0/0 bill c
fixed this day and we check 0/0 to mpc-epmi colstrip s/b priced with the
0 cent adder peak
off peak * ok for the hard part
our nets are ok for the balance of the problem but they aren't priced correctly
we have a 0 peak plus a 0 peaker
0-0
totaling 0 mwh's that s/b priced @ 0.0 then we parked/lended for a total of 0 mwh that s/b priced @ 0.0
you have them dispursed between several accounts
to bpa-epmi
pge sys
= 0 mw 0/0 i believe our indices are off
i show 0.0 peak
0.0 off peak
every account you have on this day is off
or maybe i have the wrong index
hey young
perfect timing i tell you
natalie came down with the croup
hence i'm staying here to take care of her cuz dad's out of town also
real bummer because there's a lot of fun going to happen up there
have a good time
maybe we can go hiking around here
diana
either saturday will be fine
how do we feel about having approval/denial authority in e-tag for all of the el paso stuff
how does it work now
steve hall is contacting al paske regarding the transmission contract
apparently they have already been discussing this issue
stewart
i left you an envelope with information regarding the city of k
falls
not sure if you forwarded it to anyone to begin the process for credit approval
can you please respond to ray's e-mail
let me know if there is something else you need me to do
fyi
hey what's the scoop on this
i went into scheduling to view these deals and they have been zeroed out
i'm confused as to why they would appear in the view actuals in deal entry
i believe these should synchronize
or they read off of one another
not that we have much equity in our 0 anymore
but we may need to look at which fund to invest in
paul
put me down for a 0
and a 0
if there's availability
fyi
lynn
who can i talk to regarding my password to get into the tsin site
diana scholtes enron
vicky
thank you again for you assistance with this process
as you requested
this is our notification to pg&e of our purchase from the city of shasta lake of their cotp transmission capacity bi-directionally
the term of the deal will include the months of november and december 0
also as you requested
i faxed the confirmation notice between shasta and epmi to your office
i have listed my office number below if you have any further questions
thanks again
diana scholtes enron west trading
o.k
just to keep you appraised of what i'm doing
i have left a message with bob sullivan @ ciso and i spoke to wapa
i think the call to wapa was just to notify them that they won't be managing shasta's transmission position for the term of our deal
i'm going to be working with bob sullivan to create procedures for scheduling purposes
not sure if you want to stay in the loop for that
you can update gerry though
for me
i appreciate your help
thanks diana
wonder what their nomination will be for nov

hi
it has been a long time
as you know things here are very shaky
i can't believe the big e has crumbled
who would have ever guessed
everyone is completely disappointed and mostly pissed off
i'll have to give you the inside scoop sometime when we get together
and we need to
i'll be traveling around making my rounds to find out what's in the market place soon
so
hopefully i'll get a chance to see you
any chance of you and mark coming down
we have plenty of room for the two of you
you're always welcome
i love your house
thanks for sending the picture
its so exciting but its also a lot of work
i'm glad i'm done
it's nice to be in the house
but also funny all the work and effort you put in and how exciting it is all those months while you're in the process
all to be completely indifferent with it afterwards
its very strange
but what to do
natalie
i can't believe is 0
and a very terrible 0
my hands are full
i'm contemplating of putting her in ski school this winter
she quite the daring child
so i think she'll enjoy
ask mark for me if this is too young
she won't think so
its mostly my fear
=0d
you'll get a kick of the pictures i've attached
one of them is my depiction a young penny lane
hopefully you saw almost famous to understand my analogy
you'll also notice the beagle that bill bought for natalie
haha
his name is presley
she's absolutely in love with him
keep in touch
diana
i will concur with cara's response of nothing serious as to bring up in a formal setting
diana
fyi

thanks again
diana scholtes enron

deal # 0.0 in the ltca book has been changed from a fixed price of $0 to $0

i have forward this to sean crandall to help you settle
i will be out of the office for the balance of the year
thanks
diana scholtes
what we are looking at is cleaning up for december
so the schedule strips have already been created
for settlement purposes
we have to go in and clean house
so it wouldn't help to change the deal in deal entry and i'm not even sure that we can do it anyway because of deal preservation
so we are looking at a time strip for example dec 0-0 to zero out
counter party
i will be talking to john tomorrow morning to find out more about the west bankruptcy book
don't know anything about it
thanks again
diana
will
can you tell me what day was the last to be rolled in auto scheduler
i'm trying to go back into december to balance enpower for settlement purposes
thank you
diana scholtes
hello john
i appreciate the recommendation
but i am not in the position right now to make a move
if they are interested in discussing a position here in the nw
i would be more interested in that
i hope everything is going well for you
keep in touch
diana
michael
i had a family emergency that i had to attend to prior to the holidays
so i apologize
i haven't been in town
not sure what happened with our pre-arranged days to have discussions with your prospect
but hopefully we can reschedule
considering my situation now with my family
i will not be looking for a re-location anytime soon
but rather something either in portland or within the west
if exelon is willing to explore opportunities with that in mind
then please set some time aside to discuss
you can continue to reach me either at home
0-0-0
or at work

i'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in enpower for the month of january
my question is whether we
the west desk
should enter any changes in enpower due to our non-delivery and/or incremental deals
we have everything recorded on our trade sheets
but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the estate by us making the changes in deal scheduling
we can do so
i also understand
after talking to john
you will be using our trade sheets for such changes for the month of december
i'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets
but if you can call me
we can set up a conference call and i'll coordinate from each desk to attend
if there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know
diana scholtes west desk
0/0 we are in trouble
you have some price points that don't make sense

hey
i hope things are still going well
i've been thrown right into the mix right away and have barely had a minute to breathe
i'm scheduling gas after the morning trades have been made which basically entails lining up the buyers and sellers to exchange contract numbers
however
it's a great place to learn operational logistics
the intent is that i'll be productive in the role immediately while learning the ropes
as they hire the needed full-time schedulers and i get up to speed
i'll move into market research for the traders
my first such assignment is to value storage in different markets based on historical gas pricing and injection-withdrawel strategies
let's just say my plate looks to be full
by the way
i'm sure you saw the previous email from our buddy
ted bland
looks like he got the message
although i'm still feeling like there's still some orientation regarding the a/a program itself that we're missing
for instance
did you see that there's a whole page in the intranet dedicated to the program
it mentions month guest speakers and lunches
i also saw mention of a mentoring program
of course
the a/a happy hours important as well
i'd like to know more
anyway
the real reason i wanted to drop the line is to find out if you're spending all your time in georgia
or if you want to grab lunch sometime this week or hear of any after work activities that would help in meeting other people at enron
you can reach me at 0-0
later
mat
lunch on friday sounds great

mat
marlo
as discussed
i am forwarding to you two spreadsheets with the requested information
each spreadsheets are identified by month
within each spreadsheet are a number of tabs
based on the customers you mentioned on the phone
i believe you need only to use the
occmarkets
tab
customers are along the horizontal with dates on the vertical
for each customer
several columns are used to identify the gas supplied to the customer from each location
please call if you have any further questions
mat
i didn't forget
i'm just new to lotus

his name is ted spackey with oh
by the way
i ended up going to the volcano last night til 0:0 and had a great time
those frozen screwdrivers will fuck you up
i get half way in the door and one of the traders in my group comes running up to say
i hung out with her and this other guy who's one of our brokers
random
the broker was great to talk to because he had great things to say about enron
and he wasn't kissing ass for the business because his last day is today and he's moving back east
anyway
i'm exhausted
no partying for me tonight

it's totally my fault
anyway
i do want to catch up with you sometime
also
i will be back in ny in two weeks
but only for one day
so

i'm getting in early in the morning
so maybe we could go out to lunch or something
i'll give you a call sometime this week

here's some digits for you
you can pretty much get a hold of me anytime
i usually work till around 0 pm
anyway
i speak to you soon
el presidente
ok
thursday definitely no
friday maybe
also dave shank is in town to work with marine this week
you remember dave don't you
what are we going to do
brief
i can only say that will probably hit the city sometime during the upcoming holidays
i will promise to give you some warning so that we can get together
and maybe i'll even stay more than a day this time
anyway
i hope your thanksgiving was nice
although it sounds like your work responsibilities are indifferent to holidays
i had a nice time at home and i saw rent while i was in the city sunday
i give you a call soon
mat
make sure you take care of dave
awesome dude
i'll definitely be around
hey
maybe you can bring my wine
or the empty bottles which is probably more likely
mat
mi casa es su casa
i've got plenty of room

have we made any progress on finding out why the northwest website is not accessible before 0 am
for your reference the error message is below
the address is error 0--internal server error from rfc 0 hypertext transfer protocol
http/0.0
0.0.0 0 internal server error the server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request
thanks
mat
everything went well
and you
we are suppose to hear today
i don't know what time
but i guess this means you haven't heard anything yet
let me know when you do
and i'll do the same
i'm sure we both did fine
since they didn't give us the technical tests
i need descriptions of all the people on the mailing list that i don't already know
any news yet
huh
i think they met all of the candidates and decided to scrap the whole program
either that or ted's buying time to go out and find more candidates
it's very dissappointing that we have heard absolutely nothing thus far
i'm too chickenshit to ask phillip
early today three of the six people i interviewed with were in my area talking
its sucks just knowing that they know and aren't offering any info
cool
i actually left a message with ted
but obviously i've heard nothing
thanks
mark
did we not already do this
mat
aah
thanks for the clarification
damn it
what did i say
do you read your emails or what
i want descriptions
i want chicks
i need a chick
i need a really cool chick to hang out with
my response is that you need to call me tonight because email sucks
seriously
you better fucking call me
mark's away and i'm lonely
no
hey
you still coming to h-town
hey
i
for some reason
just got your email
anyway
i'll try to call you later in the morning
but if you want to call me at work my # is 0-0-0
talk to you soon
mat
i agree
everything is just peachy up here
my scheduling group wants me to stay in this rotation for another month
and i think philip has ok'ed it
he also thinks that for my next rotation
he'll just switch me with an analyst in the risk group that works on our books
soooooooooo
i'm curious how this
track
will actually affect me
happy hour tomorrow
mat
jeanie
as you may already know
i'm scheduling on the west gas desk
socal
el paso
tw
williams
etc
do you need any more info
do you have any more info on how this program is going to be structured
if so
i'd be interested
see you around
mat
hey
are you there
agghhh
it's so nice to get email from you
i was thinking about old times
i can picture you right behind the cube wall in front of me and practically hear you yacking on the phone
or whispering to jimmy
hey
you know my email doesn't update automatically
i actually have to refresh it manually
it sucks
so
yes changes were good
although
i don't exactly know which changes you were referring to
but i'll pick which ones i would have liked you to be thinking of
anyway
i think i'm heading out to happy hour soon with jeff
so you'll have to call if you want to communicate
later
mat
hey
do you have instant messenger
you're the type of person that would utilize it to its fullest potential
anyway
i have it
and i think you should so you can send me an instant message
well
will discuss that later
call me whenever you want
mat
seeing as how its 0:0 pm central time and i didn't know you sent the email until i
manually
checked before packing up to go home
i'd say not
how about that instant messenger
though
just think
you'd be able to send me a message and i instantly read it
almost better than email at malcolm pirnie

the ones to hobby are american

on american
the one's i sent are the about the only ones
continental has many available flights for about $0 more
mat
sure
unless i'm on a flight
just so you know
i should be home around six or so
definitely going to bed early
though
and the street is on from 0-0
so
any more info regarding the chicks
or i mean ski trip
as in
what people think of the digs
when people are wanting to go
my update is that the best weekend for me is the first weekend in march
as lucky as i am
it's probably the worst one for everyone
hey
do you think you could send me emails of all of those going
i think we should start copying the whole group on correspondance
mat
leo
well
actually that is how i spell my name as well
but not enron
one of the drawbacks to working for a large company
your analysis of the database structure and its intent is correct
the extra table enables the use of a many-to-many relationship between regulatory items and facilities
joanne and i previously discussed the need to
keep track
of all facilities referenced in a particular order
this relationship allows users to query facility and review data related to an order
for instance
if an order required the upgrade of chlorination facilities at several plants
one could develop a query and report that produced the results of all equipment inspections for the related facilities
this would not be possible
or at least not achieved as easily
without the many to many relationship
so yes
you are giving up functionality
so i would only consider eliminating the table if it would causing undo problems with the database
as far as actually modifying the database
there would be some manual labor required for those orders with multiple facilities already assigned
i have to go
but if you or joanne need to discuss it over the phone
i'd be happy to with a little notice
mat
kristen
how often do you check your cell phone and email for messages
mat
tracy
i believe i neglected to rsvp to you regarding the associate orientation beginning february 0th
if possible i would like to attend a portion of the activities
since i have been with enron for five months
i do not think i should attend the entire program
but i believe the derivatives
modeling and risk sessions would be of value to me
please let me know if i can still attend these sessions
thank you
mathew smith
kristen
just wanted to let you know that i didn't get any emails from you last night or today
steve
hey
what's up my friend
i hear that business is well in puerto rico
although that was quite awhile ago so who knows
i'm assuming that you are
indeed
still there
i can't believe that i've just finished my fifth month with enron
it's been great
though
everything is new so i'm learning a ton
working on a trading floor is quite a different environment than pirnie
my desk is so small it reminds of puerto rico
although there are no bomb threats
the bell does not sound at lunch
and the number of holidays does not exceed the number of work days in the year
i've recently been accepted into a subprogram of the program i'm in to become a trader
so my next year is pretty much planned and eventually i'll start trading
anyway
i was just thinking the other day that i miss my trips to the island
especially my accomodations at the excelsior
and i can't help feeling a little shorted that i didn't get a follow-up event of the reggae tour or diving trip
so i was wondering if maybe i should come down some weekend and make it right
you know put all of the planets back in alignment
so i was wondering if you might be able to put me up for a weekend and maybe do some diving or something
if not
then no big deal
there's about zillion places i'd like to visit in the next few months
just drop me a note sometime and let me know what you think
please say hello to pat
joanne and juan carlos for me
by the way
it was bittersweet to hear barry left soon after i did
had he done so sooner
i would have taken his spot
anyway
wish everyone well and i'm curious to hear what's happening on the island these days
take care
mat
louis
when i started july 0st
you arranged parking for me in the regency garage until the time that a spot opened up to get on an enron contract
i am not currently
i haven't heard anything
and i know some people that have obtained enron parking
i signed my name to a list that you circulated at orientation
is there something further that i need to do
mathew smith
hey
i just wanted to let you know that it's 0 pm wednesday and i still have not received any emails from you regarding the ski trip
steve
i'm real flexible on timing
but this whole
you may not be there thing
definitely restricts the possibilities
what are the chances of a follow-on tour
won't the contract be renewed
if your tour was indeed over
would how long would you be there both with and without a contract extension
which weekend do you intend to be around and wish to have company
the later the better for me
but seriously
i could probably get on plane next weekend if that was the only opportunity
i'll give a call sometime
but i don't think i have the number anywhere
can you send it to me
fyi
my numbers later dude
that is good to hear
give me a call today as you indicated
mat
fyi how are you feeling today
i couldn't get to sleep until 0 pm
but i actually feel pretty good
i'm excited because steve h
replied and said icould definitely come down
although
he said are contract is over at the eof jan and his tour might be over
still waiting to hear whether a non-renewal is a realistic possibility or whether its like every other yeari thought you mentioned that we got all that 0 mil or whatever of work downthere
interesting
anyway
i finally got signed up for the continentaltravel specials
i assume you get them but just incase you wanted to go tolouisville
ky or something
i thought i'd send it along
i'd take advantage
but i'm have to work a few hours this weekend and i think its alittle late to switch with somebody
well
i should get back to work although it looks like now is just a sit around and bullshit about california gas period in the day
later
continental airlines on 0/0/0
well if you're still there
i hope the studying is going well
malo means bad
i feel bad because today was a big cluster fuck on the socal system
the reason i feel bad is jan was out today
she usually does socal
and either ted or i was going to fill in for her
neither of us wanted to do it
and ted got stuck with it
well
i would have done it
but i was out until 0 am last night and i didn't want to fuck up because of it
socal can be high stress because there are huge time constraints and its the most expensive gas in the country
anyway
a bunch of shit got fucked up
it's not ted's fault
but he really had a rough day because of it
i think i might have been able to do a better job
but i knew there was chance for error because neither of us have done it in a while
i feel bad
regardless
i'm pretty whipped and am looking forward to going home
of course
i have a whole weekend of work to look forward to
anwyay
it looks like i'm about done here
so i have one last word for
matt
i'm sorry i have'nt done any testing
i'm working this weekend so i'll give it a go
thanks
mat
that
s funny
i must have missed your call the other day
mark must not have given me the message or the answering machine is broke
regardless
i'll be available all weekend with my phone with at all times
you could also try my work number as i'm working this weekend
mat
basically
you don't want to talk to me anymore
i just want to be loved
just kidding
i can't really respond right now
so i'll give you a call later
i don't think i'm going to come now
so the time constraint is off
mat
brief
you name the time and the place between 0:0 pm friday january 0th through 0 pm monday january 0th
pres
oh my god
this is way too fucking weird
i sent you the message below earlier today and had two emails waiting for me this afternoon
one indicating that i sent it to the wrong address and your email
i can't believe it
the worst part about it is that
yes
i am planning a trip to nyc
and i'm going to be there this weekend
which was the point of my email this morning
holy shit
that sucks
i can't believe you're not going to be there
when are you leaving/coming back
i try to call you
but i don't know if i still have you're numbers
i've been useless since my palm pilot crashed
anyway
again
this is freaky
pres the original message was received at mon
0 jan 0 0:0:0 gmt from
0.0.0.0
the following addresses had permanent fatal errors

i will be attending the reception on thursday for the a/a program
thanks
mathew smith
good morning
sorry i didn't call last night
i went out and it was late when i got home
and not knowing how late you were going to be out
i decided not to take the chance of waking you
so did you have a good time
who did you go with
i didn't think you were going out until the weekend
you little party animal
that means you must have missed buffy and angel
oh i bet you taped it though
and no i didn't watch them incase you were wondering
remind me to tell you about a new project i may get involved in
if i kick ass
there's a small chance it could be a fast track to getting a trading book
oh
and have you talked to dave lately
he said his dinner went well
and although they didn't offer as much money as he was hoping
i think it was a lot and i bet the farm that he'll take it
anyway
i have to run
have a nice day
mat
hey
are you at work today
did you have fun last night
are you busy
i want my bed
too
ideally
i'm going to take a nap when i get home so i can go out later
if i can't nap then i'm not going out because i definitely want to go out tomorrow
not too hard though because i'm saving some steam for nyc baby
the aga storage injection number came out low
so i think we're losing a bunch of money today
oh well
it's the new year
don't you want to hear about my new project
though
i can tell because you're so inquisitive
i guess i'll just wait for the weekend
later
well it's good to hear from you
i'm glad the skiing was good
i'm jealous
although i'm going to ny this weekend
and i'm trying to set up a day of skiing
i haven't reserved the place yet
but as of yesterday it was still available
i was suprised to get mail from duncan yesterday
then i realized it was a check
cool
so
when do you think the rest will be on the way
once i know
i'll go ahead and get the place
give me a call
though
i'll try you today if i don't hear from you first
i'm leaving for ny tomorrow morning
but i'll have my phone all weekend
stay cool
mateo
who are you
so tired i am
well
it wasn't that bad
i was delayed a half an hour from newark and then was only about a half an hour late getting into houston
i made it to bed by 0:0 am and managed to drag myself out of bed at 0 am
i have a bunch of work to do this week which sucks
but i'm interested and excited about what i have to do
so it's good
fortunately this scheduling thing has become second nature so i don't really have to think too much this morning
how are you
mat
hey
we need to talk
so far i've gotten duncan's check and that's it
i have not gotten the place yet
since i was waiting for you to tell me that they are on their way
since i have not heard from you
i'm assuming they are not
so what's up
i still need everyone's email because i don't not have those original messages with everyones address on them
i think it would be great if everyone who's commited could send me an email just saying when they plan on paying
i guess it's really only your friend and duncan's friend
so i guess it's not really a big deal
i don't know
i guess i just don't have a warm fuzzy feeling because you're the only person i speak to and i often times have trouble getting in touch with you
which by the way
you never did reply to my email asking how often you read you email so i know whether i should use it to get in touch with you
anyway
i just got back from nyc
had a great time
except for the fact that scully feels the need to build a wall between us
i can deal
but its just kind of annoying
i just feel the need to put this skiing thing to bed quickly
mat
oh yes
i had a good time
although very exhausted from getting in late
did you have a good weekend
hand out with marky much
i noticed some of my wine stash was depleted
did you have anything to do with that
mat
ina
i need to be able to pull price curves from the oracle database
can you please see to it that i get the proper access tomorrow
this is required for a special project for phillip
so it is high priority
let me know if you need any further clarification of what i need
but i think it should know
thank you
mat
hey
just wanted to let you know i made $0,0 today
for me that is
just wanted to tell someone
it's for doing the trading track
mat
tonight my ass
call me now
0-0-0
so not even remotely funny
thanks for reminding me
i was in the process of emailing you
but i got distracted
anyway
it was working for ken because he had someone's password coded into the file
one of the it guys found it and coded it into my file
so that i really don't need access anymore
apparently i have all the necessary software as well
thanks
mat
phillip
i'm building a sheet for each person specifically for financial hedging
each day it will pull in the previous days position and previous day price curve to calculate the mark to market
then that day's transactions can be entered to calculate the p
l of transactions which close out previous positions
as well as to calculate the new open positions
initially
i thought that daily p&l could be calculated by simply adjusting the p&l whenever a transaction was made by the difference between the bid/offer of the closed out position by the offer/bid of the new position
of course time value and storage costs would be included
however
this only works if the person is 0% hedged
meaning they do not have any open positions which require marking
as the seller of synthetic storage utilizing 0% hedging
i should be able to do this
except for the fact that i will have size limits on transactions that will probably leave me open here and there
the main question i have is simply
should i be calculating the p&l for each person's storage book for open and closed positions
then beyond that
if we do calculate the p&l's from the buyer side
it seems that if their storage is not hedged
i will have to develop the market value of the storage in the ground and the remaining capacity to mark to market it
so
i guess i could apply the model for that purpose
does this make sense to you
any comments are appreciated
thanks
mat
i was waiting by the phone all day and night for you to call
but no
i was ever dissappointed that i was not a high priority for you
i suppose i'll just keep waiting
mat
tom
thanks for the new version
i finally got the other version to work
but only by running it on ken's computer
i have some questions regarding the summary sheet
and i plan on spending a significant amount of time with the model this weekend
so yes
let's meet tomorrow if possible
i'm free anytime except between 0:0 am and noon
just name the time and place
i also need to get familiar with the model used in chicago for the real time decision making
speak to you soon
mat
tom
here are the two curve files for this year that i have downloaded
thanks for your help
mat
kristen
i thought mark had called you
but i guess not
he said that he can't have wendy and amy change their plans
so he can't go on the ski trip
it was pathetic
i heard
so
are you guys still planning on coming that weekend
well good
he proceeded to talk for at least two hours on the phone
and just mentioned the outcome yesterday
i pushed him to give me details
but all he said was the cost was a major factor and that wendy had time off
i think he was bullshiting and that he never really asked them
i'm such a skeptic
anyway
fuck'm
any ideas
mat
sorry
i'm busy
work
brad
what's up cuz
are the lights on in san francisco
i think it's only a matter of time before the national guard comes in to prevent rioting in the streets
anyway
i was just wondering what plans you have in the next month or so because i want to go someplace and do something
but i'm just not sure what yet
i have a bunch of vacation i need to take and i'd rather not sit around here and twidle my thumbs
let me know if you have any suggestions
mat
yo
sorry i haven't gotten back to you right away
i am still trying to figure when and where i'm taking vacation
puerto rico is right up there
buddy
so what's the latest on the whole contract extension
i checked some airfares a couple of weeks ago and
wow
it was a bit high
which is why i didn't jump right on this
i'll do some checking tonight
and i'll let you know what i come up with
ideally
mid to end of february is best
but of course
that all depends on if you're still going to be there
anyway
i just wanted to let you know
i'm still considering
mat
we need to work out a system here kristen
why is it you are so freakin hard to get in touch with
i asked you how often you check email
but you've never told me
once a day
week
what
and this cell phone thing
do you have it with you all the time
is it on
if not
how often do you check voicemail
how long after i leave a message should i expect to here from you
i'm generally impatient
which is why it kills me to wait to hear from you
especially when i have not idea of what time frame to expect
anyway
i really need to make plans
otherwise i'm going to go to utah with dave
or san fran
or puerto rico
mat
hey
i don't know if you've been reading any of those emails today
but please tell me we
as in me and you
can do something other than hand out with those fucking losers
you know mark's all over this fucking thing
trading was boring today
well
boring because i'm not participating yet
soon though
the superbowl isn't until 0 pm i think
so yes
i say we go someplace or your place
i'll just tell everyone i have to work
which i do anyway
it'll be my second to last weekend stint
i'm jealous about you being in ny
have a drinky for me
i'm going to look for some pussy on saturday
big
frat
style party at some chics place
too bad you're away
i'm sure we could do well
anyway
have fun in ny
mateo
sara
yo
what's up
how are things across the street
let me guess
you got all rested up saturday and sunday
then when out three nights already this week
and now are ready to go home
do laundry and sleep
unfortunately
i've been extremely lame
mostly because you got me sick
well maybe not
anyway
i haven't been feeling so hot
yet i did oversleep by two hours this morning which really helped
poor ted had to pick the slack
so
any big plans for the weekend besides laundry
superbowl
happy hour
toilet flushing into the phone
stupid drunk
mat
andrea
i'm rotating as part of the trading track sometime before march 0st to the gas fundamentals group
i'll get you the required information next week
thanks
mat
hmmm
i don't if i could pass up an opportunity to dive the caymen islands
timing wise the end of february still works best
but if you're still working then it wouldn't be nearly as cool as if it were march and you weren't working
so i'm willing to hold out until you know your fate
definitely keep me informed
though
i'll just plan a ski trip in the mean time to hold me over
say hi to the crew for me
and of course
jewels
mat
try to call me at work today and i'll give you the latest fare availability
talk to you later
mateo
as a matter of fact
mark your damn calender
march 0-0
i'm in town and will hopefully be attending the big championship game sat
night
otherwise just partying
again
you name the time and place
and whoever else might be interested in
getting it done
how's the residency going
enron kicks ass
but i feel like it's going to take me forever to get where i need to be
and you won't believe where that is
but more on that later
go syracuse
tom
i believe that your right up correctly interprets the current model
but as we discussed
i think the more correct methodology is to use the next day's cash price since the gas daily print is for gas traded the previous day and delivered the same day as the print
if i'm trading day gas on april 0th
the prices i'm basing my decisions on are those represented in the gas daily print for april 0th
if we do not change the model
i think we need another sentence to clarify that the cash prices a day behind
of course
eventually we need to fix the model
mat
i'm going to be working late
and i have some errands i need to run
so i don't really have plans
except that dinner will probably be around 0 pm or so
mat
i have consulted my partner
and it would be great if we could be added to the reservation list
please pass this on to whoever
based on my review conducted the morning of february 0th
here is a list of items that need to be addressed in the next version of the west desk's flow summary sheet
pgt
these numbers appear to be one day off
the numbers in the test sheet for february 0th are identical to those used by the west desk yesterday for february 0th
i verified that they are the cycle 0 numbers posted on pgt's website for the 0th
generally
we use the cycle 0 numbers
however
sometimes only cycle one is available for our morning meeting
northwest
none of these numbers match our flow sheet
it appears the test sheet pulls cycle 0 nominations
whereas we use cycle 0
however
the website we use to pull the flows is generally not available to use until as late as 0 am
we are not sure why
i understand you may pull the numbers from a different place
so we should find out whether you can get the numbers earlier
tw
tw numbers appear to be correct
except for the ib link number
we pull the ib link number from the el paso blanco i/c point reported by tw
it looks like your sheet pulls the number from the el paso inwplbla point
they differ by about 0,0
but i don't know if one is more correct than the other
to be consistent
though
we should probably change the test sheet
pge
the numbers also appear to be one day off
the numbers for february 0th are identical to our feb
0th numbers
is this a reporting or a scrubbing problem
it is possible you are pulling the data from the website before they update it with the next day's data
we manually type these numbers in
if you pull from our spreadsheet
then the latest numbers would not be in when this report is run
el paso
most of the numbers appear to be correct
except for the plant receipts
the numbers are close
but we should compare our formulas because i don't think this is a cycle problem
general
the
difference
column of the test sheet compares the latest cycle for the current with the final cycle of the previous day
this can cause intraday fluxuations in scheduled quantities to appear as day to day fluxuations
any
difference
column should compare identical cycles
i suggest that we add additional cycles to the test sheet for the current day and the previous day
this way we can compare identical cycles as well as pick up any intraday fluxuations
as we discussed
you'll let me know when you're ready to revise this report
these notes should give us a great place to start
i look forward to getting this report ready to use
mat
what's up
any news on pirnie/afi contract negotiations
no skiing yet
unfortunately
my trips are in limbo
i'm pretty sure i'm going to south padre island in two weeks
but the skiing might wait until march
except that i'm going to ny for the big east championship game and my brother's coming down here for a week to hang out
oh well
i need the vacations
sorry
jeff and i went to happy hour
what is the deal with this glitter thing
hey honey
how was the men's club
i look forward to the details
i told you i'd help
just be patient
ina
i was not out today
yesterday and today i was taking a class
i'm sorry i didn't tell anyone
it was a last minute decision
mat
alexis
i think i'm going to the cookoff
so i'm will have to decline
sorry
mat
i'll have to think about it
thanks
hey jennifer
i actually have a couple friends in town this weekend as well
and we'll definitely be looking for some of houston's finest entertainment
and although the strip clubs are rated highly here
that's not what i'm referring to
i'd definitely be interested going out sat
but i don't have any suggestions as of yet
i'll see what i can come up with
mat
indian chick is a party girl
duncan and kristen are coming saturday
i don't know about the rodeo
over
fuck
i'm writing this while i'm chewing on lunch
hey
i haven't heard from you
have you bought your padre tickets
mat
i'll call you tonight
steve
yo
what's up
i'm just sitting at work getting the weather updates from the meteorologists
anyway
i was just wondering what the latest is on the the pirnie/afi saga
are you out of a job yet
i'm feeling the need to get the hell out of here and take a vacation
still thinking of your neck of the woods
got to run
mat
you can send him email on it
i want to know what its about
mat
you didn't answer my question
jennifer
as it stands right now
don't count me in for dinner
i may call you tonight or tomorrow if it works out that i can come
i think my friends would like it
but they're here seeing someone else as well
if i don't make it to dinner
we'll definitely meet you guys out afterwards
mat
word
i should be good for a place to say
but i certainly appreciate the offer
i'm definitely still coming
though
soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
tell me when you're free
and we'll hang out
you and jess up for dinner
right now
saturday night is the only night i have plans
basketball game
i'll be going out afterwards
though
just let me know
later
hey anna
sorry
i took awhile getting back to you
i took the week off
ya
we tried meeting up
but i guess you guys must have left before we got there
our dinner at sambuca's took quite awhile
i think we made it to deans around 0:0 or so
we checked there and the hub
but no luck
hope you guys had a good time
and i'm always up for another night out
mat
hey buddy
what's happening
not much up here these days
i took last week off and phillip is out this week
so i don't have much to do
i'm pretty much done scheduling and i start next week in gaskill's group
anyway
you were going to send me the names of those guys in london we talked to about the synthetic storage
and if you did
i lost them
regardless
any chance of digging them up for me
i may want to talk to them about their bid process
i think phillip is ok with going ahead with the idea
but i think i need to keep the ball rolling here with or without him
mat
oh
i had fun as well
i'm glad you guys came
unfortunately the rest of the week was not great
but jeffrey and i met some ladies friday night and at about 0 am we all decided to head to louisiana to gamble
it's a great story
i went flying on sunday too which was nice
give me a call if you want to chat sometime
mat
tom
i took a few days off and just got back
anyway
i haven't tried it without the key
but if you say it works
then i'm sure it does
one thing i'm realizing
though
is that it's taking me way too much time to babysit this thing through multiple runs of the model even when it does work
in order to get the full benefit of your model i want to run it a zillion times for many different combinations of parameters
so
if you haven't guessed already
i'm wondering how hard it would be to get this thing to zip through some preset combinations of parameters and save the results without me tending to it
i envision a spreadsheet where i list out all of the parameter values for each run
and the model picks out the parameters
runs through a year's worth of data
and saves the summary sheet
then steps to the next set of variables
in this way i could set it to run a bunch of times over night or something so it wouldn't tie up the work day
would this be just a separate macro
what do you think
mat
tom
sounds fine anytime is good
basically the parameters that need changing are those on the optimizer sheet
start/end date spreads max inj/with rates max storage volume selected curve storage facility i'm free all week
so let me know when and where if you want to get together
mat
sounds good
matt
hey
thanks for returning my call
as you're probably out from work
i'll try you again when i get in tomorrow
thursday
i basically just wanted to touch base again since ken has now moved on and left me with our synthetic storage project
i'm also looking for a legal and eol contact to help us develop a contract and run the bid process through eol
you may have provided these to ken
but i can't get in touch with him
thanks again
mat
of course i knew that
the question is
why were you calling him
ms
he's working for realastate management company
very small
but of course
paying better than pirnie
ms
i will look at it later today
well march probably isn't great for me anyway
going to nyc 0-0
and my brother's coming for a week
so
i guess just keep me posted
i took a week off and went to south padre island so it took the edge off my need to get away
but certainly did not completely satsify
still looking for more
talk to you later
mat
so where the hell was it
both
testing you bitch
mat
hey fucko
give me a call
you should come to nyc this weekend and party with your friends
yo
i'm still coming
saturday would be great
i'm in the city all day and night
and the only plans i have are to go to the game sat
i'll call you when i get a chance
my cell phone is 0-0-0
looking forward to seeing you
mat
just one thing
my first name only has one
t
in it
thanks
mat enron north america corp
once again
i was out when you sent me mail
i went to nyc for a long weekend
had a great time
but i'm still exhausted
hope you're having a great time in utah
if you get back before the weekend
drop me an email
mat
chris
i met with phillip yesterday
and he had a few more items to add to his list of objectives for me
for your information
the attached table provides the additional items
please let me know if you have any questions/comments
also
the following e-mail from mike grigsby relates to the socal sendout model objective
also for your information
i will be running randy gay's eol product
keystone cash
next week and will be covering for tori k during her maternity leave
i don't expect these activities to interfere with my fundy responsibilities
mat
i would love to
except for the fact that i have a 0:0 meeting
because of which i had to cancel my flying time
call me later
and by the way
i don't check my email that often
so you might want to try my phone or pager 0@pagenetmessage.net in the future
mat
test
thanks
chris
this spread sheet contains the new wic meters
as discussed
i also discovered that there are about 0 meters we current get manually for cig that also need to be added to the database
they are included in the attached file on separate sheets
meters already existing in the database are not included for either pipe
can you please dump these into the database and set up additional sheets in the socal manual entry spreadsheet for these meters
let me know if you have any questions
thanks
mat
amanda
can you please add this link to the fundy website under the power tab
it should be called
proposed gas generation plants
thanks
mat
chris
use this file instead
thanks
mat
dad told about you changing the ticket
but thanks
um
i look forward to hearing about this little accident
at least i hope it was little
waking up with a toilet by my head was a wonderful feeling
and
boy did i feel great the next day
get this
i get on my little rinky dink plane to philadelphia
and as i walk passed the flight attendant
i hear this voice
mat
i turn and the flight attendant is none other than
heather chapin
although she offered me all the booz i could drink
i could drink none
i would have eaten some food if offered
but judging by the double-chin she has developed
i'm guessing she ate it all
anyway
from what i remember
i had a great time
although a little dissappointed at the syracuse'esk finish of the rest of the brother jimmy's team
i'll be thinking about you guys this weekend when i'm outside drinking my green beer
about the trips
i don't know anything yet
except that jazzfest is looking bad since no one can seem to find a hotel with availability
later
mateo
ok chris
this is it
three tabs each with new meters to add to the database with unique identifiers
the third tab has four points that need ihs numbers assigned
these four should be assigned to the questar pipeline
thanks
mat
amanda
can you put this file in the appropriate directory
and create the necessary link under the
testing
tab of the fundamentals website
it should be called kern expansion economics
i don't have a description yet
and i'm still working on the other one i owe you
let me know if you have any questions
thanks
mat
orangemen suck
i hate syracuse
i'm no longer a fan
amanda
please move the file i sent you from the testing tab to the west directory under the pipeline tab
i have updated it in the testing tab so discard the version i emailed
thanks
mat
orangemen suck
i hate syracuse
i'm no longer a fan
yup
my little bro is coming to visit
we'll definitely be hitting the town
are you around
i may organize something
so i'll let you know
mat
as you requested
here are the west desk's forecasts for california reciepts minus instate production by month
they are broken down into delivery points onto socal and pge's system
please let me know if you have any questions
thanks
mat
amanda
please add add a link called
plant outages
portland
to the gas fundamentals website under the power tab
the description is as follows
query of portland's database of plant outages for yesterday and today
thanks
mat
i haven't created it yet
i was hoping to have the link there
so that i can put the file in the directory tomorrow morning
before you get in
it will be called
curtailments.xls
mat enron north america corp
thanks
enron north america corp
amanda
yes
it appears that the link you set up works properly
however
i have a slight change
please modify the title to read
wscc plant outages
portlant
also add the wscc to the description
in addition
please add an additional link under the power tab called
cal plant outages
cal iso
with a description of
daily plant outages posted on the web by the california iso
the file will be called
iso curtailments.xls
thanks
mat
mat
ya
it was finalized last thursday night
this should already be in our forecasts
mat
team
the attached spreadsheet identifies the manual entry points for each pipeline
please send me additional points for your respective pipelines and highlight in green
make particular note of any information that will be tracked on a schedule other than the standard cycle schedule of the relative pipeline
the blue highlighted meters already exist in the database
where appropriate add the ihs drn
if it does not exist
leave blank and the it group will create an id using the description provided
please let me know if you cannot get this done by the end of the day
since i'd like hyde to incorporate these first thing tomorrow
call me if you have any questions
mat
that's fine
thanks
mat
chris
here are the additional manual entry meters
those highlighted in blue should already be in the database
while green highlighting designates new records
those without web drn numbers need enron designations which i will leave up to you
let me know if you have any questions
mat
just wanted to let you know i split the west_0 report into two reports as we discussed
the other report is called west_0
also
the cig/wic report should be added to your webpage
but it's not ready yet
thanks
mat
why can't you go
or do you just not want to
and you think i'd want to go with them
actually
i thought that they had a ticket for me too
david
here's the information for the portland database
machine name
napdx-sql0 password
fundamentals the access database i created is located at
o:\\fundy_ops\west the qry_curtailments is the query i'm currently using
although it only has fields for today and yesterday
and i think i need more
the tables for the query are dbo_lkpout_plantcharacteristics and dbo_lkpout_plantoutage
in general
i think i need two tables
one needs to show each plant and the other needs to summarize the outages by region and fuel type
both in the plant table
i don't really have a query that prepares the data for the summary table
the other two queries in the access database are a start
the attached excel file has two sheets with what i would ideally like the report to look like
it might be good to group the first table by region and then fuel type as well
when you have a chance to look this stuff over
i'd be happy to discuss it further
thanks
mat
that bitch
j/k
thanks
philip
i'm sorry this took so long
i thought i sent it ealier
but apparently not
let me know if you need anything else
mat
for later
mat
angela
this file contains the historicals for socal in the specified format
can you please dump them into the database
thanks
mat
angela
here are some more historicals for socal
i didn't realize we had these additional years
they are in addition to those already loaded
thanks
mat
please make the pge daily report
#0
available on your website
thanks
mat
angela
as discussed
the following file contains hisoricals for pge
chris should have deleted data in the database from the middle of march back so you can import anytime
this data goes up to 0/0/0 and chris will reload from 0/0/0 to present
thanks
mat
use this file
not the previous one sent
thanks
mat
angela
here's the nwpl historicals
thanks
mat
here are the ones i did for you to check against your values
thanks
mat
new file
thanks
mat
david
this one is very similar to the one you just did
in fact
the data is almost identical
we download power plant outage data from the california iso website
manual until you guys get some free time to set up an automated scrape
anyway
the data gets into an access database of mine in a table with key fields
date and res name
the other fields include type
planned or unplanned
owner
location
plant capacity
and of course
the quantity of the outage
so
we need basically the large table as the one you did which lists each plant and the outage for
today
and let's say 0 week in the past
we cannot go in the future because the data gets posted daily for that day only
then the other table will just summarize the total
planned
and
unplanned
by region
a copy of the database is attached
let me know when you have a chance to start working on it
thanks
mat
hey
i'm going to give your resume to this girl
and i'll let you know when to follow up
mat
jeanie
i have a friend who is interested in an hr position with enron
she spoke of a rotational program for hr that i am not familiar with
do you know anything about the program
or who i might forward her resume to for an hr related position in general
she has a few years of experience with a smaller firm
and i think she's looking for a company with a more established hr department like enron
also
do you have knowledge of specific positions we are trying to fill in ena
any info would be helpful
thanks
mat
thanks
i'll get her resume to you tomorrow
she doesn't have a graduate degree
yet she probably has more experience than a typical analyst
mat
try this
thanks
mat
angela
try this one
thanks
mat
mog
here's the socal file as requested
as i indicated
this information is a competitive advantage of ours
so it should stay in the company
thanks
mat
mog
as requested
here is the socal file
please keep this within the company
as it represents a competitive advantage to enron
thanks
mat
phillip
here's a copy of the spreadsheet we gave to bill bradford
our exposure on the financial deals increased relative to the february spreadsheet from $0 mil to $0
also
we have one physical deal
next winter
which is not physical storage
that is marked at $0 mil
the spreadsheet shows five synthetic storage deals with pge energy trading that may have the wrong counterparty in our system
i'm at the office and will be here through the meeting
my cell number is 0-0-0 if you have any questions
mat
i am no longer looking for assitance in finding an apartment
but thank you for your attempts at contacting me
mat
the merged reports look great
i believe the only orientation changes are to
unmerge
the following six reports
0 keystone receipts 0 questar pipeline 0 rockies production the orientation of the individual reports should be correct
thanks
mat ps
just a reminder to add the
*
by the title of calculated points
patti
chris said you had problems gettting to the manual entry website
the link is socal manual entry is the correct pipeline to choose
a slight change from socal
also
we need to start entering the clay basin numbers under the questar manual entry pipeline
however
chris hyde is working to set up the page so that a delivery and a receipt value can be entered
mat
mike
sorry i missed you guys friday night
i made back from a golf outing around 0 pm
but you guys must have already left the front porch
anyway
i was out the other night and met some dynegy talent that were interested in an enron analyst/associate and dynegy pace program happy hour
what do you think about the prospectsof a combined happy hour
they have a group that goes out on the third thursday of every month
which would be this thursday
mat
chris
the ihs drn's are identified in red below
please make one up for the 0 novelty hill m/s point
thanks
mat ps
this just reminded me that we need to start scraping that additional pg&e point that we discussed last week
angela
it's me
your favorite coworker
attached is
yet again
an access file with a table of historicals for clay basin
questar pipeline
before they can be loaded
however
a new location needs to be added with drn
ebbclayhist please make up an ihs id and the title should read
clay basin inj and w/d historicals only
thanks
mat
new file
try this
mat
hey
i got an error back because the files were too big
i'll stick them in the dropbox in a folder called scheadul
mat
anytime you get a chance is fine
just let me know
but i'll tentatively plan on 0 pm
mat
angela
cig
#0
is almost complete
but we have a few data changes to make
first
for drn 0 big blue meter station
please replace the utilized capacity values of the records with effective date 0/0/0 to 0/0/0 with values below listed from 0/0/0 to 0/0/0 and delete records with effective date 0/0/0
also
please change all historicals from receipts to deliveries
second
for drn 0 keyes
town of
please delete both the receipt and delivery records for effective data 0/0/0 and the receipt record for effective date 0/0/0
thanks
mat
chris
please add the following locations for pipeline #0 and populate with indicated flow type
0 bullfrog meter station
bul
r 0 desert springs meter station
des
r,d 0 pueblo north meter station
pue
d 0 western sugar meter station
wes
d thanks
mat ps
we'll probably have a few more for wic in the next day or so
but let's get these in to finish out cig
chris
i assumed we were scaping the
inventory chagne
point for pge
but it doesn't look like any data is in the database
can you check on this
it's the last row of the larger tables on the webpage
the location name i believe is inventory chang
if it's not being scaped
let's get it started
mat
good point
let's assign a d to it
mat
thanks
jody
i have not confirmed that these are the correct values
but this should get you started
these are based on socal's published long-term storage tariff
i cannot confirm whether socal has capacity at these rates available to sell
keep in mind i don't think the lng project would incur the entire cost of the storage
as ena could extract additional value from optimizing its operation
it appears the cost is quite sensitive to the winter withdrawal rights
which i do not see any way around unless we can unload more of the cargo directly into the system and bypass the storage facility during the winter
please do not hesitate to call with any questions
mat
as discussed
it is acceptable to rerun the cube at 0:0 am
after the the refresh
the following west reports should be generated
#0 cig_wic
daily
#0 rockies production
daily
and #0 socal
daily
historical
merge
also
please generate the west flow summary report at 0:0 am
in addition
#0 west_0
daily and historical
and #0 west_0
daily and historical
which run before the 0nd cube refresh should be among the first report run after the 0st cube run because they will be the first reports accessed in the morning by patti
roughly 0:0am
let me know if you have any questions
mat
chris
i stumbled across a few problems with cig/wic
first
location 0 for pipeline has historicals loaded with flow type
d
yet new data is scraped with flow type
t
let's change all d's to t's
where dates overlap
key violations
just leave the existing ts and scrap the ds
second
please move the usage data for 0 with pipeline number 0 to the same drn with pipeline number 0 and delete the location under pipeline 0
as this is a manually entered point
let me know if you have any questions
thanks
mat
chris
i think we need a new pipeline for el paso manual entry
we need to enter linepack once a day
let's call the drn linepack and populate with flow type s
thanks
mat
chris
more changes
for drn 0
please change the utilization value in the usage table for 0/0/0 to zero
then change the drn on all of the usage data for 0 to 0 and delete location 0
in addition
please make the following utilization value changes to the usage data for drn 0
thanks again
mat
chris
remember way back when
we threw out a bunch of pge
#0
data that we were going to reload from the saved html files
anyway
it looks like we're missing data from 0/0/0 through 0/0/0
as we discussed
we should have the html files so can we run those through the transform and get them into the database
let me know if there are any issues
mat
the value should be 0 for r
the value moved from drn 0 which should have been changed to zero
and 0 for d
all the values were d's consistent with the existing data for drn 0 for those days prior to moving the r values over
which should be zeros for those days
mat
i'm sorry i do not know what this is in regard to
could you have meant to send it to another mat smith
colin
great
as we discussed
we'll need the final query to list all counterparties for each product with net quantities stated for each day
dates listed as column headings
of the current month
ideally
the query will be executed daily and posted in html or xls on the gas fundy website
i understand that we do not yet have permission from eol to hit their database regularly and that you will have someone else from your team finish out this task
i'm available today to help any way i can
thanks
mat
keith
take a look at this
mat
thank you
dave
as discussed
i need to have daily power outages summarized by natural gas
ng
type plants and everything but ng for each wscc region for the previous year and one year into the future
the historical part of this task should be considered a higher priority
initially
i only need the results in excel format so the west desk can work it into their forcasts
we do not need any web interface at this time
maybe in the future
please let me know how long you think this would take and your availability as soon as possible
if we can't get it done relatively quickly
say by wednesday
we might have to try a different route
thanks
mat
tim
colin and i spent a few minutes on the phone with bob regarding the outage information we were trying to get
with bob's help and with the use of your stored procedure we saved a bunch of time
thanks for your help
mat
colin
per our conversation
i have outlined keith's task for the team
background
portland maintains in their database a table called
plantoutage
records in that table each contain an outage
beginoutagedate
endoutagedate
capacityout
and
outagereason
records also include a plantid
key field for plantcharacteristics table
and a plantunitid
key field for unitcharacteristics table
the plantcharacteristics table contains a
wsccregion
field and the unitcharacteristics table contains a
fuel_designation
field
portland has a stored procedure that for a specified date range can calculate for each date the sum of
capacityout
for all outage records where the date falls between the
beginoutagedate
and the
endoutagedate
i have inlcuded the results of this storaged procedure in the attached file
our task is similar but requires more detailed subgrouping of the data
objective
the objective is to return the sum of
capacityout
by each possible subgrouping for each day in a range
say 0/0/0 to 0/0/0
there are roughly five possible parameters for
fuel_designation
seven for
wsccregion
and two for
outagereason
the resulting query would return approximately 0 values for each day within the specified range
format
ultimately we will have the date in one excel sheet with dates down the left and each of the 0 sub groupings across the top
it would be most convenient if the results of the query were formatted in this way
alternatively
we can use a pivot table if the results of a list query are provided
if the second option is used
we will need to get the data in two separate lists since excel can only hand 0,0+ rows
in this case
we would use the
outagereason
grouping
which only has two parameters
to split out the two lists
thanks for your help
mat
amanda
can you please add a link to gas fundy under the testing tab called
west cash trades
the file is called westcashtrades.htm
the description is
daily cash trade volumes by counterparty for west region locations
thanks
mat
thanks
the balance of month gas daily product is called kern opal
but all basis and indexes are settled on the nwpl rocky mountains product
these should be used for the plasma screen accordingly
mat
david
you may have fixed this already
but please make sure that we filter for the
y
for
approved
in our current query that posts to the the gasfundy site
thanks
mat
keith
as requested
mat
david
i spot checked about 0-0 points and the data looks good
as i indicated before
can we run the query for 0 as well
preferably using the quick method
thanks
mat
amanda
under the power table in the plant outages folder on the fundy website
we have a link for california iso outages
please change the link to point to the file called
pge_iso_outages.htm
in the testing folder instead of the existing file
thanks
mat
keith
this file contains data for jan-0-0 through dec-0-0
mat
chris
per our conversation
the following table shows four storage inventories that we need to track/compute/report
etc
background the west desk currently displays storage balances on several of the morning reports
these balances are not reported by the respective pipelines
however
each day the injections and withdrawals are available
in the past
our excel spreadsheets have tracked the running balances by simply adding the current daily activity to the prior day's balance
as we get validation of the balances through phone calls
and/or postings
we tweak the balances to maintain an accurate representation
currently
our reporting/storage system does not allow us to make these balances available on our reports
task synthesize the currently used method of displaying storage balances for the storage facilities shown on the following table
it is our intent to have a drn established
and some already have been created
that would hold the storage balance each day
however
this requires that a calculation be executed to determine the value to be placed in the database
one possibility is to have the scraping script make the necessary calculation and store the new storage balance each time the pipeline is scraped
another possibility is to incorporate the ability to do these calculations in the report
while a third option is too keep a spreadsheet with storage balances that queries the database for the daily activity
lastly
these storage balances could be manual entry points
but would require manual calculation each day
representing a lower level of performance than the existing system for this feature
timeline this is a necessary feature before transitioning from the current spreadsheets
at a minimum
we need to have temporary system in place before the end of the week
although
we do not have a final date for transitioning
we see this as one of a few critical tasks
mat
amanda
please add a new link under the the power tab in the plant outages folder called wscc interactive
portland
the file is in the california directory within the power directory
it is called pge_portland_data.htm
thanks
mat
chris
for the following dates
we do not have cycle 0 data in the database for pg&e
pipeline #0
these should have been reloaded from the saved html files
do we have these files
and if so
can you load the appropriate dates
in order the get the cycle 0 data in for these points
for the following dates
the data we have for cycle 0 in the database does not match that in the spreadsheet that the west desk maintains
we need to verify from the saved webpages whether our data is correct
and if it isn't
get it corrected
i could check them
if you could print out the saved pages for me
for both of these
the actual date of capture will be several days later than the effective date for cycle 0
mat
as i was discussing with duncan
i'm coming home wednesday night and coming back to houston on monday late afternoon
during some portion of the holiday
i'll be up at the islands
but i'm free to hang out for a day or so
are you around thursday
where would you go rafting anyway
i'm definitely looking forward to the holiday
though
a little barbaque
a little beer
a little boating
a little fishing
a little beer
a little golfing
i guess i should have taken the whole week off
anyway
give me a call sometime
and i'll try you when i get chance
talk to you soon
mateo
jerry
i requested some questar flow historicals from you per the following email
i am still in need of the referenced data

it looks to me like the following dates are missing for cig/wic date ranges are inclusive
mat
just wanted to let you know that i'm having some flowers delivered to the house tomorrow
sat
for mother's day
they couldn't give me a time
though
i told them to leave them on the porch if noone is home
also
i just got invited to play golf at tpc
which if you don't know
is the venue for the houston shell open
a round costs at least $0
but free for me
i better get to the range tomorrow
unfortunately every muscle in my body aches from working out and today we did arms
so i'm really in trouble
oh well
talk to you soon
mat
charles
the attached table contains monthly flows to the referenced southwest gas meter points off of el paso
kern and pg&e
as i indicated earlier
swg may have deliveries off of socal which we would not be able to see
also
there may be unidentified swg meter points not included in the attached file
and we are missing some days of data so the actual numbers may be a little higher
finally
if this data is used for pricing/hedging analysis
one should be careful which prices they use for comparison
swg territory in california would be subject to california pricing
while that closer to the producing basins would be priced differently
in addition
southwest gas owns transport capacity on el paso
such that they were really only vulnerable to san juan or keystone price fluxuations
and not socal
you could only make a hedging estimate if you knew their transport capacity
which i do not
it is available on el paso's website
anyway
that's all i have
mat
one more thing
we have no way of knowing what gas was bought at index vs
daily
sick of emails yet
the last line in the table is not swg
please ignore
tara
it appears that from december 0 back
although i haven't checked everything
kern historicals were loaded improperly
wrong column from the website
so
another major action item will be to reload those actuals
mat
hey
haven't read this yet
will try today
juan carlos
the line you deleted simply saves the current record
deleting it will not cause any problems in a read-only database
in the regular working version
deleting may result in edits to a record not being saved
mat ps
i hope things are well on the island
please pass along my regards to everyone
chris
i recently found out that questar posts a clay basin storage inventory in html on their website
the link is we will need to start scraping this balance
specifically the
total clay basin annual working gas
and
total clay basin reservoir inventory
this does not impact the storage inventory issue that we've previously discussed
since this balance is currently a manual entry point
and will continue to be even after we start scraping these points
please give me a realistic estimate of when we can begin scraping this data
we will need to create drn's for both of these points
clearly
in terms of priorities
working out the bigger storage inventory balance issue is much higher priority
please let me know if you have any questions
mat

can you please give me an estimate of when you can provide the requested historical flows we discussed yesterday
i'm trying to manage a number of tasks that depend on this data
and it would be helpful to know when it might be available
thank you
mathew smith enron
no thanks
this one is fixed
i'll be home wednesday night and i fly out monday afternoon
but i don't really know which days i'll be up at the 0 islands
depending on when i go up to the 0 islands
i'll probably come back from the 0 islands on sunday in time for a little boating and binge drinking
would it be a good idea to plan a barbaque or something for sunday
monday doesn't work for me because i'm flying back
jeff will be around in case you didn't know
anyway
i'll be in touch
mateo
hey
by the way
do use instant messenger
i think you should
it would be a great
since i would know when you're on the computer
my id is mathewsmith0
chris
i'm not familiar with the details of the reporting requirements for pipelines under the current regs
can i get an interpretation of questar's reponse to my request for historicals
thanks
mat
per our conversation yesterday
i'd like to test the send key process for obtaining the socal hourly storage postings
once i get the scheduling system opened and set
the following is the keystrokes required
enter enter enter of course
a slight pause between the keystokes might be needed
and if we need to maintain activity to keep the system from kicking us out
we can simply use two enter keystrokes
please let me know when you'll be able to give this a shot
thanks
mat
um
i don't really know
i did a search for
vb0
and did find one file
when you get a chance
can you make the long journey across the isle to take a look
thanks
mat
thanks chris
according to patti
williams was doing maintenance to its site and did not come back up
when
the site becomes available lets plan on rerunning the capture to get the last cycles for the missed days
mat
amanda
please move the link for the west ops reports from testing to pipeline\west and also add an additional link under desk\west
the location of the actual files should remain unchanged
thanks
mat
steve
exchange wouldn't send the email because the file was too big
i put it in the dropbox
though
the file is called west region map.ppt
please let me know if you need anything else
mat
karen
my current rotation information is as follows
current rotation

chris gaskill thanks
mat
chris
the attached file contains kern data for 0th cycle 0th through the 0st and cycle 0 for the 0st
thanks
mat
try this
becky
i was just wondering whether questar ever got back to you regarding the historicals we requested from them
as i understand
lori creer was going to check with her supervisors/management and get back with you
i'll be out of the office thursday and friday
in my absence
tara piazze mat
exactly
her extension is 0-0
thanks
mat
karen
i was out last week
do you still need any help
mat
sure thing
angela
please delete all data for pgt
pipeline 0
with effective date less than 0/0/0
and then load the attached file with historicals with effective dates from 0 through november 0
0
please let me know if you have any problems
thanks
mat
i need to have an outlook public calendar folder created to track maintenance shedules on west region pipelines for the west gas trading desk
patti sullivan
psulliv
and i
msmith0
would need administrative rights
can you please direct me to the appropriate people to have this set up
i can be reached at 0-0
thanks
matt smith
angela
here's another file i need loaded asap
please let me know if there are any problems
thanks
mat
becky
have you heard anything yet from questar
now we also need data for may 0 through june 0st because their site did not report all week
should i give lori a call again
mat
thanks
phil
how's this for starters
the san juan plant receipts and rockies production information should be accurate
the third tab
keystone receipts
is definitely not comprehensive
that information is for el paso natural gas only
and only the first section of the table has the receipt points values
unfortunately
a lot of production in keystone moves onto intrastate pipelines that we do not have data for
i'll see if i can get together at least some tw and northern numbers for the perm and that might be as good as we can get
mat
eddie
we'll need a new pipeline for northwest manual entry
the point should have drn jpinv
but no corresponding ihs drn
please populate the database with a value of 0,0,0 with flow type s for 0/0/0
we will manually enter this point until we can automate it
mat
karen
here you go
0
scheduling
west gas 0
phillip allen
managing director mat
chris
please add the following new point to the database for pgt
#0
and make sure we begin to scape it along with the others
name
klamath cogeneration
pacificorp this is a scraped point currently being posted
this drn is the same as the ihs drn for this point
thanks
mat
becky
well
today things suck
but overall everything is great
i lost about $0,0 this morning because i'm an idiot
but it's not completely my fault
anyway
you should definitely take an earlier flight so we could go to dinner or something
too bad it's not at the end of week so you could stay over
even though if you wanted to
you could
i could leave work pretty much anytime on wednesday
so just let me know
if you don't have my work number
its 0-0-0
thanks
mat
as requested
chris
can you please change the utilized capacity value for drn 0
pipeline 0
effective date 0/0/0 to 0
thanks
mat
i'm a dirty boy
a dirty
dirty boy
i'll also drop off a copy of the population weighting

ina
a month or so ago
you requested access to sitara reports for me
you said it was completed
but the icon on the sitara launch pad is still greyed out
can you please pass this on to the appropriate person
also
i still don't have access to tds which we requested before last week
thanks
mat
for your records
here are my eol sim trades for the month of september through today
i was out last week
but it appears that there was a trade around the 0th or 0th that i do not recall doing
it looks like a buy of calendar 0 of the nymex for 0 mmbtu per day
i do not see this trade in my eol transaction history
can you please look into this
thanks
mat
are you going to bring me the list of trades with the counterparty names
lindon
it looks like we need to add 0 to the list
after that i think we're done
thanks
mat
maria
try these
i'm still working on those other curves
mat
anne
hey
do you know where i might get a list of the curve codes in the oracle database for west index curves
mat
maria
hey
i installed sql server
i feel like a real professional now
although
i don't remember exactly which table i'm looking for
i found one that's mod_load that looks like it's the one
if it is
where do i find what the scenario id field means
by the way
i'm still working on those index curves
thanks
mat
anne
actually
i'm not sure whether i want gas daily index's or physical index's
gas daily preferably
a list or the file you use would be great
thanks
mat
ng prc if-elpo/sj index cig/rkymtn index nwpl_rocky_m index kern/river index pge/topock index ngi-socal index pge/cg index if-elpo/permian index maria
i don't remember exactly which locations you need the index curves for
but these should give you a start
let me know which ones
i've left out from your list
mat
maria
i think that the curve names are the same for index as for basis
which you currently pull
except that you specify the curve type as index instead of basis
i've never looked in the database
so i've never seen the fields
hope this helps
mat
maria
this is sumas
also
you are correct
that all you need to do
is add this value to the others
nymex + basis + index
let me know if you need anything else
mat
dave
hey
i checked out the test chart you did for outages
nice work
i'm already thinking of many other things we'd like to have
does this charting tool
allow us to customize the chart features to the extent excel does
can you manually set the min and max values on the axis
we like some of the charts to have the same axis settings so that the bars can be compared from one chart to the next
if so
jason can tell you how we'd like them set
let's also discuss what interactivity we can build into this page
mat
dave
since i'm thinking of it
what we'd like to strive for is
for one
to be able to double click on the bars and get a list of the the plant outages that make up the total and also to be able to select date ranges
also
it would be be great to be able to be able to select daily or monthly averages over a day range or month range
respectively
maybe have the current page be the default with control boxes to modify the criteria
mat
fyi
the portland website has a similar chart that allows you to double-click the bar and get the detail of the outages
as well as detail about the plant characteristics
so that you may be able to use some of their code
chris and eddie
i noticed that since sept
0
cycle 0 from nwpl has not been making it into the database
thus showing errors in our ops report
the latest scrape information does not current show any errors in capture
can you please look into this and get back to me
thanks
mat
copy to desktop and double-click to run
dave
hey
can you create a view for me on portland's database
the sql code is below
let me know if you need anything else
mat from dbo.mod_load inner join
come by and i'll show you where it is
mat
maria
do you know if you guys have started capturing the rt final import flows from oasis yet
mat
hey christine
everythings pretty normal around here
anyway
i just wanted to say thank you for the shirts
i think they're great
mat
ina
i still cannot access sitara reports
after you last let me know it was taken care of
i do seem to remember it being accessible
however
it definitely is not working currently
mat
hey
nice to hear from you
no
i haven't done much celebrating yet
just work work work
anyway
ya
i still want to come up sometime
it's just a little less inviting than it used to be
when is a good time now
i'm going to portland in two weeks for a couple of days
but pretty much free after that
by the way
my new address is 0 sul ross rd
houston
tx 0
anyway
let's chat sometime
talk to you soon
mat
nice
i found grandmom to be very sexy
to whom this may concern
i have spoken to a couple people in your sales department regarding the shipping of this order
delivery was withheld because i specified a residential address
in response
i would like to have the order delivered to the apartment offices at the delivery location
the address should read manor way office
but reference the specified apartment number
pete and christy should be notified via the submitted phone number of the timing of the delivery
if the offices are still considered
residential
you are authorized to bill me for the additional surcharge
which i understand to be not more than $0
please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments
0-0-0

mathew smith
more like 0 cents
canadian that is
no foreced drinking
just one ceremonial shot of tequilla
i think they're saving it up for this weekend
i think we're having a party on saturday
i don't know if we have any closet shelves that i can fit into
though
goat
i think that's only true for fraternity pledges
actually
i don't know the number yet
cell phone still the best
sorry
i haven't been available last night
i was out
anyway
what's the news
mat
rent revenge of the nerds sometime
and no
it's nothing personally related to me
anyway
this day is pretty much shot
the highlight was deciding where we were all going to sit in the new building
we move in november 0th
should be pretty cool
i just remembered
i'm supposed to go to dinner with a bunch of people from the office and one of the brokers we work with
we're going to a martini bar before hand
oooof
i'm going to have to find a second wind
must leave soon
my canadian beer of choice is labatt
jan
are you guys still planning on selling gas back
mat
you've got most of them
i guess i probably just need to define the major ones for the high level screen
what's up my brother
long time no speak
i just got your email from scotty p
somehow he found me
anyway
i'd like to give you a call sometime and catch up
so definitely send me your number
i don't know if you knew
but i moved back to houston again for a job with enron
i've been here over a year now working on the natural gas floor
life is good
but nothing real exciting to report
so
i just realized that next weekend is homecoming
any chance that anyone is going
i wasn't planning on it
but if a bunch of people were going i could still get a cheap flight into ithaca
but i'd have to buy it today
if you wouldn't mind
send me a quick email to let me know if anyone is going
well
since i hope to talk to you soon
that's it
hope all is well
mat
chris
hey
i noticed that we have two portland lines on our boxes
no one is around right now
but i'm wondering if it works
or if anyone ever uses it
i just got a box
and i have the second line programmed in
if you get a chance
why don't you see if it works on your end
mat
address
i assume this is to reserve the hotel
thanks
mat
maria
since you set my security up for the fundamentals database
i can't access any of the outage tables
can you make sure that i have access to those tables with my nt id
msmith0
previously
i would use the
gasintranet
id and
fundamentals
password
thanks
mat
nice
texas humor
aaron
the report you dropped off is a good start
i'm going to regroup some of the points
i'll drop it off when i'm finished
thanks
mat
can you email me the gzn file
my hard drive was replaced and i lost everything on my desktop
in general
we want all history available
you never know when they're going to remove it
bart
until we can get the proper access
just come over when you need the loads and i'll create a file for you
mat
thanks
hey
i think i lost your work number
can you send me it or give me a call at work
mat
hey
you better do something about the crappy weather
i mean
am i going to have to bring my ski jacket
so
i'm planning on going into the office early on friday
but i'll be done by 0 am probably
don't feel like you have to take any time off because of me
i'll find plenty to do with people from the office or by myself
like make up sleep for when i get up at 0 am to go into the office
so
i'll take care of a dinner venue and accomodations for saturday night
but other activities are in the air
if bonneville is on the way
that's cool
i suppose there's probably some cool hikes/drives around the area with great views
let me know if you have any suggestions
anyway
today was pretty hectic as well here
but now its quiet
and i'm ready to go home
and look at that
it's 0:0 already
hope you're staying warm and dry
mat
ina
ya
the departure should now be thursday oct
0th
i think the 0:0 am flight will do
everything else remains the same
thanks
mat ps
my frequent flyer # is eg0
chris
i need to reinstall sql on my machine
can you send me the link to the setup file in the it directory
i can't remember where it is
thanks
mat
thanks
aaron
this is mike's latest sheet with all transporation path combinations included
the files includes rates
receipt and delivery points
and live links to an eol listen sheet
it's basically everything you need to have an internet version developed
also
we do need an ops sheet modified
basically
we're trying to develop a net total for keystone production
more importantly
by the weekend we're going to need my keytext socal capture to work
this is absolutely critical since we have a nuke going out on saturday and a major coal plant down
let me know if you have any issues
stop by sometime about the keystone modification
mat
right now
i'm leaning towards no
but my friend kristen isn't being very cooperative about getting back to me
thanks for keeping me apprised of the situation
steve
do you have part 0 and 0 of this document
the last page we have has figure 0
but it looks like there was supposed to be further sections
mat
thanks
ina
thanks for checking into it
coincidently
i noticed that there is a line on my phone called portland #0 that noone uses
if it's listed on the phone does that mean that it's necessarily there
maybe it was used at one time or another
but just got forgotten
anyway
it's not a big deal to wait until we get into the new building
thanks
mat
bart
sorry i didn't get back to you right away
because i had my hard drive switched out last week
i have to reinstall sql server on my computer
however
because of the latest virus scare
they've taken away my administrator access to my machine
this should all be taken care of this week
please check back with me
and i should be able to provide you with the load data
mat
mo
hey
glad to know you are recovering swiftly from friday nights festivities
i think i just might have finally kicked my hangover
joe said he woke up early saturday morning to find me passed out in my clothes face down on the couch with the cat snuggling up against me
as exhausted as i was
i had to meet keith at the office sat
and then went to a party sat night where some asshole at the party backed into my car and didn't even come in and tell me
now i have to play detective to find out who did it
anyway
i had a great time hanging out friday night and i'm glad you did too
hope to see you around soon
give me a call if you're going to be around anytime
mat
business
thanks
get this
he didn't even wake up
he had no idea that you were there and couldn't figure out how murphy got out of his room
joe said he found me in the morning face down on the couch in my clothes with the cat snuggling up with me
i think you have the wrong matt
hey
i think i like to send an email to every that was at the party
you wouldn't by any chance have a list of email addresses would you
mat
no availability
your number is in my phone
can you call me
not too bad
i was late to work
though
fortunately
the day is over for me
i'm leaving for the airport shortly
and
i'm in a good mood because some the girl that him my car called and confessed
she said she thought she hit a garbage can
but when she heard from the girl having the party that someone hit my car
she realized it was her
anyway
she called her insurance and it's all good now
well
i should get going now
see you soon
mat ps
sorry if i woke you last night
socal injected 0,0 yesterday
let me know if you need anything else
hey
what up
i'm still in portland
in the office right now
had a pretty cool time this weekend
checked out hood river
a little town on the columbia river gorge and then headed up to mt
hood yesterday
i think its about 0,0 ft high
there's a really old lodge half way up
it was almost snowing
actually
up near the summit you can ski year round
but i don't think many people do
the little trip made me think about our ski plans
which we should definitely keep pursueing
i apologize i'm a little out of touch up here in portland
maybe i'll do some surfing when i get a chance
so
this chick fun
i don't really know what it is
but i feel comfortable hanging out with her
i think maybe its just that she's pretty down to earth
she ski's a lot and plays soccer every week
so i guess there some common interests there
she's totally not into fancy expensive things
which is good because she's broke
want's to go back to school so she can teach
only other comment is that she's got a little hippie in her
but i guess you can't have everything
anyway
i took some pictures
so i'll send them to you sometime
i have to run
thanks for the email
talk to you soon
mat
bart
just wanted to let you know that i just had access to the west region forecast data granted for the
gasintranet
id
when i get back to houston friday
we can set up the query for you to use
mat
if you want
you can have dave woodstrom do the query for you since he should now have access with that id
since i'm logged in to this computer i can get mail
so if the phone doesn't work
just send me a quick email
hope you're feeling better today
and that bitch doesn't give you any shit
mat
bart
yes
you should be able to pull the loads
important note
there are several
scenario
runs of the model
you should only use the
new model
scenario which
i believe
is number 0
mat
actually
i haven't eaten yet
i'll call you in a minute
i'm on a conference call right now
sorry
this is taking a while
steve
correction on that last email
wa water power
avista
did submit the 0 form and is included in the pnw total
mat
i'm on the 0 pm flight today
if you wanted to take me
i wouldn't say no
but
as always
don't feel like you have to
mat
hey thanks
i'll be there
just got back from portland last night and am going through some fpp withdraw
sheila
mat
thanks
so
i'm curious to know how the run went saturday morning
i was thinking about you guys while i was laying in my bed slightly hung over
that's a really old one
but definitely one of my favorites
let's see
i worked a little on sunday
but wasn't too motivated because of all of the turmoil at the company
weather was really nice
so mark and i went to a bar that's half outside to watch some football
only thing is
the one game we wanted to watch
wasn't on
at least there was plenty of beer
then we went home and grilled some steaks
i like steak
that's about it
how about you
did you get all of your laundry done
i didn't
mat
marlo
the name and number of the person to contact regarding the billing discrepancy for july 0 is mary reid @ 0-0-0
gasselect clearly shows only one trade for 0,0 mmbtu's from account 0 to z0
mat
karen
i would be happy to attend lunch on thursday
thanks
mat
i feel a little awful
plus i'm tired
i hope you weren't looking forward to speaking with a sober mat yesterday
i don't think i was that drunk
but who knows
plus
i must be allergic to something because i can't stop sneezing
oh
my life just sucks these days
j/k
anyway
are you looking forward to tonight
especially with a nice full moon
make sure to look out for the goblins
um
are you serious about the cat thing because now i'm a little disgusted
hey
don't forget that report
keith's bugging me
thanks
sounds like a trick question
obviously
you would take offence to me answering
no
for any reason at all
however
i generally don't truly like people who i work with for whatever reason
though
if i answer
yes
it might imply that i don't like you now because you do not work at enron
and somehow make you wish you did
so
the answer is that it would be cool if someone i liked happened to work in close proximity
as long as it isn't too close
but who i like is regardless of employment
ok
i changed my mind
the answer is yes
all i can say is that i'm not buying any
i don't recall needing any additional functionality from cqg
in fact
i don't even use cqg
could you be referring to someone else
mat
told you so
oh yes
it was a good contest
gannon is quite the quarterback
did you
i only watched the first half
though
because i was tired and went to bed
today
i'm watching our stock go to shit once again
it's only a matter of time before we shut the doors
i think the only thing that will keep us from going under is that the industry would get hurt too much
maybe the government will bail us out
anwyay
how's everything with you
keith
hey
is the plotter working
such that i could get a print out of that wscc map you made for me a week or two ago
thanks
mat
you just want my address
0 sul ross
houston
tx
0
well
i only got single prints
so i have to get copies or scan them or something
so it may take a bit
sorry
about the sock
ya i'm short on socks
so it would be great if you sent it
but if not
don't worry about it
maria
hey
your database sucks
j/k
give me a ring when you get a chance
mat
well
here we are
i'm still not buying
it's a little iffy right now
i'm planning for not having one
although i'll in the one place that the company is trying to preserve
not much i guess
i'm sure you heard the cnbc speel earlier
i have no news other than that
looks like dynegy may buy us
nope
true
i think the dynegy equity investment is dead
i think the discussion are about a full take over
well
i was just in a meeting for an hour
ug
this day is taking forever
absolutely nothing going on here
stephanie
do you have any idea when this will be completed
let me know if you need any additional information
thanks
mat
apparently
stephanie is out of the office
do you know if someone else can set up the eol
mat
thanks so much
karen
let me know if you need any additional information to set up my eol id
thanks
mat
karla
i assume you are referring to my nt id
which is msmith0
let me know if you need anything else
thanks
mat
this is typical of the communication we are getting
i received this at 0:0 pm
i am trading ene like a champ
if only i had size
well
people are in better spirits now that the deal is done
too bad there's still a bunch of uncertainty as to how we'll integrate the two companies
at least i'm pretty sure that i will keep my job
so now i just need to decide whether i want to keep it
there's going to be some opportunities elsewhere as people leave enron and join other companies
how's kate doing
are they worried
there probably aren't a ton of other trading shops in portand
at least there are a bunch of other shops in houston for people who get screwed from this deal
i received my eol id
and went ahead and executed a few trades
i'm now trying to get into tds to views positions and such
but it doesn't look like it is set up
i can get into tds but there aren't any selections in the desks dropdown box
the tds login i used was msmith_pc
is this something you set up
mat
now i tried msmith0_pc and my trading track simulation book was available to select
but nothing else
mat
motorcross
white trashyness
sounds like fun
i think i'm going to go home and pass out
i'm so fucking tired
went to the dynegy bar last night and i think i had a few too many beers
only thing is my roommates gone for the weekend so i'll probably get a little lonely
oh well
i hope there's some good tv on
sure wish i had some motorcross to attend
mat
thanks kam
it appears my tds is linked to keith's book and not mine
i don't mind having access to his position
and i actually will probably want it
but the book names probably got confused since his is wt and mine is wc
mat
thanks
hey
there's a nymex sale of 0
day dec at 0.0 that shows up as a changed deal in my p&l from last night
the deal is a valid sale that i executed
but it does not appear to be valued correctly
it's valued at $0,0 when nymex was marked at 0.0 so the value should have been $0,0
i would contact ashley directly
but i don't know her last name
thanks
mat
steve
as i remember the output from your power forecasting model gets stored in the mod_load table
however
that table does not appear have results for california for the scenario id 0
new model
does the california data have a different scenario id
mat
fyi
northwest is having that airfare sale again
houston to white plains
0 bucks
hey
that airfare between boston and houston of 0 bucks is now available between rochester and houston
ina
i logged out and kobra still does not work
mat
thanks
i'm guessing most of those were hitting the aga number
ina
just wanted to let you know that noone has come by to setup my kobra
mat
shouldn't be a problem
i'll get it done
chris
the last i left it with chris and dave w
was that i was going to compile a list of exactly what data we needed and i will include all the items you indicated
i do have time this week
but not much because it's bid week
mat
ashley
there's a changed deal in my book with counterparty city of pasadena
i believe i originally input the deal to go to mike's book
which is the correct book
it appears that maybe you changed it thinking it was a mistake
mat
jose
can you please add zac mccorroll to the distribution list for the west temperature sheet
thanks
mat
i think this is all for now
of course
he should have access to all of the items within the west directories below
thanks
mat
wish we could go
but we're off to ft
lauderdale this evening
are you in town next weekend
if not
let's try for something on a weeknight
hey marc
any chance you guys might like to join us on a one week sailing vacation in the caribbean early next year
feb or march
i think this has already been sent to you
just wondering
though
why this is being lumped together in one complex transaction instead of splitting it into two
we're thinking about flying down to some nice sunny spot and renting
chartering
is the technical term
a boat for a week
we've done this quite a few times in previous years
british virgin islands

the grenadines
grenada

thanks for the joke
it's getting lots of laughs
paul
it seems to me these types of transactions
at least new ones
could be covered by an isda with some creative confirm work on our part
it's certainly not necessary for us to wait for isda to get its act together
it may be quite a wait
we can come up wit our own definitions
the financial power trades might be something of a stretch but we have never had the question fully reviewed
i guess this is another matter to keep in mind as the power pool is restructured
to the extent we have any influence over the resulting structure
it would be nice if it fit easily into a standard financial trading structure
just random thoughts

greg whalley and i will be meeting with several people at the nymex on friday morning
it's possible
although not likely
that dan rappaport will attend one of the meetings
i remember that we were very unhappy with his testimony earlier this year and i know we delivered that message to the nymex a couple of times
what i'm not sure of is whether their testimony was toned down at all in subsequent hearings
are you aware of the content of the nymex testimony at those hearings and whether or not our complaints had been taken to heart when it was prepared
i'm just wondering if there is anything we should bring up in our meetings if rappaport does attend
either positive or negative
i also heard just a few minutes ago that mark h
had cancelled our trip to dc currently scheduled for 0/0 since he will be meeting with commissioner newsome tomorrow
it might make sense to leave the december meeting on the calendar
though
seems to me the enron message may get lost in the overall background noise of a big isda meeting
maybe i can come up alone and we can do a scaled down version of the originally scheduled meeting to get some solo time in the commissioner's face
what do you think
congrats justin
good job

this may prove helpful
this message was returned to me
it looks like your name is misspelled in the performance management program
i think you can go straight to performance review
please let me know if it doesn't work
i think i'll try to run this by michelle cash real quick
i'll get right back to you
yes
it's definitely time to think about this
my suggestion would be that we try to get don to pay the expenses since the trip would be necessary regardless of who she was working for
ei or ect
of course
if he balks
we'll foot the bill
michelle is going to discuss this with sharon butcher
an outside labor lawyer we use
apparently there is some corporate policy against indemnifying employees but she understands there may be a distinction here due to the nature of argentine law in the area
we'll keep you posted
i understand that robin jordan has taken care of this in my absence
if you still need anything from me
please let me know

i seem to remember that our traders in singapore did a deal with a prc company a while back and it was our conclusion at the time that it was a very dangerous
perhaps unenforceable
thing to do
my vague memory is that only financial institutions could enter into derivatives in the prc and even then there was invariably a sovereign immunity risk
do you remember this and can you refresh my recollection
mark
the alternatives are a net worth of us$0,0,0 or that all trades be guaranteed by an entity that meets the financial requirements
heather
here is an excerpt from a message in which anita fam replies to my inquiry
only 0 types of institutions have the capacity and authority to enter into derivatives transactions in the prc
they are
a
banks
b
non-bank financial institutions
nbfi
and c
foreign invested enterprises
fie
banks and nbfis require banking licences and may only enter into derivative transactions for hedging purposes
fies comprise
i
wholly foreign owned enterprises
wfoe
and
ii
sino-foreign owned joint ventures
sfjv
and include foreign banks
foreign finance companies and bank branches
there are no specific restrictions for wfoes but sfjvs may only enter into derivative transactions for hedging purposes as well
state-owned enterprises and collectively-owned enterprises can therefore only transact through a duly authorised bank or nbfi
so it looks as if china national oil company
corp
and china state power corp
do not have the capacity nor the authority to enter into derivative transactions themselves in the prc
i have also found a copy of the results of some legal research we had done a year or two ago on these issues
if you or cynthia would like to see it i'd be happy to send a copy on
congratulations and well done to you and all the others who have worked on getting this agreement in place
i know this was a long and difficult battle
mark
i know you are getting the legal bills paid through don's budget for work done in argentina
is it possible to handle the bills for work done in brazil the same way
i have a bill from tozzini that we need to pay
since it is all in connection with south american trading it seems reasonable to treat it the same as the others but i'm not sure how you are handling these things
any thoughts
what documents do we use for these deals
is it the german translation of our industrial master

thanks justin
i was planning to come over some time shortly after the first of the year
a month or two ago mark h
mentioned that there might be an isda meeting in january that he wants me to attend so i'll probably try to schedule something around then
i believe that's around the 0th

as you know
the bankruptcy code revisions never made it through the recent congress
i understand they bogged down in the final days over issues which were essentially irrelevant to us in ect
i'm not sure you are aware of the importance to our trading business of certain of the other proposed revisions
we anticipate that the revisions will be reintroduced in the next congress and are beginning to think about ways that we can influence the outcome this time around
are you the right person in your shop for us to talk to about this
if you could let me know
i'd appreciate it
thanks
mark
darlene
i'm busy on thursday but friday looks good
mark
does this make sense to you
both of those times work for me
i have revised the relevant experience paragraph slightly
if you open the attachment using
launch
you can see the changes highlighted
kim
if this is ok with you please go ahead and use it
there is a master agreement in place between ect and koch energy trading
inc
i have never heard of koch carbon
my immediate concern is as to the enron entity
it is not clear to me why peter thinks this trade is between ect and a koch entity since he does not have authority to bind ect
i have the feeling that koch finally decided to consolidate their financial trading with us into koch energy trading
they recently did a trade with our coal desk between ect and koch carbon inc
do we have a contact in legal
or elsewhere
at koch we should call to see if they are willing to use koch energy trading
my mistake in raising the issue
peter sceats is with the broker in london who arranged the trade
paul
since the recent pet coke swap
deal 0
is really a us deal
we should probably do the documentation here
would you please send me a copy of the confirm for the coal swap you worked on for us to use as a starting point
thanks
mark
are you the right person to handle these details
if not
please try to find out who it is and then let me know so i can communicate with martin
martin
i am told by my assistant
jan dobernecker
that the human resources department here has people who will assist you on the practicalities
jan has asked them to get in touch with you directly
if you have not heard from someone by the middle of next week
please let me or jan know so we can either prod them into action or get you a contact name and number to call
we are all very much looking forward to your arrival and i'd be happy to discuss any questions
and i'm sure there must be several
that come to mind
just give me a call
mark
jan
i meant to cc you on this but forgot
here is my response to martin
twas the night before christmas as written by a lawyer
twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the annual yuletide celebration
and throughout our place of residence
kinetic activity was not in evidence among the possessors of this potential
party of the first part
including that species of domestic rodent known as mus musculus
hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the wood burning caloric apparatus
pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure regarding an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among whose folkloric appellations is the honorific title of st
nicholas
party of the second part
the prepubescent siblings
comfortably ensconced in their respective accommodations of repose
were experiencing subconscious visual hallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically through their cerebrums
my conjugal partner and i
attired in our nocturnal head coverings
were about to take slumberous advantage of the hibernal darkness when upon the avenaceous exterior portion of the grounds there ascended such a cacophony of dissonance that i felt compelled to arise with alacrity from my place of repose for the purpose of ascertaining the precise source thereof
hastening to the casement
i forthwith opened the barriers sealing this fenestration
noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without
reflected as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline precipitation
might be said to rival that of the solar meridian itself
thus permitting my incredulous optical sensory organs to behold a miniature airborne runnered conveyance drawn by eight diminutive specimens of the genus rangifer
piloted by a minuscule
aged chauffeur so ebullient and nimble that it became instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our anticipated caller
with his ungulate motive power traveling at what may possibly have been more vertiginous velocity than patriotic alar predators
he vociferated loudly
expelled breath musically through contracted labia
and addressed each of the octet by his or her respective cognomen
now dasher
now dancer
et al
guiding them to the uppermost exterior level of our abode
through which structure i could readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the 0 cloven pedal extremities
as i retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location
and was performing a 0-degree pivot
our distinguished visitant achieved
with utmost celerity and via a downward leap
entry by way of the smoke passage
he was clad entirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebony residue from oxidations of carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on the walls thereof
his resemblance to a street vendor i attributed largely to the plethora of assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in a commodious cloth receptacle
his orbs were scintillant with reflected luminosity
while his submaxillary dermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging amiability
the capillaries of his malar regions and nasal appurtenance were engorged with blood which suffused the subcutaneous layers
the former approximating the coloration of albion's floral emblem
the latter that of the prunus avium
or sweet cherry
his amusing sub
and supralabials resembled nothing so much as a common loop knot
and their ambient hirsute facial adornment appeared like small
tabular and columnar crystals of frozen water
clenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking piece whose grey fumes
forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput
were suggestive of a decorative seasonal circlet of holly
his visage was wider than it was high
and when he waxed audibly mirthful
his corpulent abdominal region undulated in the manner of impectinated fruit syrup in a hemispherical container
he was
in short
neither more nor less than an obese
jocund
multigenarian gnome
the optical perception of whom rendered me visibly frolicsome despite every effort to refrain from so being
by rapidly lowering and then elevating one eyelid and rotating his head slightly to one side
he indicated that trepidation on my part was groundless
without utterance and with dispatch
he commenced filling the aforementioned appended hosiery with various of the aforementioned articles of merchandise extracted from his aforementioned previously dorsally transported cloth receptacle
upon completion of this task
he executed an abrupt about-face
placed a single manual digit in lateral juxtaposition to his olfactory organ
inclined his cranium forward in a gesture of leave-taking
and forthwith effected his egress by renegotiating
in reverse
the smoke passage
he then propelled himself in a short vector onto his conveyance
directed a musical expulsion of air through his contracted oral sphincter to the antlered quadrupeds of burden
and proceeded to soar aloft in a movement hitherto observable chiefly among the seed-bearing portions of a common weed
but i overheard his parting exclamation
audible immediately prior to his vehiculation beyond the limits of visibility
ecstatic yuletide to the planetary constituency
and to that self same assemblage
my sincerest wishes for a salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly pleasurable period between sunset and dawn
i'll be there
enron capital
trade resources corp
looks good to me

hey marc
what time is your soiree tomorrow
it's not clear to me which form you want
we have
i
an
annex a
which we use like a general terms and conditions to attach to a one-off confirm
i.e
where there is no master agreement in place
and is sometimes called the
omnibus
because it's a single form for any type of commodity derivative which replaced a multitude of separate forms
or
ii
a
schedule
which is attached to the isda form agreement to make it our version of the isda master which can then have a collateral support annex attached
just to make it a little more complicated
we also have our own form of master agreement which we use with less sophisticated counterparties and where we need to translate the document into another language
which we don't want to do with the isda
just let me know which one you want
i'll have tana e-mail it to you
this stuff is all covered in tana's short-course on ect derivatives documentation
maybe you'd like to sit in on it when she comes over
please e-mail these forms to scott
any idea what database he's talking about
i've been through both documents and can not find my comments
i wonder if there is a later draft somewhere
i haven't received anything yet
and have a meeting i have to go to now
i'll check back in an hour or so
hey guy
ted's going swimming
can be there a little after after 0:0
i'll be at the gym until 0
any chance that would fit into your schedule
i tried
alan
are you still the code of conduct person
if not
let me know
i'll keep looking
mark
martin
thanks for your note
is there an english language version of your presentation available
mark
given the absences
conflicts and heavy work-loads
let's cancel the meeting scheduled for this morning
fyi
here it is
this probably needs to go on the utility form
assuming watershed is gone
will you have time to start on this tomorrow
fyi
there appears to be a brand new book out by david brin
one of tim's authors
called
heaven's reach
which i think is still only available in hardback
if you decide not to get it
please let me know and i may
tana forwarded the following message on to me since she will be out of the office for the next week or so
we are not familiar with any of these companies or their activities or operations
you might want to check with kate cole's office to see what she knows
susan
this is not urgent
but when you have a minute
please check and see what research we have done with local counsel in the czech republic
i'm wondering in particular if they were part of our survey regarding european derivatives law
just for your background info
the other reason we use deemed isdas on the interest rate
currency deals is that the omnibus was really drafted with commodity deals in mind
i'd have to go back and look at it to see if it would work at all for an interest rate or currency deal
do you think i should do that
hopefully not or at least not til after 0/0
enron capital
trade resources corp
should i have received a copy already
i don't remember seeing it

please print the attachments for me
thanks

a couple more to print
please
here are my drafts of letters for ect and seagull regarding the transfer of seagull's positions at e.d.&f
man
please let me know if you have any questions
here is a draft letter to the exchange requesting permission to effect the seagull transfer
let me check with mr
b
i don't think we have any specific plans
probably last minute shopping/wrapping
we're both leaving on thurs
and returning on sun
there are conflicts for the 0:0 time slot and so many year-end deals taking up everyone's time and attention that i think it makes sense to reschedule for a later date
looks like mr
b has a late swim practice tonight so we won't be at adobe
maybe next time
if i don't see you
have a very merry one and let's talk next week
mark
hey mark
i thought you had my new
as of july 0
address
sorry about that
i'm now at
0 rutland i heard about mrs
boone in the scots news
i thought it was a nice write-up
the boones were very special people and i regret extremely that i didn't get to know them better
hope you guys are doing well
i was in nyc in nov
but was so busy i didn't have time for visits or fun of any kind
hope to get back soon but there's nothing for ny on the calendar
probably dc early jan
london late jan
and buenos aires and sao paolo in feb
i saw the magazine article
with such good photos
a couple of months back
my mom actually called to tell me about it
did you guys get my christmas card
i thought celena might get a kick out of it
tell debbie
celena i said
hi
take care
mark t
here is the strike price election notice letter i drafted for the ormet transaction
please let me know if this works for you
happy 0 and welcome back
sorry to hear about your travel problems
i know how much fun a night in the airport can be
i'd be happy to talk about the us commodity laws at one of our group meetings
i'm going to be in london the last week of this month
maybe we can set something up for then
the thursday times look better for me
just out of curiosity
who is thomas geisel
i assume he is an enron person
do we already have a lawyer responsible for these issues
i seem to remember that robert and justin were handling the ipe and martin and markelliott the nordpool and elex issues
it might make sense to have one person be the go-to guy for exchange issues with another designated for each exchange
what do you think
it worries me a little to have only businesspeople involved
particularly if this is an early stage where we may haveour best hope for effective legal input
mark haedicke and i are scheduled to participate in an isda sponsored conference call which begins at 0:0 eastern time tomorrow morning
if that call runs over
we may not be able to call you promptly at 0:0 but will call as soon as we can
would you please check and see if we have any jedi swaps wtih these
jennifer
our records indicate that a draft was delivered to you earlier this week
if you do not have it
please let marie heard
x0
know and she can get you another copy
mark enron capital
trade resources corp
hope you're having a pleasant first week of 0
thought i would forward this on
i found that 0
0
0
0
0
0 and 0 hit a little too close to
carol
as tana mentioned in our meeting
the credit guys are in discussions with aspect as to who should be the counterparty to the swap
we think it should be jedi
they think it should be ect
there is a master agreement in place between jedi i and inland
which suggests that there is probably a swap in place that maybe should have been transferred and still binds jedi i
mark
peter
i understand from tana that you disagree with the advice we have received from outside counsel
stikeman
regarding the necessary procedures/formalities involved in the taking and holding of cash as collateral in canada
we are in the process of revising our canadian forms for isda master agreements and credit support annexes
would you mind checking into this issue
maybe by discussing your difference of opinion with stikeman
i think the advice came from fred erickson in their calgary office
i don't want to make our forms overly complicated or impose burdens on ourselves that aren't required by law
thanks
mark
richard
in the us we have changed our swap agreement forms to provide for arbitration in order to avoid having to explain the intricacies of derivatives trading to judges or
god forbid
juries
in canada we are continuing to submit to the jurisdiction of canadian courts
on the theory that there are no juries in civil actions and arbitration is rarely used in canadian contracts generally
as we are presently in the process of revising our uk swap agreement forms
i guess it's time to revisit the issue as it applies to uk agreements
currently we agree to uk law and the jurisdiction of uk courts
where there are no juries in civil actions
should this continue to be our policy or should we begin going for arbitration in the uk contracts also
i would ask paul and scott to let richard and me know if arbitration is widely enough used in uk agreements that we can get away with asking for it
thanks
mark
martin
my assistant
jan dobernecker
tells me that sylvia sauseda has arranged for an office for you here on the 0th floor
the room number is eb0
sylvia is in the process of arranging for a telephone and computer for your office and will talk to hr about a badge
hr should have the badge waiting for you at the desk in the lobby when you arrive
if it isn't and your hr person is not available
just call jan dobernecker at x0 and she will tell them to let you in
sylvia will also attempt to find parking for you
if you haven't heard from her by friday
i suggest you park in any of the uncovered lots near the building on monday morning
they are more reasonably priced than the garages
which sometimes charge $0 or more for a single day if you don't have a contract
we're looking forward to seeing you
have a good trip
mark
mark
this doesn't look familiar to me
is it yours
thanks very much anita
that makes good sense to me
i'll coordinate through qd
hey guys
wow
0 acres
sounds like a ranch
i'm still working at enron in houston
it's a good size energy company and the subsidiary i work for does a lot of trading of electricity and energy commodities like natural gas and oil
i'm in the legal department and work on derivatives trading contracts and issues
i just got promoted a few days ago so i guess things are going well
i had an e-mail from paul palmer a year or so ago and sent a note back but haven't heard from him since
mark kopinski
i stay in touch
he's in new york managing a couple of international mutual funds
he
debbie adopted a little girl
celena
from china and seem very happy living in a high-rise in the middle of manhattan
i get up there on business a few times a year and try to stop in to say hi
i was in monmouth for our 0 year class
reunion
last june
there were only 0 of us there and i didn't even remember the other guy
oh well
maybe the 0th will be a bigger draw
mark
scott
the response from richard is that we are happy with uk courts so long as our counterparty is in the uk
but if we have a counterparty on the continent and there is any chance that submission to the exclusive jurisdiction of uk courts might not be fully enforced in the counterparty's country
we should go to arbitration
in other words
we would prefer arbitration to ending up in court in a jurisdiction in europe
let's add this to the list of topics to discuss when i'm in london
thanks
mark
we have an opening for a paralegal in the financial trading group
in the past we have been very successful with referrals from members of the legal dept
who know of paralegals with whom they have worked in local law firms who might be willing to move
please give this a little thought and if you know of a good paralegal in town
let me or tana jones know so we can contact them
thanks for you help
mark
nobody is leaving
it's a new position
jan
can you please take care of scheduling this
i found this picture of my boat on the internet
hey amanda
yao just gave me your e-mail address
he had told me you were at uva a couple of months ago
how do you like law school so far
i have to admit i pretty much hated every minute of it
now that i think about it
i can't say that being a lawyer had been all that much fun either
oh well
the pay is pretty good
i found this picture of my boat on the internet site of the charter company that rents it out for me when i'm not sailing
which is most of the time
when are we going sailing again
got any good vacation weeks coming up
the caribbean sure sounds good right about now
you know
i must have received your message on tuesday because i remember reading it
but i can't find it in my computer
can you resend so i'll have the dates
my guess is you shouldn't arrange space for me
if i can get there for part of the time and there is a spare couch then fine
if not i'm sure i'll find a room somewhere close by
we're looking forward to stopping by but it may be a little later
not sure about the exact schedule for the eve
mind if we bring a friend or two
i doubt they'll come with us
they work til about 0 or 0 on fridays and are usually ready to collapse at that point
but you never know til you ask

one day
while walking down the street
a highly successful lawyer was tragically hit by a bus and killed
his soul arrived up in heaven
where he was met at the pearly gates by st
peter himself
welcome to heaven
said st
peter
before you get settled in
though
it seems we have a problem
you see
we've never once had a lawyer make it this far and we're not really sure what to do with you
no problem-just let me in
said the lawyer
well
i'd like to
but i have higher orders
what we're going to do is let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven
and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in
actually
i think i've made up my mind
i prefer to stay in heaven
said the lawyer
sorry
we have rules
said st
peter
and with that
he put the lawyer in an elevator and it went down-down-down to hell
the doors opened and the lawyer found himself stepping out onto the putting green on a beautiful golf course
in the distance was a country club
and standing in front of him were all of his friends and fellow lawyers with whom he had worked
they were all dressed in black tie and evening gowns and cheering for him
they ran up and kissed him on both cheeks and they talked about old times
they played an excellent round of golf
and that night went to the country club where he enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner
the lawyer even got to meet the devil
who was actually a woman and very good looking
he had a great time telling jokes and dancing
in fact
the lawyer was having such a good time
that before he knew it
it was time to leave
everybody shook his hand
thanked him for coming and waved goodbye as he got on the elevator
the elevator went up-up-up and opened back at the pearly gates
where he found st
peter waiting for him
now it's time to spend a day in heaven
he said
so the lawyer spent the next 0 hours lounging around on clouds and playing the harp and singing
he had a great time
and before he knew it
his 0 hours were up
st
peter came and got him
so
you've spent a day in hell and you've spent a day in heaven
now you must choose your eternity
he said
the lawyer paused for a second
and then replied
well
i never thought i'd say this
i mean
heaven has been really great and all
but i think i had a better time in hell
so st
peter escorted him to the elevator and again he went down-down-down
back to hell
when the doors of the elevator opened
the lawyer found himself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth
he saw his friends and fellow lawyers were dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and putting it in sacks
the devil appeared before the lawyer
she now had horns sticking out of her head
fire spit out her ears and nose and she had a very evil laugh the lawyer stammered
i don't understand
yesterday
i was here and there was a golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and danced and had a great time
now all there is a wasteland of garbage and all of my friends and fellow lawyers look overworked and miserable
the devil looked at the lawyer and smiled
yesterday we were recruiting you
today you're ours
if you didn't believe us before
i'm sure it is by now painfully clear that negotiating master swap agreements is a very lengthy process
my impression is that the commercial team in portland is anxious to begin trading financially
if this is correct
it would be possible
at least from a legal point of view
to begin trading now under the existing documents
in each case where a master agreement is already in place
trades entered into before the amendments we want will certainly be binding on both parties
our only issues with trading under these agreements are where we need more restrictive credit provisions and that resumption of trading before an amendment is signed reduces to some extent our negotiating leverage
as to the credit issue
only the credit group can decide whether or not to permit trading under the existing terms
as for the negotiating leverage
if the commercial people want to resume trading immediately
my suggestion would be to let them go ahead
if it turns out that additional leverage is needed
we can always stop trading
where no master swap agreement exists
we have documentation available to enable trading on a limited basis until the master is signed
the so-called
omnibus
confirmation will work for any normal commodity derivative transaction and can be customized to include necessary credit provisions
even where multiple trades exist with the same counterparty
tana has unsuccessfully tried to get you access to our lotus notes database so you could determine the status of any negotiation on an up-to-the-minute basis
she will be sending a monthly report of our progress until you get the necessary software to access the database
of course
if any issues come up in the meantime
please continue to feel free to call
thanks for your note
it is kind of exciting
i think this attachment is probably the treaty you want
i'm sorry it didn't
save
better but i think you can probably print it out legibly
i have a copy printed from westlaw
let me know if you want me to fax it
fyi
it's that time again
we need to prepare our group and individual goals for 0
please give these some thought and give me your suggestions for our group's goals by the end of the week
thanks
mark
to make matters even more confusing
there are two mark taylors
i believe the message you forwarded to me belongs to the mark taylor at ei
based in london
unfortunately
i can't forward your message to him directly
there seems to be a problem with the attachment
if you still have it
can you send it to him at
mark ei.london taylor
i think we're talking about a senior legal specialist position
do you have the posting that we used last year
when we hired susan flynn
i think it would have gone out in july or august
sorry for the delay
i haven't seen any of the press reports
even though i am in london and i hear that's where they were
but i thought this was a well drafted response
the only additional rumours i have heard indicate that the police may have been rough in their handling of demonstrators outside the fence at the plant construction site
i remember hearing that there were times that the construction workers feared for their lives because of the vehemence of the protesters
i guess that didn't make it into the human rights watch
ever heard of them
report
mark
i think there should be a master swap agreement in place between ect and ei
i suggest you check in lotus notes but i'm pretty sure lisa did one about a year ago
mark
jeff

are there limitations on such meetings

one of the problems with indian derivatives is that when foreign exchange is involved
reserve bank of india approval is required in advance of the transaction
a $us deal would involve foreign exchange from an indian counterparty's point of view
certain transactions have pre-approved status but an ect commodity swap is not one of them
i'm still trying to track down whether a commodity deal can be done at all
even with rbi approval
i've also asked whether
if approved commodity swaps are permitted but not by ect
it might be possible to use an indian bank or other approved dealer as an intermediary

the cftc regulates futures contracts and certain kinds of option contracts
sp
what's a futures contract
a
it is a contract for the sale of a certain kind of commodity through a regulated exchange
sp
how is the contract different than a non-futures contract
a
ahem
just for your information
we call the non-futures contracts forward or over the counter contracts
the big difference is that the forward contract does not must go to delivery while futures contracts do not
sp
i though the futures contracts went to delivery
i remember getting all messed up on the gas side with delivery of nymex futures gas at the henry hub
and what about those stories of a guys getting a load of soy beans dumped in their front yards
a
well
er
yes they do sometimes go to delivery
but they are not really supposed to relatively few of them go to delivery
they are supposed to more frequently
actually the vast majority of the time
net out as financial transactions
it's that option of settling financially that distinguishes the futures contract
sp
well lets get to the point
why are physical buy sells so bad
a
that's easy
because they look like futures contracts
they are not intended to go to delivery
and if you are trading in futures contracts you are supposed to be doing it on a cftc regulated exchange
sp
so what you are saying is that if we deliberately net out our physical deals and never intend to even try to schedule delivery under them we are trading in futures contracts and could be subject to regulation by the cftc
a
you've got it
but it's even worse than that
federal law says that a futures contract which is not traded on a regulated exchange is illegal
not only could the cftc come after you but your counterparties could use that law against you to get out of performing
so you can think of each contract like that as having written a free option
sp
well how much physicality do we have to have to make it a forward contract
a
what do you mean
sp
well
if we settled physically one day a month but financially the other 0 days
would we have a futures contract
a
oh for christ's sake i've had it
i'm telling you once and for all that physical buy sells are futures contracts and you can't do them now get the hell out of my office
is this the basic idea and if so
how much can we blend physical into it to cross the line into the domain of the forward contract
christian basically
yes
a lot has to do with the look and feel of the thing but also the parties
intentions
if we do not intend to make and take delivery
if we intend to settle financially
or even intend to just have the option to settle financially
we have a problem
the closest thing we have to an exception to this is the provision for cover damages when one party fails to deliver
that is a provision in the contract that might be argued gives one party the right to settle financially just by failing to perform
we argue that this is still a forward and not a future because the parties in good faith intend initially that delivery will be made and a default occurs when there is a failure to make or take delivery
unfortunately
in the power world a large percentage of contracts may in fact get booked out
however
each party enters into those contracts knowing that they have an obligation to make or take delivery and the book-outs may or may not happen
we do not enter into those contracts knowing that they will be booked out
the book-outs occur after the fact by mutual agreement at the time of the book-out
in fact
if we didn't want to book them out
we could stand on our legal rights and require all of our counterparties to make and take delivery
although i assume this might not go over well with many of them or with our scheduling desk if a book-out would be more convenient at the time
i am also admitted in new york which has recently instituted a cle requirement
fyi
marc
i agree completely and don't have any legal reason not to send the form of l/c we would require
unfortunately
given the nature of this transaction we can't use our standard form but will have to beef it up a bit
let me know if you're ready to send that and i'll get started on it right away
shouldn't take more than a day or so to get it ready
mark
marc
here's a draft reply to your latest e-mail
which i would send to all those copied on your note to me
what do you think
marc
we have sought
and paid for
advice from indian counsel concerning commodity derivative transactions with indian counterparites
we have had that advice updated and confirmed in connection with this proposed transaction
the result of that advice is that we will require an opinion from dpc's outside counsel that the proposed transaction is enforceable against dpc before the transaction can proceed
while i have no legal objection to sending a form of l/c that would be acceptable to us
it doesn't make much sense to go through the exercise if dpc will not be providing the necessary opinions
mark
debbie
i think we should probably do a special form for this particular transaction
i've left a voice-mail to marc to that effect
there are several issues here that don't exist in our run-of-the-mill deals that should be covered in the l/c language
mark
in light of the rising frequency of human-grizzly bear conflicts
the montana department of fish and game is advising hikers
hunters
and fishermen to take extra precautions and keep alert of bears while in the field
we advise that outdoorsmen wear noisy little bells on their clothing
so as not to startle bears that aren't expecting them
we also advise outdoorsmen to carry pepper spray with them in case of an encounter with a bear
it is also a good idea to watch out for fresh signs of bear activity
outdoorsmen should recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear dung
black bear dung is smaller and contains lots of berries and squirrel fur
grizzly bear dung has little bells in it and smells like pepper
you guys around this weekend
we have asked for a legal opinion from the counterparty's indian counsel but have not received it yet
that's the reason i'd like to do a special form of l/c
we need to add some language that indicates enforceability of the underlying agreement is not a prerequisite to a draw

interesting question
most of the guys i've interviewed have gotten dressed up even on casual days
but then we're pretty causal every day so it's hard to tell
i don't think he'd mind if you called to ask
that department is a little dressier than my area
they actually wear ties most of the time mon
thurs
but i think friday is pretty casual there
and you have a pretty good excuse
it might depend on who else
if anyone
you'll be seeing
the reason they get dressed up so much is that one of the senior guys
don't know which one
but can find out if you want

if you're also talking to him it might make sense to bring a change of clothes and use a stall after the interview

power derivatives trading in germany still long way off
dow jones news service via dowvision
rcvd
mar 0
0:0 am
by axel revheim oslo
dow jones
derivatives trading in the german electricity market won't take off until certain structural blocks in the power industry are cleared
paving the way for a spot market to develop as a first step
jonas kollberg
head of abb financial energy told dow jones this week
abb financial energy is a division of swiss-swedish engineering and construction conglomerate abb asea brown boveri ltd
a small number of large
vertically integrated german electricity companies are effectively hindering the development of free trade
presenting a stumbling block by both owning the production of electricity and controlling the means of transmission
or grids
currently
if a third-party wants to transport power
it must separately negotiate access and prices for each grid
an impractical arrangement for the spot market
kollberg said
the advantage of the nordic model is that you have great liquidity for derivatives based on a broadly acknowledged system price
you also have several producers creating a well-functioning spot market
i can't see how they're going to solve this in germany
they have too many isolated
monopolized
grid areas
kollberg said
financial power contracts like futures
forwards and other derivatives are based on an underlying reference price
often an average of spot price throughout a region or country
there won't be any power derivatives trading in germany before an acknowledged reference price is established
he said
a liberalized market in law only the practice among german utilities of pricing electricity transmission based on the distance traveled
is a powerful barrier to trading
kollberg said
in the fully liberalized norwegian power market
for example
independent producers are charged fees for access to grids based on an established point system
producers pay the same tariff
regardless of how far the electricity is transported
germany's new energy law
in effect since april 0
paves the way for all german consumers to choose who supplies them with electricity
however
without clear
published grid access tariffs or a national reference price
few customers have
in reality
been able to move away from their regional supplier
no decision has been made yet as to how germany will organize its spot market for electricity sales
the first german electricity bourse is likely to be set up in either frankfurt
dusseldorf
hamburg or leipzig
but interested parties such as the deutsche boerse in frankfurt have acknowledged that a physical spot market needs to be in place before futures trading can be introduced
nord pool
the joint swedish-norwegian power exchange
recently joined up with germany's landesbank sachsen girozentrale
the leipzig town authority and the saxony state government to establish a power exchange in leipzig
using expertise gained in the nordic market
kjetil knutsen at nord pool consulting told dow jones that the plan is to develop a spot market in germany along the lines of the nordic model
there will be one system price for the whole of germany
based on spot prices in the seven regions which are controlled by germany's
verbund
regional transmission companies
he said
one can solve the spot price problem
he said
the question isn't whether germany will have a functioning spot market
but rather when
he said
separation of producers
grids the key even if germany eventually establishes a reference price
the problem of vertical integration remains
one needs unbundling
between producers and grids
to open the way for competition
abb's kollberg said
according to abb's own analysis
between 0% and 0% of german power transmission lines are owned and controlled by the big german power producers
as long as domestic producers have such grid control
power imports and exports from germany won't be free
said kollberg
any overcapacity of french power generation could be imported to the benefit of german consumers
however
because german producers control transmission
the tendency is to shield the domestic market from competition
observers said
french electricity imports could lower prices sharply for german end-users of electricity
according to kollberg
there's an overcapacity of 0 terawatts of electricity in france
while germany too has an overcapacity of 0 tw
i discussed this matter with brent yesterday and i believe the correct title for andrea is
attorney
fyi
hey bob
her name is kartini muljadi
i haven't done a good job of staying in touch but the last numbers i have for her are
phone
0-0-0-0 fax
0-0-0-0 if those don't work
you might check with yao who has stayed in touch with one of the other lawyers in that firm
he has moved over to enron international where he is responsible for their african legal affairs
i know he is out of town
in africa
right now and unfortunately i'm not sure if his e-mail address has changed
his phone number is the same
maybe his secretary could put you in touch with him
good luck
mark
p.s
if you do get in touch with kartini
please send her my regards
i'm pretty sure she still likes me in spite of the way skadden's relationship with her ended
is this something one of your people should look at
thanks nony
looks good to me
scott
what would you think about the week of april 0 for tana's visit to london
mark
what travel dates did you have in mind
i think you said you wanted to leave ny for london on the evening of the 0th
arriving saturday morning
but when do you want to go to ny
let me know
i'll give lillie a call
fyi
could you guys please get in touch with andrea bertone in sao paolo
send her copies of our forms that might be useful in coming up with appropriate documentation for this transaction
sara
you should probably discuss with her the regulatory situation and make sure we can actually do this
brent may have some information as well
thanks
mark
that schedule sounds good to me
looks good to me
the inn at little washington sounds great but i'm afraid i won't be able to make it this time
however
as the geekiest among i consider it my duty to point out that since the millennium doesn't actually end until december 0

we do have next year
marcus
i tried unsuccessfully to reach you by telephone
the number i was give for you appears to be at some other company entirely
please feel free to call me once you get this note to discuss further
the omlx issue related to having the terminal of a non-us futures exchange in the us
there is a related but different issue you can discuss with paul simons that came up in connection with the zuma 0 trading system in london
on that system
we would have been able to trade financial contracts electronically
the problem was that our counterparties were also us entities and
in some instances
trading from the us
i believe that the advice we received from cadwalader was that if our counterparties were all outside the us we would have been able to trade on zuma 0
of course
all of this relates to derivatives trading
if the system you have in mind will be for the physical commodities
we should include jeff hodge in the discussion
i have no objection to you contacting david mitchell directly
i am copying paul on this note since it makes sense to coordinate with him since he has already dealt with similar issues
oops
mine didn't go either
i've now forwarded your message
here's yao's new address
looks good to me
there is an airport in burbank
all the major airlines go there as well as southwest
done
is this for you
mark
one issue to keep in mind regarding membership in this exchange
if there is no clearing house and the exchange is the counterparty to all transactions
who bears the liability when a third party defaults
we certainly need to know if it is the exchange membership
if not
how is the liability limited and on whose credit would we be relying if we trade
mark
justin
the mention of statoil made me think of norway
alliance doesn't sound like a norwegian entity so it's probably not an issue here
but do you think we should discourage large volume and long term multiple trades with norwegian entities given our continuing uncertainty over netting there
mark
marcus
here is the note i sent on 0/0
david mitchell is definitely the right guy
mark
i have asked russell to add you both to his distribution list
attached is a first draft of a statement of our policy concerning the termination of trading contracts on the bankruptcy of a counterparty
please give me the benefit of your comments and i will produce a further draft for mark's review

here's my list of things to do on the boat
let me know what you think weshould work on first
on deck

hey marc
i was in new orleans last week
nyc
dc the week before
now back home
ready to relax a bit
hope you guys came through the storm ok this morning
our cars are stuck in the garage because the alley is filled with downed tree branches
i'm not even sure who to call to get it cleared out
ted got a ride from a friend and i took a cab
let's get together soon
mark
no trouble in n.o
i was there for a conference with all 0 enron lawyers
paralegals from all around the world
it didn't seem prudent to go looking for trouble with all those company folks wandering around the quarter

mark
wow
that is one nasty looking storm out there
i wish i'd gotten in early enough to get a covered parking spot
oh well
may sufficient hail storm damage will get me a new car
how would you like to deal with the astros ticets
i have a couple of meetings scheduled but am pretty flexible today
maybe lunch time or when you're ready to leave for the day
just let me know
call if you want
mark
mark
i am concerned about committing to the development of legal risk books using a var-like analysis since our attempts in this direction a couple of years ago failed
bob williams and i worked on that project
many of the risks that were identifiable did not lend themselves to the numeric analysis so near to the commercial guys
hearts and the numbers we came up with were close to meaningless
if you want a technical example of a legal risk in our financial trading contracts
you could use either
i
the statute of frauds
deals of more than one year in length may be unenforceable if the confirm isn't signed
or
ii
the widespread use of multiple
omnibus
short-form contracts for trades before a master agreement is executed
resulting in many transactions where netting in bankruptcy has not been tested in court
item
i
could be fixed with legislation
as it has in new york
item
ii
could be reduced if the traders/dealmakers were willing to put pressure on their customers to sign master agreements
i like the idea of emphasizing the need for buy-in from the commercial side in the contract negotiation/formation process
that buy-in needs to be at all levels and it will only happen with the line folks if they get it from the top
mark t
i will probably go straight to the game from here so won't leave til 0:0 or 0:0
why don't you give me a call this afternoon
say around 0:0 or 0:0
we can get together
looks good to me

ca-arbinet-communications
arbinet communications introduces on-line trading of bandwidth derivatives business editors/technology writers world's leading trading network for telecommunications capacity
will inaugurate internet trading of forwards and options in telecommunications bandwidth later this month
trading in the bandwidth derivatives is being facilitated through arbinet's access-controlled website where buyers and sellers can post prices anonymously
execution occurs offline
subject to a screening process for credit
documentation and interoperability issues
the announcement was made at the tra conference
booth no

as a second phase of the project
arbinet is developing a physically settled derivative product that will allow anonymous web-based execution
culminating in delivery to arbinet switching hubs
implementation of this product is an extension of arbinet's physically settled minutes trading system
the arbinet global forward and option derivative trading in bandwidth provides distinct advantages for clients who wish to hedge their exposure to future moves in the price of capacity
furthermore
it provides a level playing field where even small operators can realize the pricing advantages which were
until recently
available only to large incumbent telecommunications carriers
buyers and sellers can manage risk allowing them to better plan for the future
sellers of the forward contract can be natural suppliers of capacity such as submarine cable operators
buyers can be natural consumers
e.g
internet service providers and competitive local exchange carriers
or speculators
arbinet aims to be the premier provider of risk-management solutions for the bandwidth market
said u
kanad chakrabarti
vice president of bandwidth trading
arbinet
as a non-proprietary player
we can offer impartial execution for our clients
which is important in a non-transparent and illiquid market like this
all bandwidth contracts will be posted on arbinet's bandwidth trading site
the forward contract allows buyers and sellers to reserve transmission capacity
the option contract allows buyers and sellers to realize the optionality value present in the bandwidth market
but currently not fully priced by telecommunications players
we provide customers with a service not offered by any other on-line trading company
said alex mashinsky
chairman and founder
arbinet
of key importance
we don't trade for ourselves
which gives us complete objectivity in trade execution
this new service is a natural outgrowth of our experience in trading telecom minutes on behalf of international and multinational telecommunications carriers

please send an e-mail to all of the lawyers and paralegals in the ect legal dept
asking them to reserve the conference dates and asking them to let you know their t-shirt sizes
once you have everyone's t-shirt sizes

buenos aires
tana will let you know which people in the london office will be coming
mark
i think you are right
this is no doubt the best we can do
let's go ahead and take care of execution
thanks very much for all your help
mark
let me add my thanks for your willingness to sign these things for us
the guys in london never think about lining up a signatory in houston ahead of time who might actually know something about what they're signing and why they're signing it
any chance you'll be in ny monday night
i'm taking a few people to dinner
you might enjoy it
mark

just a note to let you know i will have to miss our meeting on tuesday
i will not be back from new york until around noon
any chance you can think abot this a bit for our monday meeting
fyi

sorry for the delay in getting back to you
elizabeth is now working in the power trading area and sara has been out of town

yes
let's send it and get an opportunity to participate in offering the products

does the proposed reorg now contemplate that a us entity will act as principal for financial transactions
christian
i'm afraid you may have your centuries confused relative to nelson and the armada
the
spanish armada
of fame was a fleet dispatched by philip ii of spain to invade england in the late 0th century
it was during elizabeth i's reign and i have some vague recollection that mary
queen of scots had something to do with encouraging philip before she was executed
the armada was defeated in a series of battles
and by some very bad weather
around the english channel
nelson didn't sail til the 0th century
of course
the english and the spanish had been going at it off and on the entire time and you'd have to say
on
in the early 0's when nelson
broke the enemy line
at the battle of trafalgar
i believe that was during a time when the spanish were allies of napoleon
whether by choice or under duress i couldn't say
and the enemy fleet was a combined french/spanish fleet
the battle is named after cape trafalgar in southern spain
i'm pretty sure it's somewhere between cadiz and gibraltar so your gut feeling is right
i don't see it on the map either
wonder if it has a different name in spanish
will you be going to that part of spain
andalusia
the english victory has in common with the armada battle of a bit over 0 years earlier that it ended any hopes held by the enemy of imminent invasion of britain
as far as the policy question goes
you are remembering what i always referred to as the
trading policy
but is officially referred to as the
risk management policy
it most definitely covers portland trading operations
i haven't been as involved in that policy for the last couple of years as i was back when meh was chief control officer
ted murphy now has responsibility for maintaining and enforcing the policy
i don't have a current version but will ask ted for one
mark

alex mashinsky of arbinet will be speaking on
commoditising telecoms
the development of a spot market for international telecoms trading
at
i will be in new york on june 0
0
regarding louise's second paragraph
i guess i had always assumed there would be different governing law provisions at a minimum
and dispute resolution fits similarly
with parties in various jurisdictions
any thoughts
just a thought
i'm assuming it will be too difficult to build in customized credit provisions on a counterparty by counterparty basis on-line
but if there are master agreements in place
the credit provisions contained in them would apply to on-line trades
the availability of the on-line system may therefore encourage more master agreements since the credit dept
will limit a counterparty's trading volume until credit terms can be imposed
here is another services agreement
this one used as a form by ees
i have not yet had a chance to read this but thought i should pass it along asap
justin
i note that the eta has been revised to include a paragraph which provides that enron's electronic records will prevail over a signed confirmation
is that how we want this to work
in the telephone trading context we assume that the executed confirmation will control over the oral conversation
even when we have a recording of the conversation
mark
sorry
i'll be in nyc that weekend and i believe that's t's big swim meet in atlanta
but thanks for the offer
i'm not sure whether to feel sorry for you or not
can't wait to hear the details yes
it was a fun weekend
we were in austin
t
swimming at the lake and i stayed around the hotel using the gym and getting a massage
good food
too
the only downer was the drive
our meeting for this morning will have to be canceled due to scheduling conflicts
please make every effort to reserve this time slot
first and third wednesdays at 0:0
in the future for our group meetings
richard sanders has asked us to revise the arbitration language in our forms
including the omnibus annex a
please give some thought to whether there are any other revisions we should make at this time
we make every effort to minimize the frequency with which we change the annex
it has only been changed once since its inception
so it is important that we get as many necessary changes made at this time as possible
mark
i currently have a 0 modem but would like to get the fastest
within reason
modem we have available for a compaq lte 0
please let me know if this is the kind of thing i can get by friday since i leave for london friday afternoon and would like to take the computer
complete with modem
with me
if the new modem is not available in that time frame
i at least need a new pigtail for the existing card since the old one is broken
thanks and please charge 0/0
mark taylor
the current versions are all the way at the bottom
here is the current version
the numbers on the annex have been deleted
hey tim
thanks for the note
i needed a smile today
i've been extremely busy and am leaving this afternoon for another trip to our london office
were you able to make any headway with the bank regarding the ny house
i just wondered if greg had been able to help at all
mark
one more try
one more try
hi marc
i just got back from london last night
looks like our it people found out about this yesterday too
don't know if it hit us or not but they made everybody log off
back on again during the day yesterday
i'm assuming that was to install a new virus shield
didn't affect me since i wasn't here anyway
how've you been
has louise mentioned anything about this to you
what are we supposed to do with it
we're home this weekend
might go sailing
you're welcome to come if you want
but nothing big planned
i'm in nyc next wed
sun
t's in a swim meet in atlanta next weekend
nyc after that
nothing planned for the 0/0 weekend
still toying with the idea of seattle for the 0th
here's a very rough draft of a set of slides we might use
let me know if this is even close to what you have in mind
i can have one of our paralegals and our graphics dept
fill in whatever we need and make it look good tomorrow
mark
attached is the form of schedule to the 0 isda master agreement we use for purely financial transactions
swaps and options
there are a large number of choices and variables to consider in these documents and usually whenever an enron company begins financial trading in a new jurisdiction we work with local counsel to adapt the form and then handle most of the drafting and negotiating from here
to the extent you are interested in using isda master agreements
we will be happy to continue in the same way
i'm not sure they will be much help in constructing the type of physical commodity agreements i suspect you need
if you need the printed form of the isda master that the schedule relates to
let me know and i can have it faxed to you
when the transaction is physical
even if there is an embedded swap or option of some kind
we use physical commodity contracts which vary widely from commodity to commodity
i will ask elizabeth sager to send you some sample electricity forms and jeff hodge or dan hyvl to send some natural gas forms
in a trading context
since enron may be on either side of one or more transactions with the same counterparty
the forms are drafted in a bilateral fashion
basically we only ask for thing we are willing to give
if your situation is different
e.g
our transactions with one party involve only the purchase of fuel and with another party only selling electricity
dramatic changes to these forms might be in order
with regard to loan/finance transactions
i am not at all familiar with forms they use and in fact those transactions may be individualized to the extent that they don't even use forms as such
i will ask julia murray to contact you or have one of the people in her group get in touch with you to talk about those types of transactions
unfortunately
i don't know of an electronic table of contents to the forms
there is a project underway to create a forms database but it is in the very early stages of thought
i don't remember if i talked to you about this last month or not
if not
would you mind giving brent a hand with his broker agreement
i've been working the whole time
no vacation or sick time to report
here's a revised draft
alison

i are putting the final touches on our presentation
will we be able to have a projector for a computer/powerpoint presentation

we would like to use the powerpoint presentation
sorry for the last minute request

i might be able to get our graphics dept

i have my wine country book here at the office today but don't know where to send it
if you're in houston i can have a messenger bring it to you

kevin should be sending you some additional pages that are not part of the slides but that we would like to hand out
see you tomorrow
mark
sylvia
i have been unable to reach either jeff keeler or maureen mcvicker to talk about this today
i'm a little worried about who is handling the commissioner's itinerary at this point and i don't know if anyone has reserved a conference room for the 0:0 meeting
fred lagrasta is now also supposed to attend and will have a short presentation to make
i don't know if he needs any audio/visual equipment
can you check on this
maybe somebody else in jeff keeler's
steve kean's
or maybe even ken rice's office will know where this is supposed to take place
it is entirely possible that no one has reserved a room yet
if you could do that and then let the attendees know where it will be
i'd appreciate it
unfortunately
i'm on my way out to the airport now and can't take care of this myself
thanks for your help

in preparation for his meetings with commissioner newsome and congressman stenholm
mark h
has asked for information including a bullet point list of our key issues and any appropriate background material
i have prepared a draft issues list which is attached
would you please take a quick look at it and see if there is anything you think should be added and then forward it on to mark
he probably also needs the final itineraries
thanks for your help
mark t
i hope ours looks better than this
sorry about that
misdirected to you
could you please look into this
i can certainly be available for a portion of that time
can you tell me the purpose of the call
i think the answers will be the same for stockholm
i.e
as long as we are not giving advice with respect to futures contracts
valuations or trading advice
or handling customer funds there should not be any commodity exchange act issues
elizabeth sager
who is responsible for power trading documentation in north america and was in large part responsible for drafting the industrial master several years ago
is reviewing the proposed form
she will have comments for us by monday morning
houston time
you might find the attached of interest
i fear it is time to consider the s&c memorandum we discussed at our first meeting in new york
there will need to be confirmation templates for the internet-generated transactions that are slightly different from templates now used for telephone-generated transactions
legal will have to give the confirm desk the necessary language
this is not the gtc issue you and i discussed the other day
rather
i think the question is how will the internet-generated trade information reach the confirm desk and how will they know to use the internet trading language in the confirm they generate
i see what you mean
the gtc's get attached to the confirms when they are sent out so the confirm desk needs to know which ones to attach if they are different
very good question
while you don't need to worry about otc swaps
otc options might be a problem
however
if the customer is not a us entity
the advice is all given outside the us and does not relate to us futures or options
we feel reasonably comfortable that the risk is quite low that there would be a problem
looks good to me
i don't know why any of my time would be charged in this way
maybe if you can give me a little more detail i could help
ken
i have no idea how any of my time would have been charged to an africa project
of course
i have no idea how any of my time gets charged to any project so my ignorance shouldn't be used as a guide
in any event
if it is my time
it is clearly there in error
is there any detail describing what i am supposed to have done during those hours
that might help me redirect the errant time to where it belongs
there used to be another mark e
taylor at enron
he worked for ei and was based in london
any chance this is his time
mark
have a good time
no problem
i'm glad we go it straightened out
do you do any work with yao apasu in legal
yao
i go way back
fyi

thanks

we are trying to decide what to do this weekend and wondered
with fond memories of last year in mind
what you guys had planned
i would be interested in your thoughts
we think the houstonstreet disclaimer is not just overkill but entirely unnecessary
and i plan to remind all of you of this the next time you claim the enron lawyers are too conservative
i have canceled my earlier plans so i have a lot of flexibility now
if my preference enters into the equation
i would say 0 or 0 august would be perfect
i could tack a holiday on to one end or the other
but i recognize that may be too late
i don't think we should take this at face value
company the size of sunoco should be able to use an isda
looks good to me
i'm not sure if this document was one of the ones we sent to you earlier but it may be useful to have around
i'm not sure if you guys have seen this before or not
lousie seems to think that you are preparing the u.s
version of this
don't worry about the delay
if you want to wait til later next week that's fine by me

all delaware corporations are registered with the secretary of state's office in wilmington
delaware
since that office is notoriously slow
if your counterparty is trying to get information on ectric they might have better luck going through ct corporation systems
a company that is in the business of dealing with corporate information and issues which has access to the delaware state records
they have offices all over the place

my apologies for the late notice in requesting your performance review for david portz
he was incorrectly listed in the system as an employee under my supervision and i didn't see his suggested reviewer list until today
looks good to me
it turns out that quite a bit has been happening without us so we may be inundated with information over the next day or so
let me know if the message below does not come through in color since it will be difficult to decipher
louise is quite anxious to finalize the eta
pa and read-only pa and i explained that we were still waiting for the proposed changes from london
knowing louise i have a feeling we may see that stuff soon
since we seem to be a bit behind schedule
louise agreed that an all-hands legal meeting next week might be premature and she is contacting the london team to discuss scheduling
i'll let you know as soon as i have anything more to report on the calendar
mark
from the nyt article
the business that thomas d
gros is building for enron remains untested
but his entire career seems to have been aimed at the opportunity
he studied aerospace engineering
worked as an analyst for the central intelligence agency
earned an m.b.a
and set up a natural-gas trading operation
competing against enron
for british petroleum
he also did a stint on wall street with chemical bank
here are the most recent versions from clifford chance
they were sent to sullivan
cromwell yesterday to be
americanized
and are still drafts with a number of open issues yet to be resolved
so we can easily make changes as necessary to solve issues you may raise
the pa = password application
to be signed by counterparty
sent to us before a password is issued
the eta = electronic trading agreement
to be agreed to online before trading is permitted
the roeta = read only eta
to be agreed to online by persons wishing access to the site to view but not trade
probably misnamed
should be ropa or something that doesn't sound like they'll be able to trade
this is the e-mail i mentioned yesterday
it is not exactly what had been described to me and i do have concerns with it
my preference would be to limit the clause to the providing of letters of credit whenever we ask
as opposed to any security in form and from a provider satisfactory to us
i understand that london legal was doing some tinkering with the language but i haven't seen anything from them yet
let's discuss
i will be handling the derivatives side of the etol transaction this time so future communications should probably come to me directly
i will be reviewing the isda draft this weekend and it would be helpful if i could get some sort of description of the overall transaction
is there a term sheet or executive summary of the deal
if so
my fax # is

0-0
thanks for your note
yes
i am available for the call and have asked sullivan
cromwell to have someone available as well
as soon as the time is firm
i will be able to let you know who at s&c to call
unfortunately
i already have a meeting from 0 to 0 houston time
i'm free from 0:0 to 0 and then after 0
marc
i want to go but t doesn't
the photo of the cast not up to t's high standards
so i'm afraid we won't be joining you
thanks for the invite
maybe dinner or drinks after or sat
that sounds like fun
what did you do last month
any preference
this looks a lot better to me
what do you guys think
sorry
i got the address wrong yesterday
i've gone back through the isda credit support annex and the
green book
and my conclusion is that unless we modify the standard form
we have to give an independent amount back to the counterparty when we go out of the money far enough
note that the definition of exposure results in a negative number when we are out of the money reducing the credit support amount below the independent amount
the theory there is that as the market moves against us
we are cushioned by our
out-of-the-moneyness
and will be able to ask for support as the market moves back in our favor before we are actually in the money
i'm afraid that credit has been operating under the assumption that we get to keep independent amounts until the transaction terminates
we need to set up a system with credit so we all know what is meant on the credit work sheets
i.e
whether a cushion or up-front amount should be given back to the counterparty as we go out of the money or not
maybe the paralegals can suggest something
i suggest we add the following language
taken from the green book
when we are using paragraph 0 and credit tells us they don't want to have to give the cushion amount back
no matter how far we go out of the money
credit support amount
will mean the higher of
i
the amount calculated as provided in the definition of that term in paragraph 0
b
and
ii
the sum of the pledgor's independent amounts
i will modify the force energy document to include it and
unless you would like to suggest alternative language
ask tana to add it to our list of alternatives for paragraph 0

i don't have a problem with brent being our primary contact there
one day a cat dies of natural causes and goes to heaven
there he meets the lord himself
the lord says to the cat
you lived a good life and if there is anyway i can make your stay in heaven more comfortable
please let me know
the cat thinks for a moment and says
lord
all my life i have lived with a poor family and had to sleep on a hard wooden floor
the lord stops the cat and says
say no more
and a wonderful fluffy pillow appears
a few days later six mice are killed in a tragic farming accident and go to heaven
again the lord is there to greet them with the same offer
the mice answer
all of our lives we have been chased
we have had to run from cats
dogs
and even women with brooms
running
running
running
we're tired of running
do you think we could have roller skates so we don't have to run anymore
the lord says
say no more
and fits each mouse with beautiful new roller skates
about a week later the lord stops by to see the cat and finds him in a deep sleep on the pillow
the lord gently wakes the cat and asks him how was he doing
the cat replies better than i could have ever expected
and those meals on wheels you've been sending by are theeeeeeee best
here is the draft form for the us derivatives gtc
i think this is the most recent version of the eta
obviously
this is the uk version and sullivan
cromwell are turning it into a us document
the us version will be governed by ny law and contain an arbitration clause
we're also trying to figure out how much to say about the confirmation process since it may vary from product to product and will almost certainly be different from the uk version
speaking of which
i was surprised to find that they have the telephone conversation
and in this case the web site records
control over a confirmation which has been signed by both parties
what's the practice in your part of the world
one alternative is to insert the language
or something like it
that we use in financial trading which says that we will send a written confirm
gives the counterparty a short time
0 or 0 days
to respond and indicates that silence will be deemed acceptance
would that work for your deals
anyway
i'm in ny today and tomorrow
back in the office on wed
louise is insistent that the gtc's be available to be uploaded this weekend
i'll be calling in periodically tomorrow and will try to get you since i'm sure you will have issues to discuss
and now is the right time to get changes made to the eta if necessary

this afternoon at around 0:0 to answer any last minute questions you may have in preparing your online gtc's

are we inviting london
my apologies for any confusion resulting from my e-mail yesterday
while the gtc's must be finished this morning

i think it would make sense for us all to get together to discuss how these work early next week
i will ask taffy to set something up

here are my revised versions
i look forward to your comments
here are the contract forms which i delivered in hardcopy this afternoon
louise
i hope you had a pleasant weekend in n.o
if you have a few minutes to spare
i'd like to get together with you this afternoon to talk about the weather deal documentation
as i tried to draft up the standard gtc's i realized there are more variables in these transactions than are currently listed in the short
long description lists
mark
i will be there
fyi
can you handle this
fyi
here is the spreadsheet which lists all of the existing counterparties proposed to receive access to the online trading system
louise has asked us to identify for each counterparty those products from which
for legal reasons
such counterparty should be restricted
as you might expect
our goal is to have as few restrictions as possible
since it is so wide
you may find that it is easier to modify the spreadsheet
by hiding various columns
in order to print it out
if you need any help in this regard
please let me know
i understand that you may be in the houston office at some point this week
if so
i would like to get a few minutes on your schedule to talk about south american legal staffing issues
could you give me a call

digital frontiers calif
says digitally signed broker contracts are valid american banker page 0 copyright

0 american banker
inc
all rights reserved
a new california law opens the door for brokerages to conduct most
if not all
of their business in cyberspace
the legislation
which applies only to broker-dealers
validates brokerage contracts that are digitally signed
though internet brokerages routinely accept trading orders on-line
most require customers to enroll and order account transfers by sending in paper documents
the law makes such paperwork no longer necessary
digital signatures-a derivative of data encryption technology that binds customer identities to documents-are seen as a way to
legalize
on-line exchanges of information
the california legislation
which california governor gray davis signed into law last week
gives people some certainty that these contracts are enforceable
said thomas j
smedinghoff
a partner in the chicago law firm mcbride baker
coles and a leading authority on digital signatures
he added
however
that the law's specific definition of a digital signature could limit the flexibility of its application as the technology evolves
certainty about the validity of digital credentials is especially important to securities brokers
because securities transactions are typically much bigger than merchandise transactions on the internet
said christopher musto
a senior analyst at gomez advisors inc
in concord
mass
e-trade group inc
the menlo park
calif
on-line broker
pushed for the california bill
bringing the issue to the attention of state sen
john vasconcellos
a democrat from san jose
sen
vasconcellos introduced the proposal in february
and it passed the senate july 0
san francisco-based charles schwab corp
the leading internet brokerage
also offered input on the law's definition of a digital signature
according to sen
vasconcellos
chief of staff
rand martin
schwab has focused its legislative efforts more on the federal level
however
a spokesman for the company said
this action is a step in the right direction
the spokesman said
but the real objective would be to get national legislation that creates uniformity regarding the use of digital signatures
e-trade said in a news release that the new law would apply to its transactions with customers in all 0 states
but the schwab spokesman said its applicability beyond california is
murky
e-trade did not respond to calls seeking elaboration on how it sees the law applying across the country
mr
smedinghoff
chairman of the american bar association's electronic commerce division
said the only way the law would have broader applicability is if a broker stipulated that a contract was governed by the laws of california
legislation on digital signatures varies from state to state
for example
connecticut law covers only medical records at hospitals
while illinois makes electronic signatures applicable to all communications
in 0 california became one of the early adopters of digital signature legislation
but that legislation was limited to communication with government agencies
utah is often cited as the country's digital signature pacesetter
with a comprehensive law that preceded california's in 0 and resulted in the pioneering designation of digital signature trust co
a zions bancorp
subsidiary
as a licensed certificate authority
to bring consistency at the federal level
sen
spencer abraham
r-mich
this year introduced two bills addressing the issue
the millennium digital commerce act sets out to clarify the legal status of electronic signatures in general
while the electronic securities transaction act focuses on the securities industry

i'm looking forward to seeing you friday night
i'll bring along some sailing info
but thought i'd let you know now what we've got in mind
dan
jamie are lined up so if you guys are still interested there would be 0 of us
we have gotten a quote for a relatively new 0
sailboat in the british virgin islands for the week of thanksgiving
we'd fly down there on saturday the 0th
pick up the boat the next day and return either saturday the 0th or sunday the 0th
the return date is still under discussion
so far we have
i
jamie who wants to fly saturday so we have a day at home before going back to work
ii
mark who likes to spend as much time on the boat as possible so wants to come back sun
and
iii
ted who when he heard the question said
let's start back saturday and spend the night in south beach
the charter company is the moorings
their website is www.moorings.com
and the specific boat we reserved is called a moorings 0
you can see a floor plan and photos on the web but the boat has three separate double cabins each of which has its own bathroom
each day's schedule is usually pretty flexible
get up whenever
i seem to remember jamie getting up pretty early
making coffee
have breakfast on the boat
decide where to go and sail off to the next island we've picked out
maybe stopping at one or two interesting looking spots on the way
maybe not
maybe stopping for lunch somewhere
maybe making sandwiches while we sail and maybe waiting for lunch til we stop for the day
most days we only actually sail for a few hours and are anchored in a little bay by 0 or 0:0 and spend the afternoon swimming
ted's favorite
snorkeling
the masks
etc
come with the boat
hiking on shore
exploring the coastline in the dinghy or sitting around on the boat or beach reading
chatting
napping or whatever
my favorite
there's a cd player and we listen to a variety of music
luckily ted has so far been able to restrain his heavy metal proclivity for the duration of the trip
if you scuba dive there are dive companies that will come meet the boat and take you on a dive trip
there is at least one really good wreck dive
in 0
0
in the bvi
if you want to learn to dive
you can take the classroom and swimming pool instruction in nyc and do your certification dives in the bvi
dan
jamie might be diving
ted
i probably won't
sunsets are often spectacular and signal cocktail hour for me
there's usually at least one restaurant on shore in most of these anchorages where we go for dinner but the charter company stocks the boat with food
there's a fridge
stove
bbq grill on the boat
and as you might guess dan and jamie are pretty good cooks so we can always eat on board if we don
feel like going ashore
while no one is excluded from any activities and everyone can participate in planning the itinerary
we don't always do everything together
either
everybody usually pitches in and shares what work
cooking
cleaning up
sailing stuff
there is
although if only from our keen sense of self-preservation you and ted probably wouldn't be expected to cook
in the past jamie has been the only smoker and he has invariably confined his habit to the downwind portion of the deck
as for $
the boat
provisioning
food on board for breakfast lunch and a few dinners
taxes
airport transfers and a hotel room for the first night we get there all comes to about $0 per person
extras include drinks
only fair since you and jamie won't be imbibing as much as the rest of us
and any dinners ashore and of course the dreaded airfare
i've tentatively got flights for you
through the boat company
that come to $0 per person
though if we decide to come back on saturday that might go down
ted
i usually try to see if there is some way to use frequent flyer miles but we're not always successful
it's such a popular week to sail we need to decide pretty soon so we can put a deposit down
the boat is not actually reserved until we do
i'd better stop
send this
it's turned out to be a good bit longer than i intended but i get carried away sometimes when i daydream about sailing
check out the website
let me know if you have any questions
sorry about all these
it looks like people who don't know my address are just guessing and they get you instead
i'd appreciate it if you could forward them on to me when they come to you
i'll let the sendersknow the correct address as i get them and hopefully that should cut down the number going forward
mark
let's add this as an agenda item to discuss when sara and i are there
just to give you an idea of the kinds of things brent and andrea are working on
please do a card for my rolodex
thanks
marcus
when we were in new orleans i mentioned that i might be planning a holiday in germany
well
i've finally gotten around to scheduling it
i'm flying into munich on the 0th and leaving from amsterdam september 0
if you are going to be in the office next monday or tuesday
when i'll be in the london office
i'd really appreciate a few minutes of your time to get whatever suggestions you would like to make
if you will be out next week
maybe we could chat by phone tomorrow or friday
thanks
mark
i spoke with bill about this and he agreed it was a good idea
in order to complete the approved list of counterparties fo the new online trading system i need a list of master agreements you have negotiated that do not have all the necessary representations
e.g
trade option exemption
and definition references to permit trading energy commodity derivatives
friday noon would be soon enough
thanks
mark
this might be good for you to go to
please print this out for me
laurel
apologies for my delay in responding to you
carol st
clair is helping me with this transaction now
she will get back to you on the confirms
please copy her on future e-mails
mark
if you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs
it's just possible you haven't fully grasped the situation
i'm off to london tomorrow
after a stopover day in nyc and back next wed
but t will be around all weekend
are you guys here or traveling again
i will not be available for the call on friday
i like to leave for london at least a day earlier than absolutely necessary so i have a day to get adjusted to the time change
otherwise you get off the plane and go straight to the office
with a shower on the way if you're lucky
and i'm exhausted at that point
i don't ever sleep well on the plane
this time i'm leaving on friday afternoon to stop in ny for a party friday night and then leaving for london from there on sat
night
since the company pays for business class
there's no savings for going over the weekend
i could get a free companion ticket for t but he's never been able to get off work at the same time i have to go
the rest of our august is a bit hectic
too
next weekend t has a swim meet in san francisco and i leave that mon
night to spend the rest of the week in s
america
the following weekend we had tentatively set a trip to laguna beach but i think it's been canceled for lack of funds if not just so i can catch my breath
we leave on our big trip to europe
germany
belgium
the netherlands
on the 0th and don't get home til 0/0
i have to pack tonight so i think we'll pass on the film
i hope we get a chance to get together some time in the next few weeks
maybe a weeknight dinner some time since the weekends look pretty full
it strikes me that it would be appropriate to offer this service without the application fee and deposit to platinum elite members and presidents club members
if not
the fact that any spaces are being removed from the already inadequate supply will only infuriate me
not make me happy
enron capital
trade resources corp
thanks for the update
i can't say i'm too sorry about any delay since i haven't had a spare moment to look at them yet anyway
this project moves so fast and there's so much to do it's scary
do you remember negotiating any master agreements for ect that did not contain the necessary elements for trding energy commodity derivatives
in particular i'm thinking about things like the trade opiton exemption representations and the commodity derivatives definitions provisions
thanks marcus
i'll give you a call when i'm in london next week
unfortunately
you have the wrong e-mail address for me
my correct address is mtaylo0@ect.enron.com
i'm headed to south america next week
any particular issues you think i need to be aware of or anything you want me to look into
cindy
i won't be able to make the 0/0 meeting
i will be at the 0/0 meeting
enron capital
trade resources corp
here is the north american legal issues list i prepared for mark
he actually called me down to ask for it yesterday
my first day back no less
obviously i've kept it to just the major areas where there might be residual legal risk
he seemed satisfied enough with the format
i explained that i had mentioned his request to you and that you were working on a european version which might turn out to be somewhat longer since you have so many jurisdictions to deal with
the online trading it people have sent us a revised version of the long descriptions and a document spelling out the
rules
for how they are put together
louise is asking for our final comments by close of business on next wednesday
august 0th
since i will be out of town then
please forward your comments and/or approvals directly to mark dilworth
questions can be directed to mark dilworth
marcello romano or louise kitchen
all on the online trading team
please note that my correct e-mail address is mtaylo0@ect.enron.com
i understand that there may be a few additional changes but these are the revisions from our meeting on monday
mark h
has asked me to let him know exactly what we will be sending out on 0/0
would it be accurate to say it will be no more than a flashy brochure with the recently circulated content together with a blank password application all in a very exciting package of some kind
i'm making another business trip to brazil
this time just to sao paolo
i'll be there tuesday to thursday of this week
any chance you will be nearby
i tried to arrange a meeting in rio too but unfortunately our office there is quite small and the only people i need to see will be in sao paolo then
i also still get to london every once in a while
let me know when you are there
maybe we can have dinner
mark
here are my draftversions of the weather gtc's
since enron north america will be the enron contracting entity for all of the transactions
i have expanded the documents to allow for european as well as u.s
transactions and to allow for multiple weather station
index
deals or single weather station deals
the option forms work for either a put or call but that has to be specified on the web site
i think it would make sense for one of the weather commercial people to take a quick look at the forms to make sure they agree that they work
i'm hoping to sit down with mark dilworth in the morning to make sure the long descriptions are complete
when you look at these forms
it is clear that a number of defined terms have to be covered on the web site
premium
effective date
termination date
reference weather station
s
fallback reference weather station
s
reference basis
reference degrees
c or f
strike amount
notional amount and maximum payout limit are the terms i have identified so far
please note
these are not ready to be uploaded to the system
there are blanks for the weather agencies for the european deals
these are not referenced in the earlier uk drafts and i don't know who the appropriate agencies are
i have not spelled out the data sources for the european transactions either
mark
mark
would you be available to sit down with me monday morning
say beginning at 0:0
to go over the spreadsheet
i have quite a few comments on the financial transaction items that i was able to understand and several questions on areas i haven't yet been able to decipher
i am particularly concerned about the weather products generally and the floating prices for all financial products
the index tab
if you could let me or my assistant know so i can work out my calendar for the day i'd appreciate it
i've blocked out 0 hours but it might not take that long
unfortunately i'm leaving town mid-afternoon so i have to get these wrapped up
i'm at x0
thanks
mark p.s
it might make sense to have somebody from the confirmation desk come too
what do you think
here is the spreadsheet with my comments to date
the letter looks fine to me
one typo on the last page where the
o
in enrononline is not capitalized
i have suggested that mark dilworth
one of the guys responsible for the web site development
schedule some time with each of you to discuss the latest long descriptions spreadsheet
he can walk you through exactly how it works for your commodities so you can make informed comments
the addition of paris is news to me so we may have to make a few extra modifications i had not anticipated
once you get the info why don't you take a crack at making the necessary changes
let me know
it may be pretty obvious but i think i can walk you through it on the phone if it's not
who knows if this is true or not
but it is bizarre
subject
darwinian kharma
very weird
a true story from associated press
by kurt westervelt
stick with this
it's worth it
this is the strangest thing i've ever heard
the series of events that had to have taken place in order for this to happen are astounding
at the 0 annual awards dinner given for forensic science
aafs president dr
don harper mills astounded his audience with the legal complications of a bizarre death
on march 0
0
the medical examiner viewed the body of ronald opus and concluded that he died from a shotgun wound to the head
mr
opus had jumped from the top of a ten-story building intending to commit suicide
he left a note to that effect indicating his despondency
as he fell past the ninth floor his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast passing through a window which killed him instantly
neither the shooter nor the dead man was aware that a safety net had been installed just below at the eighth floor level to protect some building workers and that ronald opus would not have been able to complete his suicide the way he planned
ordinarily
dr
mills continued
a person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds even though the mechanism might not be what he intended
is still defined as committing suicide
that mr
opus was shot during what would apparently have been an unsuccessful suicide attempt because of the safety net
caused the medical examiner to feel that he had a homicide on his hands
the room on the ninth floor where the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife
they were arguing vigorously
and he was threatening her with a shotgun
the man was so upset when he pulled the trigger that he completely missed his wife and the pellets went through the window striking mr
opus as he passed by outside
when someone
intending to kill person
a
kills person
b
instead
someone is still guilty of murder
when confronted with a murder charge the old man and his wife were both adamant
they both said they thought the shotgun was unloaded
the old man said it was his long-standing habit to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun
he had no intention to murder her
therefore
the killing of mr
opus appeared to be an accident
that is
the gun had been accidentally loaded
the continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple's son loading the shotgun about six weeks prior to the fatal accident
it transpired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial support and the son
knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly
loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother
the case now reverts back to one of murder on the part of the son
now comes the final twist
further investigation revealed that the couple's son was in fact
ronald opus
he had become increasingly despondent over his failed attempt to engineer his mother's murder
this led him to jump off the ten-story building on march 0rd
only to be killed by the shotgun blast passing through the ninth floor window
the son had actually murdered himself so the medical examiner closed the case and declared it a suicide
i won't be able to attend the forum since i am travelling but do have a suggestion that would make tap a bit more attractive
when a traveller is placed on a
wait list
the agency should check back with the provider regularly and often to see if the wait can be cleared
if you wait for the provider to get back to you
as appears to be tap's policy
the chances are significantly reduced since the provider will almost invariably clear the person on the phone before anyone on the list
other agents have done this for me
i have done this for myself
and it works
tana
please send a copy of the stikeman memo to peter keohane
thanks
mark
sorry paige
i was in south america last week
will respond today
sorry for not getting back to you sooner
i was out of town last weeek
unfortunately
i have a 0:0 already on my calendar but am available later
if you want to meet with alan
jeff first and see me afterwards
that's ok with me
any objection to having david gilberg fill in for me on this
i'll be on vacation then
see you in september
i see what you mean
and i can't explain the bcc
unfortunately
unless they use
mtaylo0@ect.enron.com
it doesn't get here
it must just disappear into cyberspace
thanks for continuing to send them on
mark
please note that my e-mail address is mtaylo0@ect.enron.com
if you use mtaylor it goes to someone else and may or may not get forwarded to me later
paige
i can be more argumentative here but if it's not going to make any difference in the outcome
i don't really see the point
let me know if you disagree
while a commodity forward contract which contains an asymmetrical default provision clearly does not have the characteristic of net settlement
we do not believe that statement 0 is appropriately applied to any contract which requires the making and taking of delivery of a physical commodity absent a default
regardless of whether the default results in a termination payment which may be payable to the defaulting party
an event of default and resulting termination of a commodity contract can have far reaching negative implications for the defaulting party well beyond the terms of the contract itself
e.g
damage to reputation and credit
triggering of cross-defaults
etc
mark
it looks like the new version
that i received from andrew last week
does not contain the comments i had already made
have those been lost somewhere
marie
would you please check with credit and see if you can help with this issue
thanks
mark
the october days are fine with me
i will be out that week in november so i'd appreciate it if you could coordinate with sara and shari to make sure we'll have adequate coverage
yes but gtc's not confirmed as complete set and long descriptions not yet reviewed
mike
in a word
no
we'll add it in and you don't need to worry
mark
could you please send tana the list of countries from which online trading of derivatives with ect is permissible
she is trying to complete the counterparty spreadsheet for louise
thanks
mark
looks good to me
do you want to set up a time to meet tomorrow
how does 0 a.m
look for you
fiona
welcome to the legal dept
i think taffy was coordinating with you regarding my dinner with mark this week
unfortunately
my trip was canceled at the very last minute this afternoon
mark is already aware of the change but he may now have an open slot for dinner on wed
i'm sorry i won't be able to meet you this week but will look forward to it on my next trip over
mark
i'm in eb0
hey dave
thanks for your note
believe it or not
it actually is
good to be back
and thanks to louise's timely intervention
i actually get to stay in houston this week instead of coming over to london for the isda meetings
we discussed the need to have the lawyers review the long descriptions yesterday and mark dilworth is checking on whether or not all the lawyers actually have access to the necessary programs on their machines
he and i are meeting later this morning to talk about several of the items in your note and we have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning to show all the lawyers involved how to use the system to review the long descriptions
the other topics i had on my list to keep moving this week are the matching of gtc's with products and continued progress on the counterparty spreadsheet
harry collins is the emissions guy
i'm assuming he'll be part of this process tomorrow and i'll ask him to take a close look at the long descriptions and how the mesh with the gtc's
finally
i agree with you on the gtc variables issue
my plan is to ask the lawyers involved to focus on this as they review the long descriptions for which they are responsible
with me here to answer questions that may result in more progress but i'm still not convinced that's enough
i hope to be able to spend some of my own time looking at these as you have over the last couple of weeks but realistically i don't think that will happen very soon
maybe you can help me prioritize
should i look first at areas with predicted high volume or areas where we have the least confidence in the quality of work to date
talk to you soon
mark
thanks for the itinerary
please note that my e-mail address begins with mtaylo0
not mtaylor
which goes to mitch taylor
please note that mark dilworth's demonstration scheduled for tomorrow morning
0:0 eb0a
will not be of the entire enrononline system but will focus on the portion of the system that builds the long descriptions
the system now builds the entire long description from the various elements
most of which we have already reviewed
and displays them as they will be viewed by counterparties online
it is particularly important that the lawyers responsible for the long descriptions and the gtc's attend so that we can complete the review process
if you can not attend
please let me know so we can set up a time for mark to show you how to access the system
thanks
mark
dave
one item that was left open after my meeting with mark d
this morning was what the index should look like and how much input we have had from the confirm desk
my inclination was that the index should be the same language that we currently use in the confirmation on the theory that the gtc taken together with the long description should result in a complete
unambiguous contract
mark felt that the index should provide a more complete description than the short description abbreviation but that the full legal text could wait for the paper confirm
given mark's view as to how this field should be dealt with
it may be that the confirm desk has in fact looked at all of these and said they look fine as far as they go and has not attempted to correct them with the full legal language
mark said he would be contacting you himself but i thought it might make sense to give you my version as well
what are your thoughts
if you'd like to discuss
i will be in by 0:0 tomorrow but have a meeting at 0 and then the meeting with all of the lawyers and mark to discuss the further long description review at 0
mark
it may be that you don't need to be there at all
this relates to the online trading system that is being built and the legal review of various pieces of the system
if you haven't been involved yet
it probably means that somebody else
maybe wayne
harry or janice
is responsible for the commodities you handle
the project is only confidential in that we're trying to minimize information outside of enron about it
there's no problem talking about it internally
you're certainly welcome to attend if you want to find out more about it
but if somebody else in your group is already covering things
you don't need to worry about it
mark
dave
could you please give me a call about this
i think it would be easier to explain over the phone
i have an interview scheduled at 0:0 but am at your disposal after that
mark
just a
heads up
there is now no doubt that there will need to be some major revisions to the index language
i am meeting with some of the folks from the confirm desks this afternoon to get them started on a further review
can you please arrange to have the following people given access to the product manager
jeff sorenson dale neuner bob bowen lynn shivers kevin sweeney
fyi
here's my revised version
let me know what you think
frank
i think harry collins is tracking this down
if it isn't settled to your satisfaction by thursday
please let me know
mark
fyi
i'll be there
thanks for your note
if you are still trying to decide about shore excursions
i was just remembering my trip and have the following observations
i found the volcano on the big island to be marginally interesting
not particularly pretty
and from where i was staying
kona
a very long day
kauai was very beautiful
the na pali coast is particularly spectacular
that coast and the nearby beaches are where south pacific was filmed
but it is quite rugged and nearly inaccessible as i remember it except on foot or by boat
i would highly recommend seeing it by boat if that option is available
otherwise
you can just drive up to the end of the road and get a pretty good view
there is also a river boat trip i didn't get to take so i can't recommend it
it was popular with visitors
i didn't make it to maui but i've always thought it would be fun to go to the top of the mountain to watch the sunrise
in a car or bus
and then ride down the hill on a bicycle
there was a bay near honolulu on oahu
near diamond head
where i did my first-ever snorkeling
it was very popular
crowded
but a lot of fun and while there were plenty of fish to see the reef itself was pretty dead
not a lot of pretty coral
i found the web site for the dolphin lab where i worked but a quick look didn't indicate they have a visitors center
you might call them when you are there if you have the extra time and want to go
as far as your clothes are concerned
since you won't have to carry them yourselves
why not take them all
have a great trip
love
mark
the language works for me as long as the long description describes multi-month options as a series of multiple options
test message
i'm pretty sure sita is a french company
have we decided that french counterparties are ok
looks ok to me
non-smoking please
i've put an hour on my calendar tomorrow afternoon to discuss conference issues
give me a call with any questions
if debbie is talking about the language she and i discussed late last week
that is new credit language that has not yet gone in to any of the gtc's
i found it
my analysis is that forcing the scroll through the entire agreement provides additional comfort that the counterparty has actually looked at the agreement and knows to what they are agreeing
it is that much more likely that the contract will be enforceable
it is certainly not necessary from my point of view that the document take up the entire page rather than appearing in a smaller window with a scroll bar down the side
in fact i think that looks much better
it would be acceptable from a legal point of view if the
agree
button appeared as in the example below as long as it didn't work until the agreement had been scrolled through
i personally think that would create more problems from a commercial point of view since many counterparties will try to click on
agree
as soon as it appears without reading the agreement and get frustrated when it doesn't work right away
david
do you agree
same treatment as for telephone trading
enron north america corp
the 0th looks fine
the 0rd and 0th are already holidays
as for the 0nd
please coordinate with the other legal assistants to make sure we will have coverage that week
in this case i would say do whatever is easiest for you guys
since we know that enron canada is qualified
we don't really have to have the representation but if it is easier for you to not make an exception
it doesn't hurt to have it in
fyi
hey marc
i'm here
it's actually nice to be home
not traveling for a while
will you guys be around this weekend
it doesn't look like i can help your friend
we almost never hire lawyers fresh out of law school
believe it or not
they don't really teach you how to be a lawyer in law school so passing the bar is just the first step
your first job is where your real training takes place
we just don't have the time and capacity to train junior lawyers so we try to hire people who have worked for a number of years
usually at least 0 or 0
at a good law firm
they get good training there and we don't have to hassle with it
tanya wants us to use this credit for the 0 deemed isda's for aig that lucy is working on
can you guys please send over a copy of the questions that were submitted to local counsel in europe relating to the online trading project
alan needs it for australia and louise has asked me to deal with columbia
thanks
mark
i have marked my revisions below
here are several of the contracts we are planning to use for the online system
i wish i could tell you these are the final
or even the most recent
versions of the documents but things have changed so frequently that i'm afraid these may not be quite up to date
they do have the advantage of being in my directory and therefore available to send to you today
i don't think the final changes will be significant but if you want to use these as starting points
please let me know so i can be sure you have the latest material
the pa is the password application which is the only document the prospective counterparty actually signs by putting pen to paper
the first time the counterparty logs on to the system with its approved password
it is required to agree to the eta
electronic trading agreement
by clicking on an
i agree
box after scrolling through the agreement
the gtc's are the contractual terms that apply to online transactions if there is no master agreement in place
legal will have the ability to restrict a counterparty to trading only certain products online if we feel it is necessary
while most financial transactions will be governed by gtc's that look like our
omnibus
documentation
the weather derivatives look more like a
deemed isda
one final complication
the credit group has asked us to create two sets of documents
one for highly creditworthy counterparties which will have no credit provisions included and a second set for counterparties credit is not quite comfortable with which will contain a provision allowing us to call for collateral if we choose
maybe you can just respond to this
here is my first cut at an issues list for wednesday
let me know what you think
my meeting with mark h
has been moved up to 0:0
he may want to get you on the phone then but i don't really know
my only concern is knowing which way the inside ferc price adjustment that is submitted will go
will it always be plus or always minus
if so
let's say so
if not
how will it be clear on the web site which direction the adjustment is going
was there supposed to be an attachment to the e-mail or are these coming
i would suggest changing
attain
to
obtain
epmi and rmt are two different corporations
as i understand it
in north america epmi enters into only physical power transactions with third parties while ena enters into financial transactions
rmt handles financial transactions between wholly-owned enron companies
if the transaction you are handling is a derivative between ena and australia
it should be documented as two trades
one between ena and rmt and the other between rmt and australia
that's why the master agreement is between rmt and australia
i don't know how the booking is handled
the same people may be involved but there are tax savings achieved by passing all the derivatives through rmt
fred called
asked if we could move our lunch from monday to thursday or friday
does thursday work for you
stephanie
sorry i didn't see your response until today
the prior tenant is moving out today so the house will be available as soon as i can get it cleaned up and any necessary repairs made
let me know if you'd like to see it
mark
something must have happened in the transmission process
i can't make anything out of the info below
you can ignore that last e-mail
we have not decided
to prevent any regulated utility from completing any financial transactions
online
if we have already satisfactorily concluded the necessary due diligence with respect to a particular utility
they will be approved
it is only with respect to those utilities which have not yet been researched that we are withholding approval
the due diligence required involves asking the utility for certain information concerning their organization and regulatory situation
hiring local counsel in the relevant state and having research done into the laws and regulations in place there and into any public utility commission orders respecting the particular utility in question
and on occasion requesting an opinion letter from the utility's counsel
we usually begin that process only when a trader believes there is a likelihood of a sufficient volume of trading with the utility to justify the time and expense
fyi
the due diligence process has in the past revealed circumstances which prevented the utility from trading derivatives or required actions to authorize such trading which had not been taken
a recent count showed about 0 executed master agreements and another 0 to 0 in one stage or another of the due diligence/negotiation process
looks good to me
are we certain that all of the other traders plan to post daily volumes
looks good to me
good idea
enron north america corp
thanks for your help last week
saturday night was a lot of fun
what is the proposed process once legal receives this kind of request
how does the new product type approval process work
we have received several test messages but it is not clear how we look beyond the short description in the e-mail to see the long description
can the short description be set up as a hyperlink to the web-site
or how we are supposed to respond
my attempted reply was rejected as undeliverable
i noticed that isda is putting on a one-day course in london october 0 on documenting and confirming credit derivative transactions
if you are interested and haven't received the brochure
let me know and i can fax it to you
sorry for the delay
my e-mail has been down all day
we may have some problems with derivatives trading in mexico
see tana's note from earlier today
i'll start the process for the eta

i was glad to see that the next monmouth meeting was rescheduled for a time other than december
i guess monmouth is a little harder to get to than chicago but it will be nice to see the campus again
i'm going to be in new york nov

the difficulty is in knowing which entites are regulated and which are not
for instance
ena is an
unregulated
affiliate of a regulated utility
pge
but many utilities have energy services companies affiliates which
while not regulated utilities like san diego gas
electric
are nevertheless heavily regulated
we have tried to figure out what we can in the time available and have relied on readily available public inofrmation
we are getting very excited about the bvi
it's hard to believe it's only 0 weeks away
i try to think about it whenever the stock market gets me depressed
which is happening with altogether too much frequency these days
i see you guys got hit with a triple whammy today
oh well
can you say
buying opportunity
i'm coming to nyc for a conference in a couple of weeks
any chance you guys are free for dinner on sunday the 0st
we also need to talk about $ sometime soon since i made the final payment on the boat a couple of weeks ago
have you made your hotel arrangements
we still have a room reserved for you for the night of the 0th which you won't need if you've made other arrangements
and we can always get you a room there for the last night if you want
and there's still the beverage list
you did get my fax
didn't you
t
sends regards
hope you're well and not letting the market roller-coaster get you down
my mantra is
think long term

today's simulation has been postponed to next wednesday
unfortunately
they have not yet opened the system to the entire web
you have to be on the enron intranet to get access
if you want to see it badly enough
i might be able to arrange something for you in our ny office
midtown
otherwise i'll let you know when they roll it out onto the web
mark
as far as i know
this is the policy for all online trading
did i miss something
let's go for dinner monday night
with any luck i'll be able to get to the airport for a plane back to houston tues

here are my comments
yes
without doubt
the eta can't be amended on a counterparty by counterparty basis and it says that any applicable master agreement will control
leslie hansen is also working on a draft
if you get something from justin
please forward a copy to me and leslie
thanks
mark
please arrange
hopefully for tuesday since wed
may be hectic
i fully agree with the
fade
effect
but this looks right to me
as i remember it
we were not totally happy with the notional quantity language but this was the best we could do
we were going to make sure that whether the submitted volume was per day or per month was clearly reflected elsewhere in the long description
not elegant
but adequate
thanks for your reply
i think i'd prefer something that's not hosted if possible
i can definately spend more for something that's either very nice or very interesting
also prefer to avoid far reaches of upper east or west sides
thanks for your note
of the three you have listed
#0 is probably a bit far from public transport for me
#0 is convenient to the business i have on mon
tues
what is double ss
#0 sounds like a fun location
i'd be willing to spend more for a place that is particularly well furnished or interesting
any loft spaces
sounds reasonable to me
i'm afraid the difficult questions are the one you posed to peter and whether or not credit will agree
this issue comes up when the credit group is not happy with the credit provisions built into the already executed master agreement
they want the ability to use the gtc with the credit provisions that allow us to call for a letter of credit whenever we want to instead of having the online trade governed by the master
as provided for automatically in the eta
what do you think about edmund's solution
mark
would you be available to take andrea calo to dinner next wednesday
the night before the legal conference
she is coming in a day early to meet
chat with people here
would you like me to set up some meetings for you with people here in the houston office for the day before the confernce
if so
please let me know what your schedule is
i will ask my assistant to set up some times for you
i had a voice mail from him mon or tues that said he would try and get into the office either today or tomorrow
i expect he may be tied up with getting his son into the hospital and catching up with his wife so we may not see him til monday
i feel confident putting myself in your hands
as long is it's not stratospheric
i should be able to get enron to pick up the tab
please go ahead and book whatever you think would be good
just let me know when
where to go
there is no organized transport to the woodlands but it will be easy to make arrangements for you to ride with someone else leaving from the office
so i guess it makes sense for you to come in thursday morning as well
i'll try and set up a few meetings for you starting with lunch on wednesday
i was thinking primarily of lawyers here
anyone in particular you would like on the list
jeff
alan
i will all be in a meeting at 0

i was planning to take her to lunch that day
you should feel free to take whoever you want
as presently drafted the eta provides that if a master agreement is in force covering a particular transaction
the master controls
i don't think we ever adequately resolved the multiple enron entity issue
though
for example
if a counterparty has an isda master agreement in place with ena
that master agreement could easily cover a trade based on uk gas prices
however
it is not the commercial people's intent that the system work that way
they want every trade for a particular product to be with a single enron entity
e.g
all uk gas transactions are with enron europe
regardless of what master agreements are in place
to resolve this i suggest that the long descriptions be revised to state the enron trading entity for each product type
this is already in place for european derivatives
and that the eta be revised as follows
revise the fifth line of paragraph
a
of section 0 such that transactions are governed by the short and long definitions in respect of a product
and any master agreement between counterparty and the enron entity trading in such product on the website which is in effect as of the date of the execution of such transaction
underlined text inserted
i think this will please the commercial and tax people
any thoughts from the legal side
i'm afraid i may never have called you back on this one
do we still need to discuss
my apologies but i'm afraid this one slipped through the cracks in my e-mail and i never responded
has this issue been addressed

don't forget the first session of the conference begins at 0:0 tomorrow afternoon
attire for the entire event is casual but since the room may be cool and we hope to have dinner outside

thanks for spelling it out for me
i will be in nyc this weekend and
while i have done it before and found it to be all you describe
would enjoy going to the parade with you
as i remember it
the trick to limiting the aggravating and full of people factor is deciding where to watch and when to be there
the embarrassment factor is significantly reduced by refusing to participate in the actual parade oneself and not knowing any participants
or at least not acknowledging them as they pass
do you have the time and route
maybe we can grab a bite to eat somewhere nearby
as far as getting in the mood goes
try
i should know how to make that a link but i don't
i'll definitely bring the cruising guide and a map if i can find it
none of the videos i have is right on point
either the wrong size boat is involved or they're too advanced
but i'll bring them along anyway
i have mixed feelings about bringing heavy weather sailing

my comments below in red
lucy
tana tells me you are looking for some guidance as to which enron entity should be used for booking trading transactions with various counterparties
there are a couple of general rules that apply to
normal
trading circumstances and i'll spell them out below
but remember that these are not hard and fast rules and may go straight out the window when circumstances vary
even just a little bit
from
normal
for example
abnormal situations exist where the trading transaction is in connection with another transaction with an enron company
e.g
a financing or equity investment
the counterparty has a legally justifiable desire to trade with a certain enron company
the product being traded is only traded by a particular enron company or the counterparty is in a jurisdiction outside the country where we are trading
except as spelled out below
having said all that
the following rules
generally tax driven
can be used as general guidelines
0
if there is no master agreement in place between the counterparty and an enron company
the trade should be entered into on behalf of the enron company based in the country where the enron trader is when the trade is concluded and
if there is any hope of further trading with the counterparty
credit and legal should be notified to negotiate a master agreement
of course
if the counterparty is outside the country where we are trading
legal should be consulted ahead of time
there are some countries where derivatives are actually illegal
special procedures must be followed or can't be done by us from the u.s
0
if there is a master agreement between the counterparty and either ena or enron canada
and the enron trader is in the u.s
or canada
the trade should be entered into by the trader on behalf of the enron company that is party to the master agreement
if the trader is outside of the u.s
or canada
other rules may apply
0
if there is a master agreement between the counterparty and ect international
usually only european counterparties
and the enron trader is in the u.s
or the u.k
the trade should be entered into by the trader on behalf of ect international
note that there are special considerations if the trader is in the u.k
based on u.k
regulatory issues
the trade is actually
arranged
by enron europe finance and trading ltd
on behalf of ect international
if such a master exists but the trader is not in the u.s
or u.k
the trade should be handed off to a trader located in one of those two countries for final negotiation and execution
it would be a good idea to consult with legal or tax if this comes up for more specific advice
these general rules relate to which enron entity should be the legal counterparty to the transactions
this doesn't determine where within the enron family the actual risk should ultimately reside
if we want the risk to be in an enron company other than the enron counterparty for contractual purposes
an intercompany transaction should be booked
probably through rmt
to get the risk in the right place
looks good to me
here are my comments
mostly minor
i don't have anything handy
i suggest you contact paige grumulaitis
i sent dave comments on his last three additions yesterday and on the full version e-mailed to me
0/0
this afternoon
is the version i looked at the final one or were there subsequent changes to review
keeping my fingers crossed
bunnies
bunnies
would it work if we picked you up in the usvi
i know it's possible to fly into st
thomas either directly from new york or through san juan and you could take a ferry to st
john
still part o the usvi
where we could pick you up
it's a bit of a hassle since we have to clear the boat into the us and then back to the bvi but i've done it a couple of times before
the timing might be difficult since we can't possibly get the boat to st
john before the afternoon of the 0nd
if you're nervous about sailing into the bvi
we could stick around st
john for a few days
you might check the cruising guide
see what it says about the us side of things
places to go/anchor
etc
looks like this one is for me to review
they will be sending these to all of us so that whenever one of us is out
we can let the others know to forward these on to whomever is appropriate
we're supposed to get back to them within 0 hours
there appear to have been some changes that were not made in the canadian long descriptions
dave forster will be forwarding them to you
please resend the language once those changes are incorporated
thanks
mark
bummer
i had no idea the usvi wasn't considered part of the us
i'm assuming when you say
on the way back in
you mean from the usvi to the mainland since we could try to arrange things to avoid going back to the bvi while you were with us if that made a difference
i don't have any leads on a possible stand-in
but don't really want one either since we've our hearts set on you
hopefully the lawyer can figure out a way to speed things up
as a last resort
maybe we should check with greg for a replacement since that's who he'll have to bunk with
you have to be reasonably careful about such choices since you will be spending your holiday in pretty close contact with them
it may also be a bit late to find transport to that part of the world
any hope of transferring the ticket in your name to someone else

agricultural product options are not permitted
i think s&c is fine
they are helping us with cftc issues related to online trading and energy desk.com seems somwhat related
here's the current forecast for lenny
shouldn't be a major problem for us but i feel for folks scheduled to go down there tomorrow and thursday
bruce
we're still keeping our fingers crossed that your permit will come through
are you sure you've got the right lawyer working on this
seems like he ought to be able to shake it loose somehow
anything at all we can do from here
the moorings people asked me to call back tomorrow when they'll have a better idea about the storm situation
they canceled all of their charter starts for today
tomorrow
no surprise
and she expected thursday's to cancel also
they still have everything for the weekend scheduled to go out but they weren't supposed to confirm any hotel rooms between now and saturday
they were able to confirm a room for you for sunday the 0th
the day we have to bring the boat back
i'll let you know what happens when i get through to them tomorrow

andrea calo and cecilia are not in the system to allow me to add them to your review
can you ask them to fill out the form and send it on to me
e-mail is fine
the others were in the system and they should be able to fill everything out on their computers
please see the following note from sheila walton
she has asked that the forms be returned to her by november 0th
they can be sent interoffice mail or by e-mail
thanks
mark
it does make sense that there shouldn't be a problem with traveling to the usvi
since you have to clear immigration to get in there from the bvi i wouldn't expect to have to clear again when you go back to the mainland or puerto rico
we haven't spent much time sailing in the usvi so it would be an exploratory trip for us
not at all a bad thing
we can't get the boat to the usvi till monday
charter doesn't start till noon on sun
and there's tons of work getting all the food/drinks/ice etc
put away
best bet is to pick bruce up in st
john
charlotte amalie on st
thomas is reputed to be a large
busy commercial port
a great place for yachts to play dodge-em with the cruise ships
not fun
there is regular ferry service from st
thomas to st
john
we won't be there before noon on monday
i just got off the phone with greg so hopefully aa can do the right thing here
bruce
i just had another thought
they come so rarely i feel a need to pass them along as soon as it happens
the full moon party we discussed before is on nov
0
unfortunately it is in the bvi
if your lawyer can get the permit by monday and fed ex it to us
we could still get over there
bomba's shack is on the western end of tortola
reasonably close to the usvi
the boat will have a cell phone but we won't have a number till sunday at the earliest
be sure to bring the lawyer's number so we can call him monday
mark p.s
my sympathies on your day at federal plaza
my imagination isn't up to the task of conjuring how miserable that must have been
yes
and boats
i wasn't too worried until the last update which indicates the storm has lost forward momentum and is just drifting out there
just barely east of due south of the bvi
they are predicting that it will resume its course in the morning and i sure hope so but anything can happen
as of the middle of this afternoon
the moorings was planning to let the friday charter starts go for sure
maybe even tomorrow's
you have to be careful reading those reports
the 0mph number is the current maximum wind speed
right at the eye wall
which is well to the south-east of st
thomas
the weather channel this morning showed local radar indicating a lot of rain in the us 0 bvi but the storm center was pretty far away
the real question is what direction will it go from here
if it heads out to the north east as predicted
no problems
if it takes a turn to the north
direct hit
i hadn't hard about the state of emergency but that could be due to rain related damage
many storm sites available
in case you need it to decipher some of the coordinates
the bvi is at st
thomas is closer to 0 0
n 0 w
interesting damage reports
particularly from st
croix
i had been looking at the cruising guide when i got home last night to see where we might be able to poke around in the usvi
i seem to remember that the moorings won't let us take the boat to st
croix
a bit far away
but had thought we might want to get special permission
now i'm not so sure if the place will still be all ahoo when we get there
it might not have been the entire group's cup of tea in any event since it would take a good solid day of sailing each way to and from st
john
my impression is that i might be the only soul on board who would relish that thought
particularly if the seas are still a bit rough from storm effects
i'm watching the national weather service updates as they come out
roughly every two hours
caution on the fed ex package for the doorman
usvi may be the us for ins purposes but not for fed ex
they require an international waybill for deliveries there
you can have the package sent to their cruz bay office to be held for pick-up
two day service
guaranteed by 0 pm
or to st
thomas airport
next day service by 0 pm
i mentioned in a previous note that the main harbor in st
thomas is not really yacht friendly but we could probably figure out a way to get in there if that works out best
maybe go into a different bay
dinghy ashore and get a cab to the airport

good news
lenny weakening
max
winds down to 0 mph and pressure rising bad news
the darn thing won't get moving
still just drifting a bit to the north
east it's hard to describe which islands we care about on those maps
they're all so small they almost don't show up on the maps
luckily st
thomas is to the west and a bit north of lenny's current position here is a san juan radar image that has st
thomas marked and one of th recent forecasted path maps
i just got this update

these coordinates put the storm just a tad south and a good

your own will be better than the ones that come with the boat
give us your shoe size if you're not bringing your own
a few zip-lock bags may come in handy for packing wet items waterproof wallet is good to take along some $ if you decide to swim from boat to shore instead of taking dinghy the moorings should be able to tell you how to get from the usvi to their base on tortola
it may be either a combination of ferry to west end
aka soper's hole
tortola and then a cab to the base in road town or a ferry straight to road town
i don't really know
i'm also no help on how often they run or how long they take
if you can be at the moorings by 0 or 0:0 sunday morning that would be perfect
do you have contact info for your hotel in st
thomas
i have one change to suggest
see attached
enron north america corp
i may have a few minor drafting comments but this otherwise looks pretty good to me
what do you think
test message
i may not understand the question
but legal does not need to be informed of each eta that is executed
my only concern is that the letter may not adequately tie the master agreement referred to and the products affected in a situation where we have more than one master
covering different commodities or transaction types
with the same counterparty
i can imagine a situation where credit doesn't want us to use a physical master but the financial master is ok or vice versa
i mentioned this to bob and he will watch for situations where credit is only
turning off
one master in a multiple master setting
we should also be listing each master affected if credit wants to turn them all off
is this something you know anything about
that time works fine for me
i am in eb0
i suggest you insert
with respect to the transactions
after the word
counterparty
in the second line of paragraph 0
otherwise they look great to me
enron capital
trade resources canada corp
from a financial trading perspective
the credit group is reviewing each potential counterparty and will not approve any counterparty that is not an
eligible swap participant
as defined in federal regulations as over a certain size
from trading derivatives
generally speaking
they don't approve customers that are smaller than that for any trading from a credit perspective but that is up to them
thanks for taking care of this
sorry i was not reachable
test reply
works for me
we have been working on a somewat revised version of the online
override
letter
what do you think
we have an executed master agreement with engage energy canada l.p
which we received signed around the end of august 0
that's fine with me
we're taking that approach on the
override
letters that override existing master agreements
i'm still concerned about the circularity of the letter indicating that the gtc will control but then the gtc says the master will control
here are my comments
do you want to add anything about the reason for this
i don't think it's necessary from a legal point of view but might soften the letter a bit
this phone number doesn't work
do you have another
these are ok with me if agency.com has approved
how will pr be handling #0
this is during our meeting with michael guerriero
would you prefer that i cover the isda call

hi bruce
ted took his first steps back to solid foods on monday night
he was so sick when we left you on saturday that we had to motor the whole way back to tortola and put him ashore for saturday night
we made our flight on sunday and he went to the dr
on monday
they think it was probably food poisoning but i don't see why nobody else got it
greg's expenses should certainly be part of the common fund
there were a few other common expenses we haven't settled up on yet
ted had a few groceries and a dinner and i paid for the beverage order
i'll get ted's numbers when i get home tonight and do a tally which i can send tomorrow
let me know if you think of anything else
when i first get back i usually feel the room swaying when it is small and enclosed
like an interior conference room or the shower
it's a sure sign you were acclimatised to the boat
i'm not sure which e-mail address you are using so i figured i'd send to both

enron rings opening bell for bandwidth exchange by corey grice staff writer
cnet news.com the opening bell has rung for a new kind of exchange
the currency
bandwidth
a subsidiary of energy industry giant enron
enron communications
today opened the doors to a bandwidth commodity exchange
the company first announced its intention to sell space on high-speed networks as a commodity in may
traditional commodity exchanges sell goods like oil
natural gas and grain
enron has taken this concept and given it a telecommunications spin
offering space on high-speed networks to communications carriers
in the past
carriers looking to fill holes or service gaps in their networks would have had to enter long-term contracts with other carriers to fulfill their bandwidth needs
the exchange
enron says
acts as a sort of middleman for carriers to find short-term contracts or quick fixes as they complete network construction or try to manage heavier-than-expected network traffic
for example
global crossing plans to sell capacity on a high-speed fiber optic link between new york and los angeles over the exchange
enron also expects to start an international bandwidth trading market next may
separately
ratexchange
a similar bandwidth exchange
demonstrated its own commodities trading system at a telecommunications conference in new york today
ratexchange predicts that the trading of bandwidth and other telecommunications products could become a $0 billion market by 0

what's the story
we're planning to have people over
it's the egg nog time of year

sorry for the delay on getting back to you

thursday afternoon and wednesday both look pretty good for me so far
i left a voice mail for paul but have not heard back yet
i have spoken with martin and he is going to forward some proposed language to me
i will need to draft a reply letter to try and solve their issue
you assume correctly
your understanding is correct
the trades are binding on the legal entity holding the user id and password
any trades done which either the counterparty or we want to be with a different entity should be assigned pursuant to a written assignment agreement
if the counterparty continues to misuse the system
maybe we should deny access to the types of products particular entities are not
supposed
to trade
excellent solution
lucy
cemex has previously signed a confidentiality agreement with us based on our form of agreement
their form is significantly more burdensome for us
i would prefer that we send our form and let them know that it is substantially similar to one previously executed in connection with another matter
mark
hi marc
yes
we're having a few friends over sat
night for
holiday cheer
which at our house means cocktails by the christmas tree and maybe some of my wonderful-tasting but horrible-for-you egg nog
we'd love to see you guys
it's just an 0 to 0 kind of thing so even if you have other parties to go to
you could make this one the kick-off
the extent of fabulous in our y0k plans is in the price of the bottle of champagne we're going to share at home that night
i asked t if we should plan anything and got the
quiet night at home
reply
that
of course
will change to
why didn't you plan anything
around 0/0 or 0
how's bmc
what are you doing for them
do you know clayton williams
i think he still works there
give us a call so we can catch up
tell g we said hi
hope to see you saturday
looks good to me
any chance of getting the confirms to say
ashland inc
through its ashland specialty chemicals comapny division
enron north america corp
can you take care of this for me
here is the confidentiality agreement we signed last year
csc is computer science corp
joel's number is x0
some of these are not final
i would like to consider some counterparty-specific agreement to solve this problem
what do you think of a side agreement among both kn entities and enron which specifies that a user id and password have been issued to both of kn's legal entities jointly and severally and that transactions for certain products
e.g
all financial products
entered into under that user id and password will be deemed executed by kn trading
their financial trading entity
and all others will be deemed executed by kn marketing
their physical entity
do you see any problems here
issues re
joint
several liability under the eta but not the transactions
let me know if you need further clarification of the problem
i haven't run this by louise yet
she may raise system or commercial objections

here is a draft of a letter agreement amending the online electronic trading agreement
please let me know if it is ok and i will have a copy executed and faxed over to you
my apologies for the delay
i thought i had sent this to you last week but i can't find any record of it so i must not have done it
mark
where do i go to see the products
sorry for the delay in getting back to you
i never did come up with a good solution last year to the
cat climbing the christmas tree
problem except fastening the glass ornaments really tight so when she climbed up inside the tree they didn't shake off
this year she seems content to just hide underneath the tree and hasn't been climbing up inside it
maybe she's just gotten too big
i agree that the mouse traps sound mean
what about double-sided tape
i understand the cats hate stepping on the sticky stuff so will leave the area alone afterwards
this was suggested as a discouragement to jumping on kitchen countertops but might work under the tree
and of course
the lower branches of the tree are reserved for wooden and metal ornaments
nothing breakable
cindy
we have the signed letters
where should we send them
here is an example of what such a letter might look like which may satisfy several of the concerns you raised in our call this afternoon
i do have some issues with the proposed language and will be discussing the details with dale tomorrow
how do you want to handle these
until we have determined a legal structure that works for this trading
e.g
chinese walls
public vs
private reference credits
etc
i would encourage caution in how far you go with specific names
once they are tainted
it may not be possible to cleanse the situation sufficiently to trade on them for some time
when would you like to go to new york to meet with sullivan
cromwell
let me know and i will set something up
mark
this looks fine to me
is this the way our confirmations read for telephone trades
if not
do we need to make this change there also
mark
looks good to me
it should probably get one last look by mike corbally
too
that's fine with me
i don't anticipate any problems at this point
don't worry about losing days
though
we can always make under the table adjustments next month if necessary
mark h
has asked me to prepare an outline of an
acceptable
regulatory framework for otc energy derivatives that we could use as a fallback position next year

you might want to check with paul on this
how have we arranged our ipe trading
since we are talking about exchange-traded contracts here
not dealing with customers
it may be possible to use an entity other than eeft
hope all is well
mark
louise
if you are back in houston i'd like to get together and discuss the credit derivatives project
otherwise
maybe we can chat by phone
mark
i see what you mean
another thing we need to consider is whether or not this is part of our market maker status for the exchange
do you know if bob wants steve's activities in london to be part of that
i did havea brief conversation with janice about this but don't remember her conclusions
for financial transactions we are attaching the gtc's
that is the way we handle the regular telephone trading and in an attempt to make the online trading look as much like telephone trading as possible we continue the tradition
if in current liquids trading the terms and conditions are not sent as part of the confirm
where there is no master in place
i don't know why we need to attach them for online trading
if the back office needs a word version of the gtc to make their job easier there should be no problem getting one for them
sounds good to me
it's ok with me
please check with tana and susan as well
i agree completely
have talked to the mayors office
citizens
assistance office
the traffic
transportation dept
who gave me ms
dorsey's name
and have written to ms
dorsey
i suggest you also complain to our city council member and the other at-large members
since dorsey is the bikeway coordinator
she won't have much incentive to do away with a designated bikeway but council members want our votes
gabriel vasquez gvasquez@cnl.ci.houston.tx.us
i think he represents the heights annise d
parker aparker@cnl.ci.houston.tx.us
i think gordon has already written to her the last 0 are
at-large
members of the council
i got all of these from the city web site so i can't be sure it's a current list
another argument for two lanes on heights is that with only one lane
some percentage of traffic will divert itself to side streets making them less safe for residents there
and p.s
the argument that this lane is designed for use by bicycle commuters is particularly empty since the lane doesn't go anywhere
there's no connecting route at either end that i am aware of
do they expect all these hypothetical bicycle commuters to get on i 0
i have now heard back from ken raisler's office that the only time he has left next week is thursday morning
does that work for you guys
it looks like this didn't go through last night
we sent isda our comments a couple of weeks ago
i have resent them to corinne this morning and sent a copy to you

we are scheduled at ken raisler's office at 0:0 on thursday
the address is 0 broad street

see you there
any thoughts on this platt's issue
i called and asked for an information packet on the enron insurance plan
it is through metlife
last week
i will let you know as soon as it comes
thanks for the update on tim
sharon
i guess the down-side of a 0 year old is that she may already have a fairly well formed personality
but the up-side is they will know she is healthy and she is still young enough to learn a new language easily
feel free to let me know when the bank statement comes
i seem to remember that we came up with a scheme to deal with that last year
i'll bet we can do it again

patrick o'brian
whose celebrated novels of 0th century seafaring won praise from critics and the loyalty of legions of readers

o'brian died in dublin
ireland
where he had been working on a book for several weeks at trinity college
the cause of death was not given and there were conflicting reports of the date
the british embassy in paris said o'brian died tuesday
but newspapers and the news agency press association said he died sunday
o'brian had lived in france since 0
o'brian's major work was a 0-volume series set in the royal navy during the napoleonic wars
a deep knowledge of naval history and 0th century life enabled him to evoke a time and place so vividly that
in this era of supersonic jets and smart bombs
his readers were gripped by the slow-motion suspense of sea battles fought under sail
the series
begun in 0 with ``master and commander
is the story of the friendship between a bold and ambitious navy officer
jack aubrey
and the ship's surgeon stephen maturin
a naturalist and secret agent who doesn't much like sailing
although the books were well-reviewed and found an enthusiastic readership from the start
it wasn't until the 0s that they achieved wide recognition abroad and were lifted out of the ``historical genre in which they generally were reviewed

``patrick o'brian has written great and enduring literature which happens to be set largely at sea
the sunday telegraph wrote in 0
praising ``the intensity of characterization
the complex elegance of the plotting
and the brilliance of the writing
o'brian also proved that
in the hands of a skilled writer
specialist language need not be an obstacle to understanding
readers who can't remember which side of a ship is starboard still can feel the frantic activity on deck as the sails unfurl and catch the wind
and the excitement as a man-of-war turns to engage the enemy
a lexicon explaining o'brian's nautical terminology was published
but o'brian didn't think definitions important
``ignorance of the cross-catharpins is not necessarily fatal
he once said
``explanation almost certainly would be
o'brian's fans range from actor charlton heston to critic john bayley
a former oxford professor of literature who wrote that o'brian's ``originality consists in the unpretentious use he makes of
history
to invent a new style of fiction
``no other writer

adele
here is a revised version
let me know what you think
mark
this will summarize our conversation this morning in which you asked if there was a problem with your purchase of an equity investment
through a private placement
in an internet/communications company
my response was that enron prohibits the trading by employees of
i
any security on the restricted list maintained by the compliance group
ii
any security
instrument or commodity within that employees area of responsibility and
iii
any energy commodity
i suggested that you contact donna lowry to confirm both my understanding and that the security in question is not on teh restricted list
while i did not mention it on the phone
i should point out that it would be unwise to take a position in a competitor of enron's that would
or might in the future
give you control or the appearance of control or influence over the management of that competitor
good idea
this letter goes a good bit further than we have with any of the north american counterparties negotiating the eta in that it identifies only those portions of the eta that control over the masters rather than identifying those provisions which are subject to the masters
in my view there are really only very few places where we do not want the eta to govern
most of the agreement relates to the use of the website itself and to that extent there either should be no conflict with the master or if
by some tortured interpretation there is a conflict
the eta should control
in one case i had to go through the entire eta with the counterparty's lawyer
paragraph by paragraph
to identify those provisions where we would be willing to allow the master to control
the only sections we had to amend were the first sentence of section 0
e
regarding confirmations
this may be different in the uk version
the confidentiality provisions and the notice provisions of section 0
e
and of course nearly every counterparty making comments has insisted that the indemnity provisions be scaled back to one extent or another
maybe if powergen is intransigent
they would be willing to add a sentence to the letter indicating that the eta will control regarding the acess to and use of the website
in an attempt to differentiate between our contractual trading arrangements and our agreement concerning the use of the website
perhaps paragraph 0
a
can read something like
except as set forth under paragraph 0
b
and
c
below
in the event of any conflict between the eta and the master agreement
with respect to the terms of any transactionthe master agreement shall prevail
if we have to use this letter
my only other suggestion to the language would be to refer in paragraph numbered 0 to
the agreements listed beloweach comprises a
or better yet
each agreement listed below is a
rather than
the agreements listed below comprise the
we need to revise the counterparty matrix procedures
counterparties with a north american financial master agreement should only map to north american financial products
including all weather and paper transactions
therefore
please revise the counterparty matrix to reflect that those counterparties with a north american master map to gtc's for european derivative transactions
please call me or tana if you have any questions
thanks

have you seen this
the srrs indicates there are no requests awaiting my approval
the flyer didn't come through
do you have a copy
don't be too hard on him just yet
remember that we talked about many similar issues here when they first came up
maybe after we've been through these with him once he will negotiate them in the first case and only bring the tough sticking points to us
just so you know what may be coming
i have spent roughly half of my time in the office over the last six weeks negotiating these sorts of requests
it is very time consuming
my comments below in red
best of luck and feel free to call with any issues
mark
approved
i have gone ahead and forwarded this and the ecfc version to the eol people to be uploaded
i do have a concern though that i wanted to ask you about
these gtc's use the defined term
commercial term
which is defined as follows
commercial terms
means that part of this agreement confirming in writing the specific terms of a transaction which may be in any form adequate at law that is issued in connection with a transaction
we have taken the position in our other eol trading that the transaction is complete and binding from the time we accept the counterparty's offer over the system by reference to the gtc
the numbers submitted by the counterparty
usually volume and price
and the long description
we've gone to some lengths to make sure that the combination of gtc
website numbers and long description contain all of the necessary terms
it's not clear to me that we intend the website numbers and long description to satisfy the definition of commercial terms
are these transactions not intended to be binding until the confirmation is signed
any thoughts on this
i have been able to access this but our outside legal counsel
sullivan
cromwell in ny
can't
any way for them to get access so they can advise us on this
they are also the guys who will help with a training session on various legal issues and company policies in trading
i thought your mom might like the first three
i received the attachment you sent to me at christmas but was not sure how well it worked for you to recieve them
i took a roll of film to be developed and they had a special on having the photos returned on a disk as well as prints
i though they were the christmas pictures that i could send to you right away
but it turns out it was an old roll
i tried to send this to your juno address and it came back
just in case you are home
i also received the following from the pr department a few minutes ago
be sure to watch chairman and ceo ken lay on fox news today
he will appear on
our world
with neil cavuto at 0:0 p.m
cst to discuss enron's year-end financial and operating highlights
i would like to attend
apparently there was some miscommunication
it was very clear to me after our meeting in louise's office that with respect to proposed reference entities with which enron has an existing business relationship you were going to add the consent to the notice letter
it was that consent that was to dramatically speed up the process of determining which reference entities could be listed
as we discussed last week
without that consent each proposed reference entity must be evaluated separately regarding whether or not a confidentiality agreement is in place and whether or not the existing business relationship is extensive enough to require consent
neither of these evaluations will be easy or quick
while enron north america has been reasonably good about compiling lists of confidentiality agreements
it is by no means clear that all other enron entities have done so
we have not yet determined a process for evaluating the extent of the existing business relationships with our customers but that process will necessarily require significant amounts of legal and commercial time at a high enough level to make important judgment calls
my impression was that you were willing to add the consents to the notice letters since in one fell swoop it resolved a difficult legal issue and moved your earliest possible launch date forward by weeks if not months but also on the assumption that if a customer was not willing to give us their consent we should not be taking the commercial risk that it was precisely those customers whose relationships would be jeopardized by proceeding to use them as a reference entity
we will now move forward to develop the processes necessary to conduct the evaluations mentioned above
please send the list of proposed reference entities as soon as possible
yes
i think they could develop some initial thoughts with that kind of description
is it possible to pinpoint the sources of the rumors we discussed yesterday
if so
it might be possible to maintain an action against the culprits
i'm not sure exactly what it might be
possibly for slander or tortious interference with contract
something like that
i could discuss it with our friend richard sanders but it would be a waste of time if we can't identify the perpetrator
looks good to me
there is a chance that i will be out feb 0

enron presented key objectives for 0
continued strong growth in the core wholesale energy businesses
break-out performance from retail energy services
rapid development of enron broadband services
enron's ability to extend core skills and competencies to new markets was a recurring theme throughout the day
wholesale energy business growth prospects remain strong for wholesale energy operations and services
enron's largest business
wholesale energy growth in north america is expected to be driven by the continuing deregulation of power markets in the united states and large-scale energy outsourcing by utilities and large energy consumers
enron expects to continue to broaden its early lead across the european continent as markets quickly open to competition
finally
enron is rapidly expanding its wholesale presence in other markets such as japan
where large customers will be permitted to choose their electricity provider in march enrononline will provide additional wholesale growth as incremental sales are generated through this innovative
internet-based transaction system
over 0 customers around the world have used enrononline and over 0,0 transactions have been completed since its introduction in late november 0
yesterday
enrononline transaction levels reached a new record with over 0 transactions

enron is deploying an open
flexible global broadband network controlled by software intelligence

this enron intelligent network is widely interconnected to both other wholesale bandwidth carriers and to internet service providers
thus providing the platform for two new enron business centers
bandwidth intermediation and broadband content delivery
a direct transfer of enron's core market making and risk management skills from its energy businesses
bandwidth intermediation will provide capacity
holders a vast array of alternatives for flexible
low cost capacity
enron will also provide premium broadband content services

it's kind of exciting to see a project in print like that but now it means we have to really make it work

pre-tax vs

do you want me to send the stuff to you or should we just chart about it frst
love
mark
fyi
ii have tried to approve this through the data manager
not sure if it worked
i know we must have been through this any number of times before but each time i read one of these i wonder how we are supposed to figure out the notional quantity
it says
calculated from the volume submitted by counterparty on the website
but how do we know how to calculate it
where does it say whether that number is a daily or monthly number
gallons or barrels
i remain confused
my comments/suggestions below in red
as always
i'm happy to discuss
thank you very much
can i get a copy of the risk article
the bis numbers unfortunately do not distinguish which of the commodity numbers are applicable to energy
and worse yet they include only numbers from reporting banks
in the energy area a large proportion of the transactions are by non-bank institutions
this makes finding the numbers much harder because companies like enron are not required to publicly disclose their positions
hopefully the risk article has some numbers but if you can find anything else specifically relating to the size of the energy derivatives markets that would be helpful
here's a draft of a termination letter
i'd be happy to see what everyone thinks before we use it
for instance
what tone are we aiming for
if we want to be all legal and hard-nosed
i can throw in eta section references
etc
or if we want to be softer we can emphasize other trading opportunities within enron and possibly explain our reasons for the termination
let me know what you think
just a couple of comments and questions
is it appropriate to refer to these as
us
transactions since the prices are clearly from outside the us
i recognize that ena is the counterparty but i think this may be confusing to our customers
the term business day should be capitalized
it's defined in the gtc
but it's defined with reference to ny
houston banks being open
does that work for pulp transactions
i'm not thrilled with the language for the last ten days of the contract period on the pulpex description
is that what we use for current confirmations
in the definition of the index for the finnish product
the word
relevent
should be deleted
i glanced at the power product description
what i could see of it
is it definately a physical transaction
where does the power get delivered
if it really is physical
i'll need to get one of the power trading lawyers to look it over
here's one
i have enlisted the assistance of carol st
clair to handle the eta comments and negotiations
i will be meeting with her this afternoon to go over the details of what we have been doing so far
it would make sense for you to meet her at some point in the near future
she is not a junior lawyer by any stretch and should be able to handle most issues that come up with minimal assistance
in fact
as she becomes more familiar with eol and its structure/issues generally
she will make a great back-up for me for all eol issues
there are about 0
0 pages you would probably want to see
if that's not too many for you to receive i don't mind faxing it
you can always call me from the office with the fax number when you're ready
i can even leave it with my assistant when i'm away from my desk in case you get her instead of me
it's finally winter here
too
of course that's nothing compared to you guys
it might get down into the 0's at night and 0's in the daytime
it's only really bad when it's that cold and it rains
brrrr
it was probably pretty smart of delta to send those planes to cincinnati since as a hub they could probably get them on connecting flights to wherever they were originally headed more easily from there than anywhere else
of course a lot were probably headed to nyc and the flights there the next day must have been packed
aside from a quick one-day trip to new york i haven't had to do any traveling lately
i'll probably be going to portland in early march and amsterdam mid-march
i may try and get to south america sometime in february but nothing is scheduled yet
love
mark
sorry for the delay
our general policy is
and the first response to this type of question should be
that
due to system requirements
it is not possible to provide for different online contracts for different counterparties
having said that
in the few cases where a counterparty has raised what we consider to be valid and material concerns
we have agreed to a side letter agreement with that particular counterparty to vary the terms of the eta
so if the counterparty resist the first response and threatens to not use the system for legal reasons
you should refer them to the legal department
they can contact either carol st
clair
x0
or me
x0
any concerns
yes
thanks
i think tana is going to call to get some help interpreting the numbers
christian has not yet gotten back to me but i have asked him to check on the dates we discussed for early/mid march
do we know where j aron wants us to settle the trade done from london
if it is still settled by payment to new york
this one trade probably does not cause too much heartburn
see the note from steve douglas in tax next following
we have asked the enrononline team to send the master user id and password to the person who signed the pa
our theory was that the signer presumably has the authority to bind the counterparty and understands that any holder of the password can also bind the counterparty
if they want to give it to someone else
so be it
but we should not be taking it upon ourselves to send the password to someone else unless we have conducted the same level of due diligence on that name as we have on the pa signer
i was told we were not looking into the authority of the
nominated
master users inn any way but that we were taking some steps to verify the authority of the pa signers
it just seemed safer to me to take this approach
the package you sent arrived today
i'll open it when i get home
i sent the metlife insurance materials by regular mail today
these look ok to me but i think somebody who knows what they're talking about should look at them too
jeff
sorry for the delay
i'm still trying to track this down
obviously i don't know the answer right off and no one i've asked so far knows for sure
although those who know a little something about the area don't think it looks good
i hope to have a final answer for you early next week
mark
how do these look to you
you can ignore my previous e-mail
my only concern is that the floating price is the index for the determination period
which is a month
but the index is a daily index
should we be taking the average for the month
that looks good to me
here's another one
this may be one of the things we have to deal with in connection with the sa restructuring
in the past it was easy enough to justify using don's budget since in theory all of your work was for his benefit
now it isn't quite so clear
i think we need to figure out exactly who you are supporting
is there a separate rc for argentina trading
i sent the web address of the address of the site we were talking about last week as part of another e-mail
0/0
this is just to check and make sure you knew it was there and have been able to access the site
the web site address is at the bottom
dear schuyler
it seems to me that you used to chair a seminar put on by the euromoney people on swap documentation
we used to send our new lawyers and more experienced paralegals to the introductory course and the more experienced lawyers to the advanced course
it appears that euromoney is no longer putting this on
are you doing something similar through another provider
mark taylor
the system is certainly not set up to accommodate that now but we could probably draft around it on a case by case basis
it strikes me that while we might be able to come up with a legal framework that would allow for this
the credit considerations are more problematic
i would guess that the back office will also be unhappy about having to manually rearrange all of the trades
this really seems like it is similar to the aquilla problem in some respects
when we suggested allowing one entity to trade for another
credit was quite concerned because the system wouldn't be able to check the appropriate headroom
i suppose credit could just assign the lowest headroom for any of the eligible entities to the entire relationship
would that be acceptable to everyone
another possibility is for the fund to set up a master trading entity which does the trades with us and then does back to back deals with whichever entities need the allocations
that would let them do a large transaction on eol and then smaller transactions with the other entities
of course
the master trading entity would need to qualify for credit on its own somehow
guarantees from anyone other than the owner would be difficult
upstream guarantee problems
we met with the commercial team this afternoon and i was able to piece together the following
access to the auction site will be by clicking on a button on the enrononline
note spelling
trading page
most users of the site will already be signed up for enrononline
both a pa and eta executed
other users will be given a user id and password that give them
guest
access to enrononline and trading access to the auction page
on the auction page the users may submit their offers to transact
either to buy or sell
with enron
the page will list a reserve price and identify the number of credits to be auctioned
we are willing to commit to transact up to that number with the best bidders
at or beyond the reserve price
but may transact larger volumes if we choose
users
offers may be submitted at any time during the auction period
this time frame remains a bit unclear
probably one day
possibly a week or more
and must remain binding until the close of the bidding and determination of winning bidders
certain uncreditworthy users may be required to post a deposit in the full amount of their offer to buy
it is not yet clear if we will publish the offers after the fact
maybe just the winning offers
all without names of course
or even during the auction period but we would like to have that option
i'm sure i've missed a few points but that gives you the flavor
harry is preparing the
gtc
for the actual purchases and sales
i assume based on our standard contracts for these products
we need to put the legal framework together for the rest of it
if the existing pa and eta are adequate
that would be great but i haven't reread them with that in mind
we really don't want to have to have existing users sign another piece of paper
it makes sense that the existing eta covers some territory that won't matter to users who only have access to the auction page
e.g
references to master agreements
so a stripped down version of the eta for those counterparties would make sense
can we talk on monday
just on the off chance you haven't had enough regarding enrononline to think about recently
louise has announced meetings on thursday and friday of this week to discuss
phase ii
of the project
it seems like an opportune time to come up with our wish-list of possible changes to the site and the legal structure
i haven't had a chance to look at this yet but here it is
that sounds right to me
we were going to pay for extra trips
like the ena legal conference int eh fall
but this meeting is for all lawyers so they would have to pay for this regardless
jan
thanks for your note
tim belden has asked dana to book a conference room
maybe you can coordinate with her
it might also be nice if there is a spare office or two that could be booked for the day
including the morning
so we will have a place to work when not in the meetings
the only people i know of coming from out of town will be me and ken raisler
a lawyer with sullivan
cromwell in new york
we will have a better idea of any audio-visual equipment we need as we get closer to the meeting date
the second product listed here is physical
it looks ok to me but i don't really know
can you take a look and approve it or comment to dale please
thanks
here's another one
i have not received any comments
i consider it final
let me know if you need to have it customized for any particular circumstance
since i don't know who
or for that matter what
the pcg heads are
i sugggest that if they need it you send them copies
here is s&c's first draft
unless you object
we have decided to structure the auction site with the
auction procedures
set out on the bid page
immediately above the
submit
button
as soon as the bid is submitted
the system will check to see if the counterparty has already accepted the gtc's or has a master in place
here is s&c's first draft of the procedures for an auction without a reserve price
with no commitment to sell
or buy
and no disclosure of bids to other parties
it is my impression that this is the way the enbank auctions will be conducted
is that correct
any suggestions/comments
mark
i wish it were more clear
i am trying to get down there to talk to the commercial people about the business direction and support we can provide but until then i don't know that we should get their hopes up
i had hoped to come this week but randy is here in houston
maybe second half of next week
do you know if everyone will be in those days
i was thinking sao
are either of you guys aware of this web-site
it looks like our weather people have put this out on the web ahead of us
i think we need to talk to them about what they are allowed to post and what sorts of disclaimers should be there as well
i just wanted to check with you before i call the weather desk here mark
paul is out sick today
i'll see what i can find out tomorrow
here are my comments
together with my voice mail comment to dave regarding an earlier deletion
here are the procedures toegther with our comments
if you have access to word
you can see the changes and who made them
i'm afraid i disagree with justin but prefer not to do so publicly
it seems to me we need a verifiable end time for the auction period and should choose a time and a time zone that makes sense for the traders and counterparties
presumably uk for enbank but central for emissions credits
justin
are the enbank contracts physical or financial
it seems to me we should use the same customer profiles
that is if the contracts are physical
then any counterparty which can trade physical uk gas should have access
if the contracts are financial
then any counterparty that can trade uk derivatives should have access
mark
it turns out the initial auction product will not be the emissions credits but rather the enbank uk synthetic gas storage product
they want this auction to allow bids to be revoked or revised up until the end of the auction period and not to have the ability to accept bids until the expiration time
there is still no commitment to sell anything
all transactions will be for sales by enron to the counterparty
i have taken a stab at revising the procedures language with this in mind
here's a stab at tthe procedures which provides for hte ability to revise or revoke bids during the auction period
comments
fyi
i'm not sure which
process
you are referring to
i have not yet seen a list of proposed reference entities and if any of them have a business relationship with enron they will need to be subject to a deeper legal review
the process for that review has not yet been finalized but for some potential reference entitiesit will be very time consuming
i.e
for those entities where the extent and nature of the business relationship is unclear
the
soft
chinese walls also have yet to be built for the us
for those walls to be effective there may need top be training for people on both sides of the walls
with the final comment from sullivan
cromwell
is this a document that is available generall
if so
can we get a copy
yes
this looks better to me
fyi
i'm not sure i agree with you
there is a big difference between listing the price for a reference entity's credit online
i.e
in a nearly public manner
vs
providing a price quote to customers who request it
the almost public nature of the marketing may influence whether or not the reference entity is happy with enron trading the product
even if they are not affected in this way
having given them notice in advance will at least give us moral high ground if the reference entity later decides to object
i finally got my film developed
this gives you an idea of how often i use the camera
and thought you might like these
unfortunately the only shot on the roll of bruce didn't turn out
directly attributable to the photographer's lack of skill
and we never did have anybody take a group shot
there were several others that you can tell would have been great shots if my thumb hadn't half obscured the lens
the sunset was taken during our last night there while you guys were swimming off in the direction the picture was taken
if you listen carefully
you can almost hear ted losing his lunch down below
hope you guys are well
any trips to houston on the agenda
mark
edmund
thanks for your voice mail and sorry for the delay
just a couple of questions and minor points ont eh gtc
in paragraph 0
the usual practice in north america would be for the executed confirmation to control over other evidence
since online credit derivatives are not traded under our existing master agreements
we need to make clear to the credit group that these positions should not be included when they determine their rights to call for collateral under the masters
i'm not familiar with the fraud limitation towards the end of section 0
is this particular to credit derivatives
with respect to the third paragraph of section 0
we need to be aware that these gtc's can be accepted by any eol user while the eta must be accepted by the mater user
it is not entirely clear that all sub-users will have the authority to amend the eta
is the purpose of the second sentence to
deactivate
master agreements that might otherwise control the transaction
if so
in other circumstances where we needed to force the gtc to override a master
we have taken additional steps to notify the affected counterparties
i can't remember if we required that the counterparty execute a side letter or if we just notified them that acceptance of the gtc would acknowledge that the master did not control
i'm sure you guys have spent untold hours on the definition of bankruptcy event
but i do want to point out that under us bankruptcy law it is impossible to have an involuntary bankruptcy dismissed within 0 days
if we actually want the poor unsuspecting reference entity to have a chance to have the case dismissed
0 days might do it
i am told that the various periods for notices and responses prior to the date a hearing may be held add up to more than 0 days
i'm uncomfortable with the use of the term
month
what would the effective date be for a transaction entered into on december 0
you could argue that it is either the last day of february or the first or second day of march
the ambiguity could be resolved by using a number of days and a business day convention
this is probably an issue for all of our derivatives
should we apply a different interest rate to non-us$ payments
it is mark haedicke's relatively unwavering policy that us
derivatives trading agreements be subject to arbitration
we rarely submit to the jurisdiction of ny courts unless the counterparty is incorporated outside the us
unless you have received a special dispensation from mark
there is some straightforward arbitration language in the ena financial gtc
our other derivatives agreements contain confidentiality provisions
have we decided not to include one here for a particular reason
again
sorry for the delay
i will be here all week and happy to discuss any of these points
mark
there are a few points in here that you might be interested in
or not
i received the proposed list of reference entities today
here is a draft of a memo that i cobbled together to use in trying to get input from others within enron for the restriced list
would you let me know what you think
i will be meeting with mark h
tomorrow to talk with him about it
it isn't clear to me who should receive this and from whom it should come
since the communications people may have relationships with some of these folks
is kristina the right person
i know that ees has some kind of joint venture with aol
should vicki sign off
if it is going to such persons
should the memo come from mark
cliff baxter
john sheriff
jim derrick
enron north america and enron europe will offer credit derivatives throughthe enrononline website in the near future
these products will provide foregularly scheduled payments by the purchaser and a payment by the seller ithe event of the bankruptcy of a specified
reference entity.0 for a number of reasons
including those identified below
enron maintains a
restricted list0 in connection with its credit derivatives business
which will list those entities that may not be included in the list of referenceentities or that have been deleted from the list of reference entities
this list is designed to comply with legal requirements
to deal with potentialconflicts of interest that might result because of our diverse activities,and to prevent the appearance of impropriety in connection with enron,scredit derivatives trading activities
the credit derivatives restrictedlist is designed for other purposes as well
for example
a company may beplaced on the restricted list if enron is not able to assume any further credit exposure to that company or believes that market conditions do notwarrant the trading of credit derivatives on such reference entity
a company ordinarily will be placed on the credit derivatives restricted list
either before or after it has become a reference entity on which credit derivatives are traded
in the following circumstances
when enron is actively engaged in effecting a material transaction with respect to such company that has not been publicly announced
when enron has an applicable standstill agreement or other confidentialityagreement in place with such company
when enron has a legal duty to keep such company's information confidentialand such company has not expressly consented to being a reference entity fopurposes of the trading of credit derivatives
such a legal duty may be afiduciary duty but may not rise to that level
when some part of enron acquires material
nonpublic information about a company or its securities in the course of its business activities
when enron has reached or exceeded its credit limits with respect to suchcompany
the purpose of this memorandum is to alert you to this new business and torequest your assistance in evaluating proposed reference entities prior tothe trading of credit derivatives based on such companies
below is a listof proposed reference entities
please take a few minutes to look at thislist and then let me know if you are aware of any reason such companies should placed on the credit derivatives restricted list
if you have anyquestions

i just looked at the first couple of documents attached and wanted to make sure the second item listed in them works
is everyone comfortable that the volume should be submitted in megawatts and then divided in half to produce megawatt hours
i think it works but i had to work through it to get there
it wasn't immediately obvious to me
this is getting a bit confusing
is this list included in bryan's
final
list
should we have alan in this as well
looks fine to me
these look ok
i'm still unhappy with using an average of the index for each day when there is only one index for the entire month but i guess we're stuck with it for now
also fine
with the same
averaging
concern
this one looks like it is in the
rejected
category
how should i proceed
my only concern is that it looks like we are modifying the nymex price twice
once in the second sentence and then again in th definition of index
here is the revised list
there are several european entities that we showed in our database so i have highlightedd them as well
there were also several from friday's list that were still there so i have also bolded those
i'll try to track down what happened with those entities

richard
do we have a policy regarding questions concerning pending litigation
how should we handle these
mark
do any of you guys know about this deal
paul
thanks for your voice mail
we can't print the list of reference entities from the website because we have not been given access
we do need to get that list to the various other reviewers in houston and i am sure that is the list that michael referred to
the enrononline people are probably concerned because they don't have a final list of reference entities for their launch
that list absolutely must be scrubbed by the other gc's before it is approved
mark
did you get a chance to look at the credit gtc
carol st
clair will be the swap lawyer for this transaction
this is the site you had trouble looking at a few weeks ago
i had to send the address a couple of times
thanks
i needed a good smile today
does this affect only the
booking
of the transactions
that is
from the contract point of view the trade is still done today
and should be dated the dy the trade was done
even though we may not get it into the bood until the following day
sort of an internal vs
external issue
enron north america corp
there are still certain jurisdictions where we are not offering the product
germany and canada come to mind
bryan
in fact
in order to get this first list of 0 or so on the non-transactional web page
we conducted only a very brief legal review in houston
th full review takes much longer since it involves input from a variety of people
mark
david
the password application and eta look fine to me
mark
that is correct
it never ends
do you want legal bills for this aspect of the project sent through on the enrononline work order or separately
thanks for your card and hello to the whole family
i didn't know you guys were in mass
is this a long term move
things are still pretty much the same in houston
we'd certainly look forward to seeing more of you down this way
as we discussed
attached is the new list of proposed reference entities
i have also attached my previous memo outlining the propsosed business and our concerns
can we do the call at 0:0 houston time
i'll be there
is it really only to last 0 hours
why is enron's stock so volatile now
since today's session started
ene has lost another $0.0
mr
ken lay replies i haven't had a chance to check our stock today
but i think for several reasons it's more volatile
but before i comment on that
our stock price is still up even if it went down that much today
it's up 0% since the beginning of the year when the dow was down
as recently as mid-december
the stock price is up about 0%
that's one reason why it's so volatile
some people bought in along the way
they've had a good strong increase
particularly with the uncertainty in the marketplace
people just want to take some money off the table
as we become more of a technology stock
a high p/e stock
a growth stock held by growth portfolios
you're going to have more volatility
just like all the other companies that fit into that category
throughout the market
technology stocks quite often go up or down not just $0-$0 a whack
but often $0-$0-$0 a whack
what i tell mark koenig is i love that volatility on the upside
but i hate it on the down side
we've had a change in the ownership of our stock
increasingly
it's being bought by the growth portfolio managers
and increasingly it's being sold by the value and other portfolio managers that picked it up at much lower valuations
and now at these values they want to take their money and put it back into lower p/e stocks
i know this makes everybody a little nervous
but this is probably the world we're in now
i'd rather be in this world with a 0 p/e than the more stable world with a 0 p/e
i have explained to bryan that the legal due-diligence effort for reference entities for trading on enrononline will be a lengthier process than that which we were able to accomplish before the launch of the enroncredit.com page
that process is now underway
going forward
i would hope that we will have more lead time and be able to complete the process for both sites before a reference entity is used
i'm not sure anyone told you about this
can you make it on friday
i'm not sure what
penalites
they're referring to
i assume it's a physical concept
if we trade power with these guys i guess you would be the right person
if it's gas
probably stacy
please give me a call and we can discuss
shari is now definately moving to power trading
not public yet
so we really need to figure out how we are going to cover all the bases
short and long term
i will be out the 0th through the 0th and plan to be in s.a
the last week in march
it would be grea if we could both be there for the second seminar
looks like the more pertinent to our issues
but i hate to think of carol left all by herself that much
let's see what we can figure out to make sure everything is covered
i am not available at all on friday through tuesday but the meeting can go ahead without me if necessary

i had assumed we were going to have a separate pa for the auction-only counterparties
the pa contains an unfortunate reference to the eta which will need to change if they will only be accepting the auction-only agreement
may i also point out that we went to great pains to keep the pa to a single page
this one looks like it runs over to the second page
at least as laid out here
i was also under the impression that a completed registration form was required before a user id and password could be issued
while i don't object to having an address for notices on the pa
i don't think it is necessary in north america if we have a completed registration form
then from a legal perspective i don't have any issues

i have reviewed the long descriptions i was given for the credit derivatives
i can't tell if they are current
and have substantial comments
i have attached what i have come up with
sorry it's in 0 pieces
basically i don't think we should be restating something in the long description that is already covered
sometimes with different language
in the gtc
this only creates an ambiguity and is not necessary to form a complete contract
my other concern
and i have not been able to draft language to fix it
is that i can't find any definition of the seller payment amount and i don't think the buyer payment language works
can you give me a call so we can discuss my concerns
ken
here is another
brand new
issue mark h
asked me to forward on to you that he would like to discuss this afternoon in the anti-trust call
this looks good to me
thanks
i have asked kaye for copies of the ca's referred to
i agree completely re
the need for a procedure
let me know what you think about the following
0
commercial team identifies the proposed reference entity
re
and forwards the name to credit
at the same time
the commercial team should be identifying any enron relationship with the proposed re and discussing the proposal with the appropriate relationship head
s
0
credit reviews the proposed re and approves or rejects
so far there have been many rejections so this makes sense as a next cut
if approved
credit notifies the commercial team which then forwards the approval to legal together with the results of their investigations regarding other enron relationships
0
legal conducts a
screening
confidentiality agreement review locally and forwards the name to the other enron legal groups for similar review
if the screen reveals confidentiality agreements with the re or any of its affiliates
the commercial team should be consulted to determine the appropriate level of further review
if the commercial team considers the re the subject of legitimate transactional interest
detailed review of the confidentiality agreements and their impact may be appropriate
in addition
if the confidentiality agreement screens are passed
legal should analyze the
other enron relationships
to determine if they raise any legal concerns
upon final approval
legal notifies the commercial team
copying credit
something this involved may make sense only for re's that will be offered on the website
perhaps a streamlined version would suffice for re's only offered pursuant to an unsolicited request
rod
can you tell me who the current proposed reference entity is and how it is related to the duke companies that are parties to the confidentiality agreements listed below
i need to know who the parents are and who the subsidiaries are and
if it is a subsidiary if it is a material sub of the reference entity
thanks
mark
please forward copies of the eta and pa to paul davis
e-mail address above
if you don't have them in your directory
frank davis should be able to get them to you
thanks
mark
yes
this is fine with me
edmund
rod nelson has just informed me that credit will not be approving duke energy trading
marketing as a reference entity
i don't think it makes sense to review the various duke confidentiality agreements at this point
please let me know if the situation changes
mark
can i get a copy
i don't really know what we're talking about
rod
i got your voice mail
we can talk when i get back
here is a note i sent to edmund last week with a suggestion
let me know what you think
i certainly haven't seen anything and there is nothing in our database
you might check with shari stack
i'm in portland until wed
lori
here is the initial
wish list
from the credit derivatives people
if you can focus on these first and let me know about them i'd appreciate it
any idea what bryan plans to gain this way
it's not clear to me that a hard wall solves our problems with re approvals but that's because i don't know
maybe ken can shed some light on this
david
thanks for your note
just to keep you posted
i plan to be there with my boat but will return to my slip at kemah harbor and drive over to the party so i won't add to the size of your raft
mark
what time is the game on saturday
i have received reactions from several of the other enron operating companies
ebs
ees and gpg
requesting that the following entities be placed on the restricted list for credit derivatives reference entities
at&t corp
baltimore gas
electric company bell atlantic corporation bellsouth corp
cable
wireless plc comdisco
inc
cox communications
inc
intel ibm lucent technologies monsanto sbc communications sun microsystems union carbide viacom wisconsin electric power company wisconsin gas company these companies were those on the attached list
forwarded to the various general counsels on 0/0
which were found to be objectionable for one reason or another
i have not yet heard from the former ei companies
i have not been given any reasons
the most
considered
list came from ebs where i feel sure some of them were commercial
i'm not so sure about the ees and gpg lists
these lists are going to some fairly senior people
i'm a bit hesitant to add to their workload if it isn't necessary
my suggestion would be that we ask for reasons or maybe further research on only those you particularly want to list
we had hoped to have an answer from local counsel in japan by the end of last week
unfortunately we have not yet heard from them
alan aronowitz has sent an e-mail asking for an update on their progress
as soon as we have their answers to our questions
we will be able to prepare an eta for counterparties trading from japan
hi mary
barbara tells me there's a better-than-good chance you will be coming back to join the department
hooray
i was hoping we could chat about how you would feel about joining the financial trading group this time around
i'm leaving for the airport in just a bit to head out of town for the rest of the week but would be happy to talk when i get back and you should feel free to talk to carol and sara in the meantime
mark t
mark h
suggested this morning that he
you and i should plan on getting together for dinner on thursday evening
i'm leaving for the airport here in a few minutes and will be reachable in amsterdam at the grand hotel or on my
hmmm
barbara wasn't 0% sure of your e-mail address
one more try
i will not be able to attend thursday's call
did we ever talk about this
the traders
bob crane in particular
are giving dale a hard time
they want to start trading this way immediately
my comments made below
just between you and me
i'm astonished
delighted but astonished
that they fugured their way through all of those japanese holidays and the aftermath
i'm told that the advice from japanese counsel was recieved yesterday but i haven't read it yet
i don't anitcipate any problems
i can't tell from these e-mails if they are talikng about sending out initial packets on may 0 or going live for japanese counterparties then
all of whom must then have already executed pas and been approved
i guess it depends on where you got the prices
were they from a particular publication
if not
i would suggest that you go to the nymex website and check for older prices there and you can cite to that
let me know if that doesn't work
do we have a netherlands eta
that's fine with me
david
tana and i would like to talk with you to set up the counterparty approval process for enrononline regarding australian counterparties
trading australian and other products
and australian products being traded by non-australian counterparties
the enrononline people are anxious that tana be designated their liaison and we need to figure out what she can do and what you
or someone else in australia
need to do as part of this process going forward
any chance you might be available for a telephone conversation about this at 0:0 am your time
0:0 pm houston time
today

pets in the office it's a growing trend in the dog-eat-dog world of business
there's a growing trend at some companies
workers are bringing their pets to the office
chip paucek
who produces educational videos and television programs
has been taking his golden retriever
hoss
to work for the last five years
paucek and hoss visited the early show and talked with co-anchor jane clayson
the dog has became the office mascot
says paucek
he brings a lot of emotion and people love it
he's very relaxed
but paucek
as co-president of his company
has the freedom to bring hoss to the office if he wishes
not everybody can bring their pet to work
a lot of it depends on the dog
says paucek
who explains that hoss is not a rowdy dog
he just hangs out
explains paucek
he's easy to get along with
hoss has free rein at the office
when paucek is away on trips
my wife brings him in and drops him off at the office
paucek says
while there are plenty of positives to pets in the workplace
there are also many legal issues to consider
john challenger
ceo of an international placement company
agrees that the trend of bringing pets to the work place is really growing
more and more companies in this tight labor market are trying to make their working place employee-friendly and many are looking at bringing pets into the workplace
says challenger he points out
however
that there are serious issues that employers and employees need to explore before they adopt a pets-in-the-office policy
one of the things that the companies must do
before they jump into a policy like that
is take a poll of their employees and find out what they're thinking
if you have certain employees that don't feel comfortable with pets
you might want to rethink the policy
there are liability questions as well
for example
the company might be liable if a dog or cat bites or scratches another employee
the company ought to talk with their attorneys before they put this kind of policy in effect
says challenger
the employee needs to understand that if their dog bites someone or the cat scratches someone
it can't be the company's fault
allergies are a major deterrent to bringing cats to the office
many people are allergic to cat hair
you have to think
as an employer
will you put them in a certain part of your space
what about people who are afraid of animals
many don't feel comfortable with them around
just how many do you want
do you want cats and dogs and what about birds
what about the noise of birds
paucek admits that when there's more than one pet in the office
it gets chaotic
in 0
the american animal hospital association surveyed 0,0 pet owners
they found that
0% of those surveyed had taken their pets to work 0% feel guilty about leaving their pets at home while they're on the job 0% said they leave a tv or radio on for their animals if a company decides to allow pets in the office
they should
poll employees before they let the pets come provide a written policy about pets and list which pets are not welcome in the office establish an off-limits-to-pets area make sure employees bring documents proving pets are vaccinated bar noisy
destructive
or messy animals from the office tell employees to keep control of their animals at all times if many employees want to bring their pets to the office
the company should make a rotating schedule
when the pets-in-the-office policy does work
it's great
paucek says when he and hoss arrive at work
i get off the elevator
he goes one way and i go the other
he says hello to the employees
he has his own web page
this looks good to me so i will go ahead and approve it unless you have an objection
this doesn't seem to allow me to approve
here is the e-mail we received from isda
since we only have $0 left and they are suggesting $0 for the lunch
i'm not sure it makes sense to send someone
i've left a voice-mail for stacey to ask where they stand and whether or not they still want us to send someone
stacy carey called back to say that the $0 would appreciated as would a person to attend
i didn't know if you had anyone who could go so i suggested that someone from your office call her on monday morning to discuss details
stacy's number is
0

cynthia
here is a first draft of an agenda for our meeting this afternoon
mark
here is the revised koch confirmation marked to show the changes
i realized after i had sent the koch confirmation to you
but before i faxed it to koch
that i might have given too much away by using the effective date as the buyer payment date
in the version i send to koch i will change that to trade date
you can always change it to a later date if you want to tomorrow
i believe that this is not the gtc but rather the master agreement used for bandwidth
i spoke with cynthia harkness
one of the bandwidth lawyers
last week
my impression was that the bandwidth trading documentation was still in flux and they were waiting for it to settle down before preparing a gtc
attached is the confirmation revised to include ken's most recent comments
tana
please mark up the draft with these comments so i can see what they look like
jay
thanks for your note
this definitely falls into the
b
category
the problem is that there are sooooo many things in the b pile already that i can't tell you exactly when this will be resolved
having said that
i agree that the weather information is probably the least risky
but it might be helpful if you were to visit their sites and see if there is any comment about further use of the information posted there
as for the others
a little additional information would be helpful
for instance
i know we were in discussions with ngtl at one time and were unwilling to sign the letter they asked for
was there ever any follow-up with them on that
is there any correspondence at all
it doesn't have to look like an official contract
is the telerate information also available from other sources
is it possible that telerate gets it out really fast and that is their advantage but others are right behind with the same or very similar information
do we have an agreement of any kind with telerate regarding the services they provide to us
thanks for your help and continuing attention to this
i agree we should be trying to do this the
right
way
mark
there are no requests awaiting my approval
thanks for the messages
i have not heard anything since they left
very good news
i'm not sure
i thought we were not adding any products
just opening existing products to japanese counterparties
is he talking about the existing gtc's for petroleum products

are you planning to attend the planning committee meeting in monmouth next week
i'm setting up dinner with doc
instead of the private dining room affair
in case you're interested
when i try to open the link i get an error message saying
you are not authorized to perform that operation
there are still no requests awaiting my approval in the srrs icon on my desktop
sorry
doc
the schedule calls for the meetings to end at 0:0
there's also a play
the merry wives of windsor
that night and we can work around that if you were planning on going
mark
thanks for forwarding all of this stuff
so far it has all been mine
i think your name must come up automatically for some of these folks when they just type in mark taylor
it's not nearly as bad as when there was another mark e taylor
and he wasn't nearly as nice about it either
instead of forwarding them to me
he would send them back to the senders with sometimes nasty notes like
try to get it right next time
luckily for both you and me he is no longer with enron
can you imagine how bad it would be if there were three of us
when i get these
i usually send a note back to the sender letting them know that there are two of us and they need to pay attention when addressing things to one or the other
mark
good meal
in monmouth
not sure if that is really possible by your standards
i had the barnstormer in mind
it pretty much has to be better than the food at the stockdale center
you might want to take a read through this one more time just to make sure i have it the way you want it
approved
i had a note back from doc asking if we wanted to go to the play after dinner
if we're not interested he can go on sunday but if we want to go he'll get us tickets
i can go either way
what do you think
thanks for your note
i'll keep those items in mind
it seems pretty clear to me that the pres
has something of a bricks and mortar agenda and some gentle nudges towards a more academic path may be needed
i asked mark kopinski
who is also coming to the planning meeting
if he wanted to join us for dinner so i've sent him a note asking if he wants to go to the play or not
i'll let you know what he says
i have mixed feelings since i'd like to see the play but would regret the time we could have spent chatting
please order enough books for the swaps group and a few extras
alan
regarding the legal comments below
my impression was that the joe had settled the choice of law issue
i.e
the umbrella documents
password application and electronic trading agreement
will be identical to those used in north america containing a new york choice of law provision
these agreements have been approved by local counsel in japan
this is till my recommendation unless the commercial team decides that a document governed by japanese law is essential
as is the case for all enrononline trading
the online gtc's governing various commodities contain an appropriate choice of law for that product
e.g
english law for uk gas
new york law for us derivatives
etc
regardless of where the counterparty is situated
when a japanese product is offered
i would assume that you will create a gtc governed by japanese law
but last i heard that bridge is still ahead of us
i don't know what the
international contracts
are that rousseau refers to
there is no standard agreement for online trading
the eta provides that if a counterparty and the relevant enron entity have a master agreement in place
such as an isda master agreement for derivatives trading
is this what rousseau had in mind
such master will control the relevant transactions
the choice of law in that master would be the subject of negotiation at the time the master was signed
in summary
unless the commercial team has changed its mind on the documents
the legal side of things is ready to go
mark
rousseau
i have copied you on an e-mail to alan aronowitz which may answer your questions
if not
please feel free to call and we can discuss your issues
if i am not at hand when you call
my assistant can book a particular time on my calendar so we won't be trading calls forever
mark
mark k thought the play sounded like a good idea so if you could get tickets for us that would be great
my flight out isn't until around 0:0 friday morning so i can always stay up late to chat
i'll be there thursday morning
too
i'm supposed to attend a lecture at 0 but am free before that
any chemistry classes or labs i should sit in on
mark
any further news from russia
there's a good chance i'll have to go to dc for a day tomorrow
if they're back i might be able to get up there to see them
i could try and get an early enough flight tomorrow afternoon that i could spend the evening with them
fyi
what do you think
ok with me
although i think i'm supposed to leave for south america on sunday evening
gone 0 days or so
this is the trip that has been postponed twice already so i won't be surprised if it is delayed again
allison
i don't think they were expecting cynthia to attend these meetings with me
there will only be one representative from each of the three companies
i did want her to know what meetings had been set up for me though and to know i was in town that day in case she wanted me to see anyone else
my flight out isn't until after 0:0 pm
and i assume that the luken meeting will be over around 0:0
enron north america corp
fyi
just a heads up
mark h
asked me to set up a day that he and i could come to your office to discuss the legal issues surrounding electronic confirmations of transactions generally but in particular those done over enrononline
i'll check with his assistant and get a couple of potential dates
hey marc
we're in town this weekend
let us know if you plan something
mario
we have conducted our initial legal due diligence for the enrononline launch in japan
the advice we have received is that to the extent the agreements are enforceable under the law chosen
e.g
new york for the pa and eta
they should be enforceable in japan as well
local counsel is aware of our business and has not identified any other legal pitfalls
we have not looked into the registration of domain names in japan
please let me know if this is required
mark
thanks for your note
i am actually checking my e-mail with my laptop at the airport in minneapolis
i was in dc on wednesday
too bad tim
sharon aren't back
and then flew on to monmouth
well
flew most of the way
the closest airport is still a bit over an hour drive away
for a capital campaign planning committee meeting
mark kopinski was there and he and i had dinner with dr
kieft
our fraternity advisor and one of my chem
professors
who is still teaching
i'm now on my way back to houston
flight delayed but shouldn't be getting back too late
hope you are well
love

are you sure about this
i didn't know i had a ny bar number
looks good to me
robbi
the cftc issued a regulatory framework for some new regulations in late february
a copy of which is attached
no proposed regulations have resulted but could come out at any time now
there is also some activity on the hill
bills percolating through various committees
house banking
house agriculture and senate agriculture
which are also of interest
we have been monitoring these developments and i'd be happy to talk them over with you
please give me a call if you'd like at x0
mark
i don't think this one will work for us
we would prefer a college degree
angelica lacks an undergraduate degree
yes
so far that is the plan
the pa and eta for japanese counterparties will be identical to those for north america unless they need revision for some commercial reason
i will try and get to the faq's tomorrow
sorry i didn't get to you today
i have kept a slot on my calendar at 0:0 houston time tomorrow if that works for you
i will not be able to attend
i will be out the 0th but plan to be here the 0th and 0th
i have not
happy to coordinate with you

we generally do not give legal advice to our counterparties
regarding tax or other legal consequences to their trading
the only thing we could safely say would be something to the effect of
if you are concerned about the tax consequences of your enrononline transactions
please consult your tax advisor
here are my faq comments
all of the existing answers are still correct
we have interviewed four candidates so far and may be able to decide on one of them
the group will be meeting early next week to discuss everyone's reactions to the interviews
if you have other resumes we would be happy to look at them
my own view is that while these candidates would be ok
they are not superstars
like the person we are losing
mark
stanford
my only remaining comment would be a request that the we have a week to provide the notice we are required to give if we are unable to obtain the exchange consents
that would mean changing the date to september 0
0 at the end of the sentence
otherwise it all looks good to me
i will forward everything on to mark holsworth for his final review
particularly with respect to the affiliates issue
thanks very much for your help in getting this done
mark
mark
here is the most recent draft of the reuters document
you will see that while they didn't give us everything we asked for
they made significant progress on the indemnity
i'm not sure they have satisfied your concern regarding the enron affiliates issues
they have added in subsidiaries in several places but refused to change the definition of
distributor
to include affiliates
if you need a complete set of all of the drafts we have been through
to see all of the marked changes
let me or dave samuels know and we can forward them to you
i think there were at least 0 versions since the draft we discussed with them the other day
since i will be in brazil on monday
it might make sense for you to coordinate your reactions with dave
if you need me
please leave a voice-mail or ask my assistant

hi dave
thanks for your note
it's hard to believe that washington house was over twenty years ago now
i left dc at the end of that summer and went to law school in michigan
my first job after graduating was for a law firm in houston
they opened a new york office in the mid 0's and i went there to help out
the office wasn't successful but i loved living in new york so i moved to another firm there and stayed for almost 0 years total
one of those years was spent working in asia
primarily indonesia and hong kong
i've now moved back to houston where i am a lawyer with enron
a large energy company
and focus on derivatives and online trading legal issues
we have offices in several countries around the world which i get to visit periodically
i'm actually writing this from buenos aires where i'm helping them get some products ready to trade online
i get back to washington a couple of times a year to do some lobbying for the company and may actually have been there when you were in town
i think i was there the 0th
0th
i've stayed in touch with doc kieft and mark kopinski and get back to m.c
from time to time
mark lives in new york where he manages a couple of international mutual funds for american century
i was on the alumni board for a few years so got back for their meetings at homecoming and got to see the people who came back
unfortunately i haven't really stayed in touch very well
there have been a number of changes to the campus since our time so you may be surprised if you haven't been back for a while
of course woodbine is gone
there's a new theater
a big addition to the gym and several major interior renovations
and i understand there are big plans for more
they are going to close sixth street
tear down gibson and expand the campus a block to the west with at least one new dorm
a big expansion to the sports facilities
indoor track
pool
etc
and a redesign of the library
enrollment is up above 0
congratulations on your successful career
who would have thought when we got out of school so many years ago that monmouth grads could do this well
there are doctors
bankers
chemists and lawyers everywhere you look
i guess we really did learn something while we were there
let me know if you ever get to texas
it would be fun to get together and catch up

i have asked the tax guys to talk to you directly since i am in south america this week
if you have not heard from them
you might try calling stephen douglas or jeff blumenthal
they are the tax experts for enrononline
thanks for your note
my company has revised our e-mail addresses
please change my address in your records to mark.taylor@enron.com
thanks
i have no objection to changing the product name
the tax issue concerns the location of the trader
if the guy managing the prices is in london but the transactions are with ena
there may be tax implications

i've been having trouble getting this e-mail to go through to robin tompkins at portland general
would you please either find robin's correct e-mail address and forward it to her or call and get her fax number and fax it to her
thanks
mark
any idea why this question came up
my thoughts concerning potentially novel elements of enrononline
0
the online
making of a market
i.e
the continuous posting of real-time prices for both purchases and sales of commodities 0
the online ability to enter into an energy commodity or commodity derivative transaction
0
the continuous and frequent updating of prices
including the operation of the
stack manager
which automates this process in many ways so that the system can react more quickly than a person
0
enrononline uses multiple levels of contractual language
a single line
short description
of abbreviated terms identifying the transaction to the trader
a long description which defines the abbreviated terms and adds additional legal language and general terms and conditions which contain the remaining contractual terms and are accepted only once by the counterparty
0
the site directs counterparties to different contracts based on the counterparty profile containing both credit information and information concerning the contracts the counterparty already has in place
0
it may be relevant for any or all of the foregoing that the enrononline system is web-based
i.e
the user does not require any system-specific software but just a web browser
and an internet plug-in application
0
the master user account gives the counterparty the ability to set up passwords for sub-users for that entity and control the access and trading authority of various password holders
0
each user can create customized screens showing only those products in which he or she is interested
0
the system provides for the submission of offers to transact by counterparties which are automatically accepted or rejected by the system based on pre-established criteria resulting in binding contracts

thanks tara
thanks for your quick reply

i'm in buenos aires today and talked to andrea about her computer
while they are having big problems with her laptop
it likes to eat hard drives
she will be able to bring it along
it's a compaq armada 0c
will that fit in the docking station
in case it isn't working
can we get her set up with one of the windows 0 machines that are being installed tuesday morning
mark
i haven't been able to get into any off these things
do you know what they are
my only comment would be to suggest that the password application and registration form be referred to as
available online
describing them as
online
forms may lead some to believe that they can be filled out and submitted online while in fact the password application must be printed out and signed before being sent to us

i will be out of the office at a seminar on thursday and friday of this week

if you have time
would you please take a look at this
we are now able to open these but can't say i'm any happier about it
well
maybe that's too extreme
at least it seems like a good idea in principle
but i do have several questions
do we have a similar system here in na
are we expected to review all of these
is there some way to filter out the junk
to whom should i address these questions
here is the japanese repsonse which also contains our inquiry
i don't think this person's experience is the right fit for our paralegal position
this person doesn't have the kind of experience that we are looking for but she might work for one of the other groups in the department
i am forwarding this to ann-elizabeth white who may know of an appropriate spot
these do not appear in my srrs but i would approve them if i could
this does not appear in my srrs but i would approve it if i could
in case you have to work late again and need a smile or two
in the future
please print these out for me instead of sending them by thanks
i agree that an electronic system of tracking these things is a good idea
either the electronic or manual system will be admissable
but the electronic system strikes me as more reliable
i'm more concerned witht he effectiveness of the notification
it's still not clear to me that adding a line on the ticker will be satisfactory
in fact
it clearly is not satisfactory for changes in the eta or a gtc
those documents will have to be clicked on again if any changes are made
the only remaining question being how do you highlight the changes
the significant gray area is still changes to the long descriptions
yes
i will take care of this one
let me know if this is what you had in mind
is this for you
i have revised my profile to give you calendar management access
sorry about the delay
thanks for taking care of this
sorry if i caused any confusion
release date
0/0/0 new york mercantile exchange announces e-commerce venture for immediate release contact
maria gonzalez new york
ny
may 0
0
the board of directors of the new york mercantile exchange last night approved the formation of enymex
an e-commerce venture that is intended to become the premier
global exchange for over-the-counter
otc
forward trading and clearing of a wide range of standardized physical commodity contracts
the board also established an implementation schedule and retained the services of andersen consulting to work on the venture
the exchange plans to use its proven clearing infrastructure to introduce complete counter-party risk management for otc trading
and create net margining with exchange futures markets by calculating a consolidated clearing position
enymex will provide a single
internet-based interface to both the otc market and the exchange futures market by routing futures orders to the trading floor and the nymex accessc electronic trading system
depending on the session
the exchange's vision for the venture also includes pursuing strategic partnerships through which enymex would provide clearing services to external organizations and creating a credit structure that will permit floor members to participate in otc markets
the range of otc products offered will initially focus on swap contracts in crude oil
petroleum products
natural gas
and electricity
with some spot cash market products also offered
over time
this would be expanded into such areas as precious and base metals
coal
and
potentially
bandwidth
weather
and emissions
although the initial geographic focus will be on north america
contracts are also expected to be offered for some european and asian locations
in addition to today's launch announcement
the key milestones of enymex
are expected to be a third quarter introduction of otc trading
followed by internet-based order-routing for futures trading
including a common interface for otc and futures trading
and clearing and settlement of otc trading
exchange chairman daniel rappaport said
the global energy and metals community has expressed a strong need for an electronic otc platform that provides an open
independent
and neutral marketplace for trading by all participants
price transparency
counter-party credit risk management
and the liquidity created by simple standardized contracts
mr
rappaport also enumerated several other advantages of enymex over other available otc systems
leveraging the proven market management capabilities of the exchange
the combination of the existing futures and options markets with the enymex electronic otc market provides an ideal combination of e-commerce with
bricks
mortar
the exchange's established and well-regarded clearinghouse
which will be used to provide counter-party risk management
net margining of positions across the futures and otc markets
providing significant cashflow benefits to participants trading across markets and commodities
enymex will be a wholly owned
for-profit subsidiary of the new york mercantile exchange

would you please take care of this asap
here is the draft of the questionnaire for local counsel
let me know what you think
if the nda is the confidentiality agreement for the energy trading platform
group of six
i have marked it up with only those revisions i thought essential
having discussed them with andy
and am now waiting to hear back regarding where i should send it
have left voice mail for greg and andy is checking
if the nda is something else
please let me know
thanks for that
i had completely forgotten about the insurance issue
this is why he never got it
i think these will be the first days susan bailey gets back from being out
please make sure this is ok with her and you guys coordinate on what's going on
you're right
i had my weeks mixed up
since we are one person short i'd still appreciate it if you guys would coordinate to make sure there isn't any undue confusion
thanks mark
these are mine and i'll ask louise to be more careful in her addressing
please be careful in addressing e-mails to me
several of yours
re
follow-up on friday's meeting
have gone to the other marktaylor
mark a taylor
i just found out when he forwarded them on to me
please respond to peoplefinder
it looks like we should send him the term sheet
frank
there appears to have been a mild snafu with my e-mail address
my fault
not yours
and i have just now seen your note from yesterday morning
i am working on the posting agreement
i'm afraid louise may have thought more highly of my abilities to create something like that from whole cloth than i deserved but we will try and get that to you soon
travis mccullough
our corporate lawyer
will get together a term sheet on the equity side of things which we should be able to get to you quickly
no later than thursday if his schedule permits
i'm assuming that your legal team will have to be draftsmen of the definitive corporate documents but the term sheet should give them a good starting point
and let you confirm that the lawyers on both sides are getting it right
sorry for the delay and confusion
we'll get these out to you as soon as we can
mark
yes
in fact it is already on my calendar
i am available
best after 0:0 or 0:0
where is always difficult
quieter as opposed to noisy
crowded
but not dead either
i'm not picky am i
any suggestions
they shouldn't be doing any trading so i hope we won't need those things
what is your anticipated start date in houston
we need to work on a place for you to sit
i got a call from aep asking that we have louise initial the changes we made in the ca and fax it back to them
is she here today
this is the north america version
there are a number of variations for different jurisdictions
you can see them all on the website by going to enrononline.com and then going to the
how to register
page
there is a drop-down that lists all of the available pa's
justin
david samuels and rahil jafrey have come up with an idea for an incentive to get people to use enrononline
they want to set up a sports fantasy league system on the website allowing users to accumulate points and then awarding prizes to the winners
the first proposal relates to european football
i think
and they would like to meet to discuss the idea at 0:0 a.m
houston time tuesday
any chance you might be available to listen in
they said they had agreed but i have not seen a copy initialed by them
mark
you might consider treating the choice of law and submission to jurisdiction as two separate issues
for example
if bc law is not objectionable
we could choose that law to apply but not consent to the jurisdiction of any particular court
the most likely outcome
at least in many us states
would be that we would end up in a bc court if we had to sue them but unless we have significant contacts with bc
e.g
an office there
they would have to sue us in alberta
mark taylor
yes
i spoke to her earlier this week
sorry i didn't get back to you in response to your voice-mail
i was hoping i could talk to carol and sara to see if anyone remembers why we incorporate the credit support documents by reference
regarding the cross-default
we usually do not expand the definition since we don't want to bring in other derivatives transactions
of course that was before we started doing derivatives under various master agreements with the same entities
it may be time to revisit this one
looks good to me
this looks fine to me
the tax section of the draft was a holdover from the initial survey done in europe last year
in this case
i assume that lynn is taking care of the tax issues and may be using different counsel for tax issues
in brazil the entire tax section of the memo was deleted before it was sent to counsel
in this case
i would view you as andrea's supervisor and i would be her representative at the prc which would be here in houston
alan
i know jeff is out of town and may not see this right away so i thought i would forward it on to you
steve
here is the most recent draft of the swap agreement
the marked copy
the second attachment
shows the changes with the exception of the payee tax rep which has been deleted in the clean version
mark
will putting this in the confirmation give the accountants heartburn over treating the transaction as a swap
please remember to go into the performance management system to select reviewers for this series of performance reviews
please remember to go into the performance management system to select reviewers for this series of performance reviews
bryan
the process for approving these involves sending the names to the general counsels of the various operating companies here in houston
several of them then send the lists to the senior business people in their organizations
unless there is a real urgency
i would suggest that we send the list all at once instead of piecemeal
what do you think
mark
thanks for your note
in reply
0
we will change united kingdom to england in the governing law section
0
and 0
we did switch to the english law form and our form didn't provide for using securities as collateral
as you point out
it is likely that sr will always be in the money and the csa provides for an unlimited threshold for sr at all times so that it will never be providing collateral under that document
there are certainly other changes that could be made to the document with that in mind but in the interest of time we didn't make much of an effort on that score
our theory was that you wouldn't mind too much since you would never have to post anything under this document
please let me know if you have any other questions or comments
mark
that certainly makes sense to me
i had better talk to paul about the appropriate procedures going forward
i was assuming that paul might have a process set up for the uk and that we could copy most of it
do you know if he has created one already
done
my only comment is that there should be an apostrophe in
sellers
in the third line up from the bottom
looks good to me
there is a meeting on my calendar for friday morning to discuss phase 0 content issues with people from the research group
not sure if this is the same issue or not
susan
please send this guy a sample form of each of the omnibus
industrial and isda
both printed form and schedule
thanks
jason
would you take a quick look at this
i think legal in london will be negotiating it so you don't have to be particularly thorough
but i thought you might have some insights given your recent experience with our other content agreements
thanks
mark
i agree with you 0%
i hope that mike can make it clear to john that it is never appropriate to criticize another department
whether legal or anyone else
in such a public manner
if he feels there is a problem that should be corrected
he should proceed through proper channels
in this case
a direct one-on-one conversation with andrea strikes me as the most obvious route and if that is not possible
not productive or just too awkward
he should have approached either you or mike
sending out an e-mail that might be considered personally critical of andrea in such a public way is clearly contrary to our core value of respect
i hope you are able to have some input into the review process for john and this should certainly be mentioned
if you need my help in any way
please let me know
remove
craig
there was no attachment to your e-mail
is it coming in hard copy
mark
i can make it next week
travis will be on vacation but we can patch him in by phone
ken is available from 0 to 0 and then again from 0 or 0 onwards
which would you prefer
approved
another thing we'd like to talk about on monday is the danger of becoming a commodity trading advisor and the kinds of things we should look out for in the proposed website content
for example
we have heard repeated references to
market commentary
and we will need to develop some sort of guidelines to give the commentators
please revise my entry in the web directory to show my new e-mail address
mark.taylor@enron.com
and my greek affiliation as zeta beta tau
thanks
mark taylor

i agree with you on 0
passport should be password and i have put a call in to tony pryor to ask about #0
here is the most recent draft of the posting agreement which we would like to discuss with you at our meeting tomorrow
this is certainly a tough one
we go to great lengths to avoid regulation here and have been fairly successful to date
we do have some oversight from the federal energy regulatory commission
ferc
regarding our power trading and pipeline activities and local state regulators keep an eye on our purely intrastate pipeline activities
but for the most part we are unsupervised
if it helps
we conduct our derivative trading operations in accordance with commodity futures trading commission
cftc
regulations
but that's just complying with the eligible swap participant and trade option exemption rules
it is true we are a member of the nymex and subject to their rules but they relate almost exclusively to trading on the nymex
it might be more helpful to talk to the guys in london about our sfa regulatory status
we have quite a bit more supervision there than we do here in the states
sorry about the delay
here are my responses
0
yes
this is primarily a tax issue
however
there are some countries with strange laws regarding internet usage and we have covered some of those issues with specific pa provisions for those countries
0
no
only one user from each counterparty has to accept the gtc and that only the first time they trade that product
the gtc's are arranged by
product type
so you only have to agree to it once for that type
regardless of how many products there are
so for example you only agree to the financial derivatives gtc once no matter how many different types of swaps and options you subsequently trade
0
no
but if that would be helpful it can be arranged
0
this one doesn't make much sense to me
enrononline itself doesn't make any money
there is no advertizing
and enrononline doesn't trade
the trades are all done by the various enron trading entities
enrononline is actually providing them a service
0
i really have no idea
i guess we would have to print out the records and have one of the it people testify that they had not been modified
0
so far we haven't deleted anything
if we need to keep the records for a long time we probably can but this has not been discussed
were you thinking about presenting re
enrononline or attending to hear what the others have to say
here is my first cut
what do you think
here is the language i mentioned in my voice mail
cynthia sandherr's office should be getting in touch this afternoon with the addresses
forms of address
etc
the letters need to be hand delivered in dc on monday so they need to be fed exed to our dc office tonight
please call if you have any questions
thanks
mark
dan
how does this look
jason peters
x0
will be able to go with you
you might meet with him a bit ahead of time to fill him in on what you plan to do
this looks like and isda comparison to me
i'm not sure who is next on the list
sorry for the delay
this looks fine to me
what about a
personal best
award
jeff
carol
as you work through these issues
please remember that even though the mexico commercial group may not plan to offer many of their own products and may not expect many other products to appeal to their customers
the enrononline people will expect all products listed online to be available unless we can articulate a compelling reason to restrict them
mark
dave
here is the agreement i received from london which i have revised to apply to the chicago situation
let's consider this a rough draft at present
it does identify some interesting issues regarding how this will work
let's get together and go through it and see what we need and what we don't
let me know what time works for you
mark
craig
there was nothing attached to your e-mail so i assumed you were sending something by hard copy
we haven't received anything yet
mark
i was here
thanks for figuring this out
outside counsel reviewed enrononline content such as the faq
legal and privacy statement and anything else we were concerned might create the basis for an agreement regarding how the site was used
we reviewed everything else internally
i've never heard of these guys
not sure who this could have been meant for
will the reuters feed contain a time stamp
some other sites let you know what time the trade was done that resulted in the quote
we may have a problem with adding our own time stamp
first
i believe our agreement with reuters limits our ability to modify their content and restricts what we can say about the current nature of the quotes
they are time delayed
and second
we don't want our time stamp to make people believe that the quote was even current as of that time
since it won't be
it might be ok to have the entire quotes section headed by a line indicating when it was last refreshed
many sites providing quotes like this have a line
usually towards the bottom
indicating the delay period and most people using those sites know they have to refresh their screen to update them
jason peters is the expert on the terms of that agreement
so if you still feel like you need to add something you might check with him
fyi
paul
i think we handled this in phase i through the legal and privacy statement which is available through a link from each enrononline page
including the home page
if memory serves
the advice
including the language for the legal and privacy statement
came from clifford chance
justin will probably be able to fill you in on our thinking at the time
will that be sufficient for phase ii
we can revise the legal and privacy statement if that is necessary
mark
the enrononline guy responsible for the video is trying to get the contractor we used to get these guys to stop using our name
louise may want us to contact them if he is not successful
as long as the coal lawyers have approved the contract forms it looks good to me
this one came after the one you sent
which i commented on by voice mail
but is even worse
i hope it was an earlier draft rather than a later one
this sounds reasonable to me
any objections
either works for me
michele
just to let you know that i have approved the following for carol
0
in addition to the 0 weeks that enron allows for leave
carol will add to that period by using any remaining vacation time that she has for 0
i believe an additional 0-0 days
0
after that time is used up
carol will be on an unpaid leave of absence until december 0
0
please let me know if there is anything else you need
mark
let's stick with what we already have on order
is frank ready to start phase iii as soon as phase ii is done
attached is the story with my comments
0
i changed
standard
to
familiar
and deleted the reference to price discovery since these are elements of futures contracts
comparison to which we would like to avoid
if the price reference is important
transparency
would work as a replacement for
discovery
0
the changes to the last paragraph are to avoid the suggestion that the pa and reg
forms can be filled out online
they are available to be downloaded but must be signed and sent to us offline
thought you might be interested in this
do you know when they are building the walls around the cube we designated for janet moore
she is concerned
david
do you see any problems with a customer having the ability to chat with an enron representative online
mark
looks good to me
we should probably change enron north america corp
to
tana and i were unable to find anything useful here
david mitchell thought he might find something for us in his files and will send it to us but as he remembers it
we never got very far with the details
he probably just advised that if we ever did set up a cta that it should be completely separate
both in legal entity and staff
from our trading activities and should be chinese wall fenced as well
i'll send over whatever we receive from him and warned him that you might be calling
my comments
it's not clear to me what it means to say that joe hockey
joined
in the launch
end of first paragraph
they may be planning to update this just before release but the numbers in the fourth paragraph have increased
i think it's up to $0 bil
the word
values
should probably be
value
in the last line of the fourth paragraph
mark
will this only be available inside the house
answer
conde nast traveler mark e
taylor 0 rutland
as per john's request
the most recent news is that carol has been admitted to the hospital and is in labor
things are looking ok
i'll let you know if i hear anything new
do you have time to talk about the direct connection issues tomorrow
thursday
afternoon at 0:0 ny time
i also have some new issues regarding the need
or hopefully lack thereof
for written confirmations of online transactions which we can tee up then
on that basis i think we can go ahead without any trouble
do you want to take a stab at this
i'm happy to go over it with you if you are unsure
this looks fine to me
i would feel better without the big
e
on the screen since i wouldn't think you would want to give the impression that each of your trading floors was an enron office
here is the revised confirm
let's chat about the issues i mentioned in my voice mail
here is the confirm with the
out
built in
note that the no
out
version requires us to pay the premium on tuesday
the least we can do is pass this news along
is there anyone else we should tell
i think it's a good idea since the provisional application is on file
travis is the internal lawyer who has taken care of the patent application so he will have better ideas for where the words should be placed and appropriate look and feel
i would guess near the copyright notice and roughly equivalent size
does it make sense for us to set up a meeting with you participating from buenos aires
i'm not sure we have much to tell them at this stage
actually
i'm sure i don't have anything new to report but if you do that would be fine with me
fyi
if you need more
there is a proposal from the documentation committee for a new alternative for calculating termination amounts
we heard about it in amsterdam
that i think will be particularly attractive to the energy markets
i don't know where this stands officially
i haven't heard any developments since amsterdam
but i can find out from bob pickle if you want

thanks for the reminder
is there an hour or so tomorrow or friday that alan and i could claim to discuss the issues we teed up last week
numbers 0 and 0 still appear to be in the draft section
rick buy asked me to chat with sally beck about this and apologized for not having consulted with legal before submitting the report
he indicated that the results were not cast in stone and should not have been characterized
at least in connection with legal documentation
as mandates
sally has been out of the office but promised to call me this week once she had settled back in and explain the origins of these suggestions
our credit dept
normally handles the distribution of financial information to counterparties
tanya rohauer has agreed to look into this
thanks for all the docs
i'll store that in a folder until they make me clean out all my files again
what i really need
though is the current north america versions
which have changed since last september
does someone down there have a word version of the current eta and pa for na
there have not been any revisions to this version
if someone else needs to receive/review
please let me or leslie know
sorry about the delay
as i mentioned in my voice-mail
this needs to go somewhere that users might actually see it
e.g
a news ticker story
simply adding it to the legal
privacy statement
while helpful
is not sufficient
enrononline will assist users
upon request
in arranging for direct access connection
such as a
t0
line or other means of direct access
to enrononline
as an alternative to internet access
direct access connections might enable users to access enrononline more quickly than is currently possible through internet access
it turns out they're talking about something completely different
i can fill you in on it next time we get together
you're right
we have not agreed to the final sentence with any of our other counterparties
i doubt that the eol people will let us do it
though we can always ask
i have sometimes gotten counterparties comfortable with this issue by suggesting that the master user id and password should be held by someone in the back office
the control group or even the legal department so that when a trader leaves the master user can immediately shut them off
it seems to me that this puts the risk and responsibility for dealing with rogues where it belongs
why should we be at risk if one of their traders decides to damage the company
having said that
i think that even without the last sentence requested we are probably in that position
if we have actually received the notice and request for termination of the password and don't do it
it would be very hard to defend if we kept doing trades and they can show they weren't authorized
my back office suggestion is that the master user id and password be held by the back office
the master user has the ability to open and close sub-user
i.e
individual trader
user ids and passwords
so if a trader leaves
the back office master user can immediately turn off the user id for that trader
they can react much more quickly than we can and certainly faster than 0 days
i suppose the remaining risk there is that the back office person is the disgruntled employee
i'm not sure who diana is
do you know if someone has been in contact with the comex and has received their permission
the only changes were in the definition of floating price
otherwise this is the same as the
no-out
version we prepared last week
sally did not realize that the recommendations as drafted had referred to the master agreement process at all
she indicated that if she had noticed that she would have deleted the reference and will revise the recommendations to that effect now
the net result is that the only change regarding financial trading documentation will be to designate someone on the confirmation desk in calgary to handle derivatives confirmations
jeff sorensen will coordinate with peggy hedstrom
i will be leaving at noon on august 0
please add to the calendar
any chance you can help with this
yes
i think you are right
it depends on what we need it for
if it is just to get the counterparty's financials
the credit group has a form they can send out without legal review
if there is more to it than that
you may want to check with the paralegals and see what is in the current form bank
as we discussed
how do you feel about this
i believe i approved this yesterday
if further action is required
please let me know
simon
sorry about the delay
i know we subscribe to various information services from bloomberg and reuters
but i am not aware of any relationship we have with thomson financial
then again that's not too surprising
i suggest you talk to the people in investor relations and maybe the info central people who may have subscribed to such services
the only way i would have heard about them would be if they were to be used for enrononline or in the highly unlikely event that they had consulted me on the subscription contracts
please feel free to call if i can be of any other help

here is the fsa letter with my comments inserted in red
i have tried to make it a bit stronger by deleting references to our positions being merely
arguable
the language i deleted in the first part of 0.0 i thought was unnecessary and just point out doors that may remain open for the sfa
the language added in 0.0 was an attempt to show how much eeft does vs
is there a reason we are referring to net works rather than enrononline llc
it is also a delaware limited liability company
are we afraid it may have a i also wonder if the discussion of epol's involvement in 0.0 and 0.0 is really needed since the eta is entered into on eeft's behalf
if this has not yet been raised by the sfa
it doesn't seem necessary to flag it for them
my position would be that eeft is a party to that agreement whenever it is necessary in connection with an investment
mark
is it safe to assume that a uk entity will be the enron party for all of these transactions
thanks to the dc team
well done
i have received a bill from leboeuf for work done in june on the ace insurance matter for a bit over $0,0
this included around 0 hours by pb wright
$0,0
and 0 hours by sd avitabile
$0,0
does that sound right to you
i have to allocate this to the business units
should it all go to east power trading
please add sara shackleton

i'm sorry i've been so hard to get ahold of lately
will you be available this afternoon
say around 0:0 or 0:0
i'm pretty well booked until then

sorry about that

do you know whether we have acquired any companies with cftc registrations of any kind
e.g
commodity trading advisor or futures commission merchant
i was wondering who was responsible for compliance matters if we have

it's usually over by noon on friday
travis could probably let you know for sure
that works for me
i saw this on the internet
thought i'd pass it along
eating fish does contribute to your intelligence
particularly before and just after you're born
a researcher at the university of connecticut has found that some fish are high in a certain chemical that's vital to brain and nerve cell growth in fetuses and newborns
babies can't make enough docahexanoic
or dha
a fatty acid that helps the brain develop
they must take whatever their mothers give them
either through the umbilical cord or by breast-feeding after they're born
and note that baby formula isn't fortified with dha
women who eat cold-water species
like salmon
trout
sardines and tuna
give their babies a better chance at maximizing brain tissue development
the research found
other fish high in the chemical are herring
swordfish and mackerel
it would be nice if they could give us a counterparty name
i've never heard of jerry peskuchi
did you get this
i didn't see your name on the addressee list
taffy
could you please reply
coordinate with the relevant people
travis
in phase i we had the copyright notice on every page
can we get away with having it only on the home page
is this ok with you
fyi
it looks like phase ii of our construction project
over where julia's office used to be
will be finished on the 0th so she will be moving into her new office that weekend
i now have the plans for phase iii and it turns out your office will be included in the construction area
phase iii will probably start on the 0th
that could always slip but i wanted to give you as much notice as possible
hope you are all doing well
getting any sleep yet
yes
please go ahead and forward a copy to ed
i don't think mark holsworth needs to be involved in this one
unfortunately
i don't know of anything directly on point other than the agreement we negotiated the last time
i guess justin coordinated that
i don't remember reading it
this may be pertinent
looks like justin has already contacted s&c
the whole schedule has yet to be determined
i'm still waiting for final seating charts from the other groups so i can figure out how to most efficiently get people moved into their new homes
we'll let you know as soon as possible
my only concern is the 0 hours out of date reference
as of when
it might not be 0 hours old when they go to press so do we mean when it is being read
would it hurt to say something to the effect of
by the time you read this
as a lead in
are we sure that even this is accurate
how long from press run til the first copy hits the street
that works for me
i spoke with stacey carey today after the isda call
i reiterated that we have been willing to support the process so far on the understanding that we would prefer a bill that gives us parity with financial products and
failing that
the minimum we can accept is a bill which exempts
preferably excludes
energy commodities and hopefully metals from the act
she confirmed that isda will continue to push for the exemption or exclusion
the comments from treasury to chris long recently underscore that our
phil graham card
to the extent we have one
is a significant political strength for us and we should not play the card until we need to
stacey agreed with a statement made by don moorehead on this morning's call that graham will not start to move in the process until the house has produced a viable bill
given that we should probably not seek his help until a bit later in the process
possibly mid september
fyi
thanks for your note and glad to hear you're feeling better
yes we are all very sad about jim's baby
many years ago my sister had a child who was born two or three months early and lived for several days
long enough to be held and loved
but his lungs were apparently just not developed enough and they couldn't save him
i know how painful that was for them
and i have to admit that experience made me very anxious when things didn't go perfectly for you guys that first few days
i received papers from julia regarding your options a week or so ago which i didn't send along because the next day julia said hr had made a mistake in everybody's package and hr was sending replacement documents
i haven't received the replacements yet but will ask
stephanie has started and seems to be fitting in as far as i can tell at this stage
we're all super busy but more or less keeping up with the critical stuff
we'll look forward to seeing you soon
any progress on the enrononline front
i'm getting questions from the eol team in houston as to our time estimate to completion and wondered if you had heard back from outside counsel
john
in case you need this right away
i've made a few changes below and this is probably adequate
if you have a little more time
i can polish it up a bit tomorrow
just let me know
please remove me from your distribution list
my comments are included
in section 0 only
i talked to kathy
gave her some basic advice to relay on the subject and told her that if alcoa has further questions they can call me
one issue for you
do you know whether or not we have a power master of some kind with alcoa and did we need to send them an override letter
don't forget my half-day on august 0
i had a lengthy conference call with a bunch of milbank lawyers this afternoon to educate them on the enrononline structure
i received the attached message this evening

thanks for your help
mark
elaine
please coordinate with the legal department in london on these issues
they are familiar with arranging for enron corp
guaranties
mark
thanks for dealing with tana on these issues
it is not entirely clear to me what you want the policy to be regarding which counterparties have access to australian power products
you probably already know that the enrononline people want every counterparty everywhere in the world to have access to every product unless credit or legal can justify restricting their access
credit already performs a financial test on each counterparty to determine if they meet the cftc eligible swap participant requirements
unfortunately
that test is not as restrictive as the australian tangible assets test
it sounds like there should be a us$0 million tangible assets test applied by credit before we give any counterparty access to australian power
this would be a total pain but certainly possible
on the other hand
if you feel comfortable giving access to non-australian counterparties without that test being performed
we can do that
too
pleas let me know if we should ask credit to start performing this test on all counterparties or if it should be limited to australian entities
congratulations
we'll have to chat soon
this is the message i received
i note that it doesn't give any instructions on how to access the site
seems to me a hyperlink would be appropriate
i have now registered but have not yet entered my key to gain access to the deal
let's get together
discuss early next week
the revised draft looks good to me
congratulations jeff
and great pictures
big brother looks a bit happier than the last time i saw him
mark
we should probably start thinking about an agenda for this meeting if only so that we can determine appropriate attendees and get it on their calendars

hey guys
welcome home
at least i assume you're home by now
how was the trip
i heard a bit about the departure but with any luck it must have gotten better
any hope you took digital pictures
i have already told linda but i wanted you both to know how great i thought your wedding was
there is no doubt in my mind that it was the most special
beautiful
fun wedding i've ever been to
magical doesn't seem like too strong a word
thank you very much for letting me be part of it
it's been about 0 years since i had been to that part of the world
it's easy to see why you enjoy it so much
i was serious about sailing in the caribbean at thanksgiving
if you are still interested
we really need to start planning right away
i tentatively booked a boat but the real difficulty may be in finding flights
it is a busy travel season
just let me know
mark
this was one of your competitors
at least from the legal side
that we looked at briefly about a year ago
glad to hear the rest of your trip went well
the
normal
sailing trip is a week but that's not cast in stone
in an effort to maximize days sailing and minimize days of vacation taken we usually fly down on a saturday arriving in the afternoon or eve
pick up the boat on sunday
you get the boat around noon
and bring it back the following sunday
by noon
take a shower and head straight for the airport
because of the way the flight schedules work it's usually not possible to leave after work on a friday and make it all of the way down there
you could do a shorter trip
of course
but i never have
i've gone for longer
we did a 0 day one-way sail from st
lucia down to the southern end of grenada
stopping in bequia and mustique
among others
along the way
but that's a pretty long trip and certainly not necessary
most of the charter fleets are based where there is plenty to do right in the area for a week
one of the reasons for aiming at thanksgiving was to reduce the total number of vacation days spent
i get both thurs
fri off so i only have to spend 0 days to get a whole week
i understand the gov't may not be so generous
i haven't taken all of my days this year so i can always carry some over to 0 if that works better for you guys
my views on when to go
january
march very fun since you will be sick of winter
very popular so a lot more crowded
harder to find a place to anchor for the night and have to make arrangements farther ahead
everything is open for business
high season rates
april
may less crowded
unless easter or spring breaks are late
shoulder season rates
june
august no crowds
you may have some anchorages to yourself
many places are closed for the season
think beach bars and meals on shore
low rates
september
october see june-august and add in highest risk of hurricanes
my guess is that people who planned their trips to the bvi for this week aren't having much fun right now but they got great deals and the moorings will probably give them a refund
i've chartered during this period several times and had a blast
one time a tropical storm came through and we stayed on the boat in port
i still get mileage out of the stories
you just have to be willing to live with the risk that it may not go according to plan
not seriously dangerous
though
you're always within easy reach of the base
if a bad one threatens you just take the boat back and let them deal with it
november
december hurricane threat drops dramatically
crowds pick up around christmas
everything opens up again
rates start to go up again
bottom line
i love the trips so much it doesn't matter what time of year
just let me know what works best for you guys
keep in mind that you do have to make arrangements at least 0 months in advance
more is better
to make sure you get flights and the boat that you want
one last thought
it is possible for the main group to pick up the boat on schedule and arrange to be near the airport on a later day in the trip to pick someone up
this is definitely suboptimal
you learn a lot about the boat and the sailing area from the briefings the charter company gives you at the start and it limits flexibility to have to be by the airport on a certain day when you might rather have the boat at the other end of the island chain or wherever
i'd rather put the whole thing off until we can all go at once but if it's the only way
at least it's an option
mark
i'm not sure what your question is
the purpose is so they can see the site
laura
i'm just a lawyer and as such still operating pretty much in the stone age
the easiest way for me to look at something that is primarily text
minimal graphics involved
is to have it in a form i can just print out
if it exists as a word document that would be great
i have not yet actually been able to see the phase 0 site
thanks
mark
i didn't think we were confirming transactions between books
but maybe this is a first that crossed company lines
i would think we would confirm it through rmt as one ena rmt trade and another rmt epmi trade
i'm assuming that the reference to epmi long term hedge is an enrononline reference to one of the epmi trading desks and therefore it should be done as an epmi trade
dear john
so sorry for the delay
i hope it hasn't caused too much inconvenience
i would have called to apologize in person but believe it or not i don't have your phone number
here are my comments to the draft documents you sent
part 0
b
in our other derivatives trading
the cross default test applies to enron corp
with a threshold of us$0,0,0
to accomplish this in the schedule
threshold amount for the enron party would apply to our credit support provider if there is going to be an enron corp
guaranty and the dollar figure adjusted accordingly
part 0
d
has baker
mckenzie recommended this
we rely on local counsel advice for this provision but our preference is that the termination in a bankruptcy context not be automatic unless it needs to be
the risk in the automatic situation is that the market moves significantly before we are even aware of the situation
i.e
the outstanding transactions terminate automatically
leaving us with an open
unhedged position which we are not able to protect since we are not aware of it
in the u.s
the bankruptcy code allows us to terminate after the filing of a bankruptcy according to the terms of the agreement so we know exactly the time to rehedge
part 0
e
we usually choose loss here as the method which gives the non-defaulting party the most flexibility
market quotation is often suggested because of its apparent objective nature
however
in many of the markets where we operate
quotations will not be available
where they are available they may well not be meaningful
and the loss method gives flexibility
while still requiring commercial reasonableness
part 0
h
ix
this additional event of default only applies when there is no collateral annex
when we have the ability to ask for
or be asked for
collateral in the case of a downgrading
we build that event into the paragraph 0 to trigger a reduction of the threshold to zero which requires the posting of collateral to cover any open position
if the party fails
it then becomes a default allowing termination
part 0
h
x
wouldn't the cross default be triggered before this could happen
part 0 have our internal tax people approved this
part 0 i am not familiar with the representative director concept or some of the corporate documents referred to
since enron corp
will be a credit support provider
does it have a representative director
etc
the legal opinion requirement is one that we can waive if local counsel does not think it necessary
in many non-us jurisdictions
local counsel have advised that an opinion be obtained
in some cases derivatives transactions are so uncommon that they might be outside the ordinary course of business and therefore require special board approval
in others
derivatives would not be permissible activities for a company unless express provision is made in the corporate documents
etc
part 0
b
g
h
these representations originate with cftc rules in mind
although they may be helpful for other reasons as well
if neither party is in the us
the cftc reason may go away
on the other hand
since we are choosing new york law to apply the argument might be made that us federal law applies as well
if that is our theory
there are additional representations
the eligible swap participant reps
that we should think about putting back in
part 0
d
we are currently evaluating whether we should revise this section to make reference to the isda 0 definitions
while i think we will get there
we haven't actually made the decision yet
so far i guess we leave it the way it is
part 0
j
my only concern here is with the value of the enron corp
guaranty as a form for a guaranty from a japanese entity
any differences in japan from us practice we should be worried about
paragraph 0 i have to admit i'm not as familiar with the paragraph 0 provisions as the schedule
my only concern here is with the mac clause and it looks like there's a glitch in the form
it seems to me that if the counterparty is only rated by one of the 0 major agencies we shouldn't be pegged with a mac if only one of our agencies stops rating us
the way it is drafted now if either s&p or moody's stops rating us
even if the remaining rating is very high we will have a mac occur
the counterparty doesn't have to worry about moody's at all
just a thought
on the guaranty
you will need to run the choice of law and jurisdiction changes past clement abrams at corp
legal
my only comment is that we would usually have a cap that is a bit higher
in this case maybe an extra $0,0,0
than the threshold in the csa
that gives the counterparty a little wiggle room if we fail to post collateral after the threshold is exceeded
tana is preparing a red-line for me that hopefully will show all of the changes between the us form and the japan form
i may have a few more comments after i see how that comes out but don't expect many
i hope this is helpful
please feel free to call and we can walk through these over the phone if that would be useful
we should also talk about the most efficient way to prepare these going forward
it might make sense for credit to send their worksheets to the paralegals here for a first draft which would then go to you for review before going to the counterparty
it may slow things down by a day or two but it would free you up to work on other things
we're looking forward to having you back
dave
my comments are below in red
i'm assuming that
end of the day
is the end of the trading day
but this seems a bit ambiguous since the trader in japan may be thinking about a different
day
than the trader in london
etc
will the orders be cancelled if our trader removes a product during the day and then reactivates it

thanks
these are mine
the commercial guys have asked me for an update on where we stand with bp
any news
i sent amanda
bill an e-mail a couple of weeks ago and here is bill's reply
i sent him a fairly detailed note on how we usually schedule things and which were the best times of year
etc
i haven't heard anything from amanda and was beginning to assume they were not really interested in a november trip
have you heard anything firm from virginia
bill's next-to-last paragraph tells me that he's getting to know amanda
but i don't think she'll leave him alone for the holiday
the real question is whether her uncanny ability will extend to his schedule
too
if they still want to go we'd better make travel plans soon
that thanksgiving sunday is notoriously difficult to get seats
if you'd rather wait until jan
or feb
that's fine with me too
just let me know
i have no idea since i never read the original
i just thought it was an interesting approach to take when making a modification
i don't think i have any problems with this presentation
but can you give me an idea of the proposed audience
wow
too many choices
let's see
the day of the week charters start and end is not fixed
except that the boat has to be available on the days you want it
we usually went sunday to sunday so we could get 0 weekends in and use the saturday as a day to fly down
it's much harder to get there from houston than nyc
fewer flights
so it pretty much takes all day to get there
the 0rd
0th is a friday through wed
not optimal from the weekend point of view but doable i suppose
it just means a 0 day instead of 0 day charter
if you want to wait until thanksgiving we could certainly manage with the 0 of us
particularly if we got one of the smaller boats
and it might make sense to go back to the bvi where we know the sailing won't be all that challenging
i hear the st
martin area can get rougher
plan b sounds like fun too
and then we could all go together later
it seems mean to go without bill
new years sounds like a blast to me
what would you think about heading down the friday or saturday before
0/0 or 0
and spending the first week of january there
that assumes bill can get that week off and amanda doesn't have to be back in school til later
i have a couple of sailing friends here that might like to go then too if you're interested in a slightly larger group
they're a lot of fun
good cooks and reasonable sailors too
we were working on brazil
andrea bertone in sao paolo was heading it up
but i think they have stopped for now
i'll look for her latest e-mail and forward it to you
the others are all new
tana can give you the form of local counsel survey we have been using if you want it
i haven't read this yet
here is the confirm with my revisions
please discard the version i sent a few minutes ago
here is a clean copy with one additional change and a marked copy to show all of the changes from the original
can you let me know who at bp in london is holding things up
larry gagliardi here in houston has asked so he can give the name to his counterpart in the us
nice try
but no
first choice
new years if bill
amanda can get the first week of 0 off
second choice
another time
i guess in 0
when everybody can be there
third choice
the week of thanksgiving
i guess i would prefer not to go for a long weekend because it takes me so long to get there
although the thanksgiving weekend is pretty long
might work if nothing else does
i had a brief conversation this morning with john suttle
credit
and itlooks like he's going to insist on the csa
we are going to talk tomorrowand go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments
while we have documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a master agreement
the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy
manyof these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have trouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents
it would behelpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a following are my points responsive to their revisions
part 0
a
the addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding thepossible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes
for example
this would mean that if any enron affiliate went into bankruptcythis agreement would be in default
g
this provision provides additional flexibility without any credit riskto the other party
it should remain in place unless ibj can articulate areason to remove it
part 0 the language inserted is much to vague
our original version spellsout exactly what is expected of the parties
if the documents we listed arnot acceptable
ibj should tell us now what would be acceptable and if weagree we will put it in the agreement
part 0
f
by deleting the word
not
in this provision
ibj is saying thapayments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne
i.e
if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating
we each have tomake the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to opayment
this is not acceptable
h
if ibj will use their ny branch as agent
we should use enron corp or epart 0
a
our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to receive payments due even though technically in default under another provision of the agreement
our position is that if there are no other possible payment requirements due from the purchaser
the option should behonored
c
the section we delete requires that the market makers be in the samecity
for many markets in which we participate
it is very difficult
if nimpossible
to find multiple market makers in the same city
e
the change to 0 business days is much too long
this means we can nohave certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks
we can goas high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market practice
g
their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed tmultiple enron companies if they default and only allows set-off with eachibj branch as a separate entity
this may not be an issue if we will nevertrade or otherwise transact with them in any other enron company and if wewill never do business with any other branch of ibj
we usually don't liketo restrict ourselves that way
i
we absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions
ifthere is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it buwholesale deletion is out of the question
j
as with part 0
g
this section adds flexibility to both parties whilemaintaining flexibility within the corporate family
given the frequencywith which enron moves businesses around within the family
this section isimportant to us
k
this section results from an experience we had with a counterparty thawent into bankruptcy
and therefore default
while they were in the money
we disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement
without orevision
we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds
a rathehigh rate given their status as a bankrupt
we feel the non-default rate imore appropriate
m
i can't imagine why they wouldn't want this section included
it protects us both
n
you know more about this than i
part 0 these are all important issues for us and we can discuss them individually if they object for some articulated reason
if these provisioare not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation
asignificant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it
and we need to know now if they object to any of them
other revisions that they have made are acceptable unless credit objects
i hope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long
i'm happy to discusany of these issues at greater length if you want
it sounds to me like ibj's expectations regarding execution of documents are a bit high given thvolume and nature of their comments

ibj isda master agreement john i have just had ibj on the phone again asking for a progress report on theisda docs
have we managed to move this forward
bearing in mind labour dasince he is very keen to commence trading on monday next
he suggested thahe would be comfortable in trading prior to the implementation of the docsfor these initial trades as per jonathon's previous comments in past mails.are we comfortable doing this if we cannot resolve the issues on the docs
they are also very keen to see the draft confirms for the proposed trade
steve
i have just heard from rob in the vid conf that the proposed volumemay prove difficult to take on the books
please advise as to our capability so that i can convey this to him in the morning
best regards tom
agreed
good catch
ny law should apply throughout the americas and in japan
we used uk law in europe and singapore on the theory the counterparties there would be more comfortable with uk law
i'm not sure which the australians would prefer

the latest pa is online
i have printed out a copy of the current version and sent it to alan

do they have to click on it before it will go away or does it appear in a pop-up box that has to be acknowledged
approved
is this something you are working on
go for it
that is shaping up to be the kind of day we may cancel the group meeting any way
my first day back after vacation and everybody trying to get lots done so we can get away to the woodlands
be sure to let taffy know so she can put it on the calendar
i'm not sure if you handle nymex margin issues or not
welcome back
looks like bp has finally signed
as i understand it
this should open the way to get them signed up in the u.s
just fyi
i think the enrononline decision was to leave the user id off of the password application as a security measure
the user id is sent separately
i think in a security envelope
so that the user id and password are never written down in the same place
and of course the system requires that the password be changed the first time the new user logs on so the enron file copy of the pa won't give access to a user's valid password
approved

works for me but i hate to put it off so long so my preference is to try for new years and fall back on early november as a second choice
if you want to go for less than a week now and a full week in 0 when bill can go we can do that
too
what are you guys thinking
since we won't be going at thanksgiving
how are you going to talk your mom into dealing with the holiday

as the office construction process continues
your offices will be among the next to be demolished
reconstructed
while the current timetable is not firm
it looks like your moves will be scheduled sometime between the 0th to the 0th of october
this means the move may take place during the ena offsite
i just wanted to give you as much warning as possible so you could begin the packing process
joya davis will have details of your new
in some cases temporary
office locations
can help with obtaining boxes and will schedule the actual move
your new offices will be ready in a week or so
we anticipate your moves will take place over the weekend of september 0
joy davis will coordinate your moves and can help with obtaining boxes

thanks for all of the recent forwarded messages
they have all been mine
sorry for not getting back to you sooner but i've been out of town
any hope of a time for lisa
please get in touch with her and let her know the situation
these don't look complete to me
e.g
contractual currency
index definition
volume reference
thanks for the note
i'll be there
did you have a chance to talk to lisa
sheri
i don't remember being consulted about sending these documents by e-mail
but that doesn't mean it didn't happen
just that i don't remember it
it sounds like a valid concern
any reason we can't just send people to the web site and ask them to print out the relevant pa
mark
just wanted to make sure you had this
looks good to me
please call this person and let them know i am not going
please order a flat screen monitor for me
thanks for your note
your e-mail trouble is due to the spelling of tana's name
should only be one

i am forwarding this on to her
mark
all of these should now use enrononline
not ena
justin
do you know what other business mg london inc
is or anticipates doing with these same counterparties
it may make a difference if they are acting for these customers as an fcm
mark
probably should add mark evans for london generally
matt lee for singapore
we should get together with the right tax person/people
maybe jeff can figure this out
janette
here is the report with my changes
i have not been able to find travis or anne to see what changes if any they would like to add but will let you know when i hear from them
mark t
i'd be happy to take them if they're available
mike
i have trouble getting some of the e-mails sent to me from buenos aires but not all
i received this one from you today
one on the 0th and one on sept
if the internal address doesn't seem to work
you should probably use mark
greg
here is the eta version in my directory
i think a few minor changes may have been made
e.g
enrononline llc is now the enron party
and the definitive version is on the website
you can access it there if you have a guest user id
if you need an id
just let me know and we'll have the eol people issue one for you
i'm also attaching an early version of the password application
current versions also online and accessible even without an id
since it may cover a few issues not addressed in the eta
i usually think of the two pieces as one agreement
mark
looks good to me
sorry i've been so hard to get ahold of
mark
sorry about that
the request came while i was out of town and i missed it
have now approved
i will be in the office all week
how about 0:0 a.m
houston time on thursday
mark
greg
here are my comments to the first of the long descriptions
i was afraid i might be missing something about the way you guys do these deals in canada so i thought i would run this one by you first to make sure i had the concepts right before i tackle the rest of them
thanks
mark
oops
forgot the attachment
can you reply to justin
let him know where we stand
initial thoughts
can we use enron australia as the counterparty to avoid these issues for now
and then when a book has been established assign all the positions to enron japan
can we get
or maybe give
the rep if we soften it a bit by taking out the word
ordinary
or maybe the entire phrase
in the ordinary course of its business
is there a government agency that can give us an opinion or
no action
type of letter to give us some comfort that we are ok
it may not be quick enough to get us through this trade but it might open the door for future business
if the end result is that there is no adequate fix and local counsel advises that we are taking significant potential criminal liability
i would think that both parties would be willing to agree to unwind the trade
if necessary
my suggestion would be to raise the potential for criminal sanctions issue to mark h
what are the potential sanctions
brent
does this mean tana should not allow any non-argentine customers to have access to these products
the general rule has been to allow complete access unless there was a legal impediment
logic regarding who will want to trade what doesn't seem to enter into it
let's be sure to keep this in mind as we do future resolutions
here is the confirm template
used when an isda master is in place
this is the index language for enrononline
we would use something similar for the offline confirms
i got your voice mail and agree with the strategy of meeting with the senator's staff before sending the letter
it would be embarrassing to suggest that we don't have a view on issues that should be important to us
re
the letter itself
if you want to make it even stronger
you could point out in your discussion of enrononline that we believe that the site could have been designed such that the volume of business through the site would have been significantly larger but for the uncertainty and restrictions in existing law and regulation which would be corrected by the bill
here are my revisions
let me know if you have any questions
you can remove me from the distribution list
thanks for the resume
i'm looking at a number of internal candidates from apachi
calme and southern cone but will keep this one on file
and pass it along
might be good for richard sanders
my impression is that this now being handled in global finance
you might try jordan mintz or gareth bahlmann
here's the financial trading piece
i may not have all of the formats quite right
just a couple of minor changes
what is the last sentence about
thanks dale
looks good to me
yes
i'll take the call
this one should go to the crude traders
mark haedicke has asked me to submit a list of our
top ten legal risks
please let me know of anything you think should be included in the list
fyi
yes
thanks
yes
as i understand it
stephanie and tana will be out that week but samantha and susan will be here
i have volunteered for nov 0/0
here it is
my answers below in red
the confirm form is one of the many current templates used by the confirm desk depending on the specific transaction type and the counterparty
for instance
this template is not the used for a swap
e.g
not a cap
floor
collar or swaption
and would not be used even for a plain vanilla swap if the customer had not signed an isda master agreement
the index language can be used in a variety of contexts but again depends on exactly which type of trade you are doing
but i thought you guys had decided to use the first price published in the following month rather than the average of the entire month language attached so this may not be the final version
unfortunately euromoney is no longer offering their courses
they were by far the best around and it's a real shame
there is a pli course being offered in ny in mid november
at which i'm speaking on commodity derivatives
and isda has a conference in london on collateral arrangements and the isda credit support documents
neither is anywhere near as good as the old euromoney courses but both would probably benefit jane
yep
thanks
dale
better check your address book
this one went to the other mark taylor
i'm not sure if you guys are on this mail list but here is the most recent message from stacey at isda
agreed
can you please confirm directly with erica that tax has no problem with enron credit.com contracts being signed in the us
please print this out and put a copy in our file for colombian trading
tana may know where that should be
please print these out for me
create a file for them called enrononline pipeline capacity and bring it to me
thank you
i have confirmed with mark holsworth that he is the right guy for this
he has a form agreement that enron uses for these situations
would you guys please take a look at this and let me know if i can approve it in the system
thanks
yes
i think that's the idea
you may need to monitor and advise

sami
apologies for not getting back to you
it's been a crazy week or two
can we talk early next week
works for me
i won't be able to be on the 0:0 call this morning
i have given elizabeth a copy of the
omnibus
document we probably used if the put options sold to puget sound were derivatives and described the arguments we could make that the imposition of the proposed price cap would be a market disruption event
if it is a market disruption event the most likely outcome under the contract
since it will last more than 0 days and we presumably will not be able to negotiate an agreed price
is that
the floating price shall be determined in good faith by ena
by taking the average of two or more dealer quotes
i'm not sure what dealer quotes would get us under these circumstances
can dealers quote prices in excess of the price cap
just a few changes below
janette
this may be more than you were looking for
let me know if you want me to pare it down a bit
i assume we will have the opportunity to revise these as time goes on

new hires for the group
new internal lawyers for the group
office space issues
i haven't wanted to bother you at home but things are definitely moving around here
as usual i guess
mark
i enjoyed it too
actually it's just as well that i was carted off when i was
i was sound asleep by 0:0 and still feel the affects
it looks to me like another case of an obvious error
i.e
the counterparty should have known it was a mistake
i'm afraid we've just been lucky that the numbers have been so far off
some day we're going to have one that is too close to call obvious

please use the pep system on your computer to suggest reviewers by the end of the day tomorrow at the latest

if you have any questions or are having trouble accessing the system
please let me know
here is the meh e-mail i mentioned
my comments are marked on the attached
bob didn't make it to the meeting but did leave a voice mail suggesting that rather than creating a separate gtc for the brokers we refer to the gtcs already online for regular customers and have them agree to be responsible for the liquidated damages that would be calculated under those terms if the deal falls through
thanks david
these are fine
thanks for your concern but please don't worry about it
i was able to get a lot accomplished since i was already here and the phones weren't ringing so it was a productive morning for me in any event
i don't think i'm available for any of the remaining saturdays this year but i'll give it another shot next time
greg
looks good to me on the legal procedures
my only comments would be
i
that i'm not sure that the confirm desk generates deal tickets
i thought they were prepared by the commercial guys
and
ii
we usually don't have the commercial guys sign confirms as a control matter
even when it's an unusual matter
i agree about tana
mark
yes
i was on the call
nothing has changed
we are looking forward to having you work with us as soon as possible and to the extent possible within your other constraints
this issue was much easier when all we traded were energy commodities
interest rates and currencies
the older versions of the policy provided that no enron employee may trade any energy commodity for the account of anyoneother than enron
beyond that
no enron employee could trade a commoditywhich was within their area of responsibility
for example
i was not permitted to trade natural gas futures for my own account but
since interest rates and currencies are not within my area of responsibility
i could tradthem
as the scope of our trading activities expanded it became more difficult to identify the scope of the company's concern
much less to articulate it
we did however take a stab at it and the result is below
this may be an area which could stand some clarification in the next versioof the policy
for now
i would suggest that the term
security
highlighted below should be read to include equities and therefore not one of the commodities covered ithe second numbered clause
i.e
the word
other
refers to items other thathose listed in clause
i
the result is that an enron employee who doesnot trade financial instruments
securities
financial assets or liabilitiefor enron may trade them for his or her own personal account
to take this a step further
one could argue that an employee who trades the equities ofenergy companies for enron should not trade energy company equities for hisor her own account but could trade other equities
if it were me
i wouldcertainly make sure that ted murphy agreed with my analysis before i did itof course
a wide variety of commodities remain clearly off limits for personal trading
metals
ag commodities
bandwidth
freight
lumber
amonmany others
for all employees
as i remember it
this was done purposelyand if anyone disagrees with the scope of the policy they would be wise todiscuss the matter with the rac group as they make suggestions for policyrevisions to the enron corp
board
employee trading
no employee of any enron business unit may engage in thetrading of any position for the benefit of any party other than an enron business unit
whether for their own account or for the account of any thirparty
where such position relates to

securitfinancial asset or liability which falls within such employee,s responsibility at an enron business unit or

any idea who the target market is in hk
if we have specific customers in mind
would it be possible to approach them directly rather than making the password application generally available
it's not clear to me that even that would solve the problem since there would still be some targeted hk residents
just not the public
wednesday morning is the only time i will be in the office all week and is already fully booked
will you be in san antonia later
maybe we can meet then
i'm staying at the peninsula 0-0
i can't stay out late tonight because my talk is in the morning
what about lunch tomorrow
the system won't let me connect to approve your reviewers from outside the office
i'll do it first thing wednesday morning but since they'll only have 0 days left to fill out the forms at that point

my flight is co0 from houston intercontinental airport arriving at 0:0 wednesday night
operated by continental express
i don't like to take those smaller planes but at least this one is a jet and is a non-stop flight

since the construction isn't scheduled to be complete until 0/0 i wouldn't think we'd need it until the 0th

the legal assistants

let me know what you think
the changes are marked in blue
here is the beta with our initial comments
as we discussed a couple of weeks ago
can one of you guys handle this in stacy's absence
does this raise uncertainty for products offered by non-banks
this looks ok to me
these look ok to me
fyi
peter
here is our first attempt at enrononline long description language for the double transaction calendar spread product
we had to guess at several aspects
please let me know if we got close
mark
thanks so much for the christmas present
everyone is enjoying it very much
bob bruce's first reaction was
wow
i hope this isn't in lieu of her ever coming back
so now it's clear
i thought i'd send this around just as a reminder of the rmt guidelines
as far as i know these have not changed since rhett's memo last year
approved
thanks for your notes
just so you know
i have the polo sport perfume and a victoria's secret gift certificate for emily
were there lists for you and dad
i can't seem to find them
my feeling is we stand by our confirmation
what do you think
maybe we can chat about this first draft this afternoon
with my revisions
this confirmation should have the regular omnibus annex a attached as well as the additional chilean annex which tana forwarded last week
please call me if you have any questions
mark
in case you haven't already looked at the fee agreement draft
here is a slightly revised version
also attached is a revised beta
the changes marked in the beta are a combination of the commercial guy's comments and my revisions of those comments
hopefully marked separately
unfortunately i didn't get the changes in the fee agreement marked
bob
our issues with hedge funds are somewhat complicated
the threshold issue is that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents
the prospectus will spell out what they can invest in
so we have to review those documents before trading
that is more than we do for run-of-the-mill domestic corporates and takes a lot of legal resources that so far have been spent elsewhere
the other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates to regulatory uncertainty
about a year ago a major hedge fund
long term capital
got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in
orchestrating a bail-out
there was much wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth in washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of messages coming out of washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge funds
none of them good
our view is that the regulators will be paying much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past and we don't want that spotlight shining on us
in case you're interested
notwithstanding their name
hedge funds are speculators
much of the federal regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging
as opposed to speculation
was safer and therefore more palatable
the failure of a large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the financial markets
hence the regulators
heightened scrutiny
for both of these reasons
when enrononline was launched it was with the internally stated policy that we would not give access to hedge funds
or individuals
for similar reasons
commodity trading advisors can not trade on enrononline on behalf of their customers just as brokers cannot
mark
hi debbie
thanks for your note
it's always nice to hear from mc friends
i'm living in houston and working in the legal department of a large energy company
enron
i have two main areas of focus
derivatives trading
swaps
options
etc
which i've been doing for over 0 years now and e-commerce which is relatively new
the most fun work project i've had was being the lead lawyer in designing and launching our internet commodity trading platform about a year ago
it has been tremendously successful
while few people have ever heard of it
it is the largest
by dollar volume
website in the world
i keep in touch with mark kopinski who is managing a couple of international mutual funds in new york
my work takes me there several times a year and i usually try to see him if i have some free time
the college is thinking about another capital campaign and he and i were on a preliminary planning committee
to see if a campaign makes sense
ralph v
was there
whom i hadn't seen in years
and of course i keep in touch with doc
too
i was on campus for my 0th reunion a couple of years ago
there were only 0 of us from
0 so it wasn't as much fun as i'd hoped but it was still good to see familiar faculty faces
with luck the 0th will draw a bigger crowd
my midwest geography isn't what it once was but it sounds like you've got a terrible commute
i hope you're liking your work to justify the drive
i rarely make it back to chicago but let's keep in touch and definitely let me know if you ever make it down this way
mark
sure
it's not secret
generally speaking we have only documented that kind of concern when there were separate legal entities involved
like getting a comfort letter or guaranty from ei when ect had to do the swap for one of their deals
i think we can get away with pointing out the issue to both commercial sides
did you get this
peter
should tana add you to her list of people who get the daily enrononline customer list
she sends it out to several lawyers to see if there is any reason not to give access to the system
mark
thanks for the e-mail
i tried to go in and update my info but the system is down and will be down all weekend
is monday early enough
thanks for the number
i did not get the cooking set for elena
i ordered the bongo drum
i spoke with justin briefly this morning
he wants to look into this and get back to me
thanks
thanks
i've asked sara to give him a call now
too

i think we were ok with the base language
it was just those last issues we were waiting on
why don't you come in saturday night
i'll take you to dinner
i did get janet the white top
interlock turtleneck
medium
color
white #a0
from talbots
it was the fleece vest that they didn't have in the stores
i did not get the towels
glad the computer is working better for you
it makes all the difference in the world to have it speed up
for me it actually becomes more useful since i cant stand just sitting there staring at it waiting for something to happen
my paperwhites haven't bloomed yet
i do remember from the last time i grew some that the fragrance can be almost overpowering
i wonder if people grow them outdoors when the weather warms up
the smell might work better with more room to disperse
this time i have six coming up all at once
i hope i can stand it
love
mark
that's fine
we don't keep particularly careful track of these things but pretty much estimate the percentages on a quarterly basis
just so you can see what is happening
looks good to me
do you know if enron is trying to have any input in the selection process
i think this will do for now
thanks
sounds good to me
i can't believe you have to change planes in chicago and dallas
i don't remember you being that willing to suffer for a cheaper ticket
bummer
looks like i'll just have to be the wimp this time
there's really no way i can get away next week
i have heard of las ventanas
but i didn't know about the evian spritzing
maybe next time
any more thoughts on a week that works for sailing
i could spring for a bottle of evian and a plant mister
that's a great idea
i'll see if i can line up a boat
anywhere in particular you'd like to sail
bvi makes sense if there's a newcomer along
where do you fly into to get to charlottesville
i'll definitely take the room
how
and when
do you plan to get there
do you rent a car in dc and drive or fly into charlottesville
approved
we can try
an we'll ask the planners to put that in the design
but mark h
has indicated a desire to get rid of as many of the tall walls as possible and he approves all of the construction requests personally
so we may not succeed
approved
as per our telephone call
any chance this language came from a credit facility that provides for the issuance of letters of credit
seems to me that l/c's are the way to go then
rather than asking for cash or another asset as collateral
another option would be to mix and match
taking cash up to $0 mil
and l/c's beyond that
lenders frequently set up the facilities available to the borrower this way so they keep control over how much
debt
is supported by the asset base while still giving the borrower some flexibility
as you can imagine
most other extenders of credit are willing to take the bank's l/c in lieu of a lien on a hard asset
yes
i'm looking forward to it

i got your voice mail
will try to call you soon
i'm stuck on a conference call
i tend to agree with you
this seems to me to be contrary to our policy
on the other hand
it also sounds like a request we would want to make if we were on the other side
sorry andrea
i just tried to open this and it turns out to be the spanish version
thanks for the update
the fax came in and was delivered to jeff hodge by mistake
i'll leave it at your desk
here are some early drafts i worked on
re
assistant searches
i think you would be well advised to coordinate closely with janette elbertson
i have a conflict with the friday morning call this week
any chance you will be covering it
i know you guys are busy this week
i'll let you know when i figure out what our firm id and password are
i just heard that there is a farewell party for rainer on friday afternoon
don't know any details
ohmygawd
an e-mail message from hal
now i know we really are in the 0st century
i also get to key west on the 0th and will be there until the 0th and don't need a place to stay because i will be at the conference hotel
ted will get there friday eve
i have meetings during the days thursday
friday and sat
morning
dinner on friday is also a scheduled event for me
otherwise i don't think we have specific plans
looking forward to it
mark
sounds good to me
let's say dinner on thursday and then either lunch or dinner
your choice
including ted on saturday
we have no plans at all so far so we're flexible
mark
tana has pointed out that net works does not have a policy
at least not one we have heard of
regarding the handling of original contract documentation after it is executed
there is not an enron-wide policy but instead a patch-work of policies created by the operating units
tana and i would be happy to discuss this with you
or whoever you want to designate
and make suggestions if you don't already have a plan in mind
linda said she had an extra room booked
do i need to call the hotel directly or work through linda
peter welcome to enron
i usually get to the london office a couple of times a year and will look forward to meeting you there
if not
hopefully we'll see you at the law conference in the spring
most of your e-mail is well outside my area of expertise
are you consulting me regarding the regulatory issues and section 0.0
if so
it would help if you told me what 0.0 says
feel free to give me a call if you'd like to discuss
mark
hey jim
thanks for the note
nothing much new to report here
ted was in south beach last weekend but came home a day early to work
he's still trying to talk me into buying a new car which i would like to do but can't figure out what i really want
i'm speaking at a conference in key west next week and will stay through the weekend
i think it's the only place left on the continent that's warm
nothing like zurich here but it's been in the 0's and rainy
seems like forever since i've been fully warm through
let us know when you find a place to live mark
try userid eol0 password welcome
i hope you have access to e-mail in kw
i'm down with the flu so we won't be able to make it
i was really looking forward to this for a number of reasons
including the chance to get together with you
i didn't have your phone number or e-mail address at home so i had a friend drop my work computer off on his way home tonight
i've left a message for don at home
sorry about late notice
mark
shouldn't the people who need filing cabinets order them for themselves
you are set to move as soon as the current construction phase is completed
we hope that will be by march 0
in case you need to know
i may have missed it
but a very quick look at cnn's site showed no reports of computer virus activity since november
not sure why you weren't on this distribution
can you follow up with anthony dayao
i should be down for sick time for mon
through thurs
last week
works for me
in case the four seasons doesn't work out
there are two other hotels downtown you might consider
the stephen f
austin
an intercontinental i think
and the driskill
both are old
by u.s
standards
hotels that have been updated
for several years after its renovation the driskill was the nicest place in town
then came the four seasons
the stephen f
austin was just completely redone a year or so ago
i haven't been inside but i hear they did a nice job
both are primarily business hotels so they may have good weekend rates
sounds good to me
still available
fyi
fyi
i'm very flexible on who comes along
no views at all on that score
it would help to know the number and cabin sharing arrangement ahead of time so we can book the correct size boat
you can always change the amount of groceries but at some point all the boats will be reserved
i called keswick last week and gave them my credit card number for the extra room
it looks great from the website
will you be golfing or should we make massage appointments
now that i think about it
i'm not sure which days we have reserved
another alternative might be to stay near dc on the day we get back from sailing
inn at little washington
my guess is it's an all day affair getting from a little island to dc so we may get in pretty late
tell amanda i said hi
very funny
although i have to say i thought yours was the least humorous of the bunch

the enrononline team has asked if we can discontinue sending copies of the gtc's when enrononline transactions are confirmed
they have suggested a sentence be added to the confirmation to the effect that it is subject to the gtc's which can be accessed on the website
any thoughts
as you are all aware
the legal department has grown significantly over the last several months
while so far we have been able to find places for everyone to sit
we have not added significantly to the available file cabinet space on the floor
in fact
a number of file cabinets are now in locations where they will not be able to remain due to fire code requirements
please review the files you currently have stored outside your own office space and
after condensing
archiving and destroying as many as possible
give an inventory of your current usage and needs to your group leader
once we have an accurate picture of our needs
we can come up with a plan to allocate the available file cabinet space
most if not all of us will have to make significant sacrifices and modify our filing practices so that we each reduce our file space usage to our fair share
apparently my first attempt wasn't delivered to you guys
sorry about that
sheri
i'm not sure this is an issue for me
aren't you in lance's group now
mark
here is another draft from the business guys
janette
can you give us the straight scoop
i spoke with susan bulgawicz again today
she relates the following points
gensler has been subcontracted to do interior space planning and design for the new building generally while our work is probably in addition to that already agreed
and will therefore be billed to us
it should be covered by an amendment to the existing agreement rather than a new
separate agreement bill donovan feels that the design and space planning work should be done as near in time as possible to the actual construction work to avoid having to redo the work
and pay twice
to take into account new factors not apparent earlier
e.g
organizational and technology changes
bill's view is that we are 0 to 0 months premature at this point in doing this work for the legal department susan suggested that you might want to call bill to discuss this and talk about how you want to move forward
tana
do we have ndas in place with the following companies that would cover discussions with them concerning wireless connectivity for enrononline
agent go aether systems jp systems
do we have our other desired changes incorporated at this point
i hope you've had the vcr going
any thoughts
sounds good to me
looks like i will not be able to have my cell phone on during our meetings
but here is the number if you need to get a message to me
francisco
here is an isda that peggy needs in connection with a project she is working on in mexico
can you take care of this one
it looks like it is a deal-specific agreement for an interest rate swap or swaps
sara can probably fill you in on the kinds of changes from our standard form that would be ok
fyi
fyi
when we meet this afternoon i'd also like to discuss the canadian traders using enrononline average prices as an index for financial trades
apparently this came yesterday but i didn't see it since it didn't come directly from david
sorry about that
yes
i'm planning to be on the call
this looks like a pretty good list
my suggestions would be to substitute elizabeth sager for leslie hansen who is on maternity leave and to add denis o'connell in london for credit derivatives
please arrange for the promotion for sara shackleton from sr
counsel to asst
general counsel effective march 0
0
this was the last e-mail from leslie on the topic
we talked afterwards and i thought she was going to talk to andy about this but never heard back
thanks for your note
enron does have a policy that somewhat restricts the trading that may be done by employees
even when they are not involved in a trading function
no enron employee is permitted to trade any commodity for their own account
or for the account of another
which enron trades
the only general exceptions to this are for equity and debt securities
and there are special restrictions on persons who trade those items for enron
this policy is modified from time to time by the enron corp
board of directors and is monitored by the risk assessment and control group
i believe cassandra schultz currently has that responsibility
i am sending her a copy of this e-mail
so in case i have misrepresented the policy in some way
cassandra please correct me
and if you need any further information
please contact her
mark
gentlemen
several points regarding the below
we worked for the first half of 0 to try and negotiate a master agreement with tdcc but failed due to an inability to agree on credit terms
i.e
tdcc wouldn't sign a master with any credit terms in it at all
rod nelson was the credit dept
person responsible for this counterparty at that time
if we want to start down this road again
the first step is to contact someone in credit and have them generate the necessary credit terms for a master agreement
unless the commercial folks have already
i'll ask someone in my group to get that process started
the e-mail from dow indicates
tdcc has never accepted and cannot accept the terms and conditions included in the confirmations sent by enron
all credit concerns aside
if dow is not signing and returning our confirmations
then based on this statement our derivatives trading with them should stop immediately on legal grounds
the e-mail as forwarded to me did not contain the attachment
does someone here have it
let's hope it works out better this time
mark
all four look fine to me

if not
maybe somebody on this list will know something about fas0
sounds good to me
looks good to me
please make sure holly puts it on the group calendar
yes
a standard presentation that shows generally what traders see when they use the system would be good
we should definitely avoid being too technical
they don't have the exclusive line
brand new
boat for our week but they do have this one
if you can get in the night before we can actually stay on the boat and leave early in the morning
effectively getting an extra day of sailing
if you want to check it out online
their website is www.moorings.com and the boat is a 0
there's some good stuff on the site for people who've never been before
bill might find it comforting
i have taken a stab at a legal

please take a look and let me know what you think

this is like a very complicated game of musical chairs
right now there arpeople in the offices that have been designated for michelle and gail
wecan't move you guys in until we move them out
we can't move them out yetbecause we don't have any more places to move people
there is a design that has been drawn up to create some additional space
essentially by shrinking a lot of other spaces
which i hope will be built out by mid march
that's the best i can do right now
sorry for the confusion

thank you for your
approved
i'm in all week
just give me a call
approved
do we have extra monitors/keyboards already on the floor
any idea how i should handle this
just wanted to make sure you had received this
just wanted to say hello
i hadn't heard from you lately and wondered how things were going
have you moved out of the hotel yet
i know how depressing it can be going home to a hotel room every night
even though the hotel where i lived for the first three months i was in jakarta was very nice
it was still just a hotel room
i was so glad to get out of there into an apartment
major quality of life improvement
we've been just busy enough for me this month
austin for a couple of days on presidents
day weekend
a rockets game last friday
and we're off to the diverse works annual gala on saturday
ted wants to leave town to do something
anything
next weekend but i'm trying to talk him out of it since we're taking that week-long cruise starting the following saturday
since my arguments carry no weight
i'm just lucky that air fares are surprisingly high right now
$0 rt to ft
lauderdale is even too high for ted
ted's brother is working on a project here in town so we had him over the other night for dinner
ted had planned
can you guess
tuna steaks
having conveniently forgotten that his brother is allergic to fish
how do you just forget something like that
luckily they went to the gym ahead of time and ted mentioned what was on the menu so they stopped at the store and bought his brother a steak on the way home
that nice january bump in enron's stock price is ancient history now
pretty much the whole thing has been given back
i'm still going to buy a new car
looks like an audi a0
but just one
hope you are doing well
mark
the cruise is a western caribbean cruise on a carnival lines ship
leaving from galveston on the 0th
i'm actually looking forward to it
i may not be partying with the best of them
or have a body that would entitle me to even try
but a week in warm weather in a deck chair with a good book and a waiter bringing tropical drinks is sounding really good right now
as for europe
ted is thinking london
amsterdam
berlin
finland
iceland and norway
think blond and english speaking
personally
i'm reasonably flexible
but i'd rather go biking or barging through the wine country in france or relaxing in a tuscan hill town or villa than disco-hopping through another scandinavian capital or revisiting the bars in london
berlin
prague and budapest appeal since i've never been to any of them
or maybe i can get over to barcelona just before your cruise with ted
maybe with a few days in the wine country or madrid beforehand
fyi
every time i try to go to the
next step
and choose a hotel room type i get the hotel selection for the sonoma weekend instead of whichever trip i'm looking at
let's talk at our group meeting tomorrow about the changes we should be making to our forms based on the cfma and our conversation with ken raisler
wow
i suppose it might be mine but i have no idea what it is
my comments below
as soon as you like
my guess is this was a holdover from last year's list
ann ballard in the corp
legal dept
called me about these guys today
you might check with her to see where things stand
this is one i did for steel
it should probably be beefed up to include reference to an isda master to be signed up front
here's one carol did
fyi
fyi
ok
i think this is probably ok
you should probably just check with samantha
tana to make sure they aren't planning something then
since it is good friday
it might be a little slower than usual
greg
it looks like melba sent you an example of a put
there is nowhere else on the website to explain the different calculations so they use the identical long description except for that one clause to differentiate between puts and calls
so far there have not been any collars
straddles
etc
offered
on the second change
it looked to me like the preceding sentence already covers the treatment of holidays
at the end of such day
normally being 0:0 p.m
mpt
on enrononline
or for saturdays
sundays and statutory holidays
at the end of the day on the preceding business day
which makes the deleted language redundant
if they can figure out a way to do it
more power to them
but there are only just so many characters available in the short description line
i wish i could
unfortunately i will be out of town on vacation next week
thanks for asking
i'm not sure if carol's request ever made it to you
she is asking for a flat panel monitor
approved
thanks for your note
here is the form
i think we should be able to find someone internally so let's at least try that first
mary
here are the confirms i mentioned
mike
can you send us a red-lined version from the original annex a form
let's look at the internal candidates first
it's ok to open aig energy trading inc
for us financial gas
power
i'll be out the 0th but in the 0th
the afternoon would probably be better for me since it will be my first day back after vacation
ok
thought you might be interested in this message that went out to all enronemployees
that works for me
brent
i are both on 0
my office is 0
sorry for the delay
the general rule is that we will pay for a reasonable usage plan
huge numbers of minutes don't count as reasonable
but the phone itself is your own
i guess it looks ok to me
i'm surprised that they will have the ability to identify their own company as a counterparty
don't we limit the companies they can designate to those already signed up to trade on enrononline
fyi
marcus
i understand you are the new physical power online lawyer
lucky you
here's one that the eol people are anxious to get covered
i'd be happy to sit down and go over exactly what all this means and you'll probably want to talk to tana a bit as well
mark
shari stack has resigned but marcus nettelton has been appointed to take over from the physical power side
i'll sit down with him today and get him up to speed
i think the
sm
is their attempt to designate
enymex
as a service mark
to

re

exchange selects globalview software inc
c forcustomer interface infrastructure what exactly is an

jim will fill in when tom isn't here
i'll figure out a way to get him the key
etc
the next step is for chad to contact the credit group in rac
they will do the credit analysis and send a credit worksheet to the swap group paralegals who will prepare the first draft
run it by a lawyer and get it ready for the customer
i tend to agree with you
but nora dobin is the lawyer who knows the most about the dealbench system
you should probably check with her
i suggest you work through matthew dawson in the london legal department
they should be able to help you
i will be on vacation from monday the 0th through monday the 0th
returning to the office on tuesday the 0th
my cell phone and pager will not work either at sea or in the countries i will be visiting
i can be reached via maritime communications network at

you will need to give my name and the name of the ship
celebration
since the rates are around $0 per minute
i don't plan to check my voicemail as often as usual but will call in when in port
i don't know anything about the daishowa transaction but have to wonder why this information could be relevant to much of anything not directly related to enrononline
to the extent we can't avoid disclosing it
i would think that the traders in calgary will know how many of them trade using the system
if that doesn't work i would try savita puthigai
x0
or david forster
x0
on the enrononline team
david
i haven't had a chance to look at this yet but thought i ought to send it on to you
i will be out of the office
vacation
until the 0th and didn't want to lose the entire week
mark ps
i lost all of my voice mails the other day and i think there was one from you regarding a possible conflict
my understanding is that we're just assigning a bunch of transactions over from one party to another and in that case i tend to think there's no problem
i have not yet done the performance reviews for several people in the group
they are due by the 0th
please schedule 0 min
for me with each of sara
mary
brent
carol and bob bruce on tuesday afternoon or wednesday morning
i'll certainly take them if nobody else does
i hadn't heard from you in a while
just wondered how you were
any chance you're attending again this year
it would be nice to catch up
i highlighted the items i am concerned about
hard copy in your tray
please check and make sure they make sense for us to pay
sounds like a great idea
a couple of questions
can we convert the draft into cash and still maintain our security interest
if not
can we get the bank to somehow guarantee that the funds will be there
in the us that would require either certification by the bank of the customer's draft or the issuance of an actual bank or cashier's check
yes
thanks
thanks for the message back
i'll see you friday
how does this process usually start
i think it's a nice idea
chris
looks ok to me
sorry about that vance
i just missed it
i don't see any problems here either
erica
i have no legal objections to the presentation
i do have to wonder if it is wise from a commercial perspective to so heavily emphasize the importance of the success of enrononline to the company's business on the platform itself
mark
here's a draft of the bullet points you requested
bill
if sam's description below of the gcp procedure is correct
it looks to me like something needs to be changed
the difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty's name from global counterparty
since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names
if the correct legal name is not in global counterparty
the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself
that is the source of tana's concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system
my suggestion is that global counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the enrononline password application
my understanding is that the enrononline team returns inappropriate applications to the customer until they are correctly completed
in this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on enrononline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining
i would appreciate it if you could get this one fixed today and
if you have any problem with changing the gcp procedure
please let me know
mark
harry
are you the right lawyer to look at this
thanks bill
appreciate your help
doc
i'll be in town through sunday morning
any chance we can get together for dinner saturday eve
mark
thanks doc
sounds like fun
see you saturday
paul
sorry for the delay
i see no problems with this in the current format
there might be an issue if the description of the product included the word comex or any other trademark of the exchange
i'm not too concerned about the presence of
comex
in the long description since presumably that will not appear on reuters
mark t
that's probably ok
just a little further into the gray
the main concern is that we not be
marketing
the product with reference to the exchange
in our view using the exchange in the name of the product would be a problem but references to the exchange may be acceptable in the product description
an example of what would not work would be describing the product as a
comex lookalike
or something similar
bill
sorry for the delay
i was out of town and believe it or not enron doesn't have a local access number to its computer system in monmouth
il so i just got your message this morning
don't worry about sailing skills
among the rest of us we have that pretty well covered
we may be a bit rusty but i'll bet we can keep the boat moving in the right general direction and not hit anything hard enough to do any serious damage
we're going to an area that is one of the easiest places in the world to sail around for a few days
navigation is easy
you can always see where you're going
the waters are protected
no big waves
and the wind consistent and not too strong
so the boat will move but not be hard to handle
the skills you mentioned
sitting
drinking
socializing
are in fact the critical skills for a trip like this
we sure don't want anyone on board who is going to fall down on the job in any of those areas
if you want a sneak preview
try the moorings website
www.moorings.com
under
destinations
we're going to the british virgin islands
under
charter fleet
we'll be on a moorings 0
since you have your tickets
please send me your flight arrival information
i need to pass that along to the moorings so they will pick you up at the airport
about the only other items left to deal with are ordering our food and drinks
amanda has abdicated any responsibility there so linda
i will take care of most of that
any particular beverage requests
beer
wine
liquor
sodas
juices
mixers
and finally
just a bit if extra info
0
your cell phones will not work in the bvi
we will have a local cell phone on the boat but won't know the number until we get there
if you need to leave a contact number with someone
give them the moorings
number in tortola
0
0-0
they'll try and reach us either by phone or radio if a call comes in
0
a lot of places will take credit cards but we'll need a little cash for renting moorings for the night
much easier than anchoring
amanda can explain
meals out
departure taxes
incidentals and whatever but there aren't going to be lots of atm's everywhere so you should bring what you think you'll need
us dollars are the currency
0
you will need your passport but there are no visa requirements
0
use soft-sided luggage
easier to stow on the boat
and try to carry everything on
if they lose a checked bag it's hard to get it later
that's about all i can think of right now
feel free to ask any other questions
i'm starting to get excited now too
it's hard to believe it's less than 0 weeks away
mark
please arrange
i don't think i knew we were making a mid-week drop at the airport
we need to remember that as we plan where we'll be
no
the eta says that if you have a master agreement in place it governs trades in the relevant commodities
in fact
we used that language to mollify the people who were afraid we were going to stop sending confirms when they first signed up for enrononline
to the extent we want to eliminate confirms for counterparties with masters
we will need their agreement
from a technical legal perspective we could probably eliminate the confirms for gtc-governed transactions without asking the customer first
whether or not that is a good idea from a customer relations/marketing/pr view i will leave to others
since some customers seem to want this pretty badly
you might consider offering to do away with the paper for customers who sign up for your new data transfer arrangement before making it generally available
bill
thanks for the info
just so you know
the moorings provides airport transfers so there will be somebody with a
moorings
sign waiting right after you get through customs who will get you into a van or bus to the base
it's a little harder to get to tortola from houston so i leave at 0:0 in the morning but don't get there until a few hours after you guys
on aa0 which gets there at 0:0
it turns out i also need everyone's birthday and address
mind sending yours along
mark
yes
silly me
but just so there's some hope that bill makes his flight back
we should plan on being in the general vicinity of tortola on the day of his flight
it turns out i need everybody's birthday and address
i assume you're still at 0 w 0th but don't know your birthday
i'm pretty sure this is going in across the board for us deals
if you guys want to
i have no objection
we came up with some language to insert into the first paragraph of the confirm indicating that it is subject to the gtc and incorporating it by reference
bob bowen has the final version of the language
i think it varied slightly between various commodities
just as a
heads up
we are also starting down the road of doing away with confirmations altogether for certain us enrononline transactions
maybe we should chat about that and i can give you all the details
it's going to be a lengthy and painful process
some interesting articles in this one
thanks for the credit card number
i'm sure it will come in handy some day
i was actually planning to pay for the moorings portion of this as a graduation present
is that ok
i need your birthday and address to finalize the info for the moorings
finals going ok
ken
i have a question about the interpretation of this paragraph of the enrononline legal
privacy statement
maybe we can talk about it when we talk about the clearing issue

we have reservations with eric
the golf pro
on friday afternoon at 0:0
he thinks 0 or 0 holes will takes us 0 0/0 to 0 hours
we don't have to play just holes 0 through 0 but can pick and choose
based to some extent on where other people are playing
saturday afternoon you have a massage appointment at the club at 0:0 with a manicure/pedicure to follow at 0:0
my massage is at 0:0
amanda decided not to participate since she will need to get ready for the party
she is going to try and get lunch reservations for us all at boar's head for 0:0
bill doesn't get there until friday eve
so no golf and i had assumed he would be with amanda on saturday
we may miss out on tea
any idea what the hours are
we won't be done with golf on friday until 0:0 or 0:0
you won't be finished with your nails until 0:0 or 0:0 on saturday
and then there's the law school bbq and amanda's do
i don't know the agenda for sunday's afternoon
very clever
the pro understands there are only three of us
golfing
since we needed something for fri
afternoon and you and amanda seemed interested in the golf i went ahead and made the reservation that way
the manicure was amanda's idea
never having had one
i just assumed they dried them for you
would you rather have a facial
i didn't ask about the morning
sorry to hear you're having computer problems
i haven't gotten a virus yet but i have had 0 hard drives crash and burn on me
one at home and one at the office
you definitely loose everything when that happens
my fairly new work computer
the little one you saw at christmas
started making strange noises a couple of weeks ago so i called in the tech support guys
they agreed that is sounded odd so they took everything off of my hard drive
replaced it with a new one and then put all of my stuff back in the new one
took them a day or so but the weird noises are gone so i feel better
i'm off to san antonio this week for a couple of days and then leave for sailing on the 0th
returning on the 0st

if you can reschedule your manicure the timing would be perfect

i'm sure by then we'll be ready for a rest
do we have plans for sunday eve
do we care
i think we're committed to keswick
haven't we paid for sun
night there already
bill
i am sending you by fedex tonight a copy of the most recent edition of the cruising guide to the virgin islands
it's not required reading but i thought you might find it interesting to see a bit about where we will be sailing
please be sure to bring it along with you since we will need it if we try and go to any spots we haven't been to before and since it will have the most up to date information on navigation
restaurants
bars
etc
you will see little hand-drawn charts of the most popular anchorages
these are surprisingly useful
there's a lot of information in there
if you want to focus on just a few
the places we are
in my humble and easily overridden opinion
most likely to visit are
road town
that's where we will pick up the boat so we're pretty certain to be there the bight on norman island
deserted island but a floating bar/restaurant
good snorkeling nearby jost van dyke
we have always liked sydney's peace
love in little harbor and foxy's in great harbor sandy cay
the classic deserted island
very small
probably just a lunch or quick swim stop cane garden bay
a little tricky getting in but well worth it
the quintessential caribbean beach
swath of white sand
palm trees
steel bands
etc
trellis bay
closest anchorage to the airport and where there used to be a restaurant called the last resort cooper island
nice quiet resort on the island with a good outdoor dining option the baths
wouldn't be a trip to the bvi without a stop here bitter end yacht club
probably about as far as we'd want to go there are some great beaches and secluded anchorages over on st
john but it is in the us virgins which means clearing the boat out of immigration and customs in the bvi
then clearing into the us at cruz bay on st
john and then back into the bvi when we go back over there
kind of a lot of trouble
particularly since the anchorage in cruz bay is so crowded it's impossible to find a good place to leave the boat while we go to clear in
we've done it before but my view is that with limited time it just isn't worth it
of course
we started this with the assumption that my view isn't necessarily controlling here and i know that linda particularly likes the restaurant at caneel bay
fancy resort
on st
john
so stay tuned
we will need to be sure we are anchored somewhere near tortola
which probably just means not at the bitter end or on st
john
the night before your flight so we can make sure you get to the airport
one alternative is to stay at trellis bay
or right across at marina cay
that night and just dinghy you over to the dock
it's a 0 min
walk to the airport
or we can drop you anywhere else there's a phone since there are taxis that can be called and the island just isn't that big
i don't think it could take more than an hour by car to get from any one spot on the island to any other
i put the moorings luggage tags in with the cruising guide
they aren't that important unless you check bags
please be sure to use them if you check anything since that will make it much more likely that they will catch up with us some day
i'm not sure
but it may also make it just a tad easier to get through bvi customs when they see those familiar tags
here are some bvi links if you have time to do a little surfing
call or e-mail with any questions

why don't you just pay for you
you've been footing the bill for amanda
her friends all these years
it's your turn to take a break
by the way
i don't remember pointing out that she is spoiled
thinking it often enough
but not pointing it out
of course we both know how my tongue loosens and my memory locks up in direct proportion to the volume of alcohol consumed
the recent amendments to the commodity exchange act essentially codified the prior regulations on this point
if this technique was effective in 0 it should still be effective today

i don't know that it is part of her job description
she just saw the need and filled it

you may already have this but i thought i'd send it along

please use the system to input your suggested reviewers no later than noon tomorrow

sorry for the inconvenience
mark
can you please see if you can get me out of this
i have to talk to ken raisler with brent
julia at 0 and with tomorrow being my last day before vacation it will no doubt be too hectic to do an interview
she's right
there are a couple of high class resorts that require long pants and a collared shirt but we can easily avoid those
the first few years we went sailing down there i always took long pants and even a sport coat
just in case
the sport coat never got used
i usually wear a pair of khakis on the plane since they are sometimes cold and have used them a couple of times down there over the years but for the most part it's a tres casual part of the world
p.s
did you get the cruising guide i sent

glad you got the package
i view chess as one of the incontrovertible pieces of evidence that the peter principle is in operation in my life

i guess we'd better bring a pair of long pants
here is a first draft of an amendment agreement
please feel free to rip it to shreds
peter
my only concerns would be
0
to the extent of any overlap in customers
which seems unlikely but it's happened here
we would want all of the transactions to be in the same entity for netting and setoff purposes
0
it's been a while since we've done any due diligence focused on retail financial transactions in canada
we are pretty restricted in that area in the us
as i remember it
the new law and subsequent regulations we unearthed a couple of years ago may impose similar restrictions in canada
0
if traders in the us might close one of these transactions with a canadian counterparty or traders in canada transacted with a us counterparty
they would not be covered by the services agreement in place between enron canada and ena

the problem with the language you suggest is that it will be triggered by any term that is longer than a month
as far as i know
we have never had a product that went from mid-month to mid-month
is that a real issue for us here
we have language in a few products already that takes care of the second issue
deals shorter than one month
each calendar month during the term of the transaction will be a determination period
provided that
if the term of the transaction is less than one calendar month
the determination period shall be the term of the transaction
in some cases
e.g
power swaps
when the deal is for less than a month the payment dates are modified to fall at the beginning of the following month
rather than 0 days after the floating price is determinable
that is a commercial call
just let me know how you want to handle that issue
if mid-month to mid-month deals are likely
let me know and i will come up with alternative language
mark
here are my pitiful attempts at photos from the trip

february/march 0 issue enron unveils storage trades enron broadband has completed a series of deals in the data storage market
commoditising this fast-growing area for the first time
it acted as a market maker
purchasing storage capacity from storagenetworks
which was then sold on to best buy
a retailer of electronics products
crucially
both contracts were based on enron's standard contract and included firm delivery with liquidated damages
in the last few years the storage market has moved from being a self-managed and owned business to one where storage is served up from a standard metro network
enron's involvement will be bring flexibility of contract offering and imbedded optionality
according to ravi thuraisingham
a senior trader at enron
when we sell the product to the customer we remain in the market to buy the capacity back should they wish to unwind their position later
that is unprecedented
says thuraisingham
the storage market has historically been more flexible and more committed to firm delivery than the bandwidth market
but these trades mark a significant development
rather than dated damages the storage market has tended to favour discounts on future purchases
there is a premium in the price for firm delivery
says thuraisingham
he says that a number of other market participants are eager to commit to enron as a market maker
in addition
equipment vendors are excited by the possibilities of the market
most storage equipment at the moment is supplied to the enterprise market
this development opens up the wholesale storage capacity market
says thuraisingham
broadband networking news mark holmes 0/0/0 enron hits back quickly after blockbuster failure houston-based energy and communications conglomerate enron's enron broadband services unit signed a deal with electronics boutique earlier this month to deliver video games on demand in a bid to boost content offerings to its broadband customers as part of its entertain-on-demand
eod
service
under the terms of the march 0 deal
electronics boutique subsidiary ebworld.com will stream leading games for rental to enron
s broadband customers
the deal is a positive development for enron after the collapse of a deal with blockbuster
which the companies announced march 0
that would have given enron exclusive rights to deliver movies for a video-on-demand service
the exclusive relationship has not yielded the quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this exciting new on-demand service
explains kenneth d
rice
president and ceo of enron broadband services
the blockbuster announcement was disappointing
but i do think the technology and systems to be able to do that are virtually complete
notes james yannello
a utilities equity analyst at ubs warburg
i do think they will be able to potentially a deliver a variety of items to end-users
i would guess they need to do some more deals
driving traffic on
to
their systems
i think they can bounce back pretty quickly from the blockbuster deal
i think the blow was more psychological and i would suggest it was used as an excuse for some others to lower some very aggressive price targets on the company
which is what they did
the failure of the blockbuster deal was a blow for the company as the exclusive 0-year agreement could have given enron significant upside in the content delivery business
i don't see blockbuster as being a broadband killer for enron
bob christensen
a utilities equity analyst at first albany corp
tells broadband networking news
i think they will probably
get
one or two anchor tenants before the year is out
i am optimistic
the deal with electronics boutique and the failure of the deal with blockbuster emphasize the importance enron is placing on securing content for its broadband network
yet its main revenues from the telecom arena will continue to be derived from its bandwidth intermediation business
which uses pooling points to provide the physical interconnectivity between bandwidth buyers and sellers
allowing users to provide bandwidth on demand
this is enron
s core telecom business
the content deals
while important
are not being factored into most analysts
forecasts on the company
i am confident that the content delivery business will be successful
says ray niles
a utilities equity analyst at salomon smith barney
the fact of the matter is they did get another deal
it was not as large as the blockbuster deal
but they did get another one in there
we are not putting numbers in our model and our earnings forecast for content delivery
whether it is very successful or not very successful
in our forecasts
we are not assuming any particular forecast for the content delivery business
i think bandwidth intermediation is their competitive advantage
the reality is that no one had any earnings
from blockbuster
in the company projections for several years at best
yannello adds
it was a big name and was portrayed to be the killer app
it is disappointing
but i do think they will be able to bounce back with other deals
i also think in an early sense this gaming announcement is probably the tip of the iceberg of what they will be able to bring in
enron
which produced revenues of over $0 billion in 0 from its various businesses
is still rated highly by analysts
despite the failure of the blockbuster deal
we have a $0 target price and a
strong buy
rating
yannello says
that assumes roughly $0 of value for their energy business and $0 of value for their broadband services division
i think given what has happened in the broader market in the telecom arena
and given that the blockbuster deal has falling apart
i think we be will waiting a while before we expand that $0 telecom valuation
he told me
but i think it's still supposed to be under wraps

it really was unbelievable
our neighborhood usually doesn't have too much trouble but the velocity of the rain
at one point they say it was 0
per hour
was so high that it just couldn't drain away that fast
the water got so high that it was several inches high in the garage
not high enough to get in the car
covered the pool and completely surrounded the house
it looks like it covered the porch and got right up to the top of the slab since some of the floor boards are starting to warp
but not as high as the door sills since none actually came in
just one more inch and i'd be in big trouble
luckily i slept through the whole thing
if i'd been awake i would have totally freaked and started carrying rugs
furniture to the second floor
a lot of trouble and anxiety for nothing since it never did come inside
the garage apt
tenant parks on the street and her car had water inside and it wouldn't start without being jumped
i got home about midnight the night it happened and it was raining but the street was clear
no standing water anywhere
by the time i got up in the morning it was all gone
interstate 0 where it goes near our place
say from downtown out to the loop
looked like a river
the water filled the entire thing all the way up to the bottoms of the overpass bridges
i didn't see it myself but i hear that 0 was the same way where it dips down between montrose and shepherd

just wanted to let you know that i plan on attending the june 0 meeting along with jonathan marsh and perhaps one or two others from enron
i have your travelers checks
are you mobile yet
i have to agree
it sounds like a fundamental lack of consideration situation
if we are the buyer and actually believe there is value here
we should be willing to pay some kind of premium
even if it is fairly small
i'm happy to take a look at the proposed language and coordinate with the lawyers in london and singapore
the difficulty in making the long description language the same around the world is that the underlying gtc's are necessarily different because they are governed by different laws
we'll see what we can do
hope you had a good vacation
thanks for forwarding all of my mail
now that i've been migrated to outlook it may actually get worse instead of better
my assistant is trying to see if there isn't something the it people can do
fyi
i have inserted my changes below
i have left a lengthy voicemail for you with my comments
the comments aren't that lengthy
just the voicemail
please call if you have any questions
or page me at 0-0-0-0
louise kitchen has asked to be included and receive copies of our answers
i'm still concerned about the terms
price
and
quotation
my understanding was that
worldscale
is not a number denominated in a currency but rather a percentage number which can be used with reference to a currency denominated figure to calculate a price
that is what it looks like in the baltic exchange limited publication
i haven't seen the iitra publication so can't comment on how their quotations are denominated
the problem is that in the first paragraph of the long description
the floating price is defined to be the index
therefore the index must be a currency denominated number
that is why in the us version i used the average of the prices
calculated using the worldscale assessments
do i have this all wrong
i would very much like to get some time with each of these people while i'm there
i have already arranged some time with jonathan marsh on monday morning since he knows a lot about the isda meeting that afternoon
i would prefer
if possible
to have some time with each of paul simons and justin boyd before the rest of the crew so that i can hear a bit about them before i actually sit down with them
don't worry if that's not possible
i'd also like to get some time with each of edmund cooper
mark elliott
mark evans
robert quick and marcus von bock
mark evans would be best towards the end of the stay
maybe lunch on wed
if you really think you'll need to get in touch while i'm overseas you can try my international cell phone # 0-0-0-0 which is a london phone number but works throughout europe and north america
and of course when all else fails you can always try to page me at
0
0-0 or send an e-mail to my pager at 0@pagenetmessage.net
but the bottom line is that there is a large percentage of the time that i'm just plain unreachable since i turn them all off and let the machines do the answering
which may not impress joe but in my book is even more impressive than having lots of numbers
regarding the need for the rmt confirms
i have always thought this was really a tax issue and that for audit purposes they were needed
if that is not the case
i don't object to doing away with them altogether
we have approved doing away with confirms for eol trades on a counterparty by counterparty basis
we haven't actually gotten there with anyone yet
having just started the actual discussions this week
our plan was to negotiate an written agreement with each affected counterparty to amend the master agreements where appropriate
initially we are only working on physical power
physical natural gas and derivatives transactions
other than weather
the idea is that a lawyer from each affected group would be involved to insure that all of the bases are properly covered
this will obviously be a very time-consuming and laborious process
the initial list of 0 or 0 counterparties to approach was selected by the back office people
our conclusion that this was even possible was based only on texas and new york law analysis
if any canadian deals are at issue
we will need to get you involved both for the analysis and the negotiations
hope this is helpful
let me know if it makes sense to you
mark p.s
please be careful when sending e-mails to me
there are two mark taylors and we're hard to tell apart
the other guy has his middle initial
a
in some of the lists and sometimes there is a globe next to his name
but not mine
my name usually has my phone number next to it
we're trying to get the it people to do something to better distinguish us
we agreed from a legal perspective and sent the language along to the eol people to make sure that it works on the system
i haven't heard back
dale
i know you are getting frustrated with the delay on counterparty approvals
we have asked stephanie panus
one of the other paralegals in the group
to get started on this process and hope that that will speed things along
tana is in the process of showing her the ropes and i am hopeful that they will make significant progress by the end of the week
mark
yes
i was working with justin boyd and ian brungs in the legal dept
i think they sent the revisions to arfan
since we are not an fcm or an ib
i think we can let this one go
looks fine to me
rats
i thought i had picked a day when we were all going to be here
your day off was not listed on my group calendar
sorry
thanks chris
i've taken a quick look at these and my reaction is
0
as to the definitions of specified transaction
we will probably not want to sign on to the expansive provision as an end-user
but it may make sense from the dealers
perspective and
0
we have needed exactly what is being proposed regarding the calculation of termination payments for some time and i view this as a major step forward
bottom line
i don't think we will be advocating the mfa position
kelly
thanks for getting back to me with your analysis
here's what i've done
not sure what the situation is with the lead expediter
0%
position
the phone line of the manager for that one doesn't seem to be working and an e-mail to him was returned as undeliverable
even though his name was in the company e-mail address book
but he's in the same department as one of the jobs below
sr
purchasing agent i think
and this position is a more junior slot
so you probably want to be considered for the more senior position first anyway
the senior project manager
0-0%
and senior purchasing agent
0%
slots are still open
i talked briefly to the managers listed on the postings and have forwarded your resume to them for consideration
i have no feel for the timing on the proj
mgr
position and in fact the manager was a bit brusque
but the guy on the purch
agent job said the timing was great since he's taking a stack of resumes home with him this weekend to review
i've left voice-mail messages concerning the construction engineer
0%
and process/mechanical engineer ii
0%
positions and will forward your resume if they are still looking
on the others
it might make sense to go ahead and go through the application process on the website
particularly for the one that says not to contact them directly
there's no pointing in making them mad before they even see your resume
i'll keep you posted on the others
if there are no answers to my voicemails by the middle to end of next week
you might want to submit for those on the website
too
at least then you know your resume is in the hopper
mark
i will not be able to attend
we discussed the process of doing away with the confirmations for enrononline transactions in our last group meeting
it looks like the most equitable way to staff these is to rotate them among the lawyers like we rotate masters among the paralegals
no one should end up with more than two or three of them that way
janet moore is taking a first cut using the form and adding the power-specific provisions and then sending them on to the gas group
the gas group will then forward them to me for us to include any derivatives-specific provisions
we should talk about this when you have a minute
this is fine with me
in the past
dave wanted to see all of the eta and pa amendments that we negotiated with enrononline users
i take it these should go to you now
if it comes to you from me
leslie hansen or mark greenberg
you can assume that legal has signed off and it is just coming to you for final approval
let us know if you no longer want to receive these
could one of you please take a look at the red-lined language in the attachment and let me know if it is ok to approve it
thanks
i'm coming to new york this weekend and will be there until tuesday
any chance we could get together for a drink while i'm in town
mark
fyi
thanks
i agree
i have the pager with me but don't know if it's working
would you mind sending a test message
did you set up a lunch for me for tomorrow with david mitchell
it isn't on my calendar
or at least not the calendar i can access from the road
hope you had a good weekend
mark
everyone i've talked to was thoroughly impressed
i'd be happy to proceed but did get an e-mail from cheryl on friday indicating she wanted to talk about it
not sure yet what that means
i'm out of town today and tomorrow
if you have time to stop by cheryl's office
ask
that might help
my only concern with kim at all is that she probably can't start until september
probably worth the wait though
this is a test e-mail page
i will be happy to attend
i'm afraid i will have to be on the phone for this one
david
apologies for my silence
i need to check with mark h
and make sure he is still on board but i think it is a good idea and would suggest we try and schedule something for early september
mark
fyi
no problem
this looks ok to me but i thought i should run it by you first
any objections
as per my voice mail
fyi
i will stick my head in today
i have tentatively booked us on the qe0 sailing from southampton at 0pm on august 0
arriving new york at 0:0am on september 0
you and amanda have a caronia class cabin at $0.0 per person
including air from new york to london
with a business class upgrade on continental
i have a single in the same class
so we eat in the same restaurant
my plan would be to fly over on sunday evening
the 0th
since i have to be in ohio that morning
with that in mind i have also booked jr
suites for us at
0
the all-inclusive london hotel near buckingham palace that i've mentioned to you before
they are at 0 gbp per night
0 nights
of course
if you guys wanted to go earlier to spend more time in london
i am sure that would be possible
the difficulty is that amanda has indicated an interest in staying in europe longer
certainly understandable
her preference would be to go over on the boat leaving ny on september 0
arriving in southampton sept
0 and then stay in europe for a few weeks
that doesn't work quite as well for me because i only have 0 vacation days left and on that routing i get one less day in london
i.e
we get off the boat on monday morning and i have to fly back tuesday morning
on the other hand
we wouldn't be jet lagged on arrival in london
they will hold the reservation until tomorrow
what's your preference
looks good to me
do i need to approve this in the system
let's go ahead and make her an offer to start as soon as she can
that may not be until september but if she can make it sooner that would be great
here is the first of the no more confirms agreements
can you please handle this one
even though it came to me over two weeks ago i didn't realize this was ready for us until the back office and eol people called asking for it
entirely my fault
so there is a certain urgency to it
i also have counterparties for francisco
sara and frank to get started on
but i thought you would be better for the urgent one since you have the most experience with these issues
here is the aquilla no-more-confirms agreement
have we been officially sanctioned by the lme
if so
please send me a copy of any official statements of sanction
depending on exactly what they say
we may have to report the situation to other exchanges here and possibly the cftc
thanks
here is the no-more-confirms document i mentioned
here it is
here is the first of the no-more-confirms agreements
power and gas have already made their changes to the form so now it's our turn
sara
mary and francisco also have counterparties they are working on

fyi
thanks for the offer
but i can't get away that early without taking vacation time
at this point my flight gets in at 0:0 p.m
i'm afraid amanda's friends will be disappointed
the two-step
a polka or maybe a c&w line dance is more in the texas line
they'd be disappointed there as well but their expectations might be slightly more reasonable
i asked for a return date for you of september 0 which is the day i'm coming back
but since i will be going to houston and you will be going to nyc we won't be traveling together anyway
would you rather stay an extra day or two
will you guys be around the first weekend in august
i have to be in nyc the 0st
0nd on business
thought i'd check and see what you were up to
mark
here are my comments
your reservations went through on the card you wanted
i asked for 0/0 as your return date and 0/0 as amanda's
veronica
the lease automatically converts to a month-to-month lease at the beginning of august at the same rent
that means that from then on either one of us can cancel with 0 days notice to the other if they want to
that's ok with me if it works for you
mark
let's plan on it
my only question is whether i'll be able to come on friday eve
or have to wait until sat
a.m
do you have plans that would make one day better than the other
i have a 0:0 flight back to houston on sunday afternoon and will be able to get a rent car at the newark airport so you won't have to worry about transport for me
tom gros and the commodity logic team will be presenting a demo tomorrow of the various modules which go live in the next week or so
the demos are scheduled for 0:0 to 0:0 and 0:0 to 0:0 tomorrow afternoon in eb0c0
please feel free to attend one of the sessions if you are interested
i already have a meeting scheduled at 0 on monday
if this doesn't work
i can just send you the three whole presentations
let me know
mark
unfortunately
it's each one comes from a different presentation
here are all three
slide 0 slide 0 value proposition slide 0
here is the language for the risk control slide
sorry i can't send it to you as a slide but what they sent me was actually 0 slides that ken and i've distilled down to one
enron risk assessment and control
rac
market risk management policy approved by board of directors trading limits value at risk daily reports
stress testing application of extreme value theory credit risk management counterparty credit exposure aggregation and management counterparty value at risk models segregation of duties
independence of rac optimizes focus on risk identification and performance measurement
here is the doug leach/russell dyk e-mail
do i assume correctly that dinner is at home in nj rather than at home in ny
what should we do about keeping track of names
phone numbers etc
for me
is it time to start with one of the programs now available
isda's interview is on wednesday afternoon
how did it go
our agreements with enrononline customers prohibit us from sharing their names with third parties
i.e
non-enron companies
we can use our customer lists ourselves for marketing our products
but can not give the lists to anyone else
fyi
we do know which companies use the system
i don't know if that information is stored in a searchable format but there is definitely a customer database that has profiles stored for each customer and determines what they have access to on the system
my guess is that the only way to answer the question is for someone to sit down with the list of all customers and try and figure out which ones are utilities
a less than perfect process but one that would give you a ballpark number
had a great weekend and looking forward to next time
hope you made it back to town ok
i had no problems but i think you should just assume that from the newark airport it's at least 0.0 hours
probably a bit more
the avis lady didn't bat an eye
of course i stood towards the back of the car so she wasn't really looking at the front and there was a big line forming behind me so she was in a hurry
did the kids get away even close to on time
thanks again
a spoon is a good start
i think it's good as a cake frosting
as a filling between a couple of cookies
maybe spread on toast or even dissolved in coffee
in buenos aires i remember it coming in a tiny little jar at breakfast along with the marmalade and honey
goodness knows what they put it on
sure
just send me the numbers
or maybe a website or two
we run the risk that when you show up it's a crappy boat but then we'll know better the next time
sorry for the delay
i will be out of town most of this week but could set up a time to talk on the phone if that works for you either thursday afternoon or friday morning
otherwise
how about monday august 0 at 0:0
0:0 or 0:0
sorry for the delay
these look fine to me
can you add yourself to my rolodex
this came from the eol info web site as it is
maybe the powerpoint experts can go there to get a better version
do you know anything about this
joel
i've taken a quick look at these and think that they are really more in the physical trading line than derivatives
i'm trying to figure out who the physical metals trading lawyer is to take a look at them for you
i've checked with alan and i think mike r
is probably the right guy all the way around
i didn't see your name in any of these e-mails
do you get involved in trade commission issues

i didn't have marie on my list since she was with ebs reviewed her for the first half of the year
the project for converting our lotus notes database to oracle is now underway
the technical people need a list of the upgrades we want as soon as possible
tana will be stopping by within the next few days to solicit your input
please give this some thought now so that you can be ready with suggestions for her
thanks for a great weekend
don's family was a lot of fun and what an incredible guest list for lunch
i wish i could have been better company
love
mark
please call me
hi justin
i'm afraid i don't really know what this is all about
it sounds like it might be something the tax people should be doing
can you fill me in
i think it would be a good idea if you would print these out when you get them and bring them in at some point so we can go over them
oops
sorry
i'll bring them by
that's fine with me
i've booked it
just let me know if you need to change the time
janette
would you please revise mark's group list to delete mark a taylor and add me as mark e taylor
thanks
wow
you must really get in early
thanks for forwarding these things
i've asked janette to revise her distribution list
mark
i think holly talked the e-mail gods into making the change a month or so ago
the other mark t
and i have gotten each other's e-mails for a long time but the switch to outlook exacerbated the problem because we were totally indistinguishable in that system's address book
it's gotten a lot better since the revised names were put in
yes
that makes sense to me
good catch
i was thinking that thanksgiving was the 0th
oops
i'll get a revised quote
any ideas for who wants to go
this particular boat has three cabins and heads
if we have another person
jim
or couple
the johns
we would get along with for a week it would be fun and less expensive
and if there are even more
we could get a larger boat with four cabins
we just need to know sooner rather than later to get the boat reserved
kay
please revise your distribution list to remove mark a taylor and add me as mark e taylor
thanks
brad richter and jay webb are now in charge at enrononline
brad is responsible for the commercial side of things and jay handles operations
andy is still at enron
he's working on the gas trading desk
attached is a three page summary of our retail swaps interview in new york prepared by the cftc
please take a quick look at it and let me know if you have any comments
mark
i was under the impression that no confirmations were sent by e-mail
all of our derivatives transactions are confirmed by fax and the vast majority of physical commodity transactions are as well
there are a very few which are not confirmed at all but i don't know of any that involve e-mail
test message w/e
using mataylo0
sorry for any confusion
you can use either mark.taylor or mark.e.taylor@enron.com for my e-mails
mtaylor@enron.com actually belongs to a colleague named mitch taylor so i don't know how it got to williard.com
or where all those messages you've been sending ended up
all very confusing
yes
i seem to remember that we talked about you doing anne's review
i hope it's not just wishful thinking
here is the form for her
i would like to attend
here are the quotes from the moorings
one is for a 0 which is about the size of boat we had last time but with 0 cabins and 0 heads
last time was 0 cabins
0 heads which would be better for a smaller group but they're already booked
the other is for a 0
a 0
boat with four main cabins
each with its own head
and a fifth smaller cabin in the forepeak
if we have need for the fourth cabin
i'd be inclined to go with the larger boat
i talked to jim on friday and he's thinking about it
wanted to check his calendar
etc
any idea how to get in touch with the johns
other potential sailors to suggest
luck curtailing jamie's guilt trip
if you have not sent me a current project list within the last week
please do so no later than noon tomorrow using the attached format
this is the current incarnation of project offline
they are trying to find customers who would like us to set up and operate a version of eol for them
i think anne has been the point person for them
it is not related to the back office deal
marie
i'm afraid i don't have anything on physical bandwidth at all
it might make sense to check with the lawyers in ebs
i would suggest you start with cynthia harkness and robbi rossi

enrononline is not an exchange
it is a bilateral transaction system
it differs from futures exchanges in many respects including the following
i
an enron entity is a counterparty to every transaction concluded over the system
ii
enrononline transactions are not cleared
iii
the transactions concluded on the system are forward contracts or derivatives
not futures
and
iv
access to enrononline is restricted to commercial entities
i.e
no retail transactions are concluded on enrononline
0
enrononline transactions are not cleared through any third party mechanism
enron evaluates the credit of its customers and determines how much credit exposure it is willing to take with respect to each of them
for future reference
please do not send schedules like this to the entire group
i'd rather these go out one by one
nothing on my calendar yet
andy edison is setting it up and he knows to include you
ii made my pledge some time ago so am concerned to hear my name is on the list
i'll try again
bob
here is our first draft of the pop-up box language
please circulate among the appropriate members of your group and let barbara or me know if you have any comments
language for the revised password application will follow
i haven't sent out the language draft yet because of another concern i thought of as you were leaving
the language as drafted doesn't allow us to give the names of these signers to potential third party posters
any thoughts
remove
tana
please send the requested info to jane
thanks
mark
i have tickets to the astros game on friday
tomorrow
eve
any interest
we're almost there on the new pa language
just a little tweaking left to do
i'm doing reviews all day today so won't be able to get it to you until monday
i agree with your comment on the pop
up language
probably something to the effect of
not at this time
are you guys working on this already
i have found a couple of other people who are interested in going
but tonight is ted's last night in town before moving to ft
lauderdale so if you're feeling up to it maybe we could get together for a drink after the game
just let me know
looks ok to me
please make sure it gets on the calendar
looks good to me

i'll be getting into newark on saturday the first on continental flight 0 at 0:0 p.m
enrononline is pleased to announce that it will soon be making available to its users products posted by various non-enron providers
initially natural gas transportation and storage products
if your company is interested in this new enrononline feature
please click the

any entity
whether or not an enron entity
that posts its products on the website will be a third party beneficiary of this password application and the eta to the same extent as if it were an affiliate of enrononline

enron may give counterparty's name to potential product providers as a prospective counterparty
do you have a copy in a format i can revise
richard
has credit done a review for aaa yet
we will need their input before we can evaluate the form
holly
please print these out for me
i need to mark them up and send back to kal
are we sending drafts by e-mail
i can imagine we probably are
if so
let's run a test by sending a real draft to one of us internally to open and see if there is a metadata problem
create limit order clicking submit in the create limit order panel creates an order that will remain in the enrononline system until the order is either filled at your specified price or expires after a specified time limit
if
during that time
the price you entered falls between the enron's bid and offer posted on enrononline
then enrononline
m0
will change
m0
its price to show a new market with a tighter spread that reflects your limit order the price at which you are willing to trade with us*
you can cancel an existing limit order at any time before it is filled by highlighting the order in the today's orders screen and clicking cancel
*multiple limit orders for the same price will be prioritized by the time of submission
only limit orders that are between enrononline's bid and offer prices will create a new enrononline market on the quotes screen
m0
enrononline itself isn't trading so we need to be careful not to give that impression
m0
this is the key
we are changing our price
not showing their price
i'm going to be up near kingston on labor day weekend
just wondered if you were going to be open and if you rent sailboats by the hour
either bareboat or skippered
mark taylor
i have checked and
counterparty
is a defined term in the pa
yes
here is the next one
and another
as we discussed
here is one of the eol
no-more-confirms amendments that the confirm desk is very anxious for us to get in place
brent
mary and francisco have each don one or two already so they may have some insights into how to massage the form
the attached version has already been revised by the physical power and gas folks
here is the next no-more-confirms amendment
i was hoping to wait until we had comments to the first set before working on these but the confirm desk is anxious that we move them forward
i seem to remember that you have had some experience dealing with the texaco folks so maybe it makes sense for you to handle this one
fyi
i feel sorry for the people coming across the atlantic this week
one more reason to thank amanda for switching our routing
credit may require additional terms for specific counterparties
in case you need to tell people how to reach you on the boat
the ship's phone number is 0-0-0 or 0
the fax is 0-0-0 or 0
these numbers must be preceded by the correct
ocean code
from 0/0 to 0/0 the full number to dial is 0-0-0-0-0
using the atlantic west code
from 0/0 to 0/0 it will be 0-0-0-0-0
using the atlantic east code
i'm told that if you dial the wrong code you'll get a recording telling you which code to use
it is also possible to call person-to-person by calling the local operator and asking for the inmarsat operator
you will need to give the inmarsat operator the name of the ship
the guest's name and the closest land position
apparently it will also be possible to send and receive e-mails but the procedure remains unclear
please follow up on this for me
i shouldn't have to approve things for martha since she's not in our group
i marked my comments on the document and left it in your office
please give me a call about this
i'm not sure it makes sense to say that the index varies each day
since this is for someone in the governor's office
i have no objection
i think we need to be careful when regulators who might have an interest in regulating the system are asking
see you there
i'll be there
large/0/0
frank sayre will be working on this matter while cheryl is on vacation
would there be any interest in using the auction functions on eol for this product instead of a product line
there is a lot of flexibility in setting the rules
reserve prices or not
sale commitment or not
timing
etc
and you would have the added benefit of finding out where customers were willing to transact if our price was too high for them

i spoke with joe collins
see below
this morning
they are definitely thinking about the commodity exchange act implications
they don't know exactly who the customers will be or what products will be offered but have several ideas concerning how to avoid the cea pitfalls
maybe even including seeking no-action relief from the cftc
i gave him your name as someone he might hear from in the future concerning the transaction
thanks for the note
i suggest you check with the airline or on the internet if you have access
www.trip.com has a great flight tracker that shows more than the airlines tell you

as you can see there are a number that have yet to be assigned
would you please pass these out equitably among yourself
frank
mary and francisco
particularly those in town next week who will have a chance to move them forward
kim theriot is very anxious that we make headway on these
the counterparties marked with an asterisk are the most urgent
i will forward the docs i have received from stacy and janet as separate e-mails
thanks
mark
better check with stacy to make sure they are done with this one
barbara and i will both be out of the office next thursday
can you attend the net works staff meeting for me and fill me in on what happens
thanks
mark
i'll let you guys decide who takes first crack at this one
here's another which janet hasn't seen yet
i was looking through my e-mails for these and couldn't find them
have you guys already started these
i may have misplaced them
please coordinate with sara since i will be out next week
thanks
mark
please print these out for me and put them in the commodity logic file
i hope this isn't too late
if you need to reach me
i'm in the london office today and tomorrow
i think the correct approach is to revise the functionality and add a line or two to the description of how limit orders work
an answer in the faq section
a line for the
failed transaction
screen and a script for the help desk
i'm thinking of something to the effect of
once a limit order has been placed by a counterparty
that counterparty will not be able to complete a transaction with enron in that product on the other side of the market at the price specified in the limit order
for example
if a counterparty enters a limit order to sell to enron at price x
that counterparty may not buy from enron at price x while the limit order is active
note that this needs to be done on a counterparty basis
not at the sub user level
that needs to be clear from the language we use so i have avoided the chattier
you
and used counterparty
the
failed transaction
screen could show the failure reason as
your company has an active limit order in effect at the price at which you attempted to transact
the limit order system does not allow you to transact with enron on both sides of the market at the same price simultaneously
if you want to keep it short
the second sentence is optional as long as the necessary descriptive language appears somewhere on the web site
yes
louise was concerned that dynegy was already doing this to manipulate a canadian index to which we contribute daily volumes/prices
it would probably be a good idea to involve the power traders in this as well since it is not just an enrononline issue
thanks
i have it
do you remember how i'm supposed to check for messages on it
i'm in london today and tomorrow but plan to be in the office in houston on thursday
since it'll be my first day back after being out for over a week
it would probably be best to book some time to make sure you get me
but if that doesn't work
try and stop by anyway
well deserved
it's been fun watching the company recognize what we in legal have known all along

dial 0 and then
hi kayalyn
linda asked me to forward this
i'm at my company's office in london
am unable to call nyc from london
all lines busy
i received your fax and it looks fine
i don't understand the last sentence of section 0.0 because of the cross reference to section 0.0
please check the cross reference to section 0.0
thanks
linda p.s
if you can get through you can reach me at
hope everyone is ok
we are watching on cnn
i got your note and relayed it to linda
our prayers are with you
i hope all of your loved ones and friends are ok
i'm obviously not able to get back to houston today as originally planned
continental has me booked on a flight on sunday
assuming they're back up to full schedule by then
so i plan to be back in the office on monday morning
i will continue to work from the london office and you can reach me at 0-0-0-0-0 at the office
but i can't get voicemail here
or on the cell phone 0-0-0-0-0
where i am able to check messages
i will also be checking voicemail in houston from time to time
i know it's hard to think about work issues much less concentrate
but it seems to me we need to start thinking about market disruption issues right away
the nymex is the obvious issue and we need to find out which counterparties have affected transactions
such as using average of the entire month of nymex prices
and then review the relevant documentation
with any luck there won't be many
we also need to be alert to other price sources that might fail to publish
i'll be in touch
holly said you had been trying to reach me
i've tried to call several times but still haven't been able to get through to you on the phone
i tired to send this yesterday but it may not have gotten through
i'm in london
i had a 0 week vacation planned with bill in greece but he is unable to join me so i think we'll do that another time
are you in london
germany
if so do you want company
call me at 0 0 0
suite 0 or 0 0 0 0 or reply to this e-mail and mark will get a message to me
thanks for your note
i am stranded in london and won't be able to get back until they start international flights again and i can get a seat
looks like that means sunday afternoon at the earliest so please light a candle for me
too on friday night
thanks for that
tim
i am stranded here in london and this morning on my way into the office had the pleasure of my cab driver noticing that i am an american and taking a minute to point out exactly what this commentator has said
that we are under appreciated the world round
that the marshall plan was a remarkable departure from the accepted norms concerning how conquered nations should be treated and wondering what other nation
if it had the kind of military and economic might available to us
could have resisted
as we have
using it to totally dominate its neighbors if not the world
i'm fine
i left you a voice mail this morning on your cell phone to let you know i'm ok and stranded in london
not a bad place to get stranded i suppose
linda and amanda are here
too
i'm working from the office here while they have fun on the town
actually
they seem to be spending a lot of time at the hotel watching the news
and i can't say that i totally blame them
it seems almost disloyal to go out and have fun
they were going to a play this afternoon and got tickets for us to see mama mia
the musical based on abba
for tomorrow night
i was originally scheduled to fly back yesterday
wednesday
and have been rebooked on a flight sunday afternoon
the hotel finally told me this morning that we can keep our rooms until then
i hope the flights are running by then
kitty is being taken care of but i feel really bad having her be alone all this time
jim avant was stranded in austin for a day
they had to take a taxi back to houston the next day
and jamie said they would go over that afternoon
if you need to reach me
you can try the office number 0-0-0-0-0
my uk cell phone number 0-0-0-0-0 or the hotel number 0-0-0-0-0
it's kind of hard to get through some times since the lines to the us are often busy
hope you are doing ok through all this
i'm just sort of numb
mark
it looks like i'll be able to get back on sunday
i was originally scheduled to fly back yesterday
wednesday
but of course all the flights were cancelled yesterday and today
with luck they'll be back up to full schedules by sunday when i have a reservation
i'll let you know if that changes
it's interesting to hear what your reactions were since they very closely parallel my own
i heard as i was coming back into the office after lunch on tuesday and there was a small group standing around a computer screen watching an internet news feed
my first reaction was that it had to be some kind of elaborate internet hoax and i still have a sense of disbelief
i dread my next trip to new york when i will have to see the skyline with my own eyes
linda and amanda are also stranded here and they tend to spend a lot of time watching the news
after the first hour or so i just couldn't bear to watch and preferred to check in now and then for updates
but then what else was there to do except sit and be stunned
even today it's still hard to concentrate on much of anything
i guess in a sense i'm lucky that i have work matters to keep me busy
unfortunately
some are directly related to the tragedy
there's no doubt the world changed on tuesday and this will always be with us in some way
all sorts of odd thoughts keep coming to mind
i have wondered several times if dad remembers when he and i went into one of the towers
it must have been when they were quite new
and tried to get to the top to see the view
we were told there was no public observation area so we just took an elevator up as far as we could get and got out on a floor that was still under construction and went over to the windows to marvel at the view
remember the view from my apartment in new york
and i was on the qe0 the last time it will ever go past those buildings
forgive the bad grammar but you know what i mean
we're going to try and have as good a time as possible here
i'm working during the days and joining linda and amanda for dinner in the evening
tomorrow we're going to see a west end musical
saturday we'll probably go to a couple of museums
hope you are keeping well
love
mark
please let everyone know that they should use the following fax number for me at the office
from what i have heard
this looks pretty good
but i wonder if paragraph 0
c
is correct
is this what was agreed or should this refer to any spread transaction including a nymex
comex or platt's price and another price
whether one of those 0 or not
and finally
i don't understand the penultimate paragraph at all but since you guys are closer to the discussions it may make sense to you
can you guys confirm this with the traders and report our comments and/or agreement to isda
thanks
mark
while this statement makes reference to energy
it seems to me it might also apply to metals transactions
i don't know if we have affected transactions or not
if so
you may care about this
my impression is that the houston commodities traders will be signing off on this
possibly with minor comments
as early as this morning
if you guys want to make comments
maybe have metals excluded if our traders disagree with the approach
please let sara shackleton or barbara gray know as soon as possible
sara will be responding from enron
she is conferring with the traders this morning
if you haven't heard back in an hour or so
you may have to print it out and go down and shove it under their noses
tana can show you where they sit if you don't already know
i think sara shackleton was the last enron lawyer to have worked on this
i was working in the ny office on 0/0 and here in the london office since 0/0
i am stranded in london
there are worse places these days
but hope to get back tomorrow
sunday
glad you are well
after a two and a half hour delay
mostly caused by the extra security
we finally got off the ground yesterday and i am now back in houston
i talked to amanda after i checked in and she said you were on the train to the airport
did you have any trouble
i'm surprised that under the circumstances american won't just do it
linda and i both had to reschedule our flights and did it directly with the airline
continental for me and virgin for linda
of course
in our cases the original flights were cancelled
i don't have the cunard reservations number here and haven't been able to access the web site this afternoon
i will get it for you when i get home
the fax number for the guest relations department is
0
0-0
in a sense i felt safer in london than here
once we got off the qe0 we weren't doing anything that would have made us attractive targets and i don't anticipate attacks against individual americans overseas
at least not outside of muslim countries
while there was an increase in police presence around town
we didn't hear of any actual threats to americans while we were in london
airport security has been better there than here for a long time and now has been beefed up even further
the europeans just have more recent experience at dealing with terrorists than we do
the sword rattling doesn't bother me too much
i've been overseas during some tense international times before and as long as you're in a friendly country it shouldn't be an issue
on the other hand
it really feels good to be home and i can sure understand your wanting to have her with you
from her point of view
i think that while the brits were all being very sympathetic and supportive
the tragedy just isn't as immediate there and so the impact on amanda has been somewhat less than if we had been home
given that
i think she doesn't want to waste this opportunity to do something fun in europe while she has the chance and is already over there
for me i have to say it was hard to have any fun after tuesday noon
although i tried to put a good face on it
i don't know when that will improve since i'm still pretty depressed
it's probably even worse for you since you were so much closer to things than i am
the lawyer in me sees two sides
a
a trip to paris is just the thing to take your mind off of events and
b
why waste a week of vacation and travel hassles when you aren't going to have a good time no matter where you go
feel free to give me a call if you want to chat
good luck
mark
sounds like a plan to me
make sure they've given her an actual seat assignment or she may show up at the airport and get bumped
you might try these
in sedona
enchantment resort
i recommend hiking
jeep tours
spa
in scottsdale/phoenix
four seasons resort scottsdale at troon north
haven't been but it gets good reviews
the phoenician
huge rooms
great spa
mother-of-pearl lined swimming pool
the boulders
also highly rated
at the canyon el tovar hotel
reportedly the nicest hotel in the park
not necessarily up to hayman standards but might work for a night
in tucson
pretty far from the grand canyon
the lodge at ventanna canyon
looks good to me
one remaining concern is that section
d
may not provide much protection
according to the power trading lawyers who have worked with the ferc in the past
they never provide protection for what we would consider confidential commercial information even when they have the authority to do so
if we want that kind of protection
it should be mandated
not made possible by regulatory action
i'm not necessarily recommending a change
i just don't want anyone to be taking any comfort from section
d
if you have not already done so this week
please remember to update your work reports for me this afternoon
i'll be on the call
thanks for making my morning
i'm still grinning at the image of your bags going back and forth across the atlantic
i saw the emergency command center on tv the other night and it looked just like that huge room where we stood in line and checked in for the ship
i think that's why they can't dock in ny
has amanda made it back yet
what about noble
has he moved into his new place in midtown yet
example 0 party a calculates that it is in the money $0
which results in a
loss
to party a from the termination
party b calculates that it is out of the money $0
which results in a
gain
to party b from the termination
there are no unpaid amounts the payment amount is 0 percent of
$0 + $0
= $0 since the payment amount is positive party b
the party with the net gain
pays $0 to party a
the party with the net loss
example 0 same as example 0 except party a owes $0 in unpaid amounts to party b and party b owes party a $0 in unpaid amounts the payment amount is
a
0 percent of
$0 + $0
plus
b
$0 minus
c
$0 = negative $0 since the payment amount is negative party a
the party with the net loss
pays $0 to party b
the party with the net gain
let me know if you need any further explanation
i hope you can all join us for happy hour tomorrow from 0:0 at christopher's wine bar
christopher's is located at 0 times blvd
in rice village
while i think the law actually works that way
we have avoided putting it in writing so far
the way the web site works
the decision to accept or reject the offer happens almost instantaneously so the question is almost meaningless
the time we care is when the internet slows down or the connection goes down and they don't see that we accepted their offer and then they try to get out
i guess the other question would be how do they withdraw the offer
the website doesn't provide a mechanism for that
if we say it has to be in writing and delivered to the relevant trader
in practice it might not be an issue
go for it
hopefully just a nuisance
looks ok to me
the first one looks ok to me as long as someone has checked the accuracy of the reference to gas daily
i have trouble with the second one
this really looks like a basis swap so i think we need to start with basis swap language
can you call me on this one
sounds good to me
do you have time to look at this

thanks for your note
just so you have the whole picture
our analysis from a us law perspective is that there is a tension between wanting the transactions on the system to be enforceable and wanting out of the mistake trades
the offline unwind is by far the best approach when the mistake is not blatant since it assumes the binding nature of the original trade
we have been handling these by using a written termination rather than a reverse trade
this is universally the approach we have taken when our traders have agreed to let a customer out of a trade the customer claims was done by mistake on their part
this happens often enough that we have given the confirm desk a termination agreement form to use as needed
tana can get you a copy if you want it
but when the counterparty refuses to let us out of a trade that is a mistake on our part
our only hope is that the mistake is so blatant that we can claim mutual mistake
under us law when there is mutual mistake the contract is actually never formed
in that case
the original trade is not enforceable and there is nothing to unwind
one alternative we have used is to simply remove the transaction from the customer's
completed transactions
section as if it had never happened
as far as i know
we have only had to do this once or twice
is p&g approved to trade derivatives online
i can't be on this call
do you have time
fyi
no luck here
if you want to plug me in to your call with fred to describe the enhanced limit order system
just let me know
are the provisions we care about in title 0
sounds like you have this under control
i agree with your approach
please coordinate with sharon
fyi
i understand that you will have an amel at the ft
lauderdale boat show next month
do i need an appointment to see the boat
nobody won on wednesday so the jackpot is up to $0 million
i'll get us some tickets for tomorrow's drawing
i just saw the reference to the gala in the oct
dw mini calendar
congrats
i'm already looking forward to it
ps if you're around this weekend
it looks like great sailing weather
thanks sami
it might be a good idea to try and get the isda team to spend a little time on non-financial commodities
it's not clear from this summary that they intend to raise energy commodity derivatives as an issue or attempt to achieve parity of legal treatment with bank products
just so you know
we have run into this kind of blind spot from local participants
who are mostly banks and investment firms
before but the new york isda staff is usually willing to help us out
joel
thanks for your note back
unfortunately i don't get into town until quite late on friday evening so saturday and sunday are the only days i can make it
do you know yet where you'll be located
mark
congratulations to everyone on making it through q0 more or less intact and a big thank-you to those who pulled us through with all your hard work
given the continued increase in the number and variety of transactions coming to us from the global finance and vpp teams
we are going to have to revise our staffing procedures and ask each of the lawyers in the group to take on some of this burden
if any of you receive a request to handle one of these deals
please refer the requester to me or at least let me know so that we can equitably distribute the load
mary and anne will be scheduling training sessions for the entire group during which they will go over some of the most common structures and the issues that they have faced recently to help us on our way
as with all of our work
i expect that we will each be available to the others in the group to bounce ideas around and help with thorny issues
david
thanks for your note
glad to hear you and yours are well
we docked in southampton on monday morning so i was already in our london office on tuesday and just back from lunch when the news started coming through
i was traveling with a couple of friends from nyc
amanda mcgovern
noble black's uva classmate
and linda hayman
her mom and a friend of mine from my skadden days
so it was rather tense for a while as we tried to find their friends but everyone came through pretty well
our return had been scheduled for wednesday of that week so of course we were stranded in london but made it back sunday
not that we were having much fun
but there were worse places to be stranded
i felt bad for the qe0 passengers on their way from southampton to nyc
they would have gotten the news on their first day at sea and had to spend what should have been a pleasant cruise thinking about events and worrying
i've heard good things from both anne and brad about your meeting here in houston
thanks for getting into that
it sounds like exactly what we needed
i have been talking to barbara and she will check with frank concerning the letter
i'll look forward to chatting sometime soon so i can hear what's been happening with you and how you are coping
hope it is all going as smoothly as possible
linda tells me that new york is a changed place
nearly empty evenings and weekends
mark
ok by me
do you have time to work on this
thanks suzanne
i'll take care of it and give rbs a call tomorrow
mark
welcome
thanks vela
my office address is fine
just so you know ahead of time what some of my questions will be
0
i'm a little concerned about the safety of in-mast furling systems generally
what happens if it jams in a blow
0
are the heads both electric
will they operate manually if you lose power
0
the boat seems remarkably well equipped
what sorts of additional items are usual to purchase before she's ready to cruise
0
how do u.s
owners deal with the voltage issues and electrical repairs and replacements
0
finally
and i suppose of least importance
i'm not thrilled with the teak-look deck or the blue cabin sole
any hope of a manufacturing change
thanks again and i'm looking forward to seeing you in ft
lauderdale
mark
thanks for taking this one
sara
how much protection do the agreements give us
i have always assumed that they were primarily for the benefit of the brokers
of course
in the u.s
they are probably required by the sec and in a country where they are not required you have to wonder how well the brokers are being policed by regulators
i guess it makes sense to at least contact local counsel to find out what protections there are for the customer and whether or not it would be reasonable to ask for something in writing
i don't think we need written opinions of counsel
it might also make sense to explain to the business folks that we think there is incrementally greater legal risk in using those arrangements and that while they may be permitted to use them they should keep activities to a minimum where there is a more secure alternative
sorry for rambling
mark
fyi looks like we may get free passes to the boat show

i also received a message form an aa person asking for rate/fx templates
i know we are supposed to come up with a set of approved templates but we don't yet have a process in place
i thought we had until next year sometime
my guess is that the most current source is the work you did a couple of years ago on confirms
scary
hunh
mark
fyi
i hope it was ok to respond to this
because i did
i'm afraid i have a conflict that day
sure
i spoke with jamie this morning and explained our concerns
which master to use
given the merger is there a legal need for novation
since these are ny law documents would assignment be more appropriate
what collateral is involved to be transferred
and have since received a message from their lawyer in new york
if they insist on a novation
which is not a commonly used concept in us law
you could certainly help by letting us know if there is anything to which you would object in their draft
i'll let you know if it gets to that
otherwise i think we're under control
mark
please arrange this for me
i have taken a quick look at the schedules attached and unfortunately they are not standard isda schedules and are not in a form to which we can agree
we can provide isda documentation to you tomorrow which would be satisfactory from a legal perspective but it will not be exactly the form attached to their e-mail
we will also need credit's approval and they rarely approve isda masters without any credit provisions
there is an existing isda between ena and an entity called entergy-koch trading
lp which we would be able to use from our side but i don't know if that would work for them
it's existence might speed the negotiation process for an isda since we could pretty much duplicate its terms
except for credit and the additional provisions we require for regulated utilities
for entergy
since they are already trading physical stuff online
they are probably already approved to trade financials as well and the master will just mean they don't have to accept the gtc's to trade the derivatives
tana can check quickly and see what they are approved for
can you help bryant with this
mary and sara are both out tomorrow
brent is supposed to get the form for the commodity logic matters finished and francisco can't really take anything new until monday
i don't think anne and barbara have enough isda experience to look at somebody else's paper quickly
if you are swamped
maybe you can get this started
i doubt if they even have credit approval yet
and somebody else can take it over next week
this wasn't on my calendar
were you aware
this one has sound so be careful
i have forwarded these on to chris long
who will get back to me on monday
and left a message for ken to let him know i will send it on to him as soon as chris signs off
any idea where this stands
i have received my worldcom calling card
i believe credit is trying to decide what to do considering the recent changes in the airlines
positions
both of you are listed in lotus notes on this one
not sure who has had most recent contact
i someone working on a no-confirms agreement for chase already
any comments to the letter
it appears this was handled by the calgary office
greg johnston will give you a call
that's what i'm hoping
but if not barbara said she would work on it
fyi
i'm not sure which version this is but you'll no doubt be revising anyway
anne koehler is probably the best person to talk to
she has indicated she will have some time in the morning
we've actually completed this as far as i know
negotiated the agreement and signed it last week
how can i tell if someone outside enron is still using an old address
thanks mark
i'm not sure who kim humbarger is but the topic is at least familiar
i'll get in touch with her
that's a relief
thanks
please remember to get your work report updates to me by the end of the day
yes
do i have the receipts for these
i have a friend who is an allergist but i'm not sure he's any good
if nobody else comes up with a suggestion i will be happy to give you his name
ok by me
to the extent you need my authorization or approval regarding the trading database
you've got it
if you have any questions
tana can probably help
i have spoken with ron carletta at the cftc and explained our position
that is that as far as we know the ljm entities have only engaged in exempt transactions and are not required to register as cpo's
he has my name and number if he has any further questions
marie
can you please check on this and let richard know where we stand
thanks
my flight doesn't get in until 0:0 or so on friday night
not sure what we can still do for food at that hour
do people eat late in ft
lauderdale
in case you're still looking for food ideas
i found these that looked interesting
bistro mezzaluna armadillo cafe
davie
left bank hobo's fish joint
coral springs
darrel
olivers cafe maxx
pompano beach
not sure but i think the first two may be reasonably close to the airport
the next one in fort lauderdale but have no idea where the last two are
all get good marks in zagats
look them up at zagats.com and see what you think
i definitely think mark's is a best bet if we can get in on saturday
lunch will probably depend on where we are
is there some place on the water near the boat show that takes lunch reservations
maybe we can go to the boat show early and finish up in time for lunch
unless you'd rather do something else on sat
and go to the boat show sunday
any good sunday brunch places
has our draft letter gone to the cftc
i assume it already has
but unfortunately it turns out vicki's comments were not in the version of the letter that i forwarded to you
i have taken a look at them and am not sure they are critical but thought i'd better get them to you in case we send a revised letter down the road
i was going through some old e-mails and found this one
is this something you have already handled
hi george
i'm sorry i didn't get back to you sooner
i was just going through some old e-mails and found this one that had somehow slipped through without being read
i'm living in houston these days
i was actually in london on 0/0
my flight back
scheduled for wednesday that week
was cancelled and i finally made it back on that sunday
i'm sure there were much worse places to be stranded but it wasn't a lot of fun being away from home then
i was traveling with a couple of good friends from nyc and it was pretty tense trying to track down their friends in manhattan
mark k
is in nyc
i have heard from him and he and his family are fine
i think his company is now called american century and he is still managing international mutual funds
i was in monmouth last weekend for homecoming
dahlquist
mcgehee
mccabe
perschke
vance and ehrenhart were there
ehrenhart actually has a son who is a freshman at monmouth and has joined zbt
hope you guys are doing well
mark
here is the revised performance evaluation for cheryl
i agree with susan that for non-eol trades concluded by our traders in nyc and houston that the ena isda should be used
ms
zivic had called me yesterday asking similar questions and that is the answer i gave her
subject to approval by the tax people
i am surprised that the tax people would be ok with the suggested eol fix
my understanding was that if the assignment to ena from ectric happens automatically
that is equivalent
for tax purposes
to the uk trader binding ena and results in bad tax consequences
since i have to attend the enron net works staff meetings thursdays at noon
might it be possible to pick a different day
are you still taking care of the portland guys
do you have time to look at this
as long as this remains an internal only document
i do not have any problems with it
let's get together with sara and mary to discuss how we should move forward with the forms
i don't see why not
please see me before responding to alan
thanks
mark
our derivatives trading documentation does not generally contain a change of ownership default or termination trigger
such provisions are included in all of our master agreements between enron affiliates and may have been negotiated into a relatively small number of third-party agreements
a merger by ena or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of ena might be a trigger but the analysis is more complex
here is the revised review
password
oberon
i have meetings scheduled for the afternoon and am not sure i will be able to get out of them at any particular time
does it make sense to give her the review without me being there and meet later or not
are we getting this
can you take a look at this for the london office
i may not be able to get there today
can we do the credit card by phone
since i bid on several items
can you tell me how much you need
is it possible to restrict delete ability
we need to have a lot of people with write access but they don't all need to be able to delete entire records
yes
thanks
can you please give me a call to discuss travel plans
i need to make some reservations today if at all possible
please switch to wednesday
nov
0
thanks for the list
francisco pinto leite will look at these and get back to you
anne's been working too hard
she meant financial masters
any thoughts on how we provide legal support for swapco
should that be covered by the services agreement
can lawyers who work for ena represent swapco without a conflict
contact stephen douglas re
bill bradford deal
otherwise none
thanks
if man is not holding margin in violation of the customer agreement
it doesn't seem to me like we should send the letter
i ma leaving for the evening but was hoping we might get together for a bit tomorrow some time to go over where things stand on swapco and what needs to be done
can you leave a voice mail for me on 0-0-0 letting me know what your schedule is like for tomorrow and when would work best for you
risk management
trading corp
a delaware corporation
i will not be able to attend
can swapco buy an existing bank account from ene
pay $0 and sign a bank account sale document in the process
add christian yoder and carol st clair to list
under normal circumstances we would not need an enron corp
resolution and in fact the corporate secretary and treasury offices can handle moving the money around so we do not propose to do an enron corp
board action unless you folks think it is absolutely necessary
the other resolutions we can get in place easily
i think notre dame agreement contains restrictions on what we can do with capital stock of subsidiaries after it is signed
does that mean we need to issue the golden share today
under normal circumstances the enron treasury group would invest cash on deposit in something like overnight commercial paper obligations or something like that
can we let them do that with ermt's money
would we need a written authorization to ene to do that
we don't usually do that for other subsidiaries
i'm not sure
there was a comment by sally beck at the last meeting that she was trying to figure out which of her direct reports should be attending so maybe it has something to do with that
i don't really know what changed though
we have a few items to add in the services agmt
as services to be provided
risk assessment and control services including
without limitation
credit
underwriting and market risk analysis
risk management services including
without limitation
position and limit reporting and price curve validation
transaction confirmation
settlement
scheduling
dispatch and volume management
human resources support including
without limitation
payroll
compensation and benefits
public relations
legal
corporate records
and regulatory and government affairs
travel and aviation
at the end of the current section 0.0
vi
please add
including
but not limited to
sap
finally
we need to include enron corp
and enron net works as parties providing services
e.g
enron corp
is where risk assessment is
net works has all of the it
louise just wants global natural gas and power
i think we should throw in
related products
just to be safe
can you take a quick look at this
fyi
one more thing we need to consider is office space
can i just add that in as a
service
thanks stuart
i'll add it in
two other questions
should the performance of the services be delayed until requested at a later date
there isn't much need for it today
and what do we do about the fees
thanks
can you guys draft up the schedule i on a cost-plus basis
we have reservations at damian's at 0:0
0 smith street directions fromt he hobby area
take i-0 n toward downtown exit number 0 scott st
downtown keep left on the ramp then go straight to go onto st
joseph pkwy
turn left onto smith st
0 or 0 blocks to just before the corner of anita/smith restuarant is on your left
0
0-0
cell
you can confirm that it is not regulated and send a copy of cert
of incorp
which deb korkmas should have if tana doesn't
louise and john have asked for execution copies of all the swapco documents
all i need for the services agreement is the fee schedule
any progress on the license
sure
i think he's asking the wrong question
can you help him out
would one of you please give me a call in my office
i can't get through on stuart's cell
these documents need to have the correct directors names added so they can be signed first thing in the morning
these are the good ones
just wanted to let you know that it doesn't look like i'll be able to make it to ny this weekend as previously planned
i'll let you know if that changes
mark
thanks david
i appreciate that
i'm thinking when this all calms down
i'll just take a couple of days off and come up to the city for fun
not wait for a business trip
i'll give you a ring if anything really interesting comes up
yes
we might as well get one
john lavorato
mark haedicke and mike mcconnell
that's what he goes by
thanks for the offer
at this moment
looks like i'm not going to make it at all
much less tonight
i'll let you know if that changes
i'm proceeding minute to minute here
thanks for your message
is there a number where i can call you
thanks for your note
we're hanging in there
i can get the netco document signed but don't know anything about cgnn
who should i give that to
i honestly have never heard of either of those companies so don't know how to get them signed
i expect these are part of other efforts where i am not on the
need to know
list
if you know another enron lawyer involved in those efforts i suggest you try them
net works is not a marketing affiliate
we can make changes if they want us to
thanks for the note
not to worry about the music
i didn't have the necessary plug-in to play it and it wouldn't have been too loud anyway
thanks for the thought
it's been pretty rough but the merger announcement should calm things a bunch
mark
test
congrats on having your letter published
i've always wondered
do they edit the letters much
thanks for your note
i've been thinking about you guys a lot
too
i haven't been back to nyc since i left on the qe0 on 0/0
every time i heard about the conditions downtown i assumed you would be living in the country
sorry to hear you had to spend so much time in a hotel
i know what that can be like and it loses any appeal it ever had very quickly
also sorry to hear about mrs
b
i hope she is doing better
it has been chaotic and very depressing here
not that our acquisition deal went through but that we ever got in the position to need the deal to go through in the first place
in fact
when they finally announced it
my primary feeling was one of relief
things had gotten very bad
next time we get together i can fill you in on all the details
at least for now i am still employed and my prospects are pretty good under the circumstances
it's nice you have key west to get away to
you'll have to tell me about the house that you have available but under the circumstances i doubt that i could get away often enough to justify taking on a lease
it would be nice to get away from here now and then though
i was supposed to go to ft
lauderdale
did you know ted was living there now
a few weeks ago to visit and go to the big boat show there
that trip had to be cancelled in all the confusion around here
i had hoped to be in new york today for a seminar
where i was actually scheduled to speak
but cancelled that also
with luck things will start to get back to normal here soon
i'm really feeling the need for a break
and 0 days in cincinnati next week don't count
so maybe i can come visit some time in the next couple of months
tell don i said hi
mark
i haven't had any complaints from the post office
in fact
we used to have a mailbox outside the gate
it was a heavy metal box that required a key to open on a post set in cement
it was stolen
box
post
cement and all
about three years ago and the mail carrier said that a gate key
their key does not fit any of the doors
mine or yours
was the best answer
when i gave him the key
he put it on a huge chain with lots of keys that he uses on his route
has there been a problem
on the electrician
i am going to have some work done at some point soon but am waiting for the design people to finish and suggest a good electrician
so nothing has happened yet
i'll keep you posted
mark
sorry about that
i have been a bit preoccupied
i put them in the car so i would remember to take care of it and took them with me this weekend so i could stop at the post office
it turns out the neighborhood office is closed on saturdays and of course they were all closed on monday
you should have them tomorrow
here are the documents we discussed
i think you guys should still go since the biggest chunk is already paid for
just be very careful to try and minimize expenses
a couple of other ideas of things we might ask for
in addition to pulling this without comment from anywhere it is posted and committing to decline any representation against us in these matters
0
how many
who
have responded to this
shouldn't we have the opportunity to clear the conflict
0
commit to not give advice on any similar matter without inquiring as to the party on the other side
i.e
no
no-names
advice on these issues
does your analysis change if the license is expanded to include both source and object code licenses with the right to the licensee grant sublicenses
let's cancel
no gifts
thank you
just a social hour
in my view an assignment is the common legal method for accomplishing a sale and purchase of a derivative transaction
if they want to use sale terminology that is fine but the assignment language should also be there
if you need to reach me this weekend
i will be at my parent's home in cincinnati

i thought of another item to add to the list
cruising world 0 wall calendar
available on amazon.com for 0.0
yet another idea
a flashlight that has a magnet on the side
or some kind of clamp
to keep in the trunk of the car
this one might be good for tim
too
thanks for the idea
i may need it sooner than i expected
it's nice to know there are jobs out there but i think i can hold out until i find one somewhere better than boise
if you thought nobody wanted to visit houston
there have been some ongoing disputes with aep i think we should look into before cooperating fully
i'll check with elizabeth sager and get back to you
i called the moorings about a miami charter over new year's and they said they are shutting down the entire location as of 0/0
when i asked about any other locations that might still have boats left
she said they have a one week minimum for all charters at that time
sorry
i think there is a real possibility here
it would be extremely challenging commercially
how do we convince customers to participate
two distinct areas
i
existing portfolio of business and

new business
new business is easier in one sense since everything is at the money
who would say no to a aaa credit
still requires significant amendment to existing trading documentation and where existing trades are present
separating them out as not netting with new trades
existing business is easy for counterparties who are already in the money
they will want the improved credit
but how do we convince the out of the money side of the equation to participate
this seem to me to be the biggest hurdle
issues
requires consent of customers and significant amendment of existing contracts
adequate incentive for customers currently out of the money to participate
might make more sense where no current positions exist
contract hurdles
need to allow for termination by defaulting party so enron
vmac
will be able to control termination on default
need the consent of counterparty to assign contract to vmac
may require changing permitted credit support from counterparties
letters of credit probably don't work
if we are attempting to put an existing book of business into the structure
an initial chunk of money will have to be given to vmac to secure the existing out of the money side of the portfolio
how much is it and do we have that money
it's not clear how the proposal allows for credit lines to and from counterparties
that is
if we have given an aggregate $0 million credit line to out of the money counterparties and have only been given an aggregate $0 million credit line to in the money counterparties
will vmac be satisfied with the mismatch
will we continue to control the amount of credit we give to customers
if we go to 0% collateral requirements for all participating transactions
this is solved since there can't be a mismatch
will customers agree to 0% collateral requirements
i.e
no credit lines
once the supported/participating portfolio is out of the money
enron will have to post collateral to vmac
if we fail
vmac can default all participating/supported contracts
when all of the contracts are terminated with enron as the defaulting party
the payments to and from counterparties are calculated on their side of the market
presumably vmac will require some cushion to cover this
here is the electronic trading agreement we discussed
sally still ahs not received the list
do you have it in a form you can e-mail to her
just to let you guys know
i'm working like an animal here but at least i'm still employed
every now and then i kinda wish i'd been one of those laid off last week instead of the one who had to tell people they were no longer employed but i don't have enough to retire on any more so i guess i still need the job
hope you guys are doing well
any plans for new years
sorry joe
i haven't seen this one
have you tried elizabeth
hi
you are correct as usual
the premium is +$.0 for the time period may
july 0
thanks for checking
please contact kimberly brown for all the details
she planned the party and took care of the final charge to my account
how are you
hope everything is going well
not much going on here
i think i'll go see the new movie with richard gere on friday
wish you were here so we could go and sob together
drop me a line if you get a chance
say hello to the kids
love you
hi
i'm so glad everything is going well with the kids
what is jay going to study
i am worried about dani driving too
just don't tell me
there's no need for both of us to worry
just kidding
when do they start back to school
some kids in houston started this week already
i so enjoy the summer when the traffic is lighter
i have started getting to work earlier between 0:0
0:0 so that helps some
dick told me his brothers charles
russell and families are planning to come to houston for christmas
i started sweating immediately
what will we do with all these teenagers
love you
take care of yourself
please set me up for thursday at 0:0
thank you
i was told you may be the person to help me
i am a trader on the east gas desk working for scott neal
when i was originally set up to operate on eol i was set up with many more products than i needed
i am having problems with my system being very slow and the suggestion was made to delete everything from all products in stack manager but us gas
are you the person who can help me accomplish this
all other attempts to speed up the editing process have been unsuccessful
even if this does not help improve the time it takes to change a price i would still like to delete these product options because it takes me to long to find my products each day
thank you
i do not show i did any deals outside of eol with koch at the sabine hub during this time frame
sitara deal #0 refers to eol deal id 0
hi i guess this is a case of be careful of what you ask for
since you helped me last week delete all products except physical gas from the all products section of stack manager
i can no longer select a financial swap product as a link to my physical products
for example
i would like to link my hehub physical rest of month product to the gas daily hehub swap product
can you help me once again or refer me to someone who can
sorry
i did not realize these options were connected
thanks in advance for your help
thanks so much
your the best
hi
how is your day going
yesterday was better for me
the vote for who did better in the debate last night seems to be gore
love you
hi
how are you
i wanted to call you this week-end but i had such a bad one that i never had time
first
i made a mistake at work that caused several people to have to work extra time on saturday so i was on the phone with them all day
i felt bad
sunday we went to brunch at pappasitos and i left my retainer wrapped in a napkin on the table
so it cost me $0.0 to replace
i was so mad at myself
you know how cheap i am
i was off monday
tuesday and had four doctors appointments so that was fun
i finally got my bookcases cleaned
there were spider webs all over them
and my halloween decorations that mom made me up
my house looks really nice
to nice for us actually
we finally got our chandelier for the dining room
it is so beautiful
i made reservations for thankgiving and was sad when don told me this week-end that they are not planning on coming home because lynn has to work
i hope we can stay with you as i understand carla
russ are not doing well
maybe we can eat at the rose
just you
me
well better go
love you and take care of yourself

hi
i know your probably mad at me but i took vacation on friday and could not get my husband interested in coming downtown
i know your thinking yeah right
scott said it was fun
just because i didn't make your party does not mean you are out of sight
out of mind
i wish you much happiness and a very bright future

we are still waiting
andy

take care

last night i told dick i needed to call and see how you were and what you were doing for christmas
we have to work on the 0th
even though it's an ene holiday
so we would have to come back on christmas day if we went home
we decided to stay in houston
i'm so glad you are going home but to tell the truth i feel like you do about traveling during the holidays
nothing new with us
just about finished decorating the house but sometimes i think i'll never get done
i have not bought a thing for dick yet
still do not know what to get him
i guess i'll be one of those crazies out shopping on christmas eve
we went home for thanksgiving and i caught a cold that i'm just now getting over
will you be coming to houston in the near future
if you do you are more than welcome to stay with us while your here

i'm sorry about all the problems pg&e has had but i hope it hasn't dampened your spirits to much
it will all work out in the end
dick
i are still here
we were not smart and only sold about a third of our enron stock when the price was above eighty so we have just been riding it down
i guess we will be here for awhile
i'm glad you got your house done
that is such a good feeling
we only have a few things left to do inside
then we get to start on the backyard and patio
it never ends
we had a very mild winter and it is just starting to get warm
i'm already dreading the heat
i hope you can find a place to do ceramics
i used to go with my mom every saturday when i lived in omaha
at first i just went to spend time with her but i ended up really enjoying it
very relaxing
i was very slow
in the year i was there i only finished two projects
i still display them proudly on the appropriate holiday
are you going home for easter
this friday i am going to have nasal surgery
something i have been putting off for years
i am not looking forward to it
once again this highly predictable market is moving so i better go
take care and i'll try to call you when i get back from r&r
sorry it took so long to write
elizabeth
sorry it took me so long to respond to you
use the prices altrade is indicating
i probably just wrote them down incorrectly
i have found in past experiences with discrepencies that altrade is usually correct and this is not a large amount in question
thank you
hi
yes
we were discussing your lending habits and everyone was calling me a fricken mouch
your like a legend around here
we still need to get together and share some of your previous comments with craig
how are you
i miss you and get regular updates about how you are doing from you know who
been to any exciting ports lately
any baby news
not much new around here
john craig keeps us laughing
take care
andy
hi

hi
thanks
these were very good
take care
hi
what group are you moving to
have you finally had enough of us
i can't blame you
good luck
take care
hi
it is so nice to hear from you
i am trying not to think of all that is going on here
but it is not fun

let me know
sorry for the delay in responding i just opened your note
corrected price
sorry for the confusion
hi
count me in
thanks
the sitara number for november is 0 but you probably know by now
sorry for the delay
hi
thank you once again for all your sucessful efforts to renegotiate this deal
it means so much to enron and the physical desk
yes
i received it last week
please call me back
i love you so much
please terminate any contributions to the united way for 0
0
please call me at x0 if you have any questions
hi aunt mary and uncle bob
sorry it has taken me so long to write
life is not good here at enron
i have been asked to stay on until the company i work for is sold
i have been told i will be a part of the new company in it's proposed format
many things can change between now and then and i am very skeptical as the company has told so many lies to so many people
it was so sad the day they let all those people go
i felt sad and guilty because i still had a job
dick's company has basically been shut down
he was asked to stay on as a key person to help close down the business
his job will eventually end but we have no time frame
i know you are probably wondering about our financial situation
we had sold all our enron stock in our 0k some time ago so we have done ok
it is so wonderful that you will get to see everyone sometime during the holidays
please tell them hello and merry christmas
it sounds like everyone is doing well
michele is disappointed we are not coming home for christmas but dick is on call and he wants to work as long as possible
he keeps saying he is going to retire but i think he will get bored and end up going back to work especially if i am still working
i wish i could say more but for so long now our lives have been consumed with being part of the biggest bankrupcy in history and it has become very depressing
take care
all our love
p.s
next time i write i promise to be more upbeat
per our verbal discussion of friday january 0
i requested 0mmbtu/d of storage gas for the period january 0-0 to serve an existing market on florida pipeline
ragan bond at bridgeline informed me that my request would be denied
ena needed to purchase pre-paid gas from sequent to fulfill the market's request for additional supplies
ena did not attempt to schedule the delivery of gas out of storage after bridgeline informed me they would not perform on our request because we would have needed to request the customer to submitt a nomination for a delivery that would not be confirmed
please let me know if you need additional information concerning this transaction
hi steve
i spoke to jeff hodge this morning
jeff asked that i provide to you the pipeline contracts we will need to put into place for the east trading desk as soon as possible after we find out who is going to buy us
as expected the pipelines would only provide us will shell sgreements but we would like to get a step ahead by having legal review them so we can hopefully turn them around quickly when credit is established with the new entity
you should receive them this afternoon
i am at x0
thank you
hi
sorry it took so long to respond but i took a couple of days off
tuesday is fine for dinner
looking forward to it
it looks like ubs warburg is our new owner
we do not have any information yet from our management so i can't tell you any more about the structure of the company
hopefully i'll know more by tuesday
let me know what time on tuesday
maybe we could eat somewhere closer to the loop since we only work until around 0:0 right now and you are out that way and cindy has to go that way
hi
sorry it has taken so long to respond but i took a few days of vacation
happy new year to you too and i hope it is a better year for all of us
today they announced that ubs warburg has purchased the trading company
this is good news except we do not know any information about how the company will be structured so i still do not know if i will have a job
this is stressful because it has been going on for so long
i wish something would happen good or bad
originally i thought this would be a terrible thing to not have a job at enron or in the energy sector but as time goes on i have come to think maybe it would just force us to do something else with our lives
something we have thought about for a long time
it is a tragedy that after 0 years of service we will get no severance
i feel so sad for all those people who lost everything including a job
dick has been retained as a key employee for ees to help close down the business so his job will eventually end
we have no time frame for him
hope everything is going well for you and your family
take care
hi susan
i have not really been mia just taking some time off
i received an offer to trade for ubs which i have accepted
our desk will be very small to start out
brad did not accept his offer and is moving to kansas city to work for aquila
pete quit before he was made an offer to work for a bank in new york city
i am so happy for him
all that is left are me
scott
judy
working full-time
chuck
sandra and jon mckay
scott wants to trade all the points we were trading before so it should be interesting
he is going to trade the hub physical and financial
judy and i are going to split up everything else
chuck is going to trade market area
frank vickers
jared and craig are all that is left of origination
jared had a baby girl on thursday
her name is kendall gill
do not know where the gill came from
and everyone is doing fine.how are you doing
andy
i think i would be a
0
0
for a full requirements deal
i would like some sense of the load shape of the customer
having just monthly total energy consumption is not enough to price a deal
0
the all requirements price may be less or greater than the peak price
it is dependent on load shape
0
that is correct
i was wondering why i am not eligible yet
i sent gave my agreement forms to tricia henry yesterday
yes i am
does this information reflect the additions of the iboc or not
otherwise the info seems to be what is going on right now
if you look at the cal 0-cal 0 period
you see that there are roughly 0,0,0 mwh
two days ago
0 had only 0.0 contracts/day hedged
in the past two days
i sold 0.0 contracts/day
in the past two days
the cal 0-0 swap has increased c$0.0
here is the spreadsheet that i sent you at the beginning of the year when we set the curve marks to show the npv 0,0 cdn
these are the heat rates that i am referencing in the hedge summary sheet
here are my comments on the original guarantee my phone is 0-0
john lavorato already said that he would make jd report directly to canada
i was meaning to give you a call this week and inquire as to when you guys are planning to come up
things are good here
feeling poor as well
please give enpower access to murray fichten
john messenger
mike taylor
tyler seminuk
i hope stock goes to $0 so i can buy it at reasonable levels
things are well here
i will attend
financial settlement occurs between enron and the customer
the pool is agnostic to what its participants do
i.e
generators that do 0rd party physical hedge are still paid by the pool
consumers of electricity who do 0rd party physical hedges also pay the pool
i just need the positions aggregated
i don't need the desks broken out
i tried to answer you but my response was returned undelivered
basically
the pool is agnostic
it pays power producers for the pyhsical energy delivered to the grid and it charges power consumers for energy taken from the grid
any financial arrangements between the buyers and sellers are not known to the pool
the only mechanism the pool uses for physical power transactions is the direct sale mechanism
the terms and volume of these direct sales are entered in the pool's trading system
the pool then subracts the volume of the direct sale from the consumers and producers meter and pays/charges the producer/consumer on the net volume
i.e actual production-direct sales or actual consumption-direct sales
yes
he said to leave the reports the same as it is now
yes thanks john
here is the hedge summary for july 0/0
two things to note are
0
i bought 0 mw of cal 0 flat from mirant for a 0 gj/mwh heat rate 0
there is now a 0 year aeco basis curve
so the fixed price aeco gas from cal 0 on is generated off this curve
before the aeco basis curve stopped at cal 0
i sent you an update of the hedge summary for july 0
0
in that i mentioned that i bought 0 mw of cal0 at 0 hr flat
i am long over 0 mw at this heat rate
the biggest risk in this position is a large hydro year that tanks the mid-c
i.e
uncorrelated event with gas
mid-c off-peak is $0 usd
nymex fixed price for cal0 is $0.0 usd and sumas basis is $0.0 for cal0
this implies a heat rate of close to i am thinking about buying back some aeco gas hedge for cal0
then selling mid-c off-peak to replace the gas hedge
perhaps as winter blow-out protection
buy some jan-feb sumas basis
the trade for a 0 mw long alberta flat position would be
a
sell 0 mw of mid-c off-peak b
buy 0.0 contracts
day of aeco fixed price cal0 gas
i.e
to unwind the off-peak alberta portion of the the gas hedge
see what you think
home number is
0
0-0
i think you need to do this
they want the info today for prc reasons
john

i don't want to wait till month end
let's adjust the numbers now and for the june 0 0nd order
lets take that value into june since it relates to july puts
the total 0nd order up to and including july 0 is
0,0,0
your numbers amount to a adjustment of
0,0,0
were the total 0nd order from jun 0 was
0,0,0
now i understand that i would receive a some negative 0nd order to explain some of this difference i just thought that
0,0
difference
i.e
0,0,0-0,0
which should be the true 0nd order
was a bit high
same price as other volume
start date is fine
e-mail me for confirm
i won't have it until tomorrow morning because of a deal entry error in my 0 position
can you change john mackay's name in the natural gas fixed price positions by trader
natural gas basis positions by trader
natural gas p&l to chris lambie
john is being relocated to houston and chris lambie is now in charge of the alberta gas term desk
additionally
can you merge the p&l under mackay and add
trading into one line item and call it lambie
therefore lambie should be
0,0
as of yesterday's report
congrats
harvard is ok not as good as chicago though
just joking
does this resume interest you
thanks for making the changes on the p&l and fixed price positions report

will the telus and cisson deal appear tonight
because i haven't seen the cisson deal of +0k yet
it didn't
check with karim and let me know today
thanks
karim
this is the deal that i was talking about this morning
albert is saying that it should have appeared in friday's p&l
can you check this with him and let my know today
when you said it was in tonights p&l
i think albert was talking about the telus deal not the cisson deal
i recognize that aug 0 is jason garvey's last day
i am fine with that date
looks pretty cool
i think we can use it
i am interested
i was talking to john lavorato just this morning and he said that he e-mailed you a memo that described the topics that he wanted to talk about next week
do you have a copy of that
unsubscribe pjm-customer-info
the balancing pool committed in the their beginning of year release to dispatch milner as follows
milner has been down for maintenance until recently
since coming back from maintenace
the 0 mw block @ $0.0 has disappeared
we analyzed the offer stack and it appears that milner has the full 0 mw @ $0 i called doug heath to discuss this
he hasn't called me back
the issue i raised last week about sherness dispatch is ok
i received a justified answer
however
this milner issue is harder for th pool to defend
can we pursue this
thanks john
these are all ok
i am sure that john lavorato will want to see a presentation for the alberta power fundamentals
to save the hassle of develop powerpoint slides
is there a way that we can simply tie a projector to the computer and run it off of our website
additionally
can you enter the new known generation in the database
i am sure that he will want to see this as well
he will be in the office on wed afternoon
we should make reservations for
john lavorato rob milnthorp derek davies john zufferli eric ledain john mackay chris lambie john disturnal mike cowan
can you update slides 0-0 as of end of july
jason can you make a power point slide with the following spreadsheet
just use the number of trades and volume of trade columns
i.e
the first two
call us from london when youget there
do you have our flight info
looks right
can you re-activate the alberta power pool access to enrononline
although this entity doesn't trade
it is important that they have access to the alberta gas and alberta power product for view only
this is a government entity that controls important gas generators in the province
they use our info about aeco gas in dispatching these units and they are an advocate for electricity trading in the province
therefore
they need to see the alberta power market data on eol
thank you john zufferli
no problem
just arrange it with angela
yes
as a policy we only provide this info to customers who do business with us
sorry nella
i replied a while ago directly to rob milnthorp
this seems fine
here is a copy of the script
let me know if you have any comments
we can meet at my house at around 0:0 pm tonight
phone
0-0 can every dress up in as bushman or farmer outfit as you have
it might be funny for rob to wear a hockey jersey with the letter c on it
does anyone have a chalkboard
kyle can you bring you abacus
have you got you enron online reactivated yet
nella
the trade volume info looks correct
it is the new counterparty info that is incorrect in q0
we had 0 new counterparties for the alberta power product in q0
we had 0 new counterparties for the alberta power product
i sent a request to reactivate the powerpool of alberta's view access to eol alberta gas and alberta power
the request was sent to the help e-mail address 0 week ago
to date the powerpool has not received access
can you inform me how long it will take
thank you
this sounds fine
power trading will need about 0 seats
just respond to angela with how many seats you think you'll need
infield
no problem
i don't have any immediate needs
i don't know if anyone would want to come work for canadian pesos anyway
sorry i couldn't be more help
see you
things are ok
how is the new family addition doing
i'll be there
sure
looking forward to it
we can put him in sean's seat
i have given bill greenizan formal authority to be your direct supervisor
bill will be the point person for any questions
development issues and concerns that your group may have
you are still welcome to approach me at any time
however
i feel that given my increased responsibilities with the gas group
it would only be fair to the four of you
in terms of career development
to have more frequent and detailed interaction with bill
thank you
p.s
i would like to make this announcement in person but as you know it is difficult to get all four of you at the same time
good for me
yes and send me his resume
i'll be there
i don't have a need for traders here in calgary now
i don't have a softcopy of the application
he should think about harvard and mit
give me a call after 0:0 pm mst tomorrow
one of us will attend
john zufferli bill greenizan cooper richey of enron will attend
can you set up greg berry in duncan croasdale's old seat
thanks
john
we can have you sit down with john disturnal
chris lambie and mike cowan in informal interviews
i'll send it tues morning
i understand that the car has 0,0 km
has the engine been rebuilt
when were the brakes last changed
how is the clutch and transmission
no i don't know about a power plant in ontario
how is it going in seattle
hope all is well
give us a call sometime
i talked to milly yesterday
he was ok with the concept of covering the 0 month salary
i talked to trish and the easiest/non-tax affected way to handle it is to submit expense forms
the problem is if you sell the car at a loss
then the loss compensation is tax deductible
if you import the car
then the transport costs/imports duties can be submitted as an expense and is not exposed to taxes
i talked to trish about exactly what you have proposed and she wasn't sure from an equity standpoint between what was given to other employees that she could do that
however
don't worry about it i'll do my best so that you are kept whole in one way or another
the easiest position for me to push is if you actually want to keep your car
then you can expense the duty

not material so don't do anything
just get with me when you are in
i don't have time to go to your office
you have to come here
i am in the process of setting curves between 0 and 0
i never know when i am done since i am dependent on houston currency and gas curves
so if you could be here at 0 that would be good
take the transcanada hwy 0 west to calgary
this becomes 0 ave n in the city
take highway 0 south
deerfoot
when you get in the city
when you come to the deerfoot/glenmore intersection take glenmore trail east
on glenmore
you'll pass under macleod trail
there is a big mall chinook centre on your right
you'll pass over the glenmore reservoir
when you get to glenmore and 0 st get in the inside lane of glenmore
after 0 st
glenmore will split in 0
stay in the inside
i.e
leftmost lanes
this fork will lead you to a stop light where you turn left onto highway 0 bragg creek
on highway 0 you will pass 0st
after the light get in the outside lane and take your next right on lower springbank rd
at the the stop sign turn left onto lower springbank
you should now be going parallel to highway 0
after 0 st and before 0st there is a gravel entrance road on your right
take this road
it is 0 feet long and leads to slopeview dr
turn left when the gravel road joins the pavement and go to 0 slopeview dr
i'll call him

hey jim and greg

sent
friday

0 0:0 pm subject
from anne wodenshek jessica and john
thanks for the card
yes chris was in the wtc
0th floor on tuesday the 0th
0 days after our 0th wedding anniversary
i hadn't spoken to him at all that day and he wasn't able to call after the attack
i only hope that he wasn't frightened and that he didn't suffer
some of the other people who worked for chris were able to contact their loved ones and they said that they were going to be evacuated
none of the 0 people who worked for chris got out
and in total
there were nearly 0 employees of cantor
espeed and tradespark that didn't survive
we are all in a state of shock and disbelief
chris would have turned 0 on 0-0
he was the most wonderful
hardworking
dedicated
easy going
kind
loving and respectful person i have ever known
he never had a bad word to say about anyone nor was there a bad bone in his body
the children and i
0
feel like our lives ended that same day
i can't imagine moving on or ever being happy again
there is no reason for this dispicable act
this world will never be the same
there were many articles about chris in various papers here in nj and ny
i was also on cnn when we were searching for him
you can find these at the starledger.com
nytimes.com
the stamford advocate
bergen record and info on the cantorusa.com website
i have set up a trust fund for the children if you are interested
the address is the christopher wodenshek children's trust c/o attorney thomas palace 0 court street hackensack
nj
i am not sure if john worked at tfs with chris
but that sounds familiar to me
if so
i wanted to let him know the ted mahoney
or maloney
was also at cantor and is also amoung the missing
thanks again for your kind card and prayers
please continue to pray for peace in our and our children's time
fondly

what is the asking price of this vehicle
i am not sure what new start is
any details
btw
i think i have a bye on this video
the currency p&l is missing from the preliminary again
we shouldn't post p&l to the executive management reports with missing components
also
instead of sending me the p&l via e-mail
arrange to have someone here to put the p&l and new deal reports on my desk as usual
thanks
also
where are my gas reports
i don't have the p&l summary with post id's for my gas books as of 0/0
unfortunately
the timing does not work for me
i agree
i feel the same
it feels like we are getting left behind
looks ok to me from the trading side
i plan to attend
where is my preliminary p&l for oct 0
once again
the eol report is ignoring the new customer list that i have given twice now
they seem to insist that the the canadian subs that are now tradinig alberta power that have traded other products on eol are not new customers
i have all but given up on this issue
in terms on of # of trades/day for alberta power
the numbers for aug and sep are low
i will check the gas info later
given the volatility in the gas market
which is the sole impact on the canadian power book's us dollar exposure
and the exhorbitant cost involved in hedging multi-year cashflows
i.e
as evidenced by friday 0/0/0 trade of
$0,0,0 cdn new deal value for the 0 year swap that i entered into
i will manage the currency exposure of this book myself
i will hedge appropriately when i see fit and will not accept hedges forced on enron canada because of arbitrary position limits set by your department
john zufferli
since alberta power trades 0 times/day and east and west power trade in excess of 0 times/day
i believe that a 0% allocation for my desk is inappropriate
i would be willing to settle for 0% and i believe that this is more that generation
i never wrote nor implied that i was intending to hedge currency exposure with a third party
i implied that i will hedge with you guys when and where i deem appropriate in the term structure
there is nothing in my inbox
i have no form to sign
could you deliver me one please
i want to install some reporting measures on position limits and var metrics here in canada
can you give brian gillis the necessary access so that he can prepare the reports for me
if you have any questions give me a call
derek can you forward me the e-mail for the management conference
my e-mail puked and deleted everything in my inbox
i have no memory of receiving this info
can you send me another

i don't want to let you down and i feel like a complete heel

i am supposed to talk to her tonight
what do you think it is
yes but not 0% that the merger will close
here is a spreadsheet that captures the eol price data
an analyst here built it
apparently whenever the price changes in eol it gets sent to a file server and then the macro picks up the new data
to this spreadsheet we should add the $0mm cost for increased operating reserves
the $0mm for taxes and fx
just send the essay at home i don't know what to do about mom

dad asked if i wanted to lend you some money but i am reluctant to do it at this point in time since
a
i am not completely at liberty to touch all the cash that i have received lately for concern that it may be taken bank under potential creditor action against enron
unfortunatelty
without this cash
i really can't afford to lend any
the cash that i received recently represents 0% of the cash that i have and i am not sure when i can count on this cash with any degree of certainty
therefore
i am reluctant to touch this money for at least 0 months
b
as of right now
i don't have a job after feb
0
the new company deal that enron is trying to structure with its traders and a new buyer will not be done until the month
if this deal falls through
then i have to find a job with another company
in this case
it is most likely that i will have to move back to the us since my contacts and the most lucrative opportunities
i.e
compared the the new enron deal
are there
c
if i had the cash to give
dad asked that i could give you a discount to the bank mortgage
with discount rates near 0%
even if i gave you a mortgage at 0%
i don't think the monthly interest saving for you would be material enough
d
i think it is good for you to develop a credit rating with a bank through a mortgage
it is very beneficial for later on in life
paying visa bills does help you a bit in this category
but not like a mortgage
hopefully
you can get the financing from a bank
i think that this is the best solution in the long run
if the legacy deals move to netco then we need the ability to trade canadian gas
canada would not be out of business if we only traded us denominated financial products but it reduce our daily transactions by 0%

congrats to ali i had to fly to houston on monday on last minute notice
we have been bought by ubs warburg
i hope that the deal works out and looks good for me
don't know yet but i am excited
how is the condo going
yes
he worked for me
he ran the aeco option book
we let him go since we were not sure of our future at the time
he is setting up the bp amoco options desk he is a very smart guy and understand options very well
he is late thirties and has been trading for some time
things are going well,hectic but more steady now that we are bought by ubs
at least steady in mind jess is doing well
just 0 weeks left
she is getting to the uncomfortable phase now how are you doing in portland
cooper is doing fine he is still breathing according to him
i can't afford to bump anyone
unfortunately all the people on this list are top notch
we are trying to separate the cream from the cream
given that
and working on the assumption that dan d is a rock star
i.e
not knowing him from adam otherwise
i think we should relace lalani with him
do you have the internet addresses and directory details put togethor yet
after some brief discussions with ubs in houston
we must wait before we can make final determination of our functional currency
we may be evaluated in canadian dollars rather than american
i must get some direction from ubs
can dorland and chad meet me and mili in video 0 at 0:0 and when these guys come back can cowan and lambie come to video 0
can you send my curves and trades for jan 0
i am reading your mail
i have asked for the same thing regarding my base
especially since i came up here with a base salary converted at 0.0 cdn/usd and with no raise since being here at 0.0 cdn/usd i have received a 0% pay cut relative to my peers in houston
not to mention that my base salary is $0-$0 usd/year lower than what other shops are offering
however
after three attempts
i have been unsuccessful in championing my own cause
i don't even know your salary now
wow
that was higher than i thought
that is not much different than mine and higher than other directors in the office
i am not blowing smoke
but given my experience
there is nothing that i can do at the immediate time
no i never got the sweater
i was thinking about that on the weekend
i'll pick up the gift for you
can you prepare how the ontario market works presentation for myself and derek davies
no the packages haven't come in
kacz's called a we are going to pick up the gift
warburg is still progressing
just waiting on offer letters
i will be in charge of canadian trading
that will include ontario power

can you send me the jan 0 trades and marks as well as today's trades and marks before 0:0 pm today
thanks john
will this be video conferenced in calgary
i lifted it last night for 0,0
yes i gave him a verbal
we have traditionally have had currency issues in canada regarding p&l preservation versus cashflow preservation
we have been valued in p&l under the us$ but due to revenue canada reasons our functional currency has been c$
i.e
the preponderence of cashflows were in c$ from the legacy gas deals
petrocanada
suncour
etc
and the ppa position
since trader evaluation at year end has been in us$
traders would hedge c$ positions immediately as the trade occured
the hedge would extend until the position rolled of his book
from a p&l systems point of view
this would preserve the trader's p&l in us$
however
from a treasury point of view currency risk would still exist until cash exchange hands
these cash exchange dates were different for financial trades
physical trades and inter-company trades
there was also some currency risk
albeit small
between billing dates from sap and settlement dates of the respective trade type
it is my opinion that the functional currency should match the evaluation currency in order to mitigate many of the above problems
to a certain extent
i am indifferent if it is us$ or c$
the timeline of the decision is being driven by our accounting group who need to set up the sap system
they are trying to work within a deadline to have the company capable of performing transactions by jan 0
this is the date that they have been told to meet by houston
as a result
we would need a determinination of the functional currency by mon jan 0
subject to mechanical inspection from the vancouver porsche dealership
they are working it still
can we possibly move this meeting up from 0:0 pm to sooner

how is business
things not as fun here as pdx
i am still in the market for a car and i have a strong candidate
0 carrera 0 cabriolet
it has 0k and the interior is flawless
the exterior has a couple of dings and some rock chips
etc in the front
the paint has some waterspots on the hood as well
the guy that owns it is a geek and never has waxed the car
it may be possible to get these out by a detail shop
heres the kicker
the guy is asking $0,0 negotiable
i think i can get this for $0,0 or 0k
it needs tires and one of the headlight lenses has a rock chip
the car drives great
do you know of anything that i need to look out for with this particular model
the engine is a 0.0 litre and it runs great
can a detail shop get out smudges and waterspots
the blue book trade in on this vehicle in good condition is $0,0
the retail is supposedly $0k
what am i missing here
thanks
bobby
how's it going in pdx
things very different here in this
market
it is difficult to trade against monopoly power
book currently melting down
however
things are turning around
here
nuke goes down
very hot weather
prices tank
the transmission is controlled by utility rednecks who load up the capacity
driving up prices
and they release the capacity in mid trading
crushing the dailies
we cant buy transmission and hold it in this manner
pig forkers
anyway
i havent been accepted into the bubba club yet
but i'm still trying
presto and the other traders call my region
jimmy land
as most of the players are rednecks named jimmy
hope the wife and floyd are doing well
lot's of bad golf being played here
let me know when you are coming down
we will drink tequila at the cadillac bar
thanks for keeping me updated
jackie
seriously
how are things going in the homeland
are you glad to be back
let me know what
s happening
i havent talked to brother jimmy lately
he is not answering his phone here
say hello to the wife
we never hear from anyone in portland
knock em dead in your new job
bill
i talked with hans at the autohaus and he relayed that the car was in good shape
but did probably need a valve adjustment
as you relayed
maybe also an oil leak fixed
also
i asked him about the oil light and he seemed to think that the oil sensor needed replacing
the porsche certainly requires more attention than most cars
the clutch being a common and costly repair
the exterior of the car is in fair condition
maybe a detail shop could tell me whether some of the scratches could be buffed out
i'm not sure if you have checked into painting while you had the car
but you cant get it done inexpensively
i am still interested in the car and i would like my wife to be able to take a look at it
however
i am leaving town tomorrow and wont be back until sunday
maybe we can meet then
if our discussions progress and you havent already sold or traded in the car
i would like to have it checked out mechanically
at my cost
and would like a detail shop to give me an assessment of what they could do with the finish
i realize the car is not perfect and it is eleven years old
but it is a large investment
thanks
bill for your time
my cell number is 0-0-0
thanks for asking
things are still pretty tough here
but i determined to make it work
i am a director now
would your management be concerned about that
just curious
chuck
lee dean with primrose oil called our west desk to inquire about electricity service to their field in texas
his number is 0-0-0
if you could pass this along to the appropriate salesperson
i would appreciate it
thanks
things are going pretty well
balance of month trading $0.0 in entergy and it is going to be 0 degrees all of next week
i heard that pv is down and its 0,0 degrees in the desert
you guys must be busy
dave ryan called for mild in the northeast next week when earthsat was preaching hot
did really well on that deal as i was short balmo the cinergy
he's the man
this week
i saw swerzbee and motley at the k-derby
that was a good time
but it was bright sun and hot
while we were wearing the traditional suit and tie
there was a trader at the party that weighed about 0
he was wearing a black wool sportcoat and a khaki colored shirt
he tried to take his coat off but strangers were dogging him about his sweat rings
so he put it back on
poor bastard
louisville slugger factory and museum kicked ass
they had all the original bats from ty cobb
babe ruth
etc to current players
the have been custom making bats since like 0
good trip
see you there next year
bryan
please give me a call at 0-0 to arrange meeting
i am interested in obtaining parking in the new enron parking garage
i am currently in the kellogg building
thanks
john forney director
east power trading
elizabeth
my name is john forney and i am the new electricity cash trader in the entergy region
reporting to kevin presto
i received a letter agreement from entergy that seeks to clarify the entergy
into
definition
rogers herndon has relayed that we have tried to get them to transact under an eei agreement
where they have been willing to only operate under wspp
they are trying to get us to agree to use the wspp contract with eei liquidated damages language
i need to meet with you on this issue
rogers is available to anwer questions on the background of this
if necessary
thanks
joan
i left a message for you today concerning your e-mail
do you still need someone
i would like to ask you some specific questions again
so give me a call
i am at 0-0
thanks
thanks for checking
very unhappy with the situation here
very unprofessional and juvenile atmosphere
looking to leave the company if something doesnt open up internally
i have notified presto that i will be looking internally
i am talking to portland
as they want me back
i have been moved to the texas region to supply the texas choice and ees customers on an hourly basis
i would manage this desk and
once again
have an hourly crew
much the same as i did in california
that is not the job i signed up for when i moved 0,0 miles to houston
i have already been there
done that and i am not pleased about it so far
but it will be allright
if i did this job
it would become a big success and then i would have to hear about how lucky i was
i'll keep you posted
it's shit like this that keeps work interesting
thanks for listening on last week's phone call
i have been asked to help doug gilbert-smith get ercot off of the ground as far as services and hourly trading is concerned
if you have not heard
the entergy and tva cash trading positions will now be manned by one trader who will also trade the term markets
this will give the traders the leverage needed to create value in these respective regions
my inexperience in the term is the reason given for my implied demotion
although these moves opened up cash trading opportunities for other players
this had been the first month that i've had access to the prompt month and i am up nearly $0k
there is no doubt in my mind that i was going to beat this region into a profitable proposition
i have notified presto that i would be joining doug in ercot
but would be considering other options in houston
or even portland
i mentioned that i might call you and he has no problem with that
the job in houston may be a good opportunity
however
the environment here is not compatible with my personal and professional goals
i am looking for other opportunities
preferably within the company
if there are areas that you think might be a good match for my skill set
let me know
i would appreciate your consideration or suggestions
you certainly are under no obligation to do this
but i am confident that my track record will generate some interest within the company
possibly on the retail side
thanks for your time
frank
i am interested in speaking with you further concerning investment opportunities
although you mentioned that the $0,0
the amount in my account
is a small sum
i have been reluctant to invest more money with your firm
given to performance of the suggestions provided previously
i have been a market maker in the electricity business and i realize that no one is right all of the time
i dont expect this
however
i do expect some consistent contact from a broker who has been successful in his own trading
not just success in brokering trades
my view will be that the more success we have
the more money i will be willing to invest
i am interested in discussing my specific financial situation with you and learning more about you
your track record and your abilities
i do wish to talk about covered calls on specific options that i have expiring in january
i would also like to discuss any other profitable ideas that fit my profile
i will not use your suggestions to trade at discount brokerage or otherwise abuse our potential relationship
i look forward to hearing from you
kim
i'm sorry i did not get to come to your open house
i got the message on the day of the party and i forgot to rsvp that i couldnt attend
i am a jackass
but you knew that already
hope all went well
how's the new job
i have relocated from the west desk in portland oregon and have been advised by our legal dept
that i should not delete any e-mails until further notice
please advise
thanks for handling this
jim flores
did he also work in finance
i dont remember him
how is it going with baby wolf
i want to make sure everything is ok before i call him
done any good deals lately
at least tell me about hiking
kim
i need to speak with you at your earliest convenience
please call me at 0-0
thanks
it's a power thang
i will be attending a funeral tomorrow
but i am available to meet on tuesday
thank you for checking back with me
kim
can we meet around noon
that would be fine
just give me a call and let me know when you can meet
you are down
hey
looks like i will be returning to portland
they want me back and it is a much better place to work
hr is wanting me to consider other opportunities in houston
however
they have one week to come up with something
otherwise i'm outta here
other companies are paying ridiculous sums to experienced west traders
california experience
thanks for considering me for your group and i'll keep you updated
kim
thanks for spending time with me yesterday
i have spoken with tom may concerning what my status was
i mentioned that my preference would be to return to portland
however
i would be considering other options within the company for one week
my thought was that i need to relay this same message to presto
doug and lloyd
i will communicate this today
unless you have other ideas
as discussed
i have attached a copy of my resume
it is getting kind of long
but i havent really gotten a chance to
abbreviate
thanks again for helping
it looks like we will be moving back to portland before summer starts
the job didnt turn out as promised and i was put into a role that i didnt want
oh well
the portland team still wants me and has offered 0 different roles to choose from
you cant beat that
anyway
i will let you know how it turns out
i will come by sometime after 0:0 am if that is okay
thanks
congrats to you and your wife on your new arrival
hope she's a good sleeper
now at least you can field some different questions
how is the baby
versus
where is the baby
but
as kim used to say
enough about you
let's talk about me
i spoke with tim b again and he is agreeable to the idea of my return
he mentioned that west has needs in services
middle mkt
sw and even structuring
i think that i would be a good fit in mid mkt
as i could build upon my experience and also learn as much of the structuring side as possible
wherever i go
i am ready to make an impact
the hr department here in houston wants me to entertain other opportunities within houston and they have brought some things before me today
i had also considered staying and building the ercot business here
as there is a huge need for leadership in this area
however
real time roles are very hard to shed around here and i am apprehensive about being a commercial director managing real time
i have no doubt that i could make a huge difference here
but a lot of time would have to be wasted defending the group and myself
anyway
i wish we could sit down
have a beer and discuss
but that's probably not practical
belden says to talk with you about the needs of the floor and get some idea where the ideal fit might be
i know that you are out of the office
but give me an e-mail when you get a chance
thanks
amy
hope everything is going well with you
i dont know if tim has talked with you
but i am considering returning to portland
i am talking with wolfe and tim
but i would like to keep things low key
i know this all seems pretty weird
but my situation has changed so drastically that i have some major
immediate decisions to make
basically
the east desk wants me to build a team in real time
similar to how we did it in portland
unfortunately
that was not the job i agreed to take
always get it in writing
i never could
had i known that it was a similar position to what i had
i never would have left
anyway
kim melodick wants me to consider opportunities within enron houston and i have agreed to give her a week to see if a fit exists
she is easy to work with and is being very helpful
however
i have expressed to kevin and kim that my first preference would be to return to portland
i have given this some thought and believe that taking the real time position would not be a good move for me
given the atmosphere here
i would like to have a new perspective on this if you have time to converse
i would appreciate any feedback that you can give me
thanks
i
bart
jeff passed on your e-mail
too bad about the beetles
is that the taylor high school mascot
taylor
home of the fighting beetles
go beetles
i think you are right about ercot being difficult to set up
but it just reemphasizes the need for you
they need an organizer and this situation fits your strengths
well
enough about you
let's talk about me
the entergy gig was made more difficult
as i received no training in cash trading
after a couple of months
a coworker took me in and gave me some pointers on hedging
which is especially important in my region
the month of may was very profitable
finally
and things were coming together until
please keep this confidential
presto called me in to tell me that i was moving to ercot as manager of the real time group
his decision being final
no negotiations
thanks for your understanding
bunghole
i had previously turned down several attempts to bring me back to texas in this capacity and i expressed that i was less than happy with his decision
i think that ercot will be busy and a worthwhile region to be involved with
given that we have retail load to service
etc
however
thats not the job that i agreed to move 0 miles for
i suspect other changes would ensue
once i established this region
so
it looks like i will be returning to portland
we bought a new house here and are very happy with everything
except my job
which is a huge thing
i may be working west mid mkt sw or doing something with the service desk
i dont mind doing anything as long as it's productive
anyway
i was pissed in the beginning
but i had to take time to digest this
analyze the opportunity and make an informed unemotional decision
i am too deep in the
out of the money
options to cut and run
so it now boils down to where do i want to live
there is interest outside of the company in me
but i am under contract
i miss portland and i think about it all the time
i must be a mountain man at heart
well
let me know if you have any thoughts on the above
once again
i dont wish to have this get out to anyone on the west desk
just yet
i heard that you did really well on your home sale
that's awesome
maybe i can buy back my house and my boat
just kidding
i am actually more concerned about buying another boat than i am a house
how is your housing in taylor
i miss the beer in pdx
boating and the winter bowling
it is freaking hot here in texas
anyway
keep kicking butt and keep those texans in line
kim
my relo expenses have not been turned in as yet
do i turn those in to you
i am due the closing costs
etc
due to my move from portland
also
johnny palmer was very pleasant to speak with
i appreciate the effort that you have made in trying to generate interest in me from the inside
johnny
however
was not optimistic that he had anything available for a director level position
i have been talking with portland
greg wolfe
tim belden
and amy fitzpatrick
if nothing opens up here by wednesday
i need to get out to the west and start training so that i can make some money for the company
i am still building
staffing
trading for the ercot region
but i am eager to go quickly if no one wants me in houston
thanks
brett
have heard that platter was given trading responsibility on eol for offpeak california and other markets
i heard he has done an awesome job and richter
the gang are really happy with him
he is motivated and challenged
which is what he needed
as far as timing
i dont know yet
could be next week or next month
i kind of wanted to work on the ercot desk
but not for presto
anyway
keep in touch you wino
kim
i spoke with cammi mursch with the outside relo company
she said she is handling my account and i should send her my expenses for reimbursement
i think that this will take care of me
thanks
linus
check this out
go under texas city and you can get some good webcam action
wind speed and direction
also
you can call one of the bait camps and get directions
the opportunity here has been enhanced
in addition to managing rt
i would be managing all of the service assets in texas
this includes trading around a 0 mw plant
serving ees and new power company loads
and also the potential for managing a new 0 mw full requirements deal
of course
i would have to have all of this in writing
i would be working with the texas term trader to enhance my trading skills in order to effectively manage this position
this makes the offer more attractive
but still i would be in houston
i am still apprehensive of the bait
switch exposure
what do you think
please note that when you start/stop a schedule to or from the following control areas
the listed static scheduling fee applies
for example
if we schedule for one hour from bec>coa
the one-time charge for scheduling alone would be a flat $0
also applicable would be the per mw line losses and the wheeling fee of $.0
please account for all such charges in the p&l report
thanks
andrea
please see the attached spreadsheet for friday
all of the deals listed have been moved to teco services for this day only
we entered a buy
which is an estimate of the cost of gen
and the appropriate sales
we need to talk about how this gets reconciled
i would like to know the detail of this transaction
i know that not everything has been discussed with this account
so i would like to discuss it
i am positive that i need to change all deals for over the weekend
we had some length for this customer that was sold hourly
i assume that everything from now on will be entered under teco services for this account
can you think of any exceptions
i will let you know when the weekend is complete
thanks
i still have a need for an analyst within the group
preferably for a one year rotation
thanks
clinton
due to the flood
our phones rolled over to the portland office on saturday
geir solberg sold hours 0-0
0 mw's each hour to cscs for $0
i have entered the deals today and they are as follows
frontera
deal no
0
entered under teco services book aep deal no
0
also entered under teco services
i dont know how the reconciliation of this services book takes place
i am working on some procedures and need some input
lets party
lloyd
do i need to input security requests for this guy to get enpower
telephone
etc
im sure glad that the concert was cancelled because i had the worst hangover ever
check these
photos out
was tom pissed
whats up
can i get a copy of your group's expectations
i need to also discuss with you the duties of all the night guys
as i understand it
they all pitch in to do confirms and they unofficially cross-train in other regions
what about reconciliation reports
what is required
what other reports need to be tied out
the sched activity report vs
the p&l sheet
michael
we checked with reliant personnel and they dont know anything abuot the fees that we discussed
that's not suprising
however
does reliant bill this directly or does the ercot iso bill this to us
what is the reason for this fee
thanks
hey lloyd
as you know
joe and steve spent a considerable amount of time here last weekend due to the flood
i would think that some recognition would be in order
how about a personal best of $0
or a gift certificate
etc
what do you think
cool
fyi
please see the attached site
the logon for this is
ljester password is
0zpzz you can copy existing oasis requests or create new
here it is
okay
so we now have a procedure
i will broadcast to the group and see that it is implemented
i still havent completed all of their discrepancy checkout
i have been working nights through the weekend and tonite
i will address these on tuesday
clint will be helping me to resolve these and future issues
thanks
i agreed to stay through the end of the year
february
to get this project off of the ground
what i get in return is the responsibilty of trading around our assets in texas
a 0 mw unit
frontera
and a 0 mw heat rate call from the city of austin
i have asked that these responsibilities be officially committed to writing
it is too late in the year for me to move to portland
get out and make a contribution for the summer
these guys are in terrible shape here
and i am needed
i report to lloyd will
who is a great guy
i am working with doug gilbert-smith
who is the ercot term trader
he has agreed to share some of his knowledge with me and i am spending time with the gen group to learn more about the steel
i will be working with miller and smith
weeeeeelllll
this was the best option for me at this time
and also for the company
i will be leaving the main office in february
whether it is with enron or not
i would prefer to stay with the company
as my options are worth zero at the moment
we still want to return to portland
but right now i am needed here
thanks for checking
let me know when you are coming down
but dont bring your sweater
hope things are going well for you and your group
i'll give you a call later and tell you what's what
hey
i never used to say that
you were stereotyping
later
the turrrets are programmed in the order of personal preference
however
you can use someone's while they are gone
i will get you access to watt's or eric's
thanks
juan
check this out
we have four direct lines to the ercot iso that have been installed on each of your turrets
as an iso participant
we are required to be staffed 0-0 to handle any request from the iso concerning our generation
or to handle contingencies related to our preschedules
if any of these lines should ring
we need to be sure to pick it up
ercot may just be testing our responsiveness
or
they may have a specific question about the mock market that is taking place now
any questions that cannot be immediately answered should be relayed to smith day or myself
we will be installing hardware soon that will receive generation instructions from the iso
for rt purposes
this will be used for billing purposes
any action ordered by the iso will also be communicated to the control room simultaneously
they will be responsible for the actual dispatch of the unit
we will be announcing a meeting soon to describe our new ercot world and to exchange ideas
i would also like to have a session with the group to explain the logic behind the reports we are responsible and to explain how the whole floor works
this can be a broad overview
or we can drill down to specifics at your request
thanks for your attention
remember how bad t.a
reported that we all were on putting cuts into the system
enpower work
reconciliation
etc
these guys do none of that
no one even knows how
settlements is working hard
but ta doesnt say a word to the rt traders here
as it would be political suicide
that's why she turned toward us
she is supposed to be our rep to the iso
and i talked to her
explaining my expectations
she was squirming about saying that she or rebecca wouldnt know the answers
im cool with that
but cant you find out
everything is such a big struggle here
im not coming until february at the earliest
i am an oregonian
the freaking mosquitos are terrible now that the floodwaters have subsided
i forgot about that bit of joy
later
that's allright
go ahead and cancel my order
thanks
as you know
the frontera status screen goes away at night
as the flat screens are taken down
you can find the same screen on the east power portal under frontera production summary
save the attached link if you dont have already
lloyd
thanks for your help on this issue
sorry for the delayed response
i think i have my facts somewhat straight
but i am available to answer questions
just a quick note to acknowledge the great job that geir solberg did in helping our office out during tropical storm allison
our phone lines
computers and cell phones were down
additionally
we were short staffed due to floodwaters downtown
one of our service customers
teco
wanted to sell some test power in south texas
geir was contacted via satellite phone
he sold 0 megawatts each hour to aep
he used the proper terminology unique to ercot and sold the energy at a decent price
he maintained good
detailed notes and was able to relay this information to me the following monday
most importantly
this was a seamless transaction to the customer
again
thanks for the help
whoa
that is way too high for yesterday
please hold the presses before this gets billed to us
amy
i have elected to stay in houston until at least february
it is so late in the year
that i may not be immediately effective in the west and i would have
lost
the first part of this year
as i was training
myself
there is a huge need for me here and i am trying to do what's right for both e and myself
to that end
lloyd will has offered me an opportunity to trade around enron's assets in texas
learning the term trading side of the business from doug gilbert-smith
both doug and lloyd know my circumstances and their proposal gets me the experience that i need
while they get my experience in services
training
managing a team and making money in a pool type market
as exists in texas
these opportunities were presented to me only after i stated emphatically that i was returning to portland
i would still like to live in portland as early as february
i realize that a seat wont be held open for anyone
and i will revisit this issue in feb
this compromise seems reasonable
i have asked that this be committed to writing
so i am editing what lloyd has created concerning job responsibilities
additionally
most junior people are dissatisfied here and the bottom line reason
they dont know how their job relates to the entire floor making money
this explanation to them and an acknowledement of their contribution will bring the ideas forth from the
back corner
the senior traders say aloud that they dont need anyone
and they will make their money with or without help
a particular trader antagonizes until someone stands up to him
then he has them sent home
i think that there are three real timers at home at full pay right now
one or two will be paid for two years
or so i'm told
this type behavior is allowed as the trader makes a great amount of money for the company
this is not an unusual occurence on trade floors
but i will not be any part of it
i am going to spend this time to try to make some difference in this culture
if we dont get buy in from the top
i will also be at risk of going home
some of these guys just dont get it
there are
however
many positives to staying here
the guys i report to are like-minded concerning the above
they are very competent and have a lot to teach
they are willing to teach
i am excited about learning something new and also being able to lead a team
well
thanks for listening to my sermon
sister amy
my wife and i miss portland and will probably be back next year
hopefully there will still be opportunity for me at that time
if you have any thoughts or advice
please share
as i have alot of exposure this year
due to the move and subsequent reorg
later
always up for coffee
good thought
i sent a separate e-mail to tim belden
greg wolfe and geir's supervisor bill williams iii
chris
i think we already discussed this issue but let me summarize what i think happened
we were parking 0 mw's with cob
we sold 0 to reliant/hlp
but the transmission got cut
0 mw's flowed on oasis 0 to reliant
we show in the system that we are purchasing 0 mw's from cob and selling them 0
so
i dont think that we needed to bookout 0 mw's with hlp
they received 0 mw's from city of bryan on deal #0
you entered a bookout purchase on deal #0
oasis also shows that 0 mw's flowed on #0
so once again
we have an extra purchase from hlp that we didnt need
did you negotiate this with hlp
is this what happened
i'll talk to you about this tonight
thanks
mw
lisa
i will be out of the office for one half day on friday and a full day on monday
can you list my monday time as my floating holiday
i will obviously not be able to attend the meeting at 0pm
but i am available by cell
cool
i can meet for coffee anytime
lunch is tough
but i will keep in touch
thanks
i have one half day of vacation tomorrow and i'm out on monday
as you can see
i am still a slacker
no
really we havent been anywhere since we moved back in january
we are going to austin this weekend to play some golf
houston is not that scenic
so i'm heading out
i am very interested and i will be available at any time for training
hey
what's the latest in the service world
i am working with tom may on services in ercot in addition to my ercot iso duties
how does the price cap crap work
does this have opportunity for us on the service side or does this kick us in the face
lloyd
would it make sense to press our ees/west point guys to a decision
we should express that we want to hire internally
however
we do have external candidates that we are considering
the reliant guy
ryan thomas
was a good interview and seems to have something positive to prove
i believe that hr has some specific questions that they wish us to ask regarding his employment at reliant
also
ees is petitioning kevin for me to let watt's go right now
i have indicated to terry donavan that mid july would be preferable due to our being already short staffed
let me know your thoughts on this when you get the chance
i will be out of the office for half day friday and all day on monday
thanks
talking with bryan right now
done before weekend
greetings
i have attached the most basic expectations for our group
we have been spending a lot of time balancing the books lately
and the attached will relieve some of this
so we can focus on trading
i will make sure that we receive balanced books from day ahead trading/scheduling
also
make an effort to know why we run reports
etc
so that you can make suggestions to streamline this operation
i will provide more documented general procedures and will spend time with each of you on how to handle cuts in enpower and lotus notes
we have a good group and we will do well in the new market
however
this will take an extra effort from each of us
if you have questions about any of the expectations
ask
that is why we make the list
thanks
check it out
if you trade days with anyone
make sure they have a similar skillset
ie
dont trade with the new guy to fill a night shift alone
thanks
thank you
find the attached files and links
yes i can
i have already started working on this
chris watts will help me get this sorted out ultimately
sorry for the imbalance
you should see drastic improvement from our side effective immediately
have a good weekend
chris
i had tried to reconstruct sunday the 0th based upon your notes
but was unsuccessful
i am going to need you to spend some time straightening this out
enpower is out of balance and the books are as well
risk management/settlements wants this balanced
as we cannot tie out with our customers
we will probably need to restore enpower to precut status
then initiate the proper deal entry to handle the cuts that came in
you mention inadvertancy in your notes
but i dont know the particulars of this problem
i'm sure you are aware that every cut needs to be reflected in enpower
if you were in balance when you arrived for your shift
then you should be in balance when you leave
the real time position manager is used to check whether this happened or not
give me a call to straighten this out
lloyd
this is the guy i was talking about last week
kevin seemed to think he would be good on the retail side
i can answer any questions that may arise
or
i can put you in touch with saji
thanks
please see the attached list
if you have questions
please call
thanks
alex
please see the logon for the
traditional
ercot oasis listed below
use this login until the ercot iso is in effect
you have been invited to attend a team building outing that is sponsored by the service desk
game time is usually around 0:0 pm and we will be having drinks at cabo around 0 pm
i hope that you can make it
let me know by this friday
june 0th
whether you will attend
thanks
lets party
we have created a quick quide to do qse trades through the ercot portal
this initial guide should get you started
however
this is not a comprehensive handout that contemplates every situation
i am asking you to read the rules and implement a trade using the portal
as you have noticed
our counterparties have already started trading two hours out
we will be trading paralell until the iso rolls out for friday
this means that you will have to submit the
traditional
ercot oasis and also submit the qse trade
we must monitor to make sure that our counterparties have submitted their matching qse trades
as well
otherwise we will be out of balance with ercot
a copy of our qse quide will be in your inbox
make sure that you read
study it and ask questions
thanks
chris
good questions
0
you are fine using ercot system as the delivery opint until the ercot iso opens on july 0th
subsequent to that
we will enter the appropriate zone for each purchase or sale as west
north or south zone
if we wish to schedule mw's across a path
ie south to north
we will need to create an ercot transmission deal to link south>north
we do not actually do an ercot oasis
etc
to buy this transmission
rather
this is a way to reflect the desired pathing internally
risk management is creating this internal transmission counterparty for us
i will let you know what it is called
0
the positions that we manage for frontera/teco services should not be reflected in the p&l sheet
as we had been doing
my fault for not knowing the process as agreed to previously with settlements
risk mgmt
we are to keep these deals in the services p&l sheet
as real time has done for mdea
the location for this spreadsheet is
we will request access to this tool for everyone
thanks
dave
its good to hear from you
we are in houston and its hot
my wife is doing great and we are still trying to get used to life in houston
i am trading in ercot region
texas
and
of course
brett is now working at the iso
my wife and i miss portland working in the main office isnt as much fun as working in portland
there is a good chance that i will return to pdx
as there are so many good people there and so much to do outdoors
so
tell me what you are doing now in phoenix
everyone that i've met from srp has been very nice
perry
john sullivan
etc
hope you enjoy working there and all is well with your family
bobby
i came really
really close to coming back to portland
i was recently asked to help get the ercot
texas
region off of the ground by organizing
training and motivating the real time group
i declined initially
as i had previously turned this job down from portland
i came to houston to trade cash
bait and switch
anyway
i was looking to return to pdx to work in mid mkt or services
wherever i could have an impact
positive impact
jackie
once i expressed to houston that my bags were packed
more opportunity presented itself
i am going to get experience in managing our assets in texas
we have an agreement with teco to manage a 0 mw combined cycle facility in south texas
we have some other interesting arrangements as well
i will be working with doug gilbert-smith
who is the term trader in ercot
good
solid technical guy
these guys are in a tight spot and due to the timing of all of this
i agreed to finish the rest of the year in houston and get this thing up and running
ercot is currently not short nor volatile
not much fun yet
we'll see how the pool works
i am working with smith and jeff miller as well
for all of its sound
fury and ego's the houston office is actually disorganized and short on morale
my transition could have been handled better by a monkey man
my gut tells me that if i stay with the company
i will be moving back to portland early next year if they will have me
let me know when you will be in town and i'll set up some golf and margaritas
no boat anymore
i'm bumming a ride with my friends
later
dave
i should have been more specific
brett is working at the ercot iso
near austin texas
his e-mail address is below
thanks
my desk is available for training purposes at night or weekends
however
i am missing my notebook and my tradelog
frequently things are moved and i have a hard time finding such items as listed above
if you use my desk and you need to move my notebook
etc
then place them in my desk drawer or somewhere else that makes sense
thanks
you are done on those dates
thanks for being specific
sorry that johnny had not spoken with me
but it will work out okay
it seemed like you were needing some additional days off in july
is that right
hope your training with errigo went well this weekend
this is good info to know
smitty
i havent been aware that we were to be
on notice

tony
my logon and password
thanks
check out this site
dont look for job opportunities
however
settlements and risk have blessed our version of the procedures
now we need to run this by teco
should i call frank busot to discuss
or is this an item for discussion in the meeting on tuesday
we have already received their invoice for june and they have again invoiced us at the sales price
rather than the minimum market price
i will be involving clint in the reconciliation to give him some exposure to this side
what do you think
can you price a flight for me to tampa that would leave from hobby airport
the meetnig is on tuesday and i could leave either monday night or tuesday morning
i could take an afternoon flight from tampa to houston hobby
thanks
brett
i have a business question
for a change
ercot load is forecast to be as high as 0,0 for hour ending 0 today
the actual printed from the website is less than 0,0
i know that there is south to north congestion
but is this actual load right
is interruptible load being curtailed due to the congestion or is their rain somewhere that isnt showing on our weathermap
any help you can give would be appreciated
i dont think that this is proprietary info or anything
i am trying to see if the forecast is worthless
thanks
please make the following arrangements for me in order to join tom and jeff in tampa for the teco meeting
0/0
depart hobby to tampa at 0:0pm flight
stay at hyatt
jeff miller has made the arrangements already
0/0
depart tampa 0:0
arrive houston 0:0pm
i will be calling on friday to check on this
remember
i will be on vacation friday and monday
i was scheduled to take tuesday off
but i will have to attend this meeting
please do not schedule a vacation day for me on tuesday
thanks
thanks for remembering me
hope everythnig is well with you too
lloyd
a couple of questions
will joe capasso be aggreeable to start in my group on august 0st
that would be awesome
let me know if i can help with anything on this what is the status of the personal best award recommendation for errigo and olinde
thanks
please use the following
office
0-0-0
should roll over to his cell after hours
second line in home
0-0-0 we have had problems locating jerry on occasion in order to affect schedule changes
he lives in a rural area and his cell phone doesnt always work
in these instances
we tried to contact the plant to instruct them to increase/decrease generation
they have refused in the past
as they were only to receive instruction from jerry
the plant should now be aware that this communication problem can exist and will be receptive to making generation changes per our instructions
lloyd
here is another bryan guy
pretty much the same length of service as kevin
stephanie mchargue will be backing up jerry watson this weekend
she will be another contact person available to us if we cannot contact jerry
her numbers
cell
0-0-0 home
0-0-0 pager
0-0-0 remember to call her this weekend with any frontera changes
thanks
alex doesnt have access to lotus notes
can we get a request in for him
we use notes to communicate within the scheduling and rt groups
thanks
from time to time we have applicants from other shops that interview with our desk for rt trading
scheduling
or other positions
if you recognize someone from another firm
or know who they are
do not discuss their interest in enron with anyone else
recently
we have had two applicants who have reported that others at their firm knew that they had interviewed with enron
both felt that someone in this shop had discussed their visit here
totally unacceptable
i have to ensure that this information is not coming from my group
hence this note
common sense would dictate that discretion is necessary in these situations
if you have any feedback on this situation i would like to hear it
thanks for your attention to this very important issue
steve
check this out
does this have any truth to it
corry
can you add me as a trader in enpower under ercot asset
also
please add alex mcelreath as a trader under teco services
additionally
alex is not able to get into lotus notes and
ultimately
east power scheduling discussion
jeff miller needs access to east power discussion
he has lotus notes
thanks
lloyd
i spoke with steve directly about kevin's e-mail and concerns
steve said that dan of c.o.b contacted him
inquiring about job opportunities here
steve did mention to dan that
someone
from their shop had already inquired
he was not specific
dan
evidently
figured who this was
not very hard
and spread the word at the cob office
subsequently
dan and brandon sent their resumes
i have spoken directly with steve about this issue
i also have put out a note to the group which i copied you on
clearly
this is unacceptable and steve has apologized
how do you feel about this
if we hire kevin
then this problem somewhat goes away
i need someone immediately and kevin could be plugged right in
similar to alex
i know that kevin may not be a solid fit for the trader track program
but i am needing some help pretty quick
let me know
sorry for the very awkward situation
had to copy you on this
dont be offended
my friend is from shreveport
jerry
take a look and check to see if i missed anything
also
i would assume that you have some additional energy to sell for hour ending 0&0 and he 0
is that true
thanks
jerry
lets try this one
i am scheduled to be out of the office for a few days in late august
the dates are specifically 0/0
0 and 0th
thanks
lloyd
do you have time to meet with george at noon today
i am going to talk with him again at this time
michael
how do you know which deals are the options if they are entered as forwards
i input into the comments
but i was about to ask how these options get trued up
thanks
hour ending 0 for 0 mw's has been confirmed with hlp
he 0 was 0 mw's originally
but was cut intra hour
the integrate mw's are 0mw'w and are reflected on revised oasis request 0
hlp agrees with this
amy
how's it going
i was wondering how jeremy was doing
is there anything i can help with on an
unofficial
basis
it would seem that he has a decision to make
though i havent heard of his progress lately
did you have your vacation yet
lloyd
george has departed for his planned vacation
he will be back on the 0th
per his voice mail
i bring him in at that time
please see the attached that weve discussed
please note what is contained on the sheets on the bottom of the tool
thanks
we must notify the control room
genco
personnel concerning any deviation from the preschedule
for example
when we have availability
or even
must sell
situations off of frontera
the control room must revise their resource plan
they need to revise in order to prevent an area control error problem
they have the same deadline
two hours before hour ending
that we face in submitting qse trades
give them timely info so that they can get their side in
for now
you can use the stento
dial 0 0
or telephone 0-0-0
of course
you can just knock on the door
in ercot only
we are allowed to exchange information with the control room
no other region has this capability
thanks
pete
do me a favor
e-mail me your question and i'll work to get an
official
answer
remember that although we will get an answer
the invoice may appear somewhat different
of course
the tariff overrules any answer that we may receive
thanks
the internet address for the ercot portal
samuel
please add the following names to the list of traders that have access to the new ercot imbalance and epmi ercotpool counterparties
eric saibi alex mcelreath joe errigo steve olinde joe capasso jeff miller we will need to add more in the near future
please let me know when this is completed
thanks
george
give me a call and we will further discuss opportunities on the 0st floor
thanks
when do you want to come
the wife and i are expecting you and richter this week
i will be working some nasty hours this week due to the new market opening
let me know
lloyd
we received this from preston
everyone on this distribution list would assume that ees is waiting on information from us
we are still awaiting meaningful data from narsimha/preston
i am going to discuss this with narsimha
i feel like a reply is warranted
as we are making no headway on this project
i fear for preston if he is to work with me in the future
lloyd
fyi
rogers
customers call quite often to inquire about retail service
is there a single contact person that we can transfer them to
i talk to someone different each time from ees
i'd like to get a procedure in place for the floor so no one gets lost frmo the outside
let me know what you think
hourly deals should be under teco svc the majority of the time
however
at times enron's option
under ercot asset book
will be long into the real time market
this is frontera generation
but enron bought it in the form of the option
you will see deals of this type for today under the ercot asset
so hourly deals
teco services
0% of time

i received this from preston
it appears now that they wish to choose the customers that will switch
we were of the understanding that we were to pick the customer based upon the information that ees was to provide
we havent received the necessary information
so no choice has been made yet
please see the attached and let me know your comments
scott
i heard that the tpc was in decent shape
are you planning on playing on saturday in the morning or afternoon
how many people do you have in the group
see the attached megawatt awards for tomorrow
we are talking with the ercot staff regarding the settlement of this and the oom
out of merit
decrease for today
it is our understanding
per the protocols
that when we are dispatched down the iso keeps our $0 scheduled sale whole
we are paid this revenue stream
by our sale counterparty
plus the greater of
the applicable balancing energy price for that hour or zero
if you are decreased by 0 mw's for an hour you receive
$0 sale + balancing $0.0 = 0.0/mw for not running your plant
for the capacity tomorrow
we will reserve the mw's below and possibly sell the rest
the resource plan is increased to reflect 0 mw's plus the awarded megs for each hour
the ems will only show 0 mw until we get deployed
at the time of deployment
we also receive the balancing energy price for the hour exercised
we bid in a non-spin product which requires us to respond within 0
they can take partial hours
at their option
i hope this helps
director
epmi
jerry
please disregard the explanation of the oom power settlement
the iso called us at 0:0 pm and explained a different scenario altogether
we need to discuss this further
sorry for the confusion
ben
could you come by
i have a question about rearranging our phone turrets
thanks
scott

wont you take the final prints for each day and calc profitability for me
or how do you do this
please give me some money
how was the tradition course
are you golfed out yet
i didnt do anything saturday night
rebecca
we have heard that the resource imbalance was pretty high
we will discuss this with you
we definitely dont want to talk to teco/frontera until we get a handle on this
we will come by this afternoon
i left you a request over a week ago concerning clarification of your question
could you please present your question in written form as a reply to this e-mail
if i cannot answer the question
then i will get an answer from our ercot rep
the ercot settlement statements have just arrived and we are breaking them down to ensure that they protocols are being followed
this is what is complicated as ercot doesnt yet know their own rules
let me know what you have
johnny
what is the status of george
i think that you have been speaking with lloyd will concerning bringing him over from ees
george is inquiring about his status and wants to know whether he should mention anything to ees
i would think not
at this time
lloyd is out of town until monday
so i am trying to follow up on his behalf
thanks
johnny
i just received this from lloyd
i dont want to cause any double coverage by hr
so you might want to check with kim
thanks
mark
i called earlier today and left a lengthy phone message
sorry about that
we had a trading issue in the middle of my conversation with you
anyway
i received the following question from some of our retail folks
if you could help answer this question i would really appreciate it
jeff miller and i are planning to visit austin next friday to discuss settlements
we look forward to meeting you
are you a golfer
we may try to play friday afternoon
here you go
there is no banking mechanism
if a&b are net long
they receive the balancing energy price for all of their mw's
if c
d are short
then their short position is covered by the ercot iso
c
d are charged the balancing energy price plus replacement reserve
mw
if the money
at the end of the day
is insufficient to pay a&b
then this full cost will be allocated on a load share ratio basis
this charge will be allocated under the ufe
unaccounted for energy
charge type
if c
d serve load
then they will share the expense of paying for the balancing energy price to a
b
a
b escapes this expense allocation
as they do not serve load
kim
keenon has been recommended to doug as a possiblity in rt
i think our roster has been filled out
however
i had promised this guy an interview before i knew that lloyd had lifted some people
can we schedule an interview with keenon
as i think that he is a strong prospect
i will send you a copy of his resume via office mail
he can be reached at 0-0-0
please let me know what you think
thanks
doug
i am planning on attending this settlements deal
we plan on meeting mark patterson there
forney
john m
i am planning on attending
rebecca
pls see the attached for our expectation of imbalance for 0/0
ercot is now requiring that we fill out and fax the attached form to them when we have imported/exported across one of the dc ties
the file is located in
please update tag number
megawatts
positive for exports
negative for imports
and total number of schedules
thanks lance
i have a question
on the ercot transmission outage page
the tu bellmead station is listed as having trouble
the buss is damaged due to storm
is this the reason that there are tu csc's
as mentioned on the ercot conference call
the station is to be out until august 0th
we have had a significant price split and i think that this might be the specific reason
i have tried powerworld
but i couldnt turn off this station
what do you think
attention
the ercot iso has been settling our trades scheduled to the north by giving us the west or south balancing energy price
we have officially disputed this allocation
as we believe that we would
at most
incur a load deviation imbalance in the north zone
to be settled in the north
again
a purchase in the south scheduled to our load in the north is receiving the south or west prices
we are awaiting ercot's explanation
until further notice
do not schedule energy from the south or west to the north
you may still engage in intrazonal
or same zone
trades
qse to qse
what is permitted is imported from outside ercot into the north zone
the dc tie is in the north and we should stay aggressive
working with the spp team to secure transmission to and from ercot
when in doubt
wake me up
update
at 0 pm
our rep from ercot agreed that the schedule mentioned above should have load imbalance assessed at the north price
however
i still cannot accept his answer as the gospel
as any written interpretation of their tariff will always overrule our guy
i will advise when it is safe to re-enter the water
but for now
everybody out of the pool
never feed stray animals
they keep coming back
we are required to input down balancing bids for all generators that we represent
every morning it is especially important that we have a dbes bid input for frontera
we should have balancing bids in for all hours
but we are most likely to be deployed in the morning hours
we are required to monitor the deployment instructions and communicate any instructions to jerry watson @ teco/frontera
frontera is willing to pay a max of $0 to decrease their gen
this bid tells ercot that we are willing to pay up to $0 for ercot to fill our schedule during the time that we are being
balanced down
we should never see prices below $0 without being deployed down
if this situation happens
we have to explain to frontera why we didnt get selected by the iso
this is an important part of the services side of our business
and is the only way that we get paid on these type transactions
if anyone has any questions on this
please give me a call as this is very important to all of us
lloyd
do you want to answer george's questions
or do you want me to handle this
samuel
the traders listed above are not valid in enpower as traders under the following books
ercot hourly teco services please have them added asap
or if you could
let me know who is responsible for making this change
thanks samuel
take a look at this
add or format
add to letterhead
etc
as necessary
let me know what you think
i will not be in the office on thursday or friday
i will be attending a meeting in austin
i will be attending ercot meetings in austin thursday and friday of this week
i can be reached by cell phone
thanks
please see the attached thanks
doing well in the book
spread options coming in well
real time going very well
same old stuff
very much deja vu
golf is very good
as i get to play more often
how is it going for you
i can meet with keenon today or tomorrow
i will be out of the office wed-fri
thanks
0.0 pm is fine
ercot has a problem that could cause us great financial pain
sometimes when we are submitting an hourly schedule
through the ercot portal
the day-ahead schedules are affected
mismatches for every counterparty occur
we are subject to the hourly price for mismatches and this could prove extremely costly
even for one hour
eric saibi spoke with the ercot help desk who indicated that the problem was on our side
i called ercot and after some time
they relayed that they were experiencing server problems
attached below is the ticket number related to this problem
if this occurs again
make sure that you reference this number
thanks
erik
i will be available earlier than 0:0 for an informal discussion
i will be in the office monday and tuesday of this week
i will be out the remainder of the week on vacation
let me know if this works
george
i have been out of the office on ercot business since thursday of last week
sorry for the delay
lloyd and i would like for your start date to be on september 0st
if possible
actually
two weeks notice would fall on september 0rd
i believe
thanks
david
we often trade with epmi
as they may be the best bid on any given day
so
the language should apply
today would be fine
between 0-0pm
i can sit with you for an informal meeting and see where it goes
i am located at 0e
thanks
that is fine
was this not cancelled
can we get together to discuss how best to serve your retail load
i think this simple process has been complicated by the number of players involved
we will give you any structure that you need and provide transparency as to how we do what we do
what more is there
i have heard that this could start as early as september
but we are still a bit short on detail
if we started in september
i would envision passing local charges
congestion
etc to ees
we would schedule your hedges
your load and cover any remaining balance
or not
with respect to load zone
we would provide scheduling services
settlements and 0 hour coverage to handle any contingencies that might occur
i look forward to working with you on this issue
give me a call when you get a chance
thanks
i played the last four days
barton creek in austin colovista in bastrop
near austin
fish creek fish creek yesterday
i am hitting the ball alot better and starting to make some putts
i wont be around this weekend
as i am vacationing down in south padre island for the next few days
we need to take that boat out so i can show you around galveston
fishing is good and you can pull up to certain restaraunts on the water
let me know when you wanna go
we have not scheduled this load as of yet
i met with narasimha yesterday in order to cut through the b.s
and get at least a rudimentary plan in place
here it is
by 0am
ees submits to us their load plan
hedges
ees to use their forecast initially
we cover open position and submit schedules to ercot we monitor real time and handle continigencies wholesale settlement provided
ancillary service charges
local congestion
etc is to be passed to ees
narasimha will provide the load info and we are projecting a september 0st start at the latest
we are preparing a term sheet today that will reflect the basic requirements above
we will certainly add more complexity to this deal in the form of fixing exposure to a/s and other charges
we are prepared to go forward with this immediately
scott
i dont get discounted tickets
but occasionally someone will offer them for sale on the e-bulletin board
i'll keep an eye out for you
kim

good job
please stay focused on this
lloyd
frontera needs a portal so that they may submit outage schedules for their plant
we
as the qse
arent able to submit this
per protocols
thanks
yesterday the frontera plant was idle due to economics
we had submitted a resource plan
this indicates to ercot what we plan to generate
with zero mw's and zero premium because the unit was offline
in the resource plan
we can attach a premium for oom up or down
in the plan for yesterday we indicated that our unit was
unavailable and offline
the plant personel are responsible for submitting an outage schedule with ercot
this cannot be completed by the qse
ercot called yesterday and asked if we could start the unit if they needed us to
we called jerry watson
with frontera
and he relayed that this was possible
ercot immediately oom'd us up 0 mw's
beginning hour ending 0
to control congestion
they later upped this to 0 mw's for the remainder of the day
through 0
i called mark patterson
who is our ercot rep
and i explained the situation
i wished to know how they could oom us if we were offline
i also wanted to know how this would settle
his reply is as follows
since we indicated verbally that we could run the plant
that changed our status from unavailable to available
since we had an implied low premium
zero
on our plant
we were high in the oom stack and were called upon
we would receive only the mcp for our power because we had no premium indicated
the mcp was low all day
mid teens
yesterday
if we had been oom'd up and could not recover our startup
gen costs
we could dispute the bill and provide sufficient documentation to recover
at most
our costs
we immediately revised our resource plan and indicated 0 mw's available with a $0 premium
this invoked the protocol provisions requiring them to pay us the 0 heat rate times gas costs
the protocol section dealing with oom up payments is found under section 0.0.0.0
please review this to understand why this applies
this was a very educational process
we think that in revising our resource plan
on the fly
we were able to turn a bad situation into a profitable day for frontera
until further notice
the following policy should be implemented
if frontera is offline and ercot calls to ask about the availability
say the unit is not available
if frontera is scheduled to run
need to input into the resource plan the following premiums
$0 premium for oom up
$0 premium for oom down
these premiums will be added to the mcp and will be used to determine our place in the merit order
if we are oom'd up
the premium will require that the heat rate formula is invoked
if we are oom'd down
then we should be paid the mcp + premium
please call me if you have questions

thanks
what again is the $ impact and the days involved that we are discussing
can we create an inbox folder for joe
i need to leave something for him tonight and i promised that it would be in his inbox
which he doesnt have
thanks
please note that when we will receive a unit specific instruction
we will also receive a category one deployment
the unit specific instruction tells us the level that they want the unit to produce
the category one is just a summary of how much we need to move to achieve the unit specific level
these should not be combined
also
when you receive a category 0
0 or 0 we are essentially receiving an oom type instruction that is settled under the oom provisions

how many spots does the ercot rt group have for the lv trip in october
thanks for your reply
here's what i have learned from our conversation
since i have not gotten a specific response from my customers
my spots were
captured
by don and juan's group
i acknowledge that i have not relayed specific names for reliant and txu
as they havent responded after many calls
but did not receive notice that i was to lose my spots
i expected to be able to include my employees
as juan and don have now done with my spots
don and juan have invited my employee
steve olinde
with one of my original spots
he will attend
i am not trying to give you a hard time
but i need to know who authorized filling my spots
please make sure that the ercot rc is not billed for our portion of the customer trip
if i can assist with this accounting
let me know
i dont wish to subsidize the other hourly traders who are now able to attend this customer meeting at my expense
in the future
i need to be aware of any decisions that will adversely affect me or my group
i am a commercial director and no one below this rank should be making decisions on my behalf without my knowledge
i do realize what a large undertaking this trip was
we werent able to secure a commitment from customers
but i was confident that our spots could be filled internally
with our group members
i am sure that the overall headcount for this trip did not change
rather the allocation to each group was changed
my goal is not to give you a hard time
i dont usually mention rank or make much of a big deal out of anything
but i do expect a certain amount of respect given my rank
profitability and that i have been here 0 years
i try to extend the same courtesy to you and your staff
frontera is long hour ending 0-0 by 0 mw
s
this has been scheduled into the north 0 zone on behalf of teco services
please sell this power for > $0
if possible
use your judgement

we are selling you next day for $0.0
also
to fill mirant's call for 0-0 we purchased $0 power from aquila
this should get you flat for the day
we will not run tomorrow
as of now
we will reflect this in the resource plan and reflect that the unit is unavailable and offline
i have entered an annuity from doug's book to paul's to account for imbalance losses due to the september 0th tragedy

also
the frontera plant is currently not scheduled to run this weekend or monday
we are currently
as of friday
experiencing problems with units #0

these tripped offline when a breaker problem on cpl's side occurred
we have been asked by ercot to reflect in the resource plan that unit #0 is available but offline
we have done so
when the other units become available
please update them as available in the resource plan for the remaining hours of saturday
we should make sure that we have oom premiums

the ancillary services market for non-spinning has been horrible
non
spinnning for today is
at most
0 cents/mw for hours 0-0
the remaining hours are worth zero
the down regulation and up regulation markets are lucrative at as much as $0.0/mw
but we are not certified for this service
as i understand it
there is some work necessary on the plant to allow us to sell up/down regulation and replacement
ge personel were to travel to the plant and do some work
but in light of world events
i do not know if they have arrived
once the upgrades are complete
we need to restart the certification process with ercot
if we sell non-spin for
0
we would need to withhold this power from the market
we have been selling
on a real time basis
as much power as we can get out the door
we have not been selling offpeak and we are starting schedules
typically at hour 0 through 0 for a sales price of $0
that is the latest
we are currently looking at making sales in october
the heat rate is around 0.0 thanks
please see the attached
mikey
i heard that you have gotten married
is that true
just to double check
the meeting is now on monday
right
please see the attached
remember that we are planning on buying hour ending 0
0 mw's
so
we wont actually generate 0's as the schedule indicates
alex will take care of this tonight
prices for the weekend look like
gas $0.0 this doesnt look too good for the weekend run
let me know what you need to do
thanks
for tomorrow
see the attached schedule
this is what is communicated to frontera
the mw value at the top of the page indicates what their total generation should be by hour
the resource plan shuold be identical to this row
row 0 mirrors the purchase from frontera in enpower
the mirant call and enron's call
ercot asset book
0 mw's
are listed as well as any daily trades executed on behalf of frontera
please familiarize yourself with this report the top line will indicate how much power is available for bal-day sales
etc
additionally
the resource plan needs to accurately reflect to ercot what the plant is capable of
for example
if we are generating at the maximum of 0 mw's
we need to reflect that the combined maximums on units 0-0 do not exceed this amount
otherwise
ercot thinks they can oom you up
specifically for tomorrow
please note that we are going from 0 mw hour ending 0 to 0 mw's hour ending 0
the plant doesnt like to do this
a 0 mw schedule would be much more preferrable for this ramp
so either
0
purchase 0 mw's from rt market for he 0
change resource plan to 0 mw's for hour ending 0 only
put purchase from in teco services book
make another corresponding sale to frontera counterparty in the teco services book
if you dont make the second entry in enpower the teco services book will be long for hour ending 0
0
have plant drag and buy imbalance
they will call to make this decision
no entries will be needed
call if you have questions
for monday
it is necessary that we sell the following for frontera
also
we need to buy 0 mw's for hour ending 0 to assist with frontera's ramp
we are not running the plant this weekend
the resource plan should reflect that we are available but offline
we need to ensure that the minimums and maximums accurately reflect what the plant is capable of
also
please make sure that the oom premiums
up
down
are input as $0 and $0 respectively
fyi
for oom up
we receive a 0.0 heat rate multiplied by the houston ship channel price
for this weekend assume $0.0
if you can make hourly
bal-day sales in excess of this
check with jerry or ken at frontera
steve olinde is notifying ercot that we are coming down this weekend for economics
we have given them this notice so that they can effectively manage their system
i will be out of town this weekend
i can be reached by my cell if you have an important issue
thanks
we are long 0 mw's for hour ending 0-0 on monday
this is currently scheduled to load
if prices are poor
we need to sell this energy early monday morning for > $0 if possible
the sale goes into the ercot asset book
thanks
the position for monday is currently scheduled into imbalance in both the qse mos and enpower
make sure that both are modified when you make sales/purchases
attached are the spreadsheets that reflect what frontera is doing for the next three days
again
look to the top line to know what generation output should be
know it
learn it
live it
thanks
laurel
do you have ken parker's e-mail address
he needs to be copied on our preschedules
his address is kbparker@tecoenergy.com thanks

the length is currently scheduled to load in enpower and the qse mos system
thanks

hope all is well in taylor
i have a couple of questions about oomc capacity payments
as discussed in our meeting
i received a manual oomc on thursday 0/0
0:0 pm
from terry at the iso
he reserved 0 mw of capacity from the frontera unti for hours ending 0-0 for friday
sept 0th
we were
indeed
exercised on friday
i think that we understand the payment for the energy portion of the exercise
however
we are not certain what we will be paid for the capacity portion
as the formula for oomc payment is based upon the replacement reserve market
the replacement reserve prices have been zero
could you provide some help on this
thanks
andrea
apparently an imbalance deal was entered under teco services and the mark to market flag was not removed
i show negative new deal value for teco services
when i sold above the curve on their behalf
i assume this is the reason for the negative new deal value
the deal has been revised
as it was to be a temporary placeholder anyway
this imbal
sale deal will be taken to zero and resold to another counterparty tonight
will i ever get a true up for the negative new deal value
ken
laurel will be sending the spreadsheet from now on
i asked her yesterday to include you on the distribution
i will be out of the office next week
clint dean will step in for me
thanks
i used to carpool with a guy and his wife from liberty
he asked me one day
what if someone called you and told you that you just won a new towncar
all you had to pay was the $0 in taxes
i told both of them
laughing
that it was a scam and someone would have to be an idiot to fall for that
since they didnt enter any contest
they both looked down at their feet and said that they sent a check to this outfit
i called them dumbasses again and they called their bank to cancel the check
the jackass scam artist called them back
bitching that they had cancelled their check
my dumbass friend was talked into this transaction again
he tried to reinstate the check
but the bank's policy prevented him from reactivating this payment
he was going to do this again
but i told his in-laws
friends and everyone else i could to talk to him
he finally saw the light
just doing my job
anyway
this guy is a super nice
but dumbass
guy
he works at the harris county courthouse
his wife ran off with a crack head
left him with the kids
didnt come homefor several weeks and then wanted a divorce
the divorce was in liberty where this woman
also a dumbass friend from wayback
had worked for the judge presiding over her case
she got the kids and he pays $0/month
life is less fair to dumbasses
good to hear from you
everything is still pretty wild up here
but it is going very well
sorry to hear about the neighbors
but i think that you will enjoy living downtown
there is so much to do here now
how are your hours now
im sure that they are pretty scary
seen any good bands lately
im sorry
im kinda shifty

we are short 0 mw's in the ercot asset book for hours ending 0-0
we want to remain that way
unless the balancing energy market goes haywire
we would need to delete our sc counterparty el paso and input a replacement qse in the portal if this is filled
enpower shows 0 mw's coming from ercot imbalance
this deal would need to be cut and replaced with the power that was purchased for bal-day
etc
thanks

this morning ercot asked us to run all three units for a manual oom
our resource plan indicated that our total minimum was 0
i believe that we had a discussion with ercot indicating that our minimum on a 0 on 0 config was 0
we ran at 0
but our resource plan was not updated
ercot called mid-morning to say that they only wanted 0
it is possible that we will be punished financially
receive the balancing energy price
for the 0 mw's over their request
the point is
the resource plan is the only thing binding
we must reflect our true minimums at all times
if the situation changes intraday
we need to make changes in the resource plan to reflect what we can actually do
please see the e-mail below from alan
until further
it is best to avoid long positions in the morning hours that are to liquidate against the balancing market
the downside is $0 and the upside maybe $0
thanks
steve indicated below that he talked to ken at frontera
ken parker is the
new
jerry
they are staffing up
the file should be m:electric/eservices/ees/ercot/ees model go get em
can i get a change in enpower
we have done this type thing on the west desk
for every counterparty
ercot imbalance
i would like the risk mark to market flag set to
off
automatically
when this manual process does not get done
we have settlement problems
what do you think
ken
as discussed earlier
i am proposing ramping up late for the onpeak sale that frontera made for tomorrow
if we must sell the offpeak hours required to affect a 0 mw onpeak schedule
i show that we would almost negate all profit from the sale
i am suggesting starting your ramp beginning hour ending 0 and purchasing a fixed price swap from enron for the short generation
basically
you sold the preschedule for $0 and we would fix your price for hours ending 0-0 at $0
the benefit in this swap would be
hedge against floating price lock in $0 profit on sale for short portion of the schedule
increasing revenues avoid losing approximately $0k on selling ramping schedule
$0 is an optimistic real time sales price at this point
however
i used this in the analysis
please let me know what you think
enron will be offically rolling this swap product out to all of our service customers
i think this would be a good fit your company and i would like to try this for friday's run
additionally
i think that there may be a good down balancing or oom down opportunity for tomorrow because of this preschedule
let me know what you think
rebecca
for september 0th
we have sold a financial swap to frontera for hours ending 0
0
we bill them $0
enpower #0
for various hours
i will take the floating imbalance price for the following megawatt totals
frontera will be running a resource imbalance for these hours
see imbal
# 0
i should be allocated the imbalance charges as listed above and frontera is responsible for any remaining imbalance for this day
this is a financial swap that we will be offering our customers and i need your feedback on any requirements that you have in settling this product
thanks
thanks for looking into this
we have sold a financial swap to frontera for hours 0-0 for $0
they sold a 0 mw schedule for the onpeak tomorrow
they will be ramping up starting hour ending 0 for the following
so
basically
they will be dragging significantly for these hours
we sold this imbalance to them for $0 and we will take the floating price
the resource plan will only show 0 mw's onpeak
ercot will call and ask about our ace issue
just say that our unit is just now coming up and we are on the normal ascension ramp mentioned above
thanks
we put it on for tomorrow
i am short the pool at $0
i gave them an agressive bid and i think that we will both win
tom
frontera did agree to do the financial swap for tomorrow
i am really excited about getting this product off
i guess we need to follow up with the swap papers now
here are some things that we proposed to frontera
september 0th
i suggested selling october at $0.0
this was a 0.0 heat rate
i had to take off for an austin trip and clint took over for me in trying to get them to transact
power moved down
but so did gas
the heat rate was the same
but they still didnt want to transact as power moved down to $0.0
power reached low of 0 heat rate for october recently
it is currently 0.0
i suggested early this week in selling balance of the week at a 0.0 heat rate
the dailies have been now liquidating as low as 0.0 hr
august
late
clint proposed selling 0.0 heat rate in september
they didnt want to because they wanted to liquidate in the daily market
this didnt work out
on a daily basis
frontera has a problem making timely decisions
for example
i give them gas prices and daily prices
they say that they would like to stay offline for the next day
i tell them that i will bookout my option
they call back later and say that they would like to run
bids are now $0 less for my option and the prices they receive for their ramp up and onpeak schedule are horrible
on tuesday
i suggested selling a $0 call option for october for a $0.0 premium
this would have at least brought in $0,0
they werent interested in this idea
i communicate my feelings on the market very early
if they could react quicker
i would smack the first bids that showed their faces
including eol
i could have taken out 0mw's in a simultaneous trades several times over the last two weeks
clint has some other instances that he would like to relay
he will be sending another e-mail
this relationship
although not initially profitable
has allowed us to develop other relationships that would not have otherwise been possible
i dont really want to lose the job
we are providing some outstanding support
in my opinion
the thing that weakens our case is that ercot is not providing the appropriate settlement details that would help illustrate our case on the oom payments
the settlements extract
as i learned on my trip
is key to explainnig this value
the oom value itself is well over $0k
good luck
in this case
ercot asset gets allocated the expense of the imbalance
the enpower deals listed below are under this desk
the financial swap info is going out
frontera being the most logical first customer
is there anything else from us that you would want
im thinking in terms special entries that would notify your group to withold balancing expense from frontera
etc
let me know what you think
mark
we have a question related to the acquisition of ancillary services
ercot publishes their various a/s requirements on a daily basis
we have noticed that you dont procure up to the amount that you say that you require
for example
on 0/0
ercot published that the system requirements are 0,0 mw for regup
ercot procured only approx
0 mw's each hour
the same thing occurs for regdn and responsive
is ercot satisfying their reserve requirement needs with oom and upbalancing
etc
i will be out of the office next week
so can you reply to doug gilbert-smith
his e-mail is doug.gilbert-smith@enron.com
otherwise
he can be reached at 0-0-0
thanks for your help

i will be on vacation next week

in my absence
contact clint dean or smith day for any questions related to frontera
etc
feel free to wake clint up for any reason
thanks
i saw the memo
it is true about the startup charges
it is listed in the purchase and sale agreement
is there more that we need to discuss on this deal
thanks
could you tell me what my balance is for vacation days
also
i dont think that i have signed up for the floating holiday yet
would this balance reflect that
thank you
i have received notice that i need to attend the sandhill board of directors meeting tomorrow
clint dean will be trading the asset book
i will be available via cell phone
thanks
that is correct
mark
thanks for your reply concerning ancillary service procurement
i was wondering if ercot had made a decision on oom capacity payments
our position is that our custmers
ie
teco/frontera should recover at least their o&m expenses for the capacity
as they are standing by awaiting instruction
has there been any progress in this subject
due to the slowdown in trading
i will be concentrating on leaving positions for rt to trade around
these will keep you in the market and give some flexibilty and decision making responsibility
this will make more sense
once you inherit the position
the following positions need to be watched for monday
0
we are short to mirant
on behalf of frontera
for hour ending 0 only
we need to buy 0 mw's and schedule this with mirant real time
they are expecting and have agreed to this trade
this is energy that frontera owes them on a prescheduled basis
if you are working sunday night
check in early with mirant to make sure they are aware of this trade
it is very common that they get a bad
handoff
and are unaware of this transaction
give them plenty of time to work this out
we schedule this in the portal as a buy from x and a sale to mirant
in enpower
buy from x and sell to frontera
under the teco services book
enter this as a flat transaction
ie buy for $0 and sell to frontera for $0
0
the ercot asset book is long 0 mw's for offpeak monday at $0.0
sell this or leave to the pool
as necessary
i will be long this power offpeak for the balance of next week 0/0-0
i think that saturday morning will come in strong
as we are getting some cooler weather
i think also that some larger units are coming off line
which will put upward pressure on the offpeak
each member of the group needs to tell me what positions they want
next day onpeak is trading for $0.0
offpeak is trading $0.0
where is the value
lets trade it up
isaac needs to be set up with a certificate for the ercot portal
is there a form i need to fill out for this
ben
my new employee
isaac wong
needs a turret id
he will need to copy someone else's phone list as well
can you help
thanks
thanks harley man
kim
i had mentioned that i had not completed submitting my expense for temporary housing
etc
i mistakenly thought that the deadline was one year
can i still get this in
i think i have everything in order
thanks
any luck with the changes we have requested
thanks so much for checking into this for me
sorry for the delay in submitting
so
you waited until the weather became bearable before coming to houston
good call there
i travelled to portland a week ago to visit friends
deb and i had a great time and the flight was so cheap
$0
the weather was awesome and the wine was good
as far as i can remember
anyway
it was good to see stewie
tim and even richter
what are you working on here
is it classified
yep
coffee is a good idea
who would i talk to about the residential customers
i received a call from a load aggregating company that specializes in residential sign ups
this sounds like a good idea
provided that our strategy hasnt changed
what about new power
should we refer this deal to them
it looks pretty good
joe
do you have any record of this deal
i should that you worked this day
if this exists in your personal trade log
then we need to enpower this
let me know what you find
alex
could you check your trade log for this
i show that you were on this day
if this trade is good
we need to enpower
let me know what you find
joe
here's another
please check this out and let me know what's going on
thanks
due to oklaunion being down for maintenance
we are being cut again on offpeak schedule #0
this 0 mw purchase from tenaska needs to be replaced for hour ending 0 and 0 today
buy the power tonight and enter deal under ercot mgmt book
as this is doug's power
i have already made the cuts in enpower for both hours ending 0,0 and tomorrow
for tomorrow
i have purchased energy for this schedule
so we dont have to worry about it on a real time basis
if you have questions
let me know
thanks
alex
you have been somehow entering deals under south america
brazil region
rather than south 0
risk has been having a problem with this
this has also affected the brazil trading desk
double check your deal entry desks and zones
i intended to mention this last week and i forgot
it came up again today
per risk
also
on the hour ending 0 deal today
you should have entered a sale to frontera in enpower
rather than mirant
this is a bit confusing
but here goes
frontera had sold mirant this option
not enron
frontera tells me daily what mirant is calling for
i replace this power
or frontera generates the schedule
if i
or you
replace
then we do enter a schedule of a sale to mirant in the portal
but
we dont sell to mirant in enpower
as this is not our deal
instead
the sale goes to frontera
they pay us to reimburse us for buying lcra on their behalf
does that help
kim
cammi mursch has asked for an e-mail from enron authorizing an extension
can we do this
thanks
linus
can you give me the info for a new power contact
i have talked with john phillips with cinergy worldwide
his company is an experienced residential load aggregator in the northeast
they are not related to the cinergy utility
they are interested in a partnership with enron/new power where cinergy would market directly to individuals using our paper
terms in return for a negotiated fee
he is interested in entering the texas choice arena
they claim to be capable of size in signups
i thought that this may be a good fit for newp
the number for john phillips is
0-0-0 let me know what your thoughts are
john forney ercot trading
the oklaunion plant is offline until midnight friday
i have replaced the power for this deal in the cash market
no replacement is needed
also
you will notice that from peak on through 0
the pool has been strong
generators are taking their units offline for offpeak and are running short until peak the next day
you can recognize this in the ace display on the monitor
notice hour ending 0,0,0
theyre draggin
prices still havent done much in the offpeak,even with this going on
mr
hinson
sorry i missed your call
the frontera plant is composed of 0 ct's and and steamer
three units in total
however
the steamer cannot operate independently of the ct's
i say this because the ercot protocols allow dispatching each of these units independently and ercot exercises this right while punishing us financially for non compliance
there is no way under the resource plan from the protocols to express which combinations must be considered
these units are behind a common point
so the rules as they were written dont consider us
i know that this is more than you asked for
but for whatever it's worth
thanks and give me a call if you need more info
enron ercot region
kim
here is the e-mail address for cammi
thanks
we have been having alot of trouble with one of the big screens that is fed by the portal server
it is the display over doug's head
this shows ace and load forecast
doug is very excited about this
as we have had a daily problem it works temporarily
but goes down daily
is sasha the guy to talk to on this
best wishes to you and your daughter
the updated help desk numbers for 0 hour call are as follows
these have changed
so update your phone list accordingly
thanks
the hourly ercot book is long 0 mw's at $0.0 for hour ending 0 and 0 on friday
this is currently scheduled into the north zone load
when you sell this
cut the load and replace with the appropriate qse trade
the purchase is in enpower as #0
the sale to ercot imbal is under #0
cut the enpower sale and replace with appropiate sale counterparty
everything should be entered under the hourly ercot desk
let me know how it goes
adrianne
i was not able to participate in a phone screen for any of the applicants below
due to business travel
what is the latest on this
tom
the frontera file has
in the first tab
their calculation for their daily costing
ken gave me this and asked me what i think
it would probably be best if we talk some more about it
rather than sending it to jerry brown
etc
what do you think
the st ercot book is long 0 mw's in the offpeak hours for monday
we would like to sell these mw's at a reasonable price that is left to your judgement
if prices look to be potentially negative
of course
sell the mw's
give me a call if you have questions
preferrably before 0 pm
thanks
give me a call
the resolution desk has given me the password
however
george was not set up in deal blotter under north america
east region
i have since submitted another e-request for george
the reason is
he cannot log onto blotter or create deals under his name
can you watch out for this
william
things look better but
george does not have access to the epmi hourly ercot book
this is the book that he trades primarily
he also needs epmi ercot asset
thanks
frontera will be running short for the schedule listed below
i have sold them this imbalance for $0.0
any imbalance charges billed to them should be allocated to me listed on the schedule below
the total is 0
this is the equivalent of a financial swap
but the settlement will remain intact
thanks
ken
take a look at this
we will sell an additional 0mw's for hour ending 0 tomorrow
this is not on the sheet
obviously
thanks
frontera has scheduled the following for tomorrow
we will be required to sell an additional 0 mw's tomorrow for hour ending 0 in order to get up to the minimum run of 0mw's
if frontera has problems coming up tomorrow
there may be an ace issue
we will advise
i have sold frontera a financial swap for $0.0 for hours ending 0-0
the first 0 hours are for size
0 mw's
i would buy hours 0-0 tomorrow for up to $0
i could buy up to the 0 mw's
schedule this to load in the north
i could also use 0 mw's for he 0 and 0 mw's for he 0
calpine has had an offer recently for hours ending 0-0
if you have questions
please give me a call
as this is a very important issue
words of advice
dont go into the market with a $0 bid for 0 mw's
quietly accumulate these mw's if possible
do not tip your hand on this deal
as that would contribute to spiking rt prices
thanks
karen
i have spoken with adrianne yesterday concerning the status of this process
at that time
i had left messages with all three candidates
but was unable to reach them
late yesterday afternoon
i received a call from nicholas watson
i was impressed with his previous experience in trading and his educational background
he also had shown some innovation related to some projects that he worked on at jp morgan chase
co
i would recommend scheduling nicholas for an interview
i did relay to him that we would contact him within a week
i will again call the other candidates
john
the outage requested for friday has been approved by kevin presto
i am glad to hear that the demin tank situation has been resolved
the meeting that i attended was helpful in understanding your level of frustration
if you have further questions
please let me know
john forney
greetings
for tonight
frontera is long 0mw's hour ending 0
we need to sell this under the teco services book
for tomorrow frontera needs to sell
enter a purchase from frontera
teco services book
enter the same price as you sold for
enter the sale
teco services
i am also selling frontera 0 mw's for hour ending 0 and 0 mw's hour ending 0
i am selling this position for $0.0
i will be short the imbalance price during this time
if you can buy below $0.0 for this time period
do so and schedule to load in the south
i am long into the north zone as follows
i am long under deal #0 if prices appear to weaken
sell these mw's for 0-0 and cut this ercot imbalance deal by same
this deals should be listed under ercot asset
thanks
i have sold frontera the following
please transfer this imbalance amount to me
see deal no's 0
0
thanks
yes
i would like that very much
please give me a call at 0-0
i have spoken with ruben this morning
he is currently working in structuring for sempra
focusing on the ercot retail market
additionally
he has worked for the california px
this and his educational background would have me recommend scheduling an interview with this applicant
thanks
tell these guys to trade it up
this is the public ercot iso site
you can query for prices
we have an internal site
the east power portal site
which has a section for price and load
this scrapes info from the ercot website
i would think that you need special access to use the link below
a reminder
i am 0 mws long for hours 0
0 today
this has been scheduled into the north zone
if you sell make sure that you cut the enpower deal and make the appropriate entries in the portal
enpwr deal 0 is the sale to north zone
the ercot asset desk is long 0 mw's for the offpeak hours at $0.0
the enpwr deal number is #0 if you sell hours 0-0
cut this sale to ercot imbal and replace with the appropriate counterparty under hourly ercot book
we will leave additionally
frontera needs to sell the following
put these purchases
sales in the teco services book
i have sold them the power swap where i sell them 0 mw for 0&0
$0
i then pay the pool price
if prices somehow appear that they will be greater than $0 for these hours
please cover and schedule to the south zone the swap went very well today
since we had a physical position
although the physical may lose $0
the financial swap will make $0,0
here's how it works
when you buy balday
you buy fixed
$0
and sell floating
ercot pool
today i sold fixed
$0
and bought floating
the floating components cancel and we are left with a $0 margin
call if you have questions
i have zeroed this price out
thanks
save the file attached below to your desktop
you can just click and drag
you can view the data by interval or by hourly average
make sure that the dates are in the following
to view today
0/0
make sure the ending date is tomorrow to pull in he 0
the purpose of this toy is to paint certain blocks
ie 0-0 and get an average in the excel format
i have found this to be a quick and easy to use tool
i used a similar tool in the california pool
for example
take yesterday and compare to today
same period
factor in weather
unit outages
etc
this should give you a general idea of where prices should be for these hours
let me know your feedback
i am discussing this with cara at tenaska
she is going to send more support for this
sell hour ending 0 only
0 mw's for frontera tomorrow
do not go to the pool
if you cannot sell the mw's for a reasonable price
$0 or greater
and the pool appears to be going to a negative
call jerry and wake him up
have him ramp up starting he 0
try to sell tonite if possible
so we wont have to wake them up
i have sold the swap to frontera for tomorrow
they will be short the following hours
i have sold the swap to them at $0.0
i sell fixed and buy floating
if you think that the pool will be high
then you buy fixed and take to the pool
you will buy fixed and sell floating
net
we are left with two fixed prices
very cool
ercot will be calling due to the ace issue
the plant will be coming up slowly
call if you have questions
frontera is scheduled to generate a total of 0 mw's onpeak
there may be an ace issue for hours ending 0-0
we suspect that ercot will want us to stay down due to price/lack of load
check with real time trader
thanks
yes
joe capasso does report to me
thanks
thanks for the info for the additional load
as i understand it
we now have approximately 0 mw's in the south
this is great
each day i review balancing energy prices vs
daily prices and the choice is extremely simple
we allow the pool to fill this load
i would recommend against buying any hedges against this power until further
there is a good chance that prices occasionally go negative for offpeak/weekends and we want to take full advantage
do we need to discuss this further
i just want to be on the same page
let me know what you think
yes
but we are consistenly being oomc'd
so it's kind of an ongoing question
thanks
i need some support on this
for the last two weeks
ercot has been giving us oomc orders
they have told us to run the plant
without question
we have asked them whether they mean oome when we run
to a man
the ercot dispatch guys have said that oomc means to run
they want the power
i have launched three e-mails
requesting clarification
to mark patterson
starting weeks ago on this issue
yesterday
i caught mark by phone at 0:0pm
mark consulted with his operations group and determined that we had been oomc'd and we should run
but they are not going to pay us the hr calc
they said that oomc means run and we are supposed to sell this power
this confusion on our part will prove costly to frontera as they will be paid the imbalance
instead of the heat rate calc
we cannot sell in the offpeak hours for greater than $0
it costs us $0 to generate power
mark said
dont worry
at worst case you can file for reimbursement
mark also said that we will get paid for the capacity
but what
it is my opinion that it is no accident that ercot was vague on this issue
they want to penalize us if we dont run
and if we do
we will lose money
we then file to get a break-even rebate
they are acquiring ancillary reserves for free and not even paying for the energy component
i realize that these issues will be discussed in the tuesday meeting and i will provide examples
as requested by ercot
i need some support from the protocols and i need some suggestions
i do not want to allow these guys to game us anymore
we will be more vocal in this meeting
if no resolution is reached
i vote for ignoring their oom instructions
i need a ruling on whether they can force us to lose money
thanks
thank you bill
david
i need some help with an ercot protocol interpretation
frontera has been issued oomc requests by the iso on numerous occasions
starting september 0th
this out of merit request is issued if no mkt bids exist to solve congestion
whether local or zonal
the oomc
as i understand it
reserves capacity for ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols
the formula is based on the replacement reserve clearing price
which currently is zero
this is because the replacement reserve market is non-existent
an announcement on how the oomc capacity payments will be calculated is due out this week
per mark patterson
the second component of this option is oome
this is a request for actual energy related to the oomc option
the strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the hsc daily price
as mentioned in the protocols
so the oomc/oome ws designed to work like the ancillary services with a capacity award and an energy component
i think that this is the spirit of the oom's
as mentioned in section 0 of the protocols
here is the problem
the head of ercot market operations
john adams
interprets the protocols to mean that oomc requries the plant to be generating
when ercot dispatchers had issued an oomc
they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid
we explained to them
on numerous occasions
that we dont believe oomc means run
if they wanted us to run
then they would need to issue an oome for the actual energy component
i asked my employees to clarify with ercot whether we were being asked to run
yes or no
when instructed to run by ercot
we had to assume that we were settled based upon the oome calc
as we were previously under oomc orders
i sent at least three e-mails to my ercot rep
mark patterson regarding this issue
i finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought ercot's intrepretation was correct
for all of the times that we ran
at their request
we werent going to be paid based on the oome heat rate calc
rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price
a penalty for resource imbalance
for example
in the early morning hours we would receive as little as $0 for electricity that cost $0 to generate
mark also mentioned that when they said run
they expected us to sell to someone else
or just generate into the imbalance
mark told me
dont worry
you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lost money
here is my view
oomc does not mean run
it means have the capacity available in the event ercot calls
much like replacement
responsive reserve and non-spinning
ercot's interpretation is being decided by the manager of mkt operations
a group supposedly unconcerned with price
if oomc means to run
then why would the protocols contemplate
or need oome
they would never have to pay oome if we were already running into the imbalance
oomc is an option and the exercise is oome
this is basically the disagreement
this could very well be a $0,0 issue for frontera
why would anyone generate for $0 and dump to the imbalance mkt at $0 in hopes of filing for a
breakeven
ridiculous
i spoke with bill kettlewell with customer relations and he had
no comment
on whether oomc means to generate
mark patterson now also has
no comment
bill and mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive closure on the oom capacity payment
i suspect that we will follow this same path when we file for oome reimbursement vs
the imbalance price we will receive
i had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant
in response to an oomc
until we receive an oome instruction
this has compelled ercot to deploy an oome request to us
because they need to have us online to control local congestion
would this not be an omission that their view was incorrect
section 0.0.0 says that a qse may fail to comply with an ercot directive if it causes a safety concern
or
ercot is not in compliance with the protocols
the latter is in effect
ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us
or give us an oome deployment
unless we are already runnnig
i think that this is a software issue
not a protocol issue
we worked out an interim compromise with ercot until this issue can be settled
once we have been oomc'd
we will start to gen
once we reach full load
we will request an oome
if they dont comply
we will shut down the unit
ercot said that
it was entirely reasonable that we would request to be compensated in the form of an oome
the ercot dispatchers are complaining that oome requires them to send an instruction every 0 minutes
is this why we are not getting the oome instruction on a regular basis
finally
i stressed to ercot that i wasnt trying to manipulate prices
via oome or force ercot into a corner
it just is not the right economic environment to generate for $0 and sell for $0
further
operations personell at ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for
forcing them to oome our plant
can i get an opinion on whether oomc means to run
if you agree with me
what is our next step
i need to move aggressively on this issue
thanks
this is a start
i am having our regulatory guy review our oomc/oome situation
thanks
please update your phone list with frontera's new numbers
they would prefer that we use the toll free number
thanks
please check out the following
the agreement i reached with ercot/frontera yesterday is as follows
when we receive an oomc
we will crank up the plant then call ercot and request an oome once the plant is online
if ercot doesnt give us an oome
then we will need to advise them that we will take the plant down
we dont actually want to do this
as there are some expensive start charges associated with this
we will discuss further in the meeting
thanks
the latest from frontera
they will not run unless we receive an oome
call me if you need to
but call before 0pm
thanks for checking in with me
i had a couple of questions
does anadarko have any power plants or do they trade gas/electricity actively
i currently do several things
i am the manager of the real time power trading desk
i also manage the ercot asset book
i trade around a combined cycle gas plant in south texas
i am required to trade gas along with the power in order to properly hedge the plant
i would be interested in continuing in this area
thanks for anything you can tell me about working at anadarko
i could send my resume
but if we dont have paralell needs
then i wont bother
i have some other things that i am working on
thanks again for asking
this company will be fine
but i have worked 0-0 hours/day for 0+ years
when the stock price is $0
i can somewhat justify the hours and lack of life
however
although i am sure that enron will bounce back
i am no longer willing to sacrifice to make it so
i have been consistenly profitable in my time here
i have never been on a losing team
we have always made major money for the company
so it is very hard to understand how this whole thing is unwinding
anyway
thanks again and i look forward to hearing from you
thanks
sure
i am online everyday
i get in about 0 am
usually putting the numbers on at 0:0
i start with hr ending 0-0 and change to 0-0 usually when the first interval of he 0 is printed
this is at my discretion
you may post a limit order
either a bid or offer
that covers mine and transact online
you wont necessarily be trading with me
another counterparty can lift your offer or hit your bid
let's trade it up
a lot of shops are interested
mainly speculators
i have had at least 0 different counterparties use this
utilities or generators have a big interest in hedging their balancing energy exposure
locking in a fixed return
how they are exposed to the imbalance price is their business
as i am not encouraging running an imbalance
etc
no problem with eol
as we are trading it up
you need to add the us pwr financial swap to your eol profile
in my opinion
you will see ercot s 0-0 and n 0-0
you will need to add these and every other hour listed
thanks
frontera was asked to generate 0 mw's for this day
they were generating but our meter read was showing zero
ercot was also showing zero
steve olinde called and frontera assured us that they were running
we will need to file a dispute for approx hours ending 0
0
i am not sure when the meter came back
but it was ok when i came in this morning
thanks
mark patterson
our rep
called today to ask me if everything was resolved to my satisfaction
i relayed that i did talk to john adams last night and he did agree to give us one hour notice with an oome instruction
this is great
however
mark warned me that we were outside of the tariff because ercot still maintains that oomc means run
he relayed that in the event of line meltdown
etc
we would be liable
john adams also said this last night
we are officially on notice of pin my opinion we need to
call ken saathoff and see if he can resolve their confusion today
otherwise we need to file whatever is necessary
under the protocols
to protest this ridiculous interpretation and to protect ourself from this
liability
officially request clarification in the protocols on this issue
thanks
i kind of lost my temper a bit with mark
probably wont sound good on tape
but i told him that a monkey-man wouldnt interpret the protocols that wits the dynegy thang talking
we are long 0 mw's
ercot asset book
for the 0x0
this is scheduled into the north market
we are long 0 mw's for 0 hours saturday and sunday
the length is under the ercot asset book and the cost is $0
i am concerned about sunday morning
specifically
hours ending 0-0
if you could sell this for a decent price
it would be a good thing
the purchase is an interdesk deal
so it wont show in enpower scheduling
also
for hours ending 0-0 on sunday we are long an additional 0 mw's at $0.0
the purchase is under deal #0 from city of austin
the temps are supposed to be warm and it should be muggy on sunday ahead of the cold front
this is scheduled to the north zone under enpower 0
either leave alone or sell under the ercot asset book
for monday
we are long 0 mw's onpeak under another interdesk deal
the length cannot be seen in enpower scheduling
this deal is under ercot asset and has been scheduled to load
north
under deal #0
also
we have another 0 mw's from coa
see enpower #0
for he 0-0
this is scheduled to north zone under enpower #0
dont forget that the night crew will report to the new building sunday evening
the phones are to be inactivated here at 0:0 pm sunday
thanks and lets trade it up
any luck on developing this tool
also
tell me the status of the esca people
the hourly trading system is not complete and i understand that they are leaving
no documentation on how to use the system is available
as far as i can tell
we are collecting information to dispute ercot's oomc calculation
oomc has not had a defined clearing price due to the the non-functioning replacement reserves mkt
ercot has asked us to file a dispute for each time that we were issued an oomc
i think that this goes back to sept 0th
also at issue is the payment for the actual power once it is called for
ercot claims that oomc means run
instead of standby
so
for the times that we were asked to run
ercot will only pay us the balancing energy price
versus the oome heat rate calculation
how far can we go back in a dispute
i thought we were somewhat limited
it appears that ercot is reversing their interpretation
we still need to dispute/collect for oomc payments and also file under oome heat rate provisions for all of the times that we ran when we were under oomc
does this make sense
the instantaneous supply in the form of ancillary services was supposed to be provided to us by coa
the contract was not specific concerning the intraday gas supply
or how we would schedule intraday power
coa wants us to
split the meter
at the plant
allowing us to schedule our own 0 mw's
and assume all liability
and also arrange our own gas agreement
otherwise
they dont want to allow us intraday capability
the agreement doesnt expire until nov 0
0
their would be two gas contracts to consider
i suppose
enron needs to contract for their own supply for this plant and also wants to sell to coa directly
when do you want to talk
so
it would appear that we have a good case for recovering some money for oome
i am of the opinion that for every time i was ordered to run under the oomc
i should be paid the oome calc
is this flawed logic
what do you think
we are short 0 mw's for offpeak tomorrow @ $0
i would not expect to have to fill this
but if you do
buy in the south and schedule under ercot asset
we originally purchased this power from el paso
call me with questions
tuesday good
i am at 0
where the heck are you
please check for your new trid for your turret
thanks
thanks
the move has been very smooth
gerald
i am talking with gary bryan

we still need to provide detail on when errors
problems actually occur
i will work to get this to you by tomorrow
thanks
thank you
you are one of my favorite hr reps
here is some more specific detail

thanks alex
we have 0 mw's of length for the 0 hr offpeak block from thanksgiving through monday

thanks
i want to go to this

i have attached my resume for your review
i am interested in talking to you in more detail at your convenience
thanks again
cell phone 0-0-0
for all that have missed the floor meeting
we have been downgraded to
junk
status
ending our merger plans and crushing our stock price
a likely scenario would have us declaring bankruptcy within a few days
payroll is said to be funded until the end of the month
at least
if bankruptcy is filed
payroll should be covered
another very real option is that the trading floor could be parcelled and sold to an outside company
there are discussion underway that deal with this possibility
currently
we are not trading
we need to continue to report to work and keep a log of real time prices
continue to update the hourly prices sheet for a record of prices
we may need these prices as support for liquidated damages
more counterparties will be defaulting and cutting schedules
please make note of such cuts and prepare to bill ld's
we have prepared a cut log for this purpose

i am still interested in being a part of a leaner trade floor at enron
but this proposition is less likely than my leaving
the creditors and the bankruptcy judge are not that likely to approve good bonuses for performers
in my opinion
we will be dogged with credit issues and lawsuits for a long time
what do you think
greetings
my name is john forney and i am currently an employee of enron north america
i am a woodlands resident and take great interest in employment opportunities withyour company
i have been involved
primarily
in electricity and gas trading
i also have gas purchase and natural gas pipeline experience
i have a proven track record of success and look forward to new challenges
i have attached my resume which details my experience and capabilities
if you have further interest in talking with me
please contact me at 0-0-0 or 0-0-0
thanks for your time
john forney director
ercot trading
we understood
at the time
that the test was going well
this is frontera's test to continue to bid in replacement and non-spin
thank you
havent talked to you for awhile
hope everything is going as well as can be
i have a biz question
is the cash balance plan safe
george
here is some info
frank
thanks for meeting with me yesterday
i am impressed with your operation and the people who will be building this from the ground up
i'm sure we will be talking again soon
i regret that i wasnt able to stay longer and possibly catch some specs
thanks again
john forney
allan
i havent heard anything from anadarko
but i am talking to several other players
there is a possibility that i will be relocating to tampa florida or possibly back to oregon
thanks for passing my info along and inquiring as to my situation
we still need to make time for that beer
i get out of work very early each day
as our trading opportunities are severely limited
i would like to pass on a couple of resumes from two of my friends that were released at enron
my friend has some solid accounting background and his wife worked in hr as a specialist
they are a woodlands couple and would like to avoid that crappy drive to houston
i know that anadarko is probably being swamped with resumes
but i didnt know if your department had specific needs that may match what jim has to offer
this guy is extremely detail oriented and capable
if you could review and pass these on
i would really appreciate it
this is my golfing buddy and he cant play anymore if he isnt working
just kidding tell me what is happening with you
i still dont miss koch
but i miss working 0
0 hour days
i think that mike eiben has been long gone from enron
i had been looking for him before the layoffs
but hadnt been able to find him in the voice directory
etc
call or e-mail and i will meet at buffalo wild wings or somewhere else
we dont have to talk about work
no
lets not talk about work
thanks
rob
attached are my friend's resumes
i also added mine for your critique
let me know what you think
i need to talk to you about negotiating a new deal
unfortunately it looks as if i may be leaving the state
either to florida or back to oregon
the offers are starting to come in
but i dont want to leave anything on the table
need your advice
so let's have that beer
frank
i spoke with victoria bender and julie gildea yesterday
julie expects to send me some info today
i will be out of the office after lunch today

at the school
my desire to attend the school is quite strong
the school is a perfect fit for the career i am trying to pursue in energy and is a institution where i would be able to contribute to and learn from the energy-finance program due to my experiences with enron
eventhough i have tested poorly on tests such as the gmat
i feel that the rest of my application is quite strong and that i have proven that i can successfully compete in a competitive environment
ie
enron
i excel in environments
team-oriented
such as described by the many people i talked with at the texas b-school
again
thanks for taking the time to talk with me about my application and it was good to see someone from boston
who lived in dc and was now living in texas

professor titman
thank you for talking with the people in the admissions office
i wanted to ask you what you think i could do at this point to help the admission's people understand the reason for my gmat score
i know that this is a poor reflection of what i can actually achieve and i know that i will do well and be successful in the learning environment at ut
if i need to
i can provide the admissions office the documents stating the disability
if you can let me know what you think i can do
i would appreciate it
thanks agin
ben
meg
i would like to make sure that i have fully explained the reason for my gmat score
if the admissions office needs me to provide documentation on this disability i can do that
due to this disability
the gmat score is not a good indicator of how i will do at ut
through what i have learned in my work experiences with state street bank and enron
i know that i will be able to successfully do the work that ut requires
if you could let me know what i can do to further explain my gmat score i would greatly appreciate it
if you think it would be better to talk to dr
harris-i will do that

sorry for the late reply

the two companies i talked about was relient and entergy
relient ended up buying 0 lm 0 turbines and entergy ended up buying 0 lm 0 turbines
they both plan to put them into customer deals
just as we are doing
so there is a little competition
the delivery dates are a little further out than ours but they all are probably delivered by 0
hope this helps
talk to you soon
ben
i have been out of the office until now
so i will talk to you later today about the model
thanks ben
dr
harris
sorry for the delay
i have been traveling with work and i just got back an hour ago
i can try and retake the gmat exam if this will help my overall application file
i must say
due to my disability
i don't think my score would improve dramatically
i can also send you a summary
or the whole report
on my disability from the professional examiner to further explain my disability
i can also provide addition recommendations from my colleagues i work with to further demonstrate my achievements at work
if you could let me know what information would help best explain my disability
i would appreciate it
thanks again for your e-mail and sorry for the delay
ben
dr
harris
since i am a eternal optimist
i always feel i can strengthen my skills in most everything i do
but under these circumstances with the gmat
timed exam
combined with my disability
i feel this is my best representation for this exam
also
i know that you would not what me to take the exam just to retake it
but due to my strong desire to attend the texas graduate school of business
i would try to provide any additional information you needed to help strengthen my overall application file
again
thanks for the fast response to my e-mail
hope to hear from you soon
sincerely
ben

dr
harris
i would like to thank you for personally taking the time to closely review my application
though i am disappointed with the results i am still determined to attend the texas graduate school of business next year
i understand how competitive the process has become
but i felt that with my work experiences
recommendations
personality
extracurricular activities
etc
that this would compensate for my disability
after talking with professors titman
ronn
brown and jemison
i was sure that the school was the right place to get the education i was looking for
i am still certain that the school is the best place for getting a great graduate-level education
so i want you to know that i am going to do whatever it takes to get in next year
i plan on taking two or three graduate level finance courses at the university of houston this summer and fall to demonstrate to the admissions committee that i can compete at the graduate level
i also plan on retaking the gmat test
due to my disability
this will be a monumental task
but i am determined to prove to the committee that i can be successful at the texas graduate school of business
i would like to come down to austin this spring to meet with you to further discuss my application file and to personally meet you
if you think of anything else i can do to strengthen my overall application file for next year
please let me know
take care and hope to hear from you soon
sincerely

still working with finance group to come up with different finance structures
working with insurance group
weather desk
to wear the risk of the project
since the power desk will not wear that type of risk
pricing of the put
call and spread option values is still not finalized
because kevin presto has said that he does not put much value into these plants in eastern pjm don black is beginning to look at other companies for his price risk management product

let me know if this is suffient for your analysis
ben

hey
sorry its been a little while but i've been traveling and keeping some late hours on these generation projects
with regards to ut
i am going to stay at enron for another year
i feel that the thing that hurt me from getting in the schools i wanted to get into were my undergraduate grades
so i have decided to take a couple of graduate level finance courses this summer and re-apply next year
actually
i'll apply to columbia this sept to get into their january program
which goes for a year and half
so lets get together for lunch before you head off for b-school this summer
talk to you soon
ben
dave
i was talking with my brother-in-law who is kinder/morgan's vp of corp development and they would be interested in talking with us about contributing their 0,0 mw's of generation into a jv/partnership to lead into a public offering
we are still under several different ca's with them
due to our past conversation's regarding generation
with our previous discussions
rich kinder had suggested to kevin hannon if enron would be interested in buying the whole orion project
but at that time ena was only interested in the first couple of projects
due to the delivery of the turbines
in light of our past discussions and kmi's desire to exit the generation business
this jv would give them the perfect
exit strategy
also
it would give us a better growth strategy
with respects to our talks with other parties
i know that bringing in a potential third party would complicate the deal structure
but i think that it would build a much better growth story to wall street
if you think this would be a good idea
i can begin to set up a meeting as soon as possible with kinder/morgan
thanks
ben

i talked with thomas suffield and he wants miguel vasquez to run the numbers on the florida model
since they have been running numbers on the plano model for a little while now
i walked miguel through what i had done and how they should look at running the model
based on what thomas found out and what you have said in the past
i also gave them the numbers that the desk has given based on the simple cycle case
0 year number
and combine-cycle case

i have moveed into a new group
enron's m&a group
were looking at some interesting deals
we are looking at taking a company public which i may go work for if i can get enough equity in the deal
the other thing that might happen is finally going to my pops company at a much higher position than i am at now
which would be great
but i would be in ohio
booooooo
that way megan and i could buy a house and potential go and get an executive mba from kellog
but these are all scenarios and if any of these play out i would be amazed
my golf game is ok
but my training is starting to get better
i did see that none of us made the nyc marathon on the first go around
did you see that jon and kati had their baby-i didn't even know she was pregnant
shit were getting old
hope all is going well and i'll see ya
ben

i will be back early on sunday
so please leave me a message if you need anything and i will be in on sunday
hope to make it back safely
have a good weekend
ben
mike
thanks again for taking the time to meet with me last week
i left you rich kinder's number on thursday with your assistant
sheilla
hope you got it
again
i think a deal between or three companies is something to really look at
i think it creates a great story to the street
kinder/morgan brings the growth story
the gas pipelines for the convergence play and the development team
enron brings the mw's and trading and cinergy brings mw's
trading and operating expertise
i feel that enron and cinergy can work togther with regards to the trading
i am sending you an anayst report i just finish reading regarding generation spinoffs
i think it will be helpful
also
kay chapman
dave's assistant informed me that you were coming up next week
and i wanted to know if you wanted me to be there or not or if you wanted me to prepare anything for you for the meeting
hope you had a good weekend and i look forward to talking to you soon
regards
ben
a very good time was had by all
i for one lost some shorts and a voice
but it was well worth it
thanks miguel and everyone else
ben
mike
just a thought regarding kinder/morgan
these guys mainly care about the gas pipelines and that some of there projects are actually put on there lines to increase throughput
these plants that they want on their lines are currently in construction or development
their only operational plants are in colorado
they have a good generation team
but i fell that they do not want to be in the business of operating and maintaining the plants
just as long as somebody wants to put them along their lines
if you guys offered to buy their plants and projects
they would mainly care about price
cash and stock in the new company
and to put contracts in place for some of their projects to put on their lines
hope this helps
ben
here are some of the points cinergy will cover on monday
they are coming down with a team of 0 or 0 people
mike cyrus
bill greilis

ben
hey jon

i can't believe it
i've been trying to work on the golf game
but i'm taking a couple of graduate business courses at night so that keeps me pretty busy on the weekends as well
hope all is well and i'll talk to you soon
go sox
ben
dave
i talked with the legal guys at cinergy and after further discussions with mike cyrus
they felt that since these discussions were at a high level and very early in discussions that a
ca
at this time was not needed
there were two sticking points that i was trying to get them to backdown from
0
a stand-still agreement and 0
a solicitation agreement
they were not willing to back down from these
thus they concluded with suggesting no
ca
let me know if this is your thoughts as well
thanks
ben
i am pretty sure i have a copy
but it is really old and out of date
but i will try and find it asap and send it on to you
thanks
ben

ben
jerry
here is the latest
ca
with everyone's changes
i feel that this is pretty close to the best we can offer in terms of the stand-still and non-solicitation agreements

look forward to talking to you tomorrow morning
thanks for your patience
again
this is a draft copy for discussions purposes only
regards
ben

ben

i wanted to mention this to you yesterday after the test
but didn't have time
i was taking this course because i am applying to another business school and since i have been out of school for six years i wanted to provide the other schools with a recent academic record
i was trying to get an a in the class
but my first test was not my best work
i feel that i did much better on the second test and that brandon and mines case studies and my class participation were good enough to get me close to the a level
that said if i am also able to get a recommendation from you i would greatly appreciate it
i know that you are extremely busy now
so if i could get in touch with you at your earliest convenience that would be great
thanks for making the class educational and quite enjoyable
hope to talk to you soon and hope you can enjoy the rest of the summer

here are my answers to your questions
0
yes i think its a good idea
because you are able to reach a wide audience with this advertisement
0
i don't think the contest should be limited to just these schools/conferences
you probably should open it up to all schools to get an even wider reach of potential candidates
0
i would think that if you had a certain amount for the cash prize that people would take it seriously to try and win the cash
0
please let me know if i can support you in any way

billing separately plan

at that point
an umbrella plan will cover the turbines
regarding the balance sheet
they have been accounting for it under prepaid insurance and have been amortizing it each month as its been paid
let me know if you need anything else
ben
i know how e-mail is suppose to work
but its been so crazy here that i haven't even been able to do that

this project is going to kill me
i glad to see that you are active on the net
i'll keep in touch a little better
love ben
it wasn't like i was neglecting you
you must understand that e-mail is faster than sending a letter and its slower than calling someone
but there is not always an immediate return
some people are lazy with returning e-mail
it has been really busy here
we are working long hours and this project is trying to close by the end of the year
it's a $0 billion project
so it takes alot of work
talk to you soon
ben

he was calling to ask about an extention to the bidding on the assets

hope we can talk about this soon

these guys will cover the site visits the next two weeks
but everyone else may be asked to fill in for them if needed
while on the site visit
please make sure that the companies do not take any pictures and they are only allowed to talk to you or the plant manager
most of the companies will probably be there for only a couple of hours per day

it was a pleasure meeting you yesterday afternoon at the columbia business school information session
as you probably noticed through my enthusiasm
i really enjoy working in the energy-finance industry
especially with enron
working in this sector
at this time
has created many new opportunities
i am interested in talking with you to see if we can do some type of transaction with you guys
it sounds like you have a lot going in areas that we might be interested in
if you could send me a business proposal or summary of what your doing
that would be helpful
with regards to columbia business school
i applied last year and did not get in due to my gmat score
i decided to take a graduate level finance class this summer
which i received an a
i am currently taking another graduate finance class this semester
i am also retaking the gmat
with the hopes of increasing my quantitative score
last year
i was asked back for an interview
which i felt was a good sign
i heard from one of my recommenders that the only thing that i needed to improve on was my gmat score
recently
i wrote a brief letter to the dean of admissions
linda meehan
informing her of my recent actions as well as my continued interest with columbia
i hope that these actions will help me get into columbia this year
my desire to go to columbia
stems from their network
location
reputation and curriculum
since growing up in pelham
it would be nice to get back to new york for a little while
as you can see
my desire to go to columbia is very strong
i hope this brief e-mail has provided some insight into what i'm doing to get into columbia
i hope we can meet for lunch sometime soon either up in the woodlands or downtown
again
thank you for your interest and i look forward to talking with you about columbia and future energy transactions
regards
ben rogers
sounds good
thanks for the quick reply
i live within inside the loop on buffalo speedway near 0

hope that works and i'll talk to you soon

just wanted to let you know that i just talked to don miller
the lead guy from our side
regarding a different matter
but he mentioned to me that things seemed to be not going so well in the psa discussions
i didn't have time to see what the issues were
but i will when he calls back
as you already know
these assets are yours to lose and i would hate to see you guys lose these assets to legal issues
i know we both can come to some middle ground before people lose their patience
my only advice
for what its worth
is to keep talking with delainey and to make sure the lawyers don't run away with the issues and forget whats at stake on the commercial side
hope this helps
ben
michael
duke is presenting their final bid this sunday
so i think its even more important to get the psa signed by tomorrow
so that there is no chance to try and retrade the deal

i know michael is talking to dave
but talking to ken would really help my cause
let me know what you think
i also am sending you a presentation that you will really enjoy
regards
ben
how did you like the counter-party
ben
thought you would be interested in this
seems to come at a time when bushis going to win the presidency
very interesting
ben
rogers
just wanted to meet up tomorrow for a few minutes to discuss some trading opportunities
i think you said tomorrow at 0:0 pm would work for you
thanks
ben
mitch
just wanted to talk to you for a quick second about something we talked about this week
please give me a call and i'll come down
ben
yeah right
nice try
geek
this pc has not been set up for it
i'll get it set up soon
do you have aol
whats up
what's up
how's the week going
things are getting back to normal down here in houston
how's your brother doing
has he gone back to work
what's up buddy
how's school going
did you get this e-mail on the dolan's
are we getting that old that our friends are beginning to have kids
say it ain't so
i am stillin shock over everything that happened last week
i think our economy that is in for a beating for quit some time
our stock has gotten hammered
the safe havens are the yield stocks
gotto go trade the power
talk to you later
ben
wierd
someone has too much free time on their hands
carefull
don't make me deny you of sex
dad
let me know if you got the fedex package i sent you yesterday
it has some info i want to go through with you this weekend
also
i sent you cliff's resume for you to look at so that you can give him a call with the hopes of hiring him for a finance position
i'll talk to you soon
ben
sorry it took so long to respond
but its been crazy around here
both kmi and kmp are still good buys
its just the overall market environment thats bringing these down
also
the commodities prices in gas and crude and fuel oil have come off quite a bit
which makes the general investors worry about the future earnings potential of the companies
they are locked into contracts at a very good price
so whether the price of the commodity goes up or down they still make their cash flow targets
remember
the ceo of the company has a stack of over 0% of the company
so he is very tied to the overall stock price
enough said
invest your money into kmi and kmp
especially kmp since it has that yield of around 0%
talk to you soon
ben
mr
lay
it was good to see you down on the trading floor today
i have been in the power trading group for about a year now
i came over from the corp
development group after we sold the peakers to allegheny and to cinergy
i was the one who convinced my dad to buy those two peakers
the power trading group is a really solid group of individuals
sitting where i do i see and hear alot of what goes on in the heart on enron and i feel that this part of the company is doing really well
i have been with enron for over four years now and i continue to learn alot as well as contribute to enron's bottom line
eventhough enron's stock price has come off a little i still think this is a great company and that the overall fundamentals are very sound
i hope all is going well
regards
ben
thanks
dad
how do you like that
rumors are everywhere
give me a call
ben
jeff
i have a report that talks about enron in depth
like a former executive wrote it
but its by a group called global change associates
would you still like a copy
let me know
ben
jeff
it looks like we are playing eachother in the met's consolation round
the best time i can play is either after work or some time on the weekend
let me know what works for you
ben
i will be here trading away
look forward to it
see you then
ben
it's been a really tough day
i need a beer
we may get one beer pretty soon or maybe not
i'll let you know soon
ben
alan
the alarm on the ny model seems too be coming out slow
can you please check on it and see what the deal is
thanks ben
jeff
i think we may be past due on when we need to play by
but thats fine
i think saturday works for me as well
i know things are quite busy right now
so good luck with everything
ben
yeah
yeah
yeah
we will be going to texadelphia around 0:0
i will still call you when we get there
love ben
good luck
the day is not going so well
i'll talk to you later
everyday that we are on the front cover of the journal our stock will go lower
i have said this the past three weeks and everyday i have been right
i think it could continue to go lower
because their is going to be no good news for a little while
getting access to cash from private equity firms is a double edge sword
it doesn't look good for the small e
i needed the cpn lifeboat three weeks ago
this ship is going down
takeover soon or bankruptcy later
no joke
let me check with megan
but that sounds good
ben
remember
those cannot be used for blackmail when i run for mayor of new york
michael
i think things begin to fall apart before x-mas
ben
david
whats up
i think tomorrow seems to be a big ax day over here for many of the groups in eim and egm
it's getting pretty grim here on the trading floor
most people seem to think that this deal will not go through and that we will go into ch
0
trading has really slowed down
how do things look over there
ben
the word is
the end is near
look for something soon
call me
ben
whats your cell #
i think i gave mike cyrus your home #
i talked with him last night and he was going to give you a call
lets you and me try and talk today
i have some material about these guys that you will appreciate
ben
michael
harry's cell phone number is
0
0-0
i think i gave you his home number
this number may be better to use to get in touch with harry
ben
sounds good
0:0
sounds good
harry
wanted to get your comments on your conversation with michael
i think it would be good if we put something together using the information i have combined with what you would like to show them
then think about going up there pretty soon
let me know what you think
ben
michael
i just had another brief conversation with harry
he had not heard from bruce yet
i think coming down here sooner rather later would be important to get harry and his team convinced
harry is talking to other folks and it seems that those talks are moving along quite quickly
hope this helps
ben
harry
what did you think of the presentation thus far and what other type of info are you looking for
the rest of the presentation is not that strategy oriented like the pages i gave you
but i will go through it and see if any of the other pages will help
the key is to get an idea of what they are trying to do so that you can craft in that fashion
i am playing tennis at 0:0
but will call you later to talk more about the presentation and tomorrow's meeting
ben
0 mw's is correct
thanks
ben
ben
unfortunately yes
the traders and finance folks were kept on to perform unwind and liquidation functions
the trading group
the group i am in
is really the only group with value besides the pipleines
thus we will probably be sold off to a bank like citi or jpm
i wouldn't mind that because they understand the trading business of commodities as well as equities and fixed income
this as been an amazing experience and taught me alot about over leverage and strategic
really about what not to due
which can be as important as what to do in business
0% of the folks are good hardworking people
but its the few finance guys at the top that brought this company down
it really is a shame to see all these people yesterday get laid off
it was so sad
luckily
by accident i had sold off most of my options last year
but still lost a little 0 k dough
but i still have my health as my mom likes to say
on a good note we got your picture of the little tike
looks great
i hope all is going well and thanks for the e-mail
talk to you soon
regards
ben
sounds good
see you there
sorry about that
i had to get a name and number from mike for a guy at goldman sachs in new york
to arrange a potential meeting with those guys in nyc for a trading position
i already paid $0,0 to ml today
so its not an increase in margin
plus you will write me a check for the current margin balance tonight
see you at home
ben
whenever
i am going to leave here pretty soon
so whenever the best time for you is
just let me know
is the car ready
yes
i am going to go workout in a couple of minutes
talk to you layer
i will be going up to cinci a week from today
good discussions happened last night
ben
yes
i think so
i am still employed
just waiting to be bought out by a bank like citigroup or ubs
it's been crazy to live through all of this shit
this has been an incredible learning experience of what not to do in business
these guys at the top are complete crooks
anyway
enough bs
megan and i are heading up to boston for x-mas
were getting together with jon and kati one day
well be out in colorado for new year's
i hope all is going well and i'll talk to you soon
thanks for the e-mail
ben
joe
thanks for the call
my e-mail at work
which is fine to send it to
is benjamin.rogers@enron.com
my e-mail at home is rogersofenron@yahoo.com
i talked with harry yesterday and he is bringing up with him all the resumes of the guys we are thinking about bringing over
do you want him to give them to mccabe or you or both when he is up there
maybe someone should give hime a call before that to have the resumes sent up there sooner
i will send you and mccabe my resume today
i look foward to coming up to cincy wednesday to talk to you guys about these opportunities
regards
ben
yes
thanks again for taking the time to arrange all this
talk to you soon
regards
ben
dad
here is a quick stock analysis spreadsheet you should really get to use
call me if you have any questions or we can go through it when we are out there in colorado
did you have a chance to meet with harry
i was suppose to come up
but some of the guys weren't available
ben
missy
if you could change that to a taxi service
that would be great
since this is only a one day trip it's makes it a little easier for me
thanks again
ben
dad
cliff sent you his resume
cliff is the guy who is married to megan's sister dierdre
they currently live in nyc
he is looking to do corporate development type work with you guys in cincy
let me know what you think
i left a message for brian terp to send me his resume so i can send it to you
let me also know about your conversation with michael about what we talked about yesterday
talk to you soon
ben
eric
there is a book store called the brown book store located several blocks from here
they have several books on trading within this industry that you will want to read
you will need to call information to find out where they are
good luck
ben
joe
thanks for taking the time to talk with me regarding the opportunities at cinergy
i enjoyed my discussions with the other guys on the trading floor
there is clearly money to be made trading in the right regions with the right people
i would like to continue trading
but also learn cinergy's assets to better understand how to effectively trade around these types of assets
it seems that everyone i talked to is enthusiastic about growing the business in the right regions
let me know if you guys need me to come up and visit again
thanks again and i'll talk to you soon
regards
ben
dad
i thought the article was very poistive
but started out a little on the
good old boy
side
you are operating in a political minefield very effectively
keep up the great work
talk to you soon and have a good week
ben
your talk is cheap
i sat next to your dad all day yesterday at the kmi investor conference
we had a good chat
talk to you soon
ben
please tranfer my parking over to the allan center
please let me know what i need to due as soon as possible
thanks for the heads up
ben rogers
dave
i hope all is going well
i left you an e-mail regarding coming over to work for you
i decided to not except the ubs deal
so i wanted to come work for you and janet
since i have already talked with these guys
i am pretty much available today going forward
again
you know what i have done and i think it would be a good fit
hope to hear from you soon
regards
ben
i will call him today
i have mover off the trading floor and i am actually back on 0st floor where we used to work in trading and origination
talk to you later
ben
have you noticed where cin summer is trading lately
thats right around $0.0 to $0.0 that is lower than where it liquedated last summer and based on the fundamentals regarding gas
it looks like its heading lower than that by april
just wanted to keep you well informed and hope that your guys were in the right position
it was a pretty violent price move these last several weeks
hope all is going well and i'll talk to you soon
ben
dad
i heard that cin summer is down to $0
$0
gas is going to be below $0.0 for the summer by march
looks like your idea to short the whole year at $0.0 was a very good idea
again make sure your guys are looking at it right
i think summer cin will get to be around $0 before april and thats when you start buying it up
let me know what you think
merrill came out with a good report on you guys today
i need to talk to you about a couple of things
please give me a call at home when you get the chance
ben
it all comes down to the rotten deal culture this place became
i-banks have this kind of deal culture
but they seem to have the right controls in place
plus they are a lot bigger and the sec is a clear watchdog in their dealings
ben
excuse me
you mean to say
what you learned in kindergarten
are the skills you need to have for the rest of your lifetime
rosanna
this most recent year i was in the power trading group for enron working in the northeast market
where i was a junior trader
but doing alot of senior trader type stuff
i would be interested in talking with those guys if they are looking for someone like myself
i know that most of the senior traders are staying with ubs
there are a couple who have been looking elsewhere
some i think with goldman
let me see where those guys are at
i will send you my resume when i get home
so you will see it come through my home e-mail
thanks again and talk to you soon
ben
rosanna
sorry about not getting back with you
i am actually out in vail/beaver creek
working on my skiing
since now is a pretty good time to work on that
i am still interested in talking with your contacts
i will call you tomorrow morning
i hope all is going well and i'll talk to you soon
thanks again for your patience and help with this issue
regards
ben
greg
i went to the meeting to look at valuing some of the outstanding contracts
it will take some time to make sure that we have the correct forward prices on some of these contracts
i will report back to you soon how all that is going and prepare written summaries to you asap
hope this helps under these specific circumstances
regards
ben
you have way too much free time on your hands
you maybe should be back in bed and not at work causing trouble between already troubled employees
nice art work
paul

ben
billy

need to play some tennis before i leave
i'll give you a call later
ben

sounds good
meet at the briar club
yes
otto's or texadelphia
dad
did you see that dynegy is spinning off a mlp called dynegy energy partners
exactly what i have been talking about could be happening and that is still a very good idea
with maybe some of the players in your area
also
john rowe as been named sole ceo and chairman of exelon
they came out yesterday and said they were interested in merging with a midwest utility
talk to you soon
ben
is this the enron effect happening over there today
ben
hey
where do you think delaney goes
goldman
stan
its been a very interesting ride these last four and a half years here
i received an offer from ubs
but decided to turn it down for personal reasons
these last few weeks i have been with the estate working on selling certain assets
tomorrow is my last day with the estate and then i am off to ohio and cinergy to continue trading
i will also begin to learn the oprations of cinergy as well as go back and get an executive mba at chicago
ultimately
i want to learn more about the overall operations and effective energy risk management
i just wanted to thank you for all you have done while i have been here
i look back and think that i should have spent time in the pipeline group
even after all that has happened i certainly wouldn't change what i have experienced
thanks again for being such a good friend
hope you are doing well and good luck with everything
i will send you my new information at cinergy
my dad would love to hear from you sometime
regards
ben
our legal is reviewing right now

i'll have a final answer tomorrow
susan
stevens

0/0/0
let me know if she doesn't get it by tomorrow
thanks
susan
stevens
i just spoke to stacy dickson and she confirmed that the contract was mailed out a week ago
she will e-mail it to molly and mail it again regular mail
sorry for the delay
susan
just checking to make sure molly got the contract yesterday via email
let me know if she didn't
thanks susan pereira
thanks for the update
susan
stevens
i've called stacy dickson and provided the term changes for the confirmation
thanks
susan
the if term should be nov.0
0
feb
0
0
sorry if i messed up on the phone
thanks
susan
looks good
stacy
thanks for your help
susan
it may be time for a drink
susan
leslie
i was wanting to know what the imbalances are booked at
are they all mark-to-marketed or valued at some historical pricing
also
can you work with lig on the paperwork for settling the imbalance
thanks
susan
nelson probably has most of the deals
here are mine for october with the sitara numbers
superior
mobile bay
0,0 vintage
koch
no oct deal but sept deal was 0 santa fe/snyder
stingray superior
sea robin
0
leslie
we will cashout the imbalance with the two koch entities in the following way
we owe koch 0,0 mmbtu at $0.0/mmbtu
which equals $0,0.0
which equals $0,0.0
the net of these imbalances is $0,0.0 due to enron
let me know if you have any questions
i negotiated this with scott garrison at koch
thanks
susan pereira
cinergy has agreed to settle the imbalance of 0,0 mmbtu owed them at $0.0/mmbtu
please prepare the paperwork showing us paying them $0,0.0 to clear this imbalance
thanks
susan pereira p.s
you can just address the letter to daniel kieran
is this a receivable for lrc or enron
if the receivable is for ena
it will have to be settled separately
andy ring talks to koch for day trading
maybe she could pursue this
susan pereira
stevens
destin does not feel comfortable with volumes yet at your meter
they are waiting for final meter numbers before allocating to our transport contract
that should happen some time next week
we will send you those numbers and the prices once we receive the final allocation
thanks
susan pereira
the only info i had from you is that we owed proenergy 0,0 mmbtu
i asked you if we had any other outstanding imbalances with cinergy or its precursors
you gave me the onyx volume
but i had already negotiated the deal
whose imbalance is the 0,0 mmbtu
susan pereira
thanks
we'll take the lesson on the 0th at 0 am
thanks
susan pereira
helen
what is the mailing address
susan pereira
we have not received any final allocation from destin
i'm not sure what the holdup is
i think joe talked with harvey at rebel and communicated this to him today
susan
here are the gas daily prices for sonat on the days of allocated flow
let me know if you need any more info
susan
good questions
the volumes are at the wellhead
so the fuel volumes would need to be deducted
destin has changed their fuel to 0.0%
as for the prices
the sonat gas daily prices should be reduced by $0.0
mmbtu transportation
let me know if you have any more questions
susan
stevens
i haven't heard back from our accounting group on what their fax number is
in the meantime
you can just fax the invoice to me at 0-0-0
susan
we will not be settling the el paso/stingray imbalance
el paso insists on being paid back in kind
as opposed to cashing out at prices when the imbalance occurred
we'll just carry the imbalance on our books
maybe we'll pay it back next year
thanks
susan pereira p.s
was new paperwork sent out to cinergy
we were allocated a total of 0 mmbtu at the receipt point for november
i think our contract for november is at the average of the inside ferc postings for the three pipes plus a penny
those prices are as follows
transco zone 0 $0.0 florida zone 0 $0.0 the same transport fee and fuel percentage as last month should be deducted from this price
i think the allocated fuel was 0 mmbtu
also
keep in mind that we scheduled 0,0 mmbtu per rebel's directions
ena will have to cash out the difference with destin
at higher prices
thanks
susan pereira
jane
i've corrected the transport and fuel deducts in sitara and e-mailed the eott folks
thanks susan
stevens
i wanted to clarify with you the transportation costs on destin
the transportation rate is $.0/mmbtu and the aca charge is $.0/mmbtu
this should be deducted from the net volumes received on our transportation contract
the net volumes are the volumes allocated to our contract for redelivery after 0.0% fuel in kind has been deducted from the gross volumes at the receipt point into destin
if you bill us on gross volumes
then you must deduct the value of the fuel as well as the $.0/mmbtu in transportation costs from the pipeline
from my calculations
deducts from gross volumes would be $.0 in oct
$.0 in nov
and $.0 in dec
please let me know if you have any questions
thanks susan pereira
my understanding is that our deal converted to the average of three if indices +
0
less transport and fuel
effective november thru february
the november price would then be $0.0 +
0 = $0.0 less $.0 less 0.0% fuel
the december price would be $0.0 +
0 = $0.0 less $.0 less 0.0% fuel
please let me know if this is not your understanding
also
please keep in mind ena has taken losses on cashing out negative imbalances on this production
thanks
susan pereira
whoops
i goofed
the transport deduct on gross volumes
including fuel value
is $.0
the transport deduct on net volumes is $.0
sorry for the confusion
susan
do you know if we have actually collected on the imbalance settlement payments from koch and lig
also
are we in agreement with el paso on the stingray imbalance volume
0,0 mmbtu due stingray
i have a statement from el paso showing this volume
they want us to sign and return the volume statement
thanks
susan pereira
leslie
have you sent any confirmation to el paso stating our agreement with the imbalance and that it has been transferred to ena
susan
helen
is a stand-by time available for sunday afternoon around 0 pm

susan pereira
helen
would a private lesson be available on saturday or sunday at 0 pm
thanks
susan pereira
we'll be there at 0 pm on sunday
thanks susan pereira
kali pereira was not able to make the lesson on sunday the 0st due to car trouble
by my calculations
she has taken 0 private lessons since and including dec 0
leaving an $0 balance of the $0
that would allow for 0 additional private lessons
what days and times will work over the next few weeks
saturdays and sundays will work depending on the time
after school during the week might work
with the exception of mondays
thanks
susan pereira

i am resending this
as i have not received any reply
susan pereira
sunday at 0 pm will work
thanks
susan pereira
i can be there
susan
either day will work for me
susan pereira
the three indices are 0.0,0.0 and 0.0
the average is $0.0
so
the contract price is $0.0 +
0 less
0 transport on the net of fuel volumes
if you invoice on gross volumes you will need to deduct the value of the fuel
0.0%
thanks
susan pereira
i don't have any issues
thanks
susan enron north america corp
dave
there are several little features that eol traders such as myself would like to see on the website and stack manager
i realize that there may be bigger issues being worked on currently
but would it be possible for eol to survey enron traders as well as outside traders on suggestions for enhancements
for example
i'd like to be able to sort completed trades by date on stack manager
also
it would be nice if we could have a shading feature on the website
so people could shade products different colors
this might cut down on trades made in error
thanks
susan pereira
kathy

hi
elise
sorry to bother you
but when kali was unwrapping her presents last night
there were two without cards or tags
probably lost in transit
we narrowed it down to laura and sofi
so that we can get the thank you notes correct
did laura give kali a skipper doll or a bath set in a blue bag
thanks for your help
susan p.s
we ended up selling 0 boxes at the booth on saturday
thanks
i had a feeling laura's gift was the bath bag
as for the $0 donation
i'm glad we got it
because we ended up short on the cash collected for the cookies
susan
stevens
joe put a call into destin today
but our contact was out
once we talk to the right person and find out exactly what needs to be done

i'll let you know as soon as i know
susan

kali was a little hesitant
when do you think you'll be coming here and when do you think you'll leave
we'll need to coordinate the travel schedules
we're going to use onepass miles for at least two tickets
so we'll need to finalize things in early april to get seats
talk to you soon
susan p.s
happy birthday early
stevens
we've moved up the food chain at destin
but have not received a response yet
i'll be out next week

i left my paperwork in the green box at your doorstep yesterday
i wanted to make sure you received it
i'll be out of town until march 0

i just got back in town
monday the 0nd will work for me
susan
hi
jan
i hope you are all doing well
maman has updated us on your mother's condition
i know it must be stressful
especially from long distance
kali liked her birthday gifts
believe it or not
we didn't already have the world pup movie
we had rented it back in february and the kids liked it
i'm not sure if you got my last email before we left on vacation
but i was wondering what your travel schedule was in june
when will you be arriving
when will you be returning
kali has warmed up to the idea of travelling without us on the plane
etc
the earliest we could leave for brazil would be the evening of friday
july 0
we would probably need to return to houston by july 0
let me know how that sounds
also
if we need to reschedule for another time until you get things straight for your mother
let me know
that's certainly more important
talk to you soon
susan
i would like to have a spot in the new garage
susan w
pereira
ok
here's the plan
kali and michael will leave for brazil with y'all on wed
the 0th on the evening flight
let me know the exact continental flight number so we can make the reservations
we'll get the seat assignments coordinated later i guess
renato and i will take a flight out of houston on the evening of july 0
arriving saturday morning
the four of us will return to houston on the next fri
night flight
0th
i think we've decided not to go to foz do iguacu
since we have so little time
instead
we'd like to go to rio for a few days
can we all go together and drive
maybe you could get hotel reservations there
let me know what you think
we're excited about the trip
the kids can't wait
susan
david
is the meeting on for april 0
susan
kathy
i got your message
kali has been going to the thursday practices
with the exception of the last three weeks due to rainout
spring break and a going away party for a friend
she'll be there on this thursday
do you have a uniform for her
maybe she would feel part of the team if she gets a shirt and has that for the next game
i'll try to work on her
thanks
susan pereira
thanks
see you on thursday
susan
jan
i checked the website for the hotels at foz
the tourism website is down
it looks like a great place
i'll have to convince renato to go
you know
he might miss out on working out for one day
i think the kids might like it too
did alexia and sebastien like it or was it too much walking
i asked my boss about it
he went with his family when he was living in argentina
they really enjoyed it
can you go ahead and check on flights and which hotel to stay at
the hotel colonial iguacu e spa looked like the nicer one on the internet
i imagine the flights will be cheaper booking them there
is that right
let me know the airline and i'll check here
i guess we would go on july 0 and return on july 0
also
would y'all want to go as well
thanks for your help
susan
tomorrow at 0:0 would work better
wednesday is aga storage day and it's hard for me to get away before0pm

susan p.s.-did you get my other email
sorry
you probably sent it to my home email
susan
jan
i was looking at the wrong week
sorry
stress and sleep deprivation are my only excuses
how much time should we spend in rio
should we leave for foz on the 0th
i just heard about the cataratas this morning from scott neal
that was the place he suggested and that sounds great
i'll work on renato when he gets back in town
thanks
susan
thanks for your help
jan
renato just got home late last night
i'll have to inform him of our travel plans
talk to you soon
susan

marla is planning on signing up blakely for the second session there

it sounds like your girl scout outings are a little more exotic than ours
our last event was an overnight campout in one of the girls
backyards
the girls had a lot of fun
i was lucky and didn't have to volunteer
michael got to be an only child for the night and got all the attention
he loves it when kali spends the night away
talk to you soon
susan
that sounds great
we're looking forward to the trip as well
the kids are anxious to have alexia and sebastien here to play with
i don't know if there are any activities in particular that alexia and sebastien want to do
but i know kali and michael would be happy just to play at home and swim
mayba a movie or two
by the way

kali was not able to make last sunday's game due to a schedule conflict that i had
plus
she will not go to the last game because her best friend's birthday party is at the same time
i had her skip another friend's party to make the one game she did participate in
all the softball girls schedule their parties on sunday so as not to conflict with those games
if it's not too late
do not order a trophy for her
she really was never much of a team participant
i'm hoping her enthusiasm this fall will be like last fall and not this spring
thanks for all your help
time and effort

i would like to recommend strongly that the city of west university postpone its work at colonial park until late may 0
at least 0-0 girls
ages 0-0
in the west u softball association practice at the field in colonial park from february through may each year
what harm can it do to postpone the work so that the girls can play there this upcoming season
if the field is unavailable in 0
it will be very difficult to find suitable practice sites on such short notice
especially near west u
west u is all about family and community
what's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to use public park space
sincerely
susan pereira
thanks for your support
susan pereira
dear mr
may
i am writing to request that west u postpone the planned work at colonial park until late may 0
over 0 girls
ages 0-0
involved in the west u softball association practice at the field in the park from february through may every year
wusa would have a very hard time finding a replacement field at this late notice
especially anything close to west u
what harm would it do to delay the city's plans until the summer
west u prides itself on being a city focused on community and families
what's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to practice on public park space
sincerely

hi
fellow p&z members
i just wanted to let you know about the meeting david moss and i had with dan muniza of center america
sweet mesquite restaurant is very interested in the existing eckerd's site and is now willing to wait until next summer when eckerd's moves into its new proposed building on the west side of the property
where weiner's is now
sweet mesquite expressed an interest in some outdoor seating area and dan muniza wanted some warm fuzzies that the city would allow center america/sweet mesquite to use city easement along braes for a patio area
currently
that area is being used for parking
the proposed patio would be above the street level by around two feet or so
basically
center america would extend the existing sidewalk that abuts eckerd's out to the street and fence in the whole patio area with decorative fencing or brick
they would also include some plantings
greenery
etc
david moss is checking with david allums
city attorney
about any potential liability with center america/sweet mesquite using city easement
also
there is an existing water line under this parking area that would need to be relocated closer to the street
i think david will be able to give us a cost estimate on this at our next meeting
david did mention that the line is in need of replacement anyway
as for the new eckerd's building
dan muniza did not have the proposed elevations from eckerd's yet
he's expecting to get something this week
he's reserving the right to pick something that will blend in with the existing center
also
there was some concern at the last city council meeting about the additional parking needs of a sweet mesquite
dan muniza indicated that the parking behind the center is open to anyone
they prefer that it be available for center america employees and tenants during the day
but it's wide open after 0 pm
david moss will be contacting everyone soon about scheduling a meeting to discuss the city's proposed landscaping ordinance
he wanted to do that prior to comp
plan meeting on the 0th
thanks
susan pereira
david
after thinking about it and talking with other p&z members
i think we can suggest some more ideas to dan muniza on the outdoor seating area
since the restaurant does not need the entire area
maybe they could use the front part or the middle part
if they used the middle part
we could reclaim the front and back and put plantings and/or suitable trees
also
dora suggested they use some kind of decking instead of concrete
maybe when p&z meets again we can flesh out some of these ideas
next time you talk with dan
please mention using only a part of the area
thanks
susan
terry
i can drive my sequoia to practice and take 0 girls to baskin robbins as well
between you and me
that should be enough space for all the girls
susan
no
i've forwarded your message to christina sanchez
she was the one who reallocated the volumes
she will look at it again
let me know if there is anything else i can do
thanks
susan
hi
connie
sorry i didn't get back to you on friday
things got busy
the stock is still going down
but not as much
it's at $0.0 right now
yippee
i'm hoping all the skeletons are out of the closet now
i guess i'll be working another 0 years or so
i don't think the stock will get back to $0 or $0 until then
there aren't any new businesses for enron to get into to make the stock analysts excited
all the money we're making in trading is apparently not doing it for them
who knows what will happen to the executives who are still here
it might be hard to get a concrete case against them
i'm sure some of them are in the same boat as the rest of us
oh
news flash
ene $0.0
i think wall street wants ken lay's head on a platter
i'm sure the stock analysts are really frustrated that jeff skilling isn't here anymore
they would have gutted him
old skilling is just grinning in his new river oaks mansion
i think i would gut him if i crossed paths with him
i think i should sign up for anger management classes
as for my car purchase
yes
i traded in my land cruiser for a toyota sequoia
i got a really good deal on my trade-in and paid cash for the balance
two days later
renato found out from his new boss that renato's position was superfluous
this boss is the only entergy guy to survive the entergy-koch trading merger
they put him in between renato and his former boss
and this guy decided that they didn't need both of them
entergy-koch is so small that there aren't any other comparable positions open
the guys working for renato are sick about it
the upper management at entergy-koch has done a review of this entergy guy since he told renato to take a hike
everyone
peers and employees
told management in the review process that the guy was a two-faced loser with zero personality
of course
now
renato has already signed off on his settlement agreement
plus
he'd never consider going back
they are paying him through the end of the year and vesting him in all the savings plans
they are also paying him a year's salary
and he's currently doing a consulting job for the pipeline
he's been actively looking for a new job
hopefully
he'll find one
or i'll be working until i'm 0
oh
well
maybe i'll have some good news next time
susan
i've left a message with my contact at vintage
i haven't heard back yet
i do know that in oct and nov the gath
fee is
0
i'll let you know when i find out about sept
thanks

rudy
yes
i agree to the cancellation of deal 0
thanks
susan pereira
this just in
ene at $0.0
good thing my guns are locked up
susan
valerie
i just found out from robert eubank at vintage that he was telling me the wrong thing for the gathering charges
sln 0 has always had a
0 gathering fee
sln 0 gath
charges are as follows
sept
0
oct
0
nov
0
i'll adjust the sitara tickets
but i'll have to weight average the gathering
you'll need to fine tune it since you're dealing with the actual volumes from each wellhead point
thanks
susan
thanks a lot
karen
ugh
no kidding
i'll be afraid to look at my third quarter savings plan statement when it comes next month
each time i lose a digit on the total
i was thinking about retiring next year--ha ha
it looks like retirement has been delayed indefinitely
talk to you later susan
valerie
with the gathering charge corrections
do we have any other outstanding issues with vintage
susan
laurie
christina was going to review the allocation and change if needed last week
are we square with superior now
susan
sorry for the confusion
thanks for your help
susan
nope
no relation
we're only related to poor pereiras
susan
valerie
are we ok with vintage now
susan
my husband is no longer with koch
but we do live in southside
we moved to southside when it was the same price as west u
we're definitely some of the poorer folks in southside now
you didn't offend me at all
i wish i were related to someone on the board of directors
is the koch/sabine interconnect already mapped to sabine
susan
yes
i will be there
is the trainer supposed to come tonight
susan
laurie
no
i have not put a new ticket in the system
i wrote up a paper ticket and alejandra chavez adjusted the term of the existing sitara ticket
i'm not sure how it is supposed to be handled
you might check with alejandra and kam keiser
apparently
we've had some similar deals with other counterparties
the nymex desk people told me that credit doesn't want us paying one lump sum for unwinds
do you have any instructions concerning this
given our current financial situation
thanks
susan pereira
we support you 0%
chris
thanks
laurie

stevens
i don't think anything has changed
the transport rate is $.0 + 0.0% fuel
the pricing is the average + $.0
i've emailed tricia to see what the problem is
susan
i think we've got the prices right in our system now
susan
let me know if your payment doesn't look right
susan
thanks

mr
lay
after reading the news of your $0,0,0 to $0,0,0 payout
i am disgusted and appalled all over again
unfortunately
that's a daily occurrenci have been employed with enron since may of 0
when enron purchased lrc
i was very skeptical of enron back then and was unsure of my future with the company
as time went on
i got more comfortable with the enron way and learned how to survive and even be a little successful here
i became a believer in the things enron could accomplish
a champion of our hard-nosed
driven executives
at least some of them
i bought enron stock and held on to those valuable options
over the last 0 months
my coworkers and i have viewed the weekly
sometimes daily
selling of enron stock and exercising of options by our top executives
past and present and including you
we came up with all kinds of reasons that the executives would be doing this
they're so overly compensated that they have to cash out some every now and then
divorce settlements
mistress settlements
buying a new home in aspen
buying an island in the caribbean
etc
etc
etc
we never wanted to admit that they knew something we didn't
things were great
weren't they
jeff skilling told us that enron was going to be the
world's leading company
he even put the goofy acronyms on his car license plate
he told us gas traders in february how the stock was going to $0 by the end of the year
now
being the cynic that i am
i didn't believe the $0
although i have to admit i was hopeful
i figured that if jeff had the audacity to throw out a number that high
then it was reasonable to expect the stock to be fairly stable
i.e.,needless to say
i didn't sell my stock and didn't exercise any more options
in fact
i bought more stock when it first started going down
i'm afraid that there are many more just like me
i'm fortunate in that i have many working years ahead of me
where
i don't know
to try to build up my savings again
many others are not that fortunate
so many have spent their entire careers here
helping to build this company up
they were looking forward to retiring soon and enjoying the fruits of their labor
and let me remind you that their retirement accounts were in many cases a lot less than a month's compensation for you
now even that is essentially gone
other employees were just ready to cash in some of their options to pay for their children's college tuition
the stories are too numerous to list
and the more i think about it
the more sickened i become
it is painfully obvious to me and my coworkers
as well as the rest of the industry and houston
that enron's executives knew that there were skeletons in the closet and began cashing in ahead of this freefall
the employees and the rest of the world were fed a bunch of half-truths and mystery mumbo-jumbo
there should be an accounting for this behavior
you and your cohorts have ruined so many lives
think about that while you're spending your millions
susan pereira ena gas trader
kimberly
i would like a loaner laptop for the weekend
is that possible
also
the ice machine by us is not dispensing ice anymore
thanks
susan p.s
i promise not to complain about anything next time i write
why are we at the 0% and not something less
when is the 0 day period over
susan
still here
but don't know for how long
i still can't believe the arrogant assholes who have run this company into the ground
because our credit rating keeps dropping
our trading abilities are being adversely affected
i don't know how long things will be able to go on at this rate
we may not make it to the end of the year
dynegy deal or not
i'm hopeful that the remaining finance people can refinance our debt
but if they don't
it doesn't look good
oh
well
we'll all just move on and look for other jobs
oh
by the way
we just moved into the new building this past weekend
we're sitting near the power trading arrogant assholes
hope everything is going well for you
how is your house coming along
send me a note back
i'm going to be out tomorrow but will be back in on monday
they start laying off people next week
it won't be in gas and power
but in other areas of the corporation
merry christmas
take care
susan
i just wanted to thank all the girls and the parents for the autographed t-shirt and the restaurant gift certificate
i really appreciate it
i had a lot of fun working with the girls
they were all so enthusiastic and committed to the team effort
it was very rewarding for me to see how the team came together and improved so much
the girls have a lot to be proud of
i hope to see everyone in the spring soccer program or next fall
thanks again to all the parents for your efforts and time commitment
especially to terry
jon and vicki
have a great holiday season
take care
susan pereira p.s
terry
could you forward this on to the reeses
please
i don't have their email address
thanks
i tried to send this to your home email
but it was undeliverable
hi
connie
the trading groups
the ones that used to make all the money
are still working full days
we're trying to trade
but our number of counterparties decreases daily
i don't know if we'll make it through the next week
they are laying off people this week
so i hear
in other groups
i don't know who has been notified
we may all be walking out the door soon
as for the kids
yes
kali still believes in santa claus
i don't know if she knows and is not fessing up
we'll be here in houston for christmas
give us a call when you get here
we'd love to see you
thank goodness i already bought the kids
christmas gifts
they haven't written their lists yet
though
we went to a dude ranch in bandera
tx for thanksgiving weekend
the kids had a blast and want to go back next year
i guess i'll be updating my resume this weekend
it looks pretty bleak
talk to you soon
susan
i expect us to file bankruptcy today or tomorrow
we will likely be defaulting on a lot of our december business
there are some last ditch efforts going on
but i'm not very hopeful
if we file bankruptcy
i think we'll all get at least 0 days pay
there were supposed to be layoffs this week anyway
i guess those will happen
i don't know
they may wait until we file bankruptcy and see what the bankruptcy court judge wants the company to do first
stay tuned
craig
you might want to talk to ormet concerning deliveries for december
it is very likely we may have to default to them for december
we have nymex length and may be able to use some hub gas to transport to ormet
i don't know which deals will be served first

i got a response from ken on my email to him
in fact
he responded just a few days after i wrote him
but his assistant didn't send it back to me until today
he hand wrote a response on the printout of my email
susan
you're the best
ana
i think i am signed up as an alternate for the field trip on thursday

thanks
susan pereira

i really miss mine now that they are in kitty jail
i was successful shopping for jim on-line at b&n and territory ahead
mum
only the book will be shipped to your house
i was on autopilot and typed in my work address for the other
really missed the boat on tennis clothes
you have to act early
today i saw one of the met pros leaving with his catalog to order fall 0 nike stuff
karin
i am probably going to make a stop at macy's or neiman's makeup counter at some point so i could pick up the estee lauder for meemaw* if you know the shade
bill's b-day is today
if you want to send a message his e-mail is that's all this elf knows
* new trendy spelling with capital letter within the word
janet
please calendar these meetings for me
thanks
bryan
are you still having a great time
so what is bali like
the only images i can summon are gauguin's paintings
but weren't those of tahiti
things are pretty good here
lots of christmas parties
lots of christmas cheer
etc
not a whole lot going on at the office
for a change
really
though
i think i would much rather be in bali
take care
john buchanan and i discussed tw's transfer of gas from the pg&e/topock receipt/delivery point to the pg&e/topock park n
ride point to implement tw's use of pg&e's market center service
my understanding is that physically the points are one and the same
and that the transaction will simply be a paper transfer
since a contract is required in our system as a formality to implement the transfer
the rate tw will
charge
itself for the transfer is $0
this message is to confirm that i see no legal or regulatory problems with the above scenario
if you have any further questions
please do not hesitate to e-mail or call me
x0
hey girl
thanks for the book and the cd
i lazed around the house enjoying both yesterday morning
after we played tennis
bill took me to berryhill for fish tacos
al fresco
and later that evening we went to yet another christmas party
where i drank champagne
but luckily not too much
so it was a good birthday
have a good day
see the attached
one shows redlining
the other does not
and let me know if you have further questions
no comments this month
thanks
lindy and i are going to look at whether any changes will need to be made to the pro forma sheets we've filed
and will get back to you
i made a couple of minor changes
here are plain and redlined versions
i turned the tracker off on the plain one
also
be sure to fill in the contract #
did stan make the call to ferc
i wonder
drew
see mk's comments
i'm trying to come up with some new language to address her concerns
oops
wrong one
i meant mk had comments on red cedar
this one for duke is ok
drew
here's an excerpt from a ferc letter order accepting for filing a nonconforming agreement filed by dynegy midstream
sounds a little bit like what the tw guys are trying to do
if i understand the concept of volumetric rates correctly
left a message for my friend at dmp but he
like everyone else
is out
til next year
but since there were no subsequent orders issued in the docket i assume there were no problems with the filing
i'm still leaning towards recommending the $0 demand
$0.0 commodity + file as nego
rate approach
if steve harris is ok with the idea of doing a deal that requires filing
i will draft something and send it your way
the referenced negotiated transaction provides for a transportation service under dmp's rate schedule fts
rather than paying a reservation charge
the negotiated agreement specifies that kgs will pay a volumetric rate
the volumetric rate will equal dmp's maximum interruptible transportation service rate as set forth in dmp's tariff
the contract also
a
specifies five dth/d as kgs
maximum daily reservation quantity
b
lists kgs
primary receipt as meter # 0 and
c
identifies five primary delivery points for kgs
upon filing docket no
rp0-0-0
dmp stated that it agreed to the above negotiated rate so that kgs could serve small residential customers on dmp's system under a firm rate schedule
drew
i've attached my proposed changes to the red cedar contract
our beloved min/max language became a bit problematic
as you can see
i'd welcome your comments on this
see attached
wow
you struck a nerve with this one
my grandmother
mema
is an absolute nightmare when around family
but really sweet to everyone else
everyone tells me how wonderful and nice she is
she meets lots of people i know on her commute to her office downtown
and i just have to keep my mouth shut because no one would believe some of the things she says
does
example
over christmas she kept trying to tell my 0-months pregnant sister all kinds of delivery-room horror stories
i finally had to yell at her to get her to shut up
maybe you remember mema
she calls every so often and bullies receptionists and secretaries into tracking me down instead of just leaving a message
of course
everyone but me thinks it is really cute
hope your holiday was really great
since the 0 belt/suspenders approach didn't quite fit
i've had to try to convince mr
hertzberg that he ought to rely on the nga sec
0 exemption for gatherers
frank kelly and frazier concur with us on this
by the way
he is not convinced yet
although he is unable to cite any authority for his proposition that being a shipper on tw would subject a gathering company to ferc jurisdiction
i pointed out that agave
the owner and operator of an extensive gathering system that interconnects with tw's system
has for many years been a shipper on tw
also
lindy has found that red cedar already has a long-term transportation contract on another interstate system
transcolorado
so if hertzberg's theory is right they are going to jail anyway
red cedar also seems to be hung up on our requirement that shippers have title to the gas they ship
at this point lorraine and i believe they might just be looking for any excuse to get out of the deal
if anything interesting happens i'll let you know
anyway
ann isn't coming on friday because she can't stand it that everyone is a couple
so she is going instead with her ex boyfriend to a dinner party given by some people she doesn't even know
although i am trying very hard to be understanding
i'm not doing a very good job
when i was in her situation
i seem to remember enjoying my best friends
company whether i had a date or not
but that's just me
hope you are still having tanning weather in austin
we certainly are here
if you feel you are not getting enough color for your trip to cabo
i'll come before you leave and help you with the clinique tan-in-a-tube
you will still have to wear sunscreen
what are your trip dates again
have a good day
love
i'm attaching an article that i just received about the cpuc's and indicated shippers
protests of the recent ena deal on el paso
i have a call in to drew fossum to talk about formulating a formal response
and i will keep you in that loop in case you get any inquiries
my initial
unofficial reaction is that with the marketing affiliate rules and other safeguards in place
the fact that ena and transwestern have the same parent company should make no difference to the ferc
until further notice
i would avoid any communication with ena on these issues
if you have any questions
please e-mail or call me
x0
attached is shelley corman's response to jeff dasovich
based on conversations with drew and me
accordingly
i would advise you not to participate in the conference call jeff is setting up for tomorrow
questions
give me a call
steve
for your information
the case in which the commission denied ect's petition for a limited waiver of the shipper must have title rule appears at 0 ferc p 0,0
hi mum
ann and i saw
mr
ripley
and i lay awake last night wondering how else the main character could have dealt with his dilemma on the boat
i think i need to go to the movies more often
perhaps it will help me avoid this blurring of film and reality
my tendency is to really get involved when i see them on the big screen
might be going to san francisco next week
i'd really like to go
we'll see
probably i will come to austin on saturday but i've not heard from the landscaper yet
i doubt they will be working on the weekend though
hope you're having pretty weather as we have in houston today
love
our consulting agreement with igs for services related to the cpuc proceeding expired 0/0/0 but can be continued by mutual agreement of the parties
given the upcoming proceedings
i'd recommend that we act on this sooner rather than later
let me know and i'll draft a brief letter to mark baldwin
i've reviewed the igs market development agreement pursuant to your request
it expires 0/0/0
the agreement requires the parties to meet 0 days prior to that date for the purpose of discussing an extension but does not obligate us to agree to any such extension
as you know
i have a conflict tomorrow at 0
but would be happy to provide any other information you need for the meeting
lindy
do you know offhand whether our obas with pg&e and socal deviate from the usual 0% tolerance provided for in our tariff form oba
if not
who do you think might be able to tell me
rich
would you please add tim aron to your distribution list for the gallup weekly updates
and also forward him your latest
he is working on new mexico regulatory and legislative issues pertaining to our compression contract
and i thought your updates would help keep him in the loop
thank you

bill and i will leave for austin tomorrow a.m
as early as we can manage
i'm not picky about where we go for dinner
but was thinking bill might enjoy going to the bitter end brew pub
i'm sure they don't take reservations but it should not be a problem if we go early enough
the landscaper removed all the bushes in the front beds and it looks weird
can't wait for her to get the new gravel in my driveway
we'll call tomorrow a.m
if not sooner
have a good day
lorraine
here is the new language for the discount letter
you might want to compare the other language in the agreement to that of the existing one to make sure i got the right version
or i'll do it on monday
let me know if you have questions
i just ran it by drew and he is ok with it
ok
here's my first attempt
although i think red cedar's lawyers might be looking for more
they have not specifically requested it
so i decided to stick to making only the statements ed meaders mentioned in his 0 voice mails
i believe this may suffice
mary kay
please see the attached
red cedar has essentially asked us for acknowledgement that tw is willing to allow them to act as agent to transport gas for producers even though red cedar itself does not have title to the gas
drew has seen this and says he is going to discuss it with you
drew
here is the memo
i know you will add your own spin before sending it on to cordes
however
if there is anything you want me to fix
please do not hesitate to call
jeff
attached is our summary of the transwestern receipt point proposal for inclusion in cac's settlement proposal
i hope that this is helpful
if you have any comments
please let me know
lorraine
here is the letter
you will need to fill in the address
otherwise it's ready to go
let me know if you need anything else
including
janet
could you please try to find the files maria references in her e-mail
and i'll take it from there
thanks
please print out the attached on my letterhead
bring it over to me
thank you
i regret to report that i just ended a very unproductive phone conversation with mr
hertzberg
he thanked us for all our cooperation but politely declined to give me any information on what authority he was relying on to conclude that there is a jurisdictional problem
however
it sounded to me like whatever authority he does have is shaky at best
he also sounded interested in the possibility of our making some sort of anonymous inquiry at ferc
if such a thing is possible
on the issue
obviously they are very leery of making that phone call themselves and risking revealing their identity
he said he would discuss it with ed meaders
also
he mentioned that after tomorrow he will be on vacation for a month
and another attorney will be taking over in his absence
that could be good
or it could be bad
maybe lorraine can sweet talk meaders into at least citing us some cases from hertzberg's memo
at the very least
i hope he will show it to the kinder morgan lawyers
janet
can you open the attachment
i just rely on the market services folks to do the right thing
tell me if you think this is yet another area in which i have too much faith in our business people
lorraine
please forward the attached to ed meaders
i'm confused
are we asking for an extension of time to comply with the commission's conditions
or an extension of time to file a motion for rehearing
attached is my first try at our motion to extend time
your written comments would be appreciated
christine
you need a comma between july and august
otherwise this looks fine
please see the attached
hey k
thanks for the note
everyone is asking how you're doing
sorry to hear about your back
i know what it is like
as much as you are inclined to run around and get things done
the thing that worked best for me with my back problem was just to recline as much as possible
my house truly became a mess
but guess what
the world did not end
i really like your monosyllabic choices for names
kyle and quinn
for some reason i really like the name elizabeth with both of those
perhaps because it balances out the unisex quality of the first name
i think you really have to meet the baby before you decide for sure
who knows
she might turn out to be more of a gladys

the landscapers are almost finished with my yard
it looks really good
i even have a little palm tree
required for the heights
the last thing is to finish the driveway
right now there are 0 tons of black star gravel sitting in the back yard
time to work
try to take it easy
on january 0
0
ferc issued a section 0
c
certificate for transwestern's gallup expansion
the commission's order contained two conditions
0
that transwestern file its discounted rates within 0 days of the order
and 0
that transwestern restructure its relationship with enron compression services so that transwestern will have sufficient operation control over the motor at the gallup compressor station to assume regulatory responsibility for the motor's operation
and that transwestern file a report with the commission stating how it complied with this condition
transwestern accepted the certificate january 0
0 but reserved the right to seek rehearing or clarification of the order
on january 0
0
transwestern filed a motion for extension of time to comply with the condition that transwestern file its discounted rates
transwestern has already filed with the commission the discounted rates it will charge its expansion shippers
subject to a request for confidentiality
transwestern intends to file a request for rehearing of the january 0 order explaining why the commission erred in ordering transwestern to publicly disclose its discounted rates in advance of the normal time for making such disclosure through a discount report
lorraine

i added
maximum

to the chart but don't know whether i got it backwards
anyway
let's talk if you have any questions
hi mum
well
i mustered the courage to start my bathroom painting project yesterday
i chose a medium blue that looks very nice
guess who helped me
bill
he got pretty enthusiastic with that roller
so we were able to knock it out in about 0 hours
there was a lot of woodwork to tape off
tonight i will finish the tub area
which needed some repair/caulking/spackling
now i am anxious to do the bedroom
but probably will not get to it until next month
maybe you will be able to help me decide on a color when you are here this weekend
i'm torn between
happy yellow
and a lighter version of the blue i used in the bathroom
if i decide to paint any of the downstairs
i believe i will entrust that work to the professionals
got 0 tickets to the dance performance
since bill seems to genuinely enjoy dance
i invited him
so that leaves us with one ticket
if you would like to invite someone
just let me know
otherwise maybe one of my friends around here will join us
hope your weekend project was a success
talk to you soon
love
the only problem i can see with this is that paragraph 0 could be construed to encourage nmng to request amendment not only to increase the maxdtq but also to decrease it
if the maxdtq has been increased by a previous amendment
i worry that this might mislead nmng that the parties can decrease the maxdtq by agreement rather than nmng using capacity release procedures
however
the paragraph does not obligate tw to do anything
doesn't give nmng any rights
since any change in the maxdtq must be by mutual agreement
and it's subject to available capacity
since it does not seem to give either party anything they do not already get under the tariff
i think i would recommend we omit it
however
nmng might insist on this or similar language to reflect the
deal
or at least the conversations of the parties
if that's the case
i suppose i would advise the marketing folks to limit the language of paragraph 0 to an increase in maxdtq and explain that any decrease would have to be thru capacity release

the attached document shows my proposed changes to universal's agreement in redlining
i tried not to over-lawyer or make this overly complicated
but in my view this needed a lot of basic cleanup
many of my changes are simply to make the language more accurate
for example
in the use of defined terms
in a couple of places
i have questions
0
in the second opening paragraph
i don't know whether it is possible to attach the proposal as an exhibit
if not
ignore my change
0
section 0.a
their provision for an adjustment seemed a little unusual to me but it could work in favor of either party
so i left it in
if you don't like it
let me know
0
in section 0
i just tried to simplify the billing procedure in case of termination
let me know if this does not agree with your intent
please call me with your comments
and let me know how you would like to proceed
that is weird
i received your first message
dave
exhibit a of the o&m agreement is a description of the compressor motor facilities
do you have this
exhibit c is insurance coverages
i assume i need to get that from nemec
martha
please send me by interoffice mail copies of the executed documents drew has
mine seem to have vaporized
thank you
christine and i seem to have gotten phillips interested in a right to terminate if tw's minimum tariff rate ever exceeds the contract rate
they said they would mull it over
at least
but what they really would prefer to have is a provision in which they would get the contract rate no matter what
since this would make it a negotiated rate deal from day 0
i feel like i need to get your buy-in before we agree to it
steve has already told me it is ok with him
please advise
here's the summary we sent you before
with new reference to hector in redlining
call jeff
0-0-0
or me
0-0-0
if you have questions
mary kay and drew
please see christine's message below
this language is very similar to language that nng has used to address the change-in-rates issue
i do not believe it creates a negotiated rates issue
please let me know as soon as possible if you have any concerns
it is important that we work something out with phillips today
by the way
i asked christine if she had asked phillips to 0
give up their right of first refusal and 0
agree to our new capacity release language
i.e
tw gets the upside if capacity is released at a higher rate
in exchange for us making this compromise
she feels that it would be inappropriate to ask them because the language below does not quite give phillips what they had requested originally
that is
a negotiated rate
dear citizens
assistance division
i live in the houston heights on the 0 block of cortlandt
for the 0 years i've lived there
the drainage ditch in front of my house
and several other houses on my street
have been blocked
any time it rains
we have standing water for several days afterwards
i know that other streets in the heights have the same problem
i have heard that because of the mild winter we're having
we can expect a bumper crop of mosquitos this summer
standing water therefore poses a health concern for residents of the heights this summer
does the city have any current plans to fix the drainage problem in the heights
last year i called and requested that the ditch in front of my house be cleared
but got no response
i hope that this was merely an oversight rather than an indication that the city of houston has no regard for the health and comfort of its citizens
any information you can provide would be appreciated

if you don't hear from him
and want to call him
his # is 0-0-0
re
tw's exposure if we authorize ecs to lock in too early
if tw defaults under the csa
it must hold ecs harmless with regard to expenses incurred by ecs in the assignment of the electric supply agreement and pay ecs whatever is owed under the agreement
no other specific damages are addressed
and the agreement specifically prohibits the recovery of consequential
incidental or indirect losses or damages
section 0.0 provides for reimbursement for ecs's reasonable costs in providing compression services
but only in the event tw uses its ferc out
the gas conversion agreement provides for termination of the agreement in the event of default by tw under the csa
and obligates tw to reimburse ecs for ecs's costs and expenses incurred in unwinding the forward sale of natural gas volumes to be delivered to ecs under the agreement

i'm working on a checklist
there were just a couple of issues arising from the discussions with market services
weren't there
one having to do with whether we want to change our 0 a to reflect fts-0 and fts-0 in same bucket
i'm leaning towards not changing since the language is already general enough to cover us there
the other issue had to do with issuing the ofo if efbh does not show up in the last cycle
i do not believe any changes are necessary there either
the tariff language as it's currently written says we
shall
issue an ofo
and we would
but an ofo issued in the last cycle would simply be a formality and the efbh shipper would have no choice but to pay the penalty
if you see any roadblocks on these 0 tariff sheets
0a and 0a
or if there are any other issues we need to address
let me know
also
if you want to sit down and go thru my checklist together sometime tomorrow
or even later this afternoon
i'm available
thanks
my several hours of on-line research on this last sept
turned up nothing on point
the only case that even addressed the issue of confidentiality of contracts in a certificate context was one i'll excerpt here
maritimes requested confidentiality for the precedent agreements it submitted
commission staff denied the blanket request
but indicated that maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential
maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut-off dates
fn0
in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such information was commercially sensitive
on the other hand
maritimes requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept confidential
but was willing to make the contract terms of 0 and 0 years public
generally
the commission will deny blanket requests for confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market support for new facilities
fn0
however
in the instance case
the contract terms of the backstop agreements are public and
thus
evidence of longterm subscriptions for maritimes proposal are in the public record and support our finding that maritimes has demonstrated a market for its proposed services
therefore
we find no compelling reason to require the length of the terms of the other precedent agreements or the cut-off dates to be made public
fn0 cut off dates refer to points in time when individual contracts could terminate contingent on the occurrence of certain events
in amoco production company and amoco energy trading company v
natural gas pipeline company of america
0 ferc p 0,0
0
which involved a request for confidentiality of a gas sales agreement
the commission explained why a gas sales agreement should be given confidential treatment but transportation contracts should not
the commission has explicitly held that gas transportation rates stand on a different footing from gas sales rates because pipelines and their competitors are subject to similar disclosure requirements
in anr pipeline co
the commission explained that unlike gas sales in a competitive market
transportation of natural gas is still regulated under the assumption that the pipeline exercises market power
even where transportation competition exists
that competition is from other pipelines that are likely to be subject to similar filing and reporting requirements
there were several cases denying confidential treatment of rates in the context of section 0 cases
just to make sure i found everything
i'll do some follow up sometime in the next few days and let you know if i find anything
here is a draft of the compliance filing regarding our operational control agreement with ecs
please let me know your comments by c.o.b
tomorrow
at this point i'm not planning to file the agreement
just a report as requested by the commission
i'm still working with ecs to finalize the agreement
their attorney is checking with his resident experts to make sure ecs
by expressly giving tw operational control
does not somehow cross the line into retail wheeling
i do not expect the agreement to change significantly
steve and frank
i would be very interested in your comments on the attached
here's what i propose to send to the parties on the 0th
take a look
and think about whether it would be wise to do more selling in the first paragraph
i propose that we get on the agenda for the march 0 meeting so that we have some time to approach individual parties first
with your permission
i will forward this to mr
dasovich also
the reservation charge reduction applicable to tw's failure to deliver gas under certain circumstances does not apply to either force majeure events or periods of unscheduled maintenance less than 0 days in any calendar quarter
unscheduled maintenance is defined as unanticipated or unplanned maintenance on the pipeline system required to be performed to ensure that gas continues to flow in months other than dec
jan
feb
july and aug
assuming we could even classify the proposed activity as
maintenance
i'm not sure we could get away with saying it was unanticipated or unplanned
as the gallup expansion has been in the works for some time
i am also not completely comfortable calling this
force majeure
because part of the tariff definition is that the event was not within the control of either party
however
since the definition does include
binding order of any court or governmental authority
we could possibly say this is force majeure if we're reducing the pressure in order to comply with a dot pipeline safety rule
in that event
our notice on the ebb would be a force majeure notice
if not
we can argue that since this is not
maintenance
but simply being done to construct the expansion in a safe and prudent manner
the shippers
rights are not triggered under the reservation charge reduction provisions
in that case
damages
if any
would have to be pursued under ordinary contract law
i realize that this is not a very satisfactory answer
however
the outage is going to be relatively short
and no shipper in recent memory has availed itself of the reservation charge reduction
i recommend we give shippers reasonable notice of the pressure reduction so that they can make alternate plans
this will reduce the likelihood that they will feel revengeful
please call

or e-mail if you have further questions
parties represented at an informal meeting after the february 0
0 prehearing conference discussed circulating redlined versions of the cac settlement proposal as a point of departure for further settlement conferences
transwestern pipeline company submits the following comments in lieu of a redlined document
transwestern fully supports the cac's proposal of a path-defined receipt point structure that would define primary and secondary rights at receipt points on the socalgas system
not only does the proposal satisfy the commission's requirement that hector road be established as a formal receipt point
it is also consistent with open and non-discriminatory access and use of the socalgas system
and will help provide a reasonable degree of certainty so that all market participants can more effectively plan gas transportation
cac's proposed receipt point principles ensure that no upstream transportation provider will unduly be denied access to socal's system
transwestern believes that the parties may still need to address certain details regarding implementation of the receipt point proposal that have not been fully described in the cac document
to this end
transwestern proposes that implementation of the receipt point proposal be included on the agenda for the upcoming all-party settlement discussions
transwestern looks forward to a constructive discussion of the proposal and is confident that the parties will be able to agree on a plan for implementation

this morning i spoke with reliant's regulatory counsel
who called me after talking with lee hart
and who seemed eager to look into drafting a filing
i would be happy to talk with leonard foster or june suwara at sempra about doing the same
but somehow think sempra might be a tougher customer
don't know why i would think that
my suggestion is that we work through ms
katz initially
anticipating that we might encounter some inertia at sempra's regulatory dept
and to give you an outline to work from when talking to stefanie
i put together the attached rough draft of a motion to intervene and motion to expedite to be filed by sempra
feel free to send the attached to stefanie
however
please do so with the caveat that you are sending it for discussion purposes only
not as legal advice to sempra from et&s's legal department
and the content of this pleading should ultimately be up to sempra's legal/regulatory staff
reliant's counsel said he'd be sending me a draft of his pleading
if i don't hear from him within a reasonable time i'll call to follow up
can we keep the upside
i believe the answer is clearly
no
unless/until we get a favorable ruling on our share-the-upside filing
til then we're bound by the billing provisions on sheet 0h
sometimes the answers clarify themselves after you leave the question sitting out there a while
as for the contract rights of replacement shippers
i would say the tariff language gives us some leeway on whether to automatically give replacement shipper the releasing shipper's discount at alt
points
if we don't
and the replacement shipper uses an alt
point and has to pay max rate
releasing shipper gets a refund under our billing provision
i know lindy has some clear ideas on what we want here
we can discuss more if you like
i've reviewed order 0 on voluntary auctions and agree with you
mary kay
that the tw ios procedure is consistent with the commission's checklist
however
i do have a couple of questions/concerns
first
does
voluntary
mean filing a proposal with ferc is also voluntary
or is the commission here requiring that pipelines make filings before they can proceed with auctions

i'm not sure we comply with the commission's policy on establishment of a reserve price
since it's difficult to tell what that is from the order
a couple of times tw has stated a minimum bid in its ios
comments
i've gotten a bit more educated about it revenue crediting since you asked your question yesterday
it revenue crediting
is an industry term used to describe a requirement
brought about either by a ferc order or a rate case settlement
that it revenues in excess of a certain dollar amount will be credited back to all firm shippers in the next rate proceeding or thru some refund mechanism
transwestern is currently not under any it revenue crediting obligation
and i would be very hesitant to negotiate any such obligation with any individual shipper because then we would have to do the same for all firm shippers on a nondiscriminatory basis
if you need more info
let's talk
in my never-ending quest to expand myself both culturally and socially i am proposing a fun-filled friday night to those of you who i feel would appreciate it most
or at least have any interest what-so-ever
this friday at 0:0 p.m
pavel kogan will be performing with the houston symphony at jones hall
all of the tickets for this show are being sold at a set price
which means that we can obtain center orchestra seats for only $0.0 a piece
my idea for the night is as follows
attend what i'm sure will be an outstanding performance
grab a late bite to eat at one of several excellent restaurants downtown
mia bella and osteria d'aldo come to mind
and polish off the evening by gracing one of the many hot-spots found downtown
jones bar
swank lounge
deans
mercury room
etc
with our presence
bear in mind that my plan is completely open to suggestions from each and every one of you
while i realize such an early show may interfere with some people's plans
workout routines
etc
i am sure things could be rearranged for one evening
please email back and let me know if there is any interest in such an outing
and in the end it's not the years in your life that count
it's the life in your years
abraham lincoln
our contract with igs provides that for any agreement identified by igs and executed
tw will pay a one-time incentive fee of 0% of the first $0 million of net present value
0% of the next $0 million of net present value
etc
the southern contract associated with the gallup expansion is at a rate of $0.0 for 0,0 dth/d for 0 years
using a discount factor of 0%
the net present value of the contract is $0,0,0
so igs's commission would be $0,0.0
since the contract does not specify how npv will be calculated
i believe we purposely omitted this for whatever reason
we will need to agree on a rate that is fair given the nature of and risk associated with the project
we should probably use whatever is standard in the industry for this type of project
if that's possible to determine
i have a call in to james centilli for his recommendation in this regard
and will let you know what he says
i'll review this after my 0:0 meeting

i've been studying the el paso/dynegy reservation reduction mechanism
rrm
basically the deal was that dynegy's minimum-pay obligation would be reduced by the amount of the fixed cost component of it revenues generated by el paso's transportation of it volumes above a historical threshold
the parties based the threshold on el paso's monthly it volumes for the 0 months ended 0/0/0
the volumes in excess of the threshold were calculated and a ratio of the volumes in excess of the threshold to the total volumes was determined
the ratio would then be applied to the fixed cost component of all it revenues and the resulting dollar value applied to dynegy's monthly reservation charge
to the extent dynegy had not met its minimum pay obligation for a particular month
this provision of course met with heavy opposition
however
ferc allowed it
ferc stated that while the rrm had anticompetitive effects because it created a disincentive for el paso to discount it
it was not unduly discriminatory
the
unduly discriminatory
conclusion was based on an analysis on the potential effect on the cal
gas transportation market
the commission found that due to relatively weak market demand
neither dynegy nor el paso appeared to have been able to influence prices because so much firm capacity was available
i assume russ may be after something similar to the rrm
we would have to file it as a negotiated rate but i feel fairly confident that we could get ferc to accept it
that's my 0 cents worth on this particular issue
i'll come down around 0:0 to chat with you more about the duke
i have a conference call with mkm from 0:0 to 0:0
which is why i'm camped out on 0
after reading that did you all of the sudden feel as though your body no longer contained any organs and instead there was just a giant pit where they all used to be
i never in my life imagined the intense impact an email could have
they appear so harmless at first glance with no character or personality to the font or page
but upon closer inspection they have the ability to send you soaring or plummet you to the darkest depths
i really don't know what to say about the email
if i didn't know what happened afterward i would have said it was very promising
but knowing what i know i must resort to my new tag line that guys in general are just confused
i must say though that his quote was outstanding and if ben and i had any semblance of normal communication between the two of us i would send it to him in a heartbeat
but we don't so i'll just have to enjoy it solo
i fear today will be a very boring day so feel free to keep up an email dialogue throughout the day
recently we approved a
based on utilization
rate in another contract
the rationale was that our minimum reservation charge is zero
so on those days they don't use the point
the amount allocated to reservation component
using our discretion to allocate between reservation and commodity
is $0 and it's still within our minimum so it is not a negotiated rate
does that make sense to you
i'm a little uncomfortable with saying
tw defers to the consensus position of the non-socal settlement parties
so often
could we just not say anything on those items
or say tw has no comment at this time
would the other parties be put off if we were silent on these issues
pursuant to your request
attached is a very plain-vanilla motion to intervene out of time and motion to expedite that you can provide to your non-gallup customers if you like
if you do so
please inform them that we are not providing this as legal advice but merely as an example
and whether they choose to file in this proceeding and the content of what they file is up to their own respective legal and regulatory departments
as you know
current firm contracts on transwestern provide for delivery of 0 mmcf/d of gas to topock
in the context of the gallup expansion
transwestern has entered into firm contracts for an additional 0 mmcf/d to topock
once the gallup expansion is built
transwestern will have a total of 0 mmcf/d of firm capacity under contract to the topock delivery point
0 mmcf/d more than pg&e has agreed to accept while pcbs continue to be present
bill cordes has asked what transwestern's potential liability to shippers would be if pg&e's refusal to accept deliveries due to the continued presence of contaminants causes transwestern to have to curtail firm service at pg&e/topock
the legal answer is that transwestern's tariff provides for a reservation charge refund but does not limit the damages that could be sought by a shipper
more specifically
rate schedule fts-0 specifically provides for a reservation charge refund if transwestern fails to deliver gas for a firm shipper
in december
january
february
july and august
the shipper is entitled to a reservation charge refund for all nominated and confirmed quantities not delivered
in all other months
the shipper is entitled to a refund only if deliveries fall below 0% of nominated/confirmed quantities for a period of 0 consecutive days
the tariff does not preclude a shipper from seeking other damages resulting from transwestern's failure to provide service under an fts-0 contract
a shipper whose firm service is curtailed would likely incur damages in addition to the reservation charge
including
for example
the cost of buying spot gas or damages resulting from the shipper's inability to fulfill contractual obligations
such damages could be recovered in a breach of contract action
not all shippers would incur such damages because some might be willing to take delivery of gas at alternate points if capacity is available at such points
bill has asked steve to work with me in quantifying our potential exposure
i could really use your help in putting a dollar amount on potential damages
can we meet briefly to discuss this
i'm available after the gallup meeting tomorrow a.m
or after lunch on friday
or we can discuss a meeting time for next week
thank you
christine
here's a brief answer to your questions
with regard to segmentation
order 0 is completely silent with regard to rates to be charged for segmented capacity
so we would have considerable leeway here
the order is also silent with respect to the effective restriction of segmented capacity by making discounts inapplicable to certain alternate
or primary
points
hopefully tw will be able to avoid the segmentation issue altogether by invoking the global settlement
as we plan to do in our rehearing request and compliance filing
our global settlement argument is that we should be able to rely on tariff provisions
including our current restriction on changing primary points
that were implemented to mitigate the effects of turnback on tw
on hourly service
i believe that we could put an hourly service into place on tw without running afoul of the peak and off-peak rates
i.e
seasonal rates
provisions of the order
in other words
i think the commission would see them as two separate kinds of service
as for how to communicate with our customers
i believe regulatory has offered to have a meeting with tw customers in early april to make a presentation on order 0 and provide a forum for discussion
i realize the order becomes effective march 0
however
compliance filings are not due until may 0
and some requirements do not even become effective until september 0
before the beginning of april
the gpg pipelines will simply not have their positions fully formed enough to make a very well-organized presentation to persons outside the company
the meeting is still in the planning stages and i will fill you in on details as they are available
in the meantime
if your customers have questions
i'll be happy to help answer them

donna fulton is planning on attending the technical conference in the amoco/burlington complaint proceeding on el paso's allocation procedures
she has asked that we let her know

please let me know if you have any comments in this regard
one caveat
the technical conference is for

and since tw is not an intervenor donna is subject to being kicked out of the conf
if el paso does not want tw represented there
ena will probably be sending a representative so at the very least we can probably get some intelligence from them

i'm planning on drafting something this week for everyone's review

hi lindy
sorry i've not yet set up the meeting on imbalances
i feel i am still lacking focus so thought i'd run this by you for your comments before inviting people
first of all
i believe the general topics we wanted to address were

hourly determination of imbalances is this correct
next

me
darrell
richard hanagriff
sheila nacey
or someone else she designates
anyone else
as far as timing
i am very flexible
so let me know what works for you
and i'll get it set up
with regard to the commission's limitations on the right of first refusal
order 0 provides for grandfathering of discounted long-term contracts that are now subject to rofr
the commission's rationale was that grandfathering gives all shippers notice of the new limitation and the opportunity to re-execute current contracts
the tw commercial group has asked whether we should challenge the grandfathering of existing contracts
in limiting the right of first refusal
the commission has expressly acknowledged that if a customer is truly captive and has no alternatives for service
it is likely that its contract will be at the maximum rate
shippers that are not captive and have alternatives in the marketplace do not need the protection of rofr
and the pipeline should be able to negotiate with other interested shippers upon expiration of the contract
in light of these conclusions
there should be no reason to grandfather the rofr rights of shippers under existing discounted contracts
such shippers would not be harmed by removal of the right immediately upon the effective date of a pipeline's tariff filing to limit the right of first refusal
assuming the service contract incorporates tariff terms on an
as amended
basis
consistent with the commission's order
it would not be unfair to make these shippers compete with others for the capacity upon expiration of the contract
lorraine
here's what we would have to show ferc
along with some of my comments
let me know if you have additional ideas
and i'll turn it into a draft to send around to the usual suspects
0
rate impact on tw customers
method by which tw would collect the costs of the acquired capacity
i assume tw would be at risk for any undercollection of revenue associated with the pnm capacity
thus there is no cost-shift potential to other shippers
net costs will be separately recorded
0
would acquisition of pnm capacity enable tw to gain control over access to upstream capacity and supply sources in a manner which would permit tw to limit customer choices or improperly tie use of the acquired capacity to other pipeline services
i think mary kay will be able to help us explain the
no tying
part
0
would tw's marketing affiliates receive preferential treatment
no tw marketing affiliate will be involved in the proposed transaction
acquisition of pnm capacity will not result in any undue preference or advantage to any affiliated entity
0
will tw as a holder of capacity receive preferential treatment over pnm's customers
to the detriment of pnm's customers
no
pnm will be making the capacity available to tw only during periods in which it has unused capacity available on its system
so any impact on pnm shippers should be minimal
service contract under pnm's tariff does not provide for unduly preferential treatment of tw
0
how will capacity be managed or otherwise integrated into tw's existing open access operations
tw will enter into service agreements with pnm from time to time to transport gas on the portion of pnm's line from blanco
nm
i.e
the blanco hub operated by tw
to rio puerco
nm
where pnm's system interconnects with tw's mainline
resulting available capacity will be posted according to tw's tariff
the capacity will be used to serve customers under tw's fts-0
lft and its
right
rate schedules from the blanco receipt point to delivery points on tw's system
lorraine
we need to discuss our arrangement with pnm
would we be able to acquire on an as-needed basis
would it be an ordinary service agreement as provided in their tariff
which would come first
our deal with pnm or with our shipper
it might be good to come up with some examples of likely scenarios
0
would acquisition of pnm capacity prevent unnecessary construction of new facilities
yes
demand currently exceeds available capacity on the san juan lateral
transwestern was unable to construct san juan phase ii because of prohibitively high costs of obtaining an easement on navajo land
using the pnm blanco to rio puerco line is one of the few remaining alternatives available to tw to expand this portion of its system
it would enable tw to transport an additional ______ of gas for shippers from the san juan basin to delivery points on the mainline of tw's system without the need for expanding the san juan lateral
the acquired capacity would benefit customers by effectively providing incremental capacity on a constrained portion of tw's system
at minimal cost to tw and no environmental disturbance
would enable both tw and pnm to use their systems more efficiently
something to keep in mind
since ferc has implied that it considers shipper support in determining whether to allow pipelines to hold capacity on other pipelines
the more shippers we can get to intervene in our filing
the better
here are my comments
spice girl
the commercial group has asked whether they can sell daily firm for longer than a 0-month period
this phrasing is of course misleading
tw's daily firm contracts are always for a term of just one day
but renew for consecutive one-day terms unless terminated
the discount letter
on the other hand
grants a discounted rate for each of the one-day terms for a certain period of time
typically one month
steve harris wants to be able to
sell daily firm for a one-year period
in contractual terms all this would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one-day terms
as usual
and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year
i see no problem with this
do you
apparently the current perception in marketing is that regulatory/legal was limiting daily firm to a 0-month period

how did the doctor's app't go

every working mom i know could not wait to get back to the office after maternity leave
i think the daycare arrangement is generally best for everyone
baby gets a head start on her social life
and the parents can't wait to see the kid at the end of the work day
most everyone i know is raising their kids that way
and they seem to be turning out fine
even the handful of stay-at-home moms i've met leave their kids with someone several days a week
for sanity's sake
had lunch with mema on wednesday at treebeards
i get the impression that she's gotten the message that you and jim don't exactly want her dropping in for spontaneous visits
so that's good
i always enjoy meeting her for lunch--for some reason she's always on best behavior
and we always run into my coworkers and friends who just think she's the greatest
thank god she can never remember their names
or she might start calling them for lunch

thanks dennis
do you have the form of discount letter too
if so
please send it
the term of the fts-0 agreement is for one day
and automatically renews from day to day
the discount letter provides that the discount applies to the one-day term and each consecutive one-day term
if any
the term of the discount letter is typically one month or 0 months
the discount letter does not obligate tw to provide service for more than one day
but as long as the term of the service agreement renews
the same discount would apply
my point is that if we are already contracting for daily firm this way
it should not matter whether the discount is effective for one month or for 0 months
if there is a problem with the current arrangement
we should discuss it
nothing about the way we do these deals has changed since we discussed it last december

if you have any questions
the commercial group asked several weeks ago whether they can enter into discount letters applicable to daily firm for as long as one year
the standard wording of the discount letter applicable to daily firm is such that the discount is effective for as many one-day terms as the fts-0 agreement renews
but not beyond a specified date
typically tw enters into these discount letters for a term of one month
the marketers say that they were once told that they could not make such a discount applicable for longer than a 0-month term
i see no basis for this limitation
the term of the fts-0 agreement is one day
renewable from day to day
the discount is only applicable for so long as the fts-0 agreement renews
if the fts-0 agreement does not renew
the discount is no longer applicable
the basis for the shipper's transportation rights is the fts-0 agreement
we are not guaranteeing a shipper
daily
firm for longer than a one-day term
the discount letter merely states that
for so long as the fts-0 agreement renews
a particular discount applies
up to a certain cutoff date
does this make sense
i realize you are swamped
but i need to get steve an answer so that the marketers know what is acceptable
drew and i have discussed this and he is on board
thanks

unselfish regard for or devotion to the welfare of others we got to talking about you at lunch today
rudy mentioned that in effort to get your goat he often tells you your not being very altruistic towards him by consuming so much of his time requesting reports
my understanding is that your typical response to this is
i am the most altruistic person
i am sure you recognize the hypocrisy laden in this statement
if a true altruist is unselfish then he would not care if his acts are recognized or not
in fact
the true altruist hopes only that his acts benefit those to which they are directed
we may have to downgrade you to
concerned individual
but given your good-hearted and idealistic leanings i thought you would might like to know that the landmark river oaks theatre is going to be showing mr

i simply haven't sent one out in the past two weeks
i will make sure you both receive my next brilliant composition
i must say i was tempted to remove you given your complaints about receiving all of the follow-up commentary and a lack of appearances
do you honestly think tobin can be a substitute for you
supposedly my phone is going to be switched over the weekend so i should be back in the world of reachable individuals next week
i'm glad you appreciated my observation rather than taking offence
i was afraid after two weeks of silence i may have pissed you off somehow
in which case that last email would have probably been the final nail in the coffin
as far as the new job goes it is looking very promising
turns out my trader went to college with my brother-in-law
sister
and brother so we have too many mutual connections for him to be mean or rude to me
even without the connections he seems like a pretty cool guy and is very supportive of my learning all i can about his book
hopefully
after i get the daily routine down he'll let me sit with him during the down times and watch him work
you should definitely try and see the film saturday and even if you can't pull yourself out of bed you should rent it
i really think you would enjoy/be inspired by it
at least i am every time i watch it
i hope things are well with you although i am sensing some disenchantment
if that is the case i can give you a few tips on how to overcome and once again appreciate your current position in life
believe me over the last two months i have had ample opportunity to do just that
just let me know if i can return the favour you once did for me
have fun at y'alls happy hour tonight

it is not our policy to release such information unless we are required to do so by law
regulation or order
oh wait
i can't go to the ball game because i couldn't take a day off from work to stand in the enron lobby
or send my secretary to do it for me
for all of you who have managed to snag tickets for tonight's game congratulations and you suck
for the rest of us stuck out in the cold i suggest the only viable alternative before us is to drown our sorrows in a cold bottle of beer
or two
or three
i realize the mass email has been mia the last two weeks
for some this may have been a welcomed relief
for others there may have been some concern that they had been cut-off from the distribution
at present no one has been removed from the distribution
but it is undergoing an audit
should it be determined that it is necessary to remove an individual from the list for any reason that individual will be notified and given an explanation
if anyone would like to know the causes for expulsion you can write to
i can't believe anyone cares if there on this distribution or not because the only place we seem to go is woody's every thursday between 0:0 and 0:0
on that note
see you guys at woody's tonight around 0:0 or 0:0
aren't we a poor sport
sorry i've been mia this week
new job and all
thought you might get a kick out of this email
it's from that guy that is 0 but looks about 0
and yet he resurfaces again
read the email at the bottom first then his
yes i will be attending the taster's dinner this evening
look forward to seeing you there
you're off
you try and do something nice
keep people informed and involved and it just gets thrown back in your face
that's okay though because
i'm good enough
i'm smart enough and dog-gonnit people like me
you must have too much time on your hands
the situation has been corrected
hey
just wondering how your weekend of golf went
wouldn't want to be accused of cutting off contact again
p.s
i got a very interesting response from plauche following the mass email

nothing scheduled as of yet so let's try and do something

i'll have to check it out
also
do you have ray wylie hubbard's crusades of the restless knights
every cut i hear from it on kpft is so good
sorry so short with the email
even though they may be short i should be able to email throughout the day
hi mum
no
tickets were hard to come by
tried to get some they released a couple of weeks ago
but didn't realize everyone would send their secretaries and interns downstairs to hold places in line
i'm sure the vps will get tired of going to the games
and start giving tickets away
tonight is the big cam gala
bill was in trial all week and had no time to go shopping
or even to get measured for an ordinary tux rental
so he borrowed one from andre
who owns 0
andre is a couple of inches shorter than bill
depending on the overall look
i may or may not acknowledge that bill is my date
my 0's dress i got at wear it again sam looks fabulous
it is a sleeveless gown with an empire waist
the top is maroon velvet and the rest is very heavy pink satin
since it wraps in the back i was able to move the hooks over to get it to fit
dress was $0 but it cost $0 to get it hemmed
ann and i were considering asking mema to do our hair
but i'm really going to be pressed for time this afternoon
too bad the party is not on a saturday
our plans for the rest of this weekend are still up in the air
what are you doing the weekend of the 0th
bill has signed up for the ms0 again that weekend
if you are free that weekend why don't i plan to come either fri
or sat
a.m
let me know
our law conference begins thurs

staci's boss
is having a party at her house on lake mcqueeney on wednesday
so i'm driving frazier and tony in the dentmobile that morning
we really do have a fun group
it should be a good time
if k&j want company i'll drive over to see them on thurs
night instead of going to the awards dinner
which was a big drag last year
i'll call them this weekend and see what jim's travel plans are
today we'll find out about settlement in the california proceeding
this will decide whether i will be tied up in hearings for most of may
keep your fingers crossed
love
the two new pub codes that need to be addded to tagg are
thanks
see the attached
enron corp
has already authorized brian cherry to add enron to the list of parties at the end of the document
i recommend tw do the same
i propose that we ask brian to add tw to the list
with a footnote that we support the transmission proposal only and do not oppose the other parts of the term sheet
i propose this out of an abundance of caution because in one part of the document brian states the parties have agreed on comprehensive settlement
but later in the document he states that the parties aren't fully committed yet
if he will not agree to do this
then i would suggest we leave tw off the list and file a letter with the cpuc along the lines of what i circulated yesterday
with additional language supporting the motion for extension of time
let me know what you think
the pub code has been changed to if-elpo/sj
sorry for the mix-up
brian
transwestern pipeline company asks that it be included on list of parties to the motion for modification of the procedural schedule
with the following footnote
transwestern supports the portions of the settlement proposal pertaining to transmission rights
and the designation of primary and secondary rights described on appendix a
transwestern does not oppose the other parts of the settlement
susan scott transwestern pipeline company
now that two settlement proposals and a motion to extend time have been filed
there is no telling what the cpuc will do
my recommendation is that we play it safe and assume we will need to file testimony on april 0
to that end
it's time to review some basics
in its july 0
0 decision
the commission stated
we see reason to pursue a change in protocol for receiving gas at hector road
even in the short term
if there are burdens that would unfairly fall upon transwestern customers is a window was established at hector road
we want to hear about it in the next phase of the proceeding
in addition
we seek specific proposals as to how such an arrangement should be defined
accordingly
the testimony we file should explain
0
the unfair harm that could potentially befall tw customers if hector road were established as a formal receipt point 0
our proposal for making hector a formal receipt point by establishing primary and secondary receipt points 0
why our proposal is fair and consistent with commission policy
here we might want to draw analogies to the interstate system and explain why that works
i will also have an opportunity to make legal and policy arguments in a brief after testimony has been filed
let's discuss how best to go about drafting the testimony
i think the best thing to do would be to outline the testimony
then decide who is going to say what
i'm available after about 0:0 today
not at all
fawcett's the antsy one
he is anxious to use his new honorary law degree
ahem
i agree it would be risky to indicate our wholehearted support of a settlement when the agreement has yet to be written
it would be like giving socal a signed blank check
that's carte blancheto us lawyers
and we don't trust them that much
once we've signed a real agreement
i do want to file something in support
i'm just trying to plan ahead
is all

in an age when cloying
dumbed-down internet
chat
threatens to reduce discourse to the linguistic equivalent of casual fridays
men's-room vernacular is seeping alarmingly past its pine sol perimeter
infecting what is left of conversational civility
well-articulated sublimation--which has produced some damned fine
and sexy
art
music
and literature over the millennia--is no longer the default mode of expression
that ageless hot boy

could only have been produced through deft restraint

gerri hirshey
are you experiencing some sort of split personality today
should i start referring to you as ben or maximman depending on your responses
i am somewhat frightened that you would allow yourself to be referred to as maximman
while i realize you are a fan of the magazine
professing so too loudly may hinder your efforts with the ladies
some of us do have a shread of dignity
which that periodical in particular attempts to tear away
my advice is keep it in the closet or bathroom or where ever it comes in most
handy
it occurred to me last night after you two had left that we never quantified what constitutes a
good
girl
and
given that oversight i may have been remiss in stating that wilson was not ready for said good girl
just as the opinion of women in texas differed between you yanks and the texas boys at the table
i am inclined to believe that our definitions of a
good
girl may not be in line
p.s
a person in their nineties is referred to as a nonagenarian
we really should have figured that one out last night
wilson
i treasure your ny attitude
i think part of the reason you find so few hotties in houston/texas is that travel and exposure add such an intangible element to a person and very few texas girls have experienced either
i think everyone has a different definition of good
some more lenient some more stringent
at least that has been my experience
the word of the day for april 0 is

something extremely pleasing to taste or smell 0
a dessert made of oranges and shredded coconut example sentence
we feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia
and n the least delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which our hostess regarded us
as wesatisfied our famished appetites on the delicate fare she liberally supplied
charlotte bronte
jane eyre
did you know
ambrosia
literally means
immortality
in greek
it is a derivative of the greek word
ambrotos
meaning
immorta which combines the prefix
a
meaning
not
with
meaning
mortal
in greek and roman mythology
only immortals
gods and goddesses
could eat ambrosia
th mythological gods and goddesses also drank
nectar
whicin its original sense
refers to the
drink of the gods
even today
you'll often find the words
ambrosia
and
nectar
in ea other's company
while the
ambrosia
of the gods prevented death
we mere mortals use
ambrosia
in reference to thi that just taste or smell especially delicious
just wanted to let you know that the richardson deal has been entered into tagg
the deal number is ne0
i think i had too much nectar last night

you can remove my name from the distribution list as i have rotated to a new group and am no longer working in the controls group
thank you
please don't think less of me as a person
but this really made me laugh
the word of the day for april 0 is
the use of archaisms
as in a historical novel
example sentence
get rid of the gadzookery
bruce's editor cautioned
mirabella can perfectly well say
please
instead of did you know
gadzooks
you astonish me
cries mr
lenville incharles dickens
nicholas nickleby
we won't accuse dickens of gadzookery
the bane of historical fiction
as historicnovelist john vernon called it in newsday magazine
because we assume people actually said
gadzooks
back in the 0s
that mild oath is an old-fashioned euphemism
so it is thought
for
god's hooks
a reference
supposedly
to the nails of the crucifixion
but it's a fine line today's historical novelist must toe
avoiding expressions like
zounds
and
pshaw
and
tush
tushery
is a synonym of the newer
gadzookery
whichfirst cropped up in the 0s
as well as
gadzooks
while atthe same time rejecting modern expressions such as
okay
and
nice
for the record
i have read judge biren's ruling
and contrary to what people might have said in the conference call on friday
it is silent on the topics of the testimony schedule and the presentation of arguments
the three-sentence e-mail from biren simply requests that the parties attend the phc at which time she will rule on the motion
and states that she might issue a further ruling prior to the phc
i think it is probably fair to expect she may solicit brief comments from representatives of the parties at the phc
i hated to e-mail all of you but i honestly do not know how to handle the attached which was forwarded to me
and thought one of you might
any clues
please advise
thanks

thanks for still including me in the distribution
it makes me feel important
however
as i have moved out of the controls group it probably isn't necessary to include me any longer
first and foremost you are a father
then a husband and then a poet
the quote speaks to so many in such personal ways
obviously you identified with it's message
although
i'm not sure about the dalai lama comment as he does believe in a power higher than himself
as for myself
i am still measuring my powers
they seem to lie in such varied arenas that i never know what i will discover day-to-day
as far as tasting the fruits of my passion
you know what they say
the first bite is the sweetest
and i must say i look forward with great anticipation to sitting down at the table when the time is right
my place in the world is a combination of one of the guys and the ever idealistic
eternal optimist
i.e
i see what is and yet still hold out hope for more
* i don't believe the sentiment in return to me was pure fiction
given all of this i am very happy
given that tonight's weather conditions may not permit dining alfresco
i was wondering if we should come up with an alternative plan
i think the first order of business is whether or not we want to go some place we can eat or if everyone just wants to meet up post dinner
depending on everyone's preferences i have several suggestions
let me know your thoughts
regarding tonight
is there actually a fun sushi place
and do they have ichiban beer
with the exception of sunil no one answered the original question
do we want to go somewhere we can eat
given that the three of you sit within inches of each other
i'm going to let y'all discuss the matter and get back to me
anything's ok with me so just let me know what you come up with
if you get stumped i'd be happy to offer some suggestions
barring weather issues
it would appear as though we are on for little woodrow's tonight
i don't believe a definite time has been set as of yet
but seeing as how they ran out of steaks last week i suggest we get there as early as possible
should we be rained out an alternative location will be chosen
via a quick phone call to little woodrow's i was informed that the
steak dude
as nstepha has coined him
cooks come rain
sleet
snow or shine
thus
our evening out is on
see everyone there around 0:0 p.m
if you can't make it till later that's ok we'll save you a seat
besides
most of you would probably put good money down on my being there until closing
cheers
wilson
my most heartfelt apologies
i failed to include you on the last email
huge oversite on my part
sorry
i forgot to include you in the last email
hope to see you tonight
interesting
i seem to remember that under texas law
everything goes to the surviving spouse
any community property issues between greg and ex should have been settled in the divorce proceedings
but it's been a while since i looked
i will ask bill for a second opinion
in any event
a will is a good idea
especially when kids are involved
if
god forbid
the worst should happen
you can bet that ex + kids would make life even more difficult for you in what would already be a tough time
bill doesn't do wills but he could probably recommend someone who would do a will for cheap
just wanted to share this thought with all of you
the paradox of our time.doc it is because of nights like last night with company such as yours that i remain optimistic in the face of statements such as the one attached
the paradox of our time.doc
not quite as enlightening as the last email
but much funnier
that was amazing
fyi
this morning
lorraine and i checked with pnm and surprisingly they do not offer any kind of it transportation service
just firm service
so our final revisions to the cover letter do not include acquiring interruptible service from pnm
since it's impossible to do so

hi there
how's the little buglet doing
it was good to see you last week
and i feel honored that i got to accompany grayson on her first restaurant mission
hopefully the french-fry smell did not throw her off her feeding schedule to badly
got a message from mema wanting to discuss the baby's bottle habits
pu-lease
if it's ok with everyone i will try to bring bill at easter as a distraction
this weekend i am supposed to drive to austin to pick up bill and his friends
aka team slacker
at the end of the ms 0
i'll be driving someone's suv
if manners and general treatment of the trainer/driver
by bill and the owner of the suv
do not improve
however
team slacker will be taking the bus home
do you remember rob carty from high school
i just saw him at a seminar given by akin gump for in-house lawyers
he works for exxon/mobil now
i barely recognized him because he has gotten so hefty
thought you would enjoy the following brief excerpt from today's wall street journal
big boy's adventures in thailand with his checkered overalls
cowlick curl and penchant for double-burgers
big boy seemed an unlikely fit for bangkok
people thought he was a little
well
creepy
says peter smythe
the head franchiser for big boy restaurants in thailand
dusting off his giant big boy statue on bangkok's main thoroughfare
they kept asking me
is he a chinese ronald mcdonald
eventually
a few thai visitors decided big boy was a religious icon and laid bowls of rice and incense at his feet

no response to me but he called burton to lambast him for ratting him out

i'm a man trapped in a woman's body
not really
this is jeff fawcett in susan's office
we're on a conference call with socalgas right now talking about the settlement document
would you guys pull-up the attached file
primary rights 0-0.doc
and look it over
with particular reference to the section titled
scheduling priority
i think we're ok here
but i don't want to agree to anything that we can't administer on our side of the meter or that just doesn't make sense
we're down to the final telecon on this subject
and all changes need to be sent over to socalgas asap
will you take a quick look and send susan a note saying thumbs up or down
thanks a bunch
rob
this is jeff
i'm with susan in her office listening to the call
hey bud
landmine
look at the new socalgas language respecting the edison/sdg&e contract in section 0.0
whadaythink
write back at this address
are you going to raise the issue
mark
susan and i are online in her office if you need to shoot us a quick note
otherwise
blah
blah
blah
rob
look at the conforming languange in the appendix
a
last page
last paragraph
you know that this language was negotiated by and between socalgas and edison
my main concern is that its very
very open ended
almost a contingent liability for all settlement parties
jeff
pull out your settlement matrix and see if this sa agrees with that document
i don't necessarily think it does
didn't we basically agree to disagree and/or deal with this issue outside the settlement process
are you saying that edison can reserve capacity in the same manner as core and 0% of noncore
but at the approx
0.0 cent rate
hey
wait a minute
is this language saying that they can convert the value of their capacity rights to a capacity contract at the point
for example
if edison has 0/d at 0 cent wheeler access fee
they could conver it to approx
0/d at the full 0.0 cent rate
let's get clarification
attached is a draft of the declaration of jeffery fawcett
if you have comments
please let me know
susan scott transwestern pipeline company
you still there
quite good
they definitely provide a chuckle
this was one of the emails i told you about
i'm available tuesday also
just let me know
i'm there
vanessa
i checked with bill
and the very unsatisfying answer to your question is that it totally depends on how greg divided the community property with his ex
he agreed with me that a will is a good idea in any case because you can arrange things so that you avoid legal proceedings and save a lot in taxes
our friend tony maluski does probate work
i believe his number is 0-0-0
he's a nice guy and i believe him to be competent
however
i think it is a good idea to shop around when you're doing something routine like a will or an uncontested divorce
so i'd advise calling several lawyers and see who you like best and who will give you the best deal
if i can find some other names/numbers for you
i will
hope this helps
glen
i'm faxing you transwestern's signature page and declaration
an electronic version of the declaration is attached
glen
i think this will be fine
please add the word
company
after
transwestern pipeline
on the list of parties
thanks
we sincerely appreciate your efforts on this settlement
susan scott
see the attached
the proceeding certainly isn't over
but i think the parties have done a great job of submitting a settlement that the commission will eventually approve
provided the parties present sufficient evidence to support such a decision
unfortunately
we expect the settlement to be protested
direct testimony is due may 0
to streamline things
the parties are going to consolidate efforts and have divided up the testimony by topic
of course transwestern got the hector road issue
i plan to put mr
fawcett on as a witness
our issue is not particularly controversial anymore
so i do not anticipate rigorous cross-examination
nevertheless
i will probably ask your assistance in preparing the witness for the hearing
which begins may 0
sorry for the delayed response
i got really busy friday afternoon and didn't check my email before i left
as you know
we recently did an east-to-east deal with usgt for 0,0 mmbtu/day with alternate rights to california at a higher rate
socal filed a protest and i'm working on the response
in part
they are alleging that tw is
attempting to exploit a weakness
in the gisb procedures to the detriment of existing customers
for example
under tw's tariff
which they concede is gisb compliant
primary firm cannot bump alt
firm in cycle 0
socal says this means that any primary shipper attempting to deliever to an in-path alt
point will be unable to re-nominate to its primary point once this
alternate
capacity
i assume they mean usgt's
is confirmed
according to socal this will substantially limit shippers
flexibility
including the ability to use market area pooling
once gas is nominated thru a pool its subsequent movement to a delivery point is defined as an al
delivery regardless of the rights of the capacity under which it moves
thus by manipulating the gisb cycle process
tw and usgt will bump firm shippers
i could really use your help in responding to this argument
first of all
i'm not sure i even understand it
if either of you have a few minutes today or tomorrow when we could get together
that would be great
also
you two were the first to come to mind
but feel free to refer me to someone else in your group if you are swamped
please e-mail or call when you get a chance
thanks

here's the answer to your question regarding 0
the depth and complexity are overwhelming
don't you mean no more
to dream anything that you want to dream
that is the beauty of the human mind
to do anything you want to do
that is the strength of the human will

that is the courage to succeed
embrace hard things and your mind will blossom
this is america enron
we can do anything here

finish each day and be done with it

some blunders and absurdities have crept in
forget them as soon as you can
tomorrow is a new day
you shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense
ralph waldo emerson
to laugh often and much
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends
to appreciate beauty
to find the best in others
to leave the world a little better
whether by a healthy child
a garden patch or a redeemed social condition
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived
this is the meaning of success

bon appetit
i was remiss in excluding y'all from the original distribution
please except my apologies
i obviously didn't get up this morning to work-out
so i was wondering if you wanted to go for a run before felicity tonight
i should be home by 0:0 or 0:0
let me know
you know me
any excuse to celebrate
name a time and place
amazingly my calendar appears to be open tomorrow night
hey there
enjoyed hearing about your shopping adventures
just a quick note to say that bill will be coming with me this weekend
so mema will have more than enough entertainment
tell jim to bring his tennis gear and if the weather cooperates we can play
he would probably enjoy hitting with bill
saw bruce springsteen last night
even though i'm really not much of a fan
ann really wanted to go
and i knew it would be a good show
which it was
he played for 0 hours and needless to say i'm pretty worthless this a.m
look forward to seeing you soon
here it is
please let me know your comments today
thanks
for april 0-0
travel plans shape up and morph into much more
every step you take seems to branch out into a sea of possibilities
especially lately
the old rules don't apply anymore
the idea of signing up for something and hanging in there until retirement doesn't suit an innovator like you
your developing success will beget an avalanche of more success
have your bags packed in preparation for spur of the moment opportunities and travel necessities
your wanderlust is starting to surface in a big way
you want to know more and experience life on a richer level
you're not the same person you were even a year ago
you understand more about yourself
be open to travel
moving
advanced training
and additional contact with media and publishing
the word is out
aquarius
and hard-to-pass-up offers are already in the
for april 0
your mind is so active
inventive
and unlimited this month that you're capable of almost anything
you've privately believed that the rules don't necessarily apply to you
this month
your incredible adaptability and powers of persuasion help you shed the status quo and break out of the corral
unless you catch your foot in a bear trap
nothing can stop you
people are fascinated by your mind
wit
ideas
and conversation
don't forget
oprah winfrey is an aquarius
your views are welcomed and provoke others to investigate things they may have taken for granted
speak up during the first week
especially if it's to announce you're starting a new venture
business travel is likely during the first and third weeks
especially if contractual issues need to be finalized
travel is actually enjoyable this month and can open your eyes to fresh horizons

alabama just off of kirby

what is it about the two of you that you think i can't handle
and believe me i am making efforts to enlist worthy participants
frank and steve
see the attached
my theory
which is based on our experience with the gallup compressor
is that we could enter into a joint ownership and operating agreement with agave
and as long as we convince the commission that the agreements give tw sufficient control over the operation of the facility to ensure ferc regs are complied with
they will be ok with the joint ownership
and not try to assert jurisdiction over agave
a gathering company
although it seems likely that other pipelines have entered into such arrangements
i've not found any cases on point here
do you agree with my conclusion
any other ideas or insights
please let me know
thanks
last month lindy and i began looking into adding a provision to tw's tariff allowing shippers to elect to purchase fuel gas from tw
there is good precedent for this and i think it would be fairly easy to accomplish as long as we don't try to make the purchase of fuel from tw mandatory
see the attached memo
mary kay
as you and i discussed
we will need to address the fuel overrecovery issue before moving forward with this
ginger
i would very much like to participate in the meeting this thursday
however
given that it is bid-week
i cannot absolutely guarantee my attendance
if it is at all possible for me to include myself with the caveat that i may have to pull-out last minute i would really appreciate the opportunity
please let me know if this is all right and i will do everything i can to attend
you asked whether current contract approval procedures require the marketers to get legal's approval on all transportation contracts
the answer is no
if you look at the et&s policy on authority to grant transportation and storage discounts
i can fax it to you if you don
t have it
there is a column for
pre-approved terms
and one for
non pre-approved terms
contracts that are not on a pre-approved form always have to have the legal dept's approval
contracts on pre-approved forms with a total discount
for the entire contract term
of less than $0.0 million do not need legal's approval
those above the threshold do
does that make sense
as far as i know our marketers have been following this
i spoke with tk and she is aware of the policy
and she is also aware that she needs to show me any contract that deviates from our standard language
she has also discussed this with steve harris recently to make sure he's comfortable with the policy
if we need to discuss this further please let me know
drew
i wanted you to be aware of a potential dispute with regard to our consultant
mark baldwin of igs
our consulting agreement with igs
which has now terminated
provided for a flat fee
plus an incentive fee calculated using the net present value of any contract
identified by igs
and entered into during the term of the consulting agreement
during the term of the agreement
tw entered into its gallup expansion agreement with southern
igs is now claiming it brought in the deal and so is entitled to an incentive fee
while it is undisputed that mark discussed the deal with southern
southern was also on lorraine's list of shippers to contact for gallup expansion capacity
also
the capacity was posted for all to see
so
while mark can certainly claim he
identified
the deal
he was not alone in doing so
steve is going to call mark in response to his letter
after he talks to lorraine to verify facts
our thinking is that if we offer igs some money they will be happy
we would really like to preserve what has been a good working relationship with this consultant
on the other hand
i think we could probably take the position that they are not entitled to any incentive fee
however
since the contract is silent as to whether igs has to be the only party bringing in the deal in order to qualify for the incentive fee
this position is not as strong as i'd like it to be
and igs might sue tw
the amount in dispute could be as much as $0,0
depending on what rate we use in calculating net present value
if you have any problem with our offering to pay part of the incentive fee to igs
let me know
i think it will be very important for steve not to admit that mark helped in any way in getting the deal
just in case they do decide to take us to court
just wanted to ease your mind and let you know that i have not discussed your impending move with anyone save those you have already informed
i am well aware of the sensitivity of the subject
believe it or not
sometimes i am able to keep my mouth shut
how was ny
the post-id should be 0
i am still inputting the unofficial post-id on a daily basis in that file that was created for you all
o:\erms\erms_adm\gasdaily\gdailydrop
let me know if there's anything else i can do
no i'm not close b/c i can't take off 0hrs from work to go run in the park
however
i am getting up every morning at 0 to go run so that ought to count for extra
besides when did this become a contest i wouldn't think you'd consider me a worthy adversary
at least not yet
i do know the model you're speaking of
but isn't she married to some billionaire in venezuela
is it really so you can look at girls or so people can look at you
i think your right about everyone being able to beat anyone with one important caveat
the individuals in question must be in the same strata
i would not anticipate that an olympic medal winning long-distance runner could be beat by joe shmoe who runs every day at memorial park
of course if one is patient and bides their time they could probably stand a shot when the guy gets really old and slow
also
are you so bold as to suggest you've never lost
or do you not identify them as losses but rather the results of your own choosing
you're the greatest
i think little woodrow's is on for tonight although i'm still waiting to see if my brother and his wife want to go out tonight
he leaves for south korea sunday
if they're a no go i will be on the deck with a bucket of beer
p.s
you are in peak physical condition
so are you going tonight or not
it looks like people are going to start arriving around 0:0 so i'd say just show up after your done running and getting all pretty
i'm sure we'll all be there till at least 0:0
ben was actually already planning on going
in fact he informed me he would be bringing a friend from canada
fyi
i didn't know there was a
friend
in canada until very recently
although i had my suspicions
and further more had never heard a name until today
regardless
any friend of y'alls is a friend of mine
also
nick is going to bring amy
his significant other
should be an interesting evening
again mark i am flattered that you include me in these explanations
but i don't really need them anymore
i just finished having lunch with tobin and he filled me in a bit about this morning's meeting
i don't know how you reacted
if you were upset
etc
but i wanted to offer this up if you were struggling with the situation
whatever happens and whatever is said about your move don't ever lose sight of the fact that in every aspect of this situation you conducted yourself in the best and most open manner possible
in no way can or should your conduct be called into question
bearing that in mind any criticism that was expressed within the meeting this morning was beyond inappropriate
i am sure it reflected much more poorly on the accuser than it did any of those being criticized
furthermore
just keep focused on what an incredible opportunity this move is going to be for you and all of the doors it will inevitably open
there isn't a doubt in my mind that you are bound for great things
you just have to seize the opportunities that will lead to that when they come along
which is exactly what you've done
keep your chin up and whatever you do don't doubt yourself or your actions
o.k
just wanted to see if we're still on for saturday night
let me know if anyone else wants to come because i think i'm just going to order the tickets today over the phone or on the internet
also
i was trying to remember how much i covered of your meal the other night at sabroso's
i think it was around $0
so if it's okay with you i'll just pay for your ticket and then take the difference from the amount you sent in that email and cut you a check for that amount
i know i'm very delinquent
i promise i'm good for the money
also
was wondering if you're still interested in the bruce cockburn concert on the 0th
just let me know
hope your having a wonderful day
jeff
didn't realize everyone else was going to use narrative format
now that i've had a chance to think about it
i think ours will look silly if it's in q&a format
i'll work on changing it this evening
keith
last week you and i discussed briefly facilities planning's proposal to change the service factor on the gallup compressor in order to increase capacity
i believe you had concluded that a certificate application would be necessary
now arnold eisenstein is asking me
thru our commercial people
whether we would still have to make a filing if our certificated capacity could be increased without any physical modification to the compressor
in other words
through a pressure commitment
my initial impression is yes
we would have to make a filing
am i out of my mind
does this make sense
please advise
steve's new idea is to send a letter to mark asking him to document/explain exactly what his role was in getting this deal
comments
not sure i care one way or the other
but after i see how it looks in writing
i'll have a better idea of whether this is how we should approach it
multi-tasking heavily today
i'll send you a draft of our pnm answer to dynegy protest by close of business
yes
i will send you a draft shortly
please see the attached and let me know your comments by wednesday a.m
if possible
we do not really have anything that specific
but i could at least point out that the san juan lateral is fully subscribed
sure
why the heck not
enron capital
trade resources corp
in honour of your departure i think it is only right that we do
red meat
one more time
i feel as though i've said this a lot lately but
congratulations
i don't want to devalue the statement by repeating it over and over again so just know that i am completely sincere when i say it
the money sounds fantastic
although i hope that aside from the money you enjoy and are challenged by your new role
i may not know you inside and out but i do know that you need to be in an exciting and fast-paced environment to hold your interest and sustain motivation and this sounds like it will provide that for you
also
the step up position-wise is great and i think deserved
as far as being scared goes
that'll be our little secret
you do know though that fear is a great motivator and often provides us with that extra push to do and try the things we may not have otherwise done
i guess this means i'll have a good excuse to visit ny
i may have to start training now for that
here is the quick
dirty
none of the gallup contracts contain a shipper out if the facilities are not placed in service by a certain date
the respective obligations of the parties do not commence until the facilities are
tested and placed in service
we notified our shippers by telephone yesterday that the facilities were in service
the compressor has since been taken down because of excessive vibration and an unusual whining noise of undetermined origin
ee&cc does not know how long it will take to correct the problems
they do not have enough information yet to even give an estimate
based on our experience with hubbard
it could take months to correct the problem
today
we've been able to deliver all nominated gas simply because noms did not exceed our existing capacity
nominations are expected to exceed existing capacity this week
in which case we will have to allocate
given the uncertainty involved
from a pr standpoint i believe it would be best to tell the customers that because of unforeseen circumstances we are not in service after all
that we apologize for the mistake and will do our best to provide service on a daily or interruptible basis
when the compressor is actually tested and really in service
we'll let them know
the downside
we get no reservation charge at all
estimated loss
the upside
in the long run we probably save face with our customers
from a short-term economic standpoint
the better choice appears to be not to revoke our
in-service
announcement
when summer weather kicks in
we'll probably have to allocate every day
on our ebb we will have to give some reason for the allocation
or if we don't
shippers will demand an explanation anyway
shippers
rights to a reservation refund will be triggered
the downside
shippers will never trust us again
also
we could be subject to fraud or related causes of action for representing the compressor was
in service
when we knew it was not
the upside
on the off chance no one files a lawsuit and wins
we might at least get to keep some of the reservation charges owed us
to the extent deliveries don't fall below 0% of nominated quantities for a period of longer than 0 days in months other than july and august this summer
in july and august
we don't get any reservation charge for amounts not delivered
we just need to keep in mind that normally the pipeline runs full in the summer months
and gallup capacity was sold with that assumption in mind
haven't had time to do a formal write-up
if you want me to turn this into a memo for wider distribution
let me know
for now
i think it's important to get a decision on one of the above options
the longer we wait to get information to our shippers
the bigger our customer relations problem will be
sounds like a great idea
let us know where/when
who all would you like on your guest list for tomorrow
regular crew
i've called and checked before and evidently the steak cook comes rain
sleet
snow or hail
so unless everyone's opposed to eating inside
if it's raining
we can go no matter what
i apologise for the delay in my response to your email
thank you for contacting me regarding the rotational opportunity in your group
while it sounds intriguing
i will not be able to pursue it as i have already begun my second rotation with ena
however
i would appreciate the opportunity to learn more about your group and any possible future rotations
please let me know if you would be able to meet at some later date
thank you again
fyi
fyi
lorraine
here's keith's brief response to your question about increasing capacity without changing the service factor or making other mods to the gallup compressor
let me know where we need to go from here
susan
my understanding is that the capacity west to the california border is a certificated amount
0 mmcf/d
if in any way we try to change the certificated amount of capacity
firm capacity
we will need to file
tw is different than nng
in that tw certificates capacity rather than facilities
arnold's idea of using a pressure commitment would still require a filing
please let me know
if we need to discuss further
keith
it is tonight and it looks as though we will have great weather
i'm planning on getting there asap as i've had a rough week already and need some beer in a bucket
what time are you thinking about getting over there
i will most likely have a good headstart by the time you get there
by the way
when are you leaving for ny/moving all of your stuff
and
when's your last day at the big
e
i have purchased 0 tickets to saturday night's show
maybe we can all go out to dinner before-hand or i wouldn't mind having everyone over to my place for a little wine and food
also
i don't think i can make this week's tasters dinner because my old group is having a belated going away happy hour in honour of me
partay
are you still going to run
i'm sure we can find you a ride over there
what time do you think you're going to be finished-up here
while i don't truly fear you becoming a bitter individual as a result of these negative experiences
i do feel the highlighted section below is now more appropriate than ever
one must keep their eyes open and use all of the wisdom they possess when they trust
just as i suggested that positive experiences can cause one's level of trust to grow exponentially
negative experiences can cause irreparable harm
if you trust blindly or too willingly and that trust is violated it colours every aspect of your life
there are too many people in this world that have become bitter and cynical
not because they were born that way but
because they handed out trust haphazardly and too many times that trust was thrown back in their face
i don't mean to suggest from the above that one should live in a day-to-day mind-set of distrust but rather that they must really look at people and all the aspects which they posses
i have come to the conclusion that if you spend most of your time observing and listening to people rather than always taking the lead you will learn a great deal more about them and their character
the smallest acts and statements can in fact say the most
so always be observant
this includes listening to what others have to say and paying attention to the opinions of people whom you respect
to that end i have one last comment
i am constantly amazed and periodically reminded what fragile creatures we humans are
that beyond the hype and self-grandizing the basic components of ourselves
our experiences
fears
cares
concerns
needs etc
cannot be completely disregarded and will always be a part of us
i think that only by recognizing those components and trying to understand their origin can we truly become stronger
i too enjoyed our talk last night
i'm always interested in other viewpoints
it is only by examining them that we challenge our own
the happy hour tonight is at teala's on west dallas
my recommendation is that you plan on arriving at 0:0 or later
hopefully by that time my old manager will have had enough to drink he won't mind all these other people on his tab
i must admit
the job just keeps sounding better and better
p.s
thanks for the compliment
that's a quality i like being associated with
i'm finally having my going away happy hour with my old group tonight so i'm out
sorry
hope you guys have fun
don't forget woody's is a cheese-fest
turns out my boss is going to get to teala's at @ 0:0
so if you want to show up earlier
say 0:0/0:0
i'm sure that would be cool
i know ben
nick and possibly sunil are planning on going so you may want to see when they are planning on getting there
tell lisa that eol sucks
i've had to rebook 0 screwed up deals
hope to be there by 0:0
where were you last night
bummer
too bad all of us are captive to eric's schedule
bill and i enjoyed our too-short trip to the gc
we hiked down bright angel trail to the second rest stop
which was plenty for me
it was pretty hot
wish we could have stuck around longer but bill had to be back for a trial
talk about restrictive travel schedules
i was thinking about you and karin and wanting to take your customary nature trips
you know
when grayson is a little older
we could go on some trips and just take turns staying at the hotel/cabin with her while everyone else goes hiking/climbing/whatever
you might have to pay for extra hotel days that way
but at least you would get to go
in the meantime
what about staying in one place for a week or so
a beach house
for example
eric permitting
i think it would be fun to get everyone together in florida or colorado sometime within the next year
my car is ready at the shop
yay
ciao
fyi

we only need to send a copy to the judge electronically
this is why we've only seen a few from the other parties
i'm starting to receive some in the mail and will get you copies
i'll do so promptly
i'll e-mail one to brian cherry as well
and to anyone else who specifically requests it
if you would prefer that i send to everyone electronically
let me know
copies were mailed to everyone friday
hi mum
the trip was pretty exhausting
friday we saw hoover dam
had lunch at a great diner in kingman
on route 0
and rolled into sedona around 0
climbed around the red rocks of sedona all day on saturday
sat by the pool in the afternoon and i did some shopping
sunday we drove to grand canyon and did part of the bright angel trail
that was pretty strenuous but definitely worth it
wish we could have made it a longer trip but we had bill's trial schedule to deal with
i'll spare you the details of my trip home
suffice it to say i didn't make it back to houston until about noon yesterday and have a $0 travel voucher for my trouble
i will definitely come to austin next weekend but probably will not get in until later on saturday
how about a homemade
by chef sooz
brunch on sunday a.m
have to run to a meeting
for race info
i would try a search for texaco or texaco gran
d
prix on the internet
i know that texaco probably has it on their website
if you don't find anything let me know
love

here is the electronic version of jeff fawcett's testimony

thank you
sorry i didn't return your call last night
lisa and i went to hear julie andrews speak at jones hall and didn't get home until after 0:0 p.m
knowing what a precious commodity sleep is i refrained from possibly disturbing your own
hi there
i was not able to launch the photo but was able to see it in
view
mode on my lotus notes
what a pretty girl
i assume you'll be in austin for mother's day
let me know
i was thinking of cooking brunch if the whole gang is going to be there
but if it is just me and mum maybe we'll just go out
i have no idea what to buy her
must do some shopping today or tomorrow
trivia time
last night i went to the astros game with some people from work
one guy brought his girlfriend
thani-ta
who is from thailand
she likes to eat at nit noi when she is in town
she told me she has a dog called nit noi
which means
little bit
now you know
have a good day
hope to see you in austin

rich and dave
attached are my suggested revisions to mike mcleod's draft of an amendment to the original electric service agreement
dave
i'll bring you a copy of that agreement
rich
if mike did not send you one
let me know and i will fax it to you
in my revisions
i've attempted to reflect the least cost billing you described to me
using terminology i read in the tariff
please let me know if it looks alright to you
i'm available to discuss this whenever you are
then i will make sending this to mike top priority
my sincerest apologies for the delay
there has been more chaos around here than i am accustomed to handling
and i appreciate your patience
susan
p.s
dave
on your wish list you had included an evergreen provision
see section 0 of the original contract
which gives tw the right to extend for another five-year term by giving notice to sps
if tw does not give such notice
sps may cancel the contract
and if it doesn't
the contract automatically rolls over for another year
if this is not acceptable please let me know
what if we replace section 0 with something like
this agreement shall continue in effect unless and until terminated pursuant to section 0
and replace section 0 with
either party may terminate this agreement upon written notice to the other party not less than twelve
0
months prior to the intended date of termination
sound ok
if so i'll add it to my draft
rich
dave and i were just discussing whether a period less than 0 months would be appropriate
see language below
given that dereg
may bring some changes we want to take advantage of
it's basically your call
if sps were to terminate our contract
how much time would we need to negotiate a replacement
hi brian
how nice to hear from you
congrats on being an uncle
scott is a good-looking baby
yes
i'm pretty psyched about little grayson
she is a sweetie
karin and jim are anxious to give me a refresher course on babysitting skills
i told them that when my niece is old enough to understand the command
go find your shoes and i'll help you put them on
i'll be happy to take her off their hands for a weekend
i too am in no rush to have kids
while my boyfriend is a great guy and loves children
somehow i just can't imagine him hanging around the house helping with diapers
i am so glad you're enjoying tampa
picking up and moving can be a great thing sometimes
i will never regret leaving austin for houston
there is just so much here i enjoy doing and my social life is a whole lot better
the job is absolutely crazy
if you ever watch
er
that is usually what my day looks like
only without all the blood
here at enron gas pipeline group i work as the only lawyer for a very busy commercial team
we sit in an open work area and it is chaotic every day
but it's a good crash course in business for me
and my clients are wonderful
do take some study breaks and keep in touch
e-mail is a wonderful thing
time to hit the tennis courts
love
susan
today we remember jane austen
the british writer born on this date in 0austen depreciated herself as a
miniaturist
and a domestic novelist of restricted scope
but her literary legacy is large
she was also able to laself-deprecation aside
however
and in northanger abbey she declared thatnovels
her chosen genre
are works in which
the greatest powers of thmind are displayed
in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature
the happiest delineation of its varieties
the liveliest effusions of wit andhumour are conveyed to the world in the best chosen language
austen's work brims with general statements that are contradicted by the people in her stories
for instance
pride and prejudice opens by noting that
it is a truth universally acknowledged
that a single man in possession of a good fortune
must be in want of a wife
the book then describes mrs
bennett
mother of a household full of marriageable daughters as
a woman omean understanding
little information
and uncertain temper
as austen acquaints us with the tale of each daughter's engagements
she wonders
for what do we live
but to make sport for ourneighbors and laugh at them in our turn

if you don't know for sure what the answer is

if you cannot answer a

no
question with

say so and explain why
i could let the fluff comment fly if you were referring to a woman that hadwritten such works in present day
but given that austen was dealing with acompletely different world with decidedly different expectations for the women in it i cannot
the fact that she was able to challenge those limitexpectations and never allow her heroines to sell themselves short or compromise their character should not be taken for granted
yes
there is a definite romantic bent to her works
but in addition their is amazing insiginto people
their motives
their struggles and their capacity to surpriseeven themselves
and in the end
what conquers in her novels is the union of two individuals who have the utmost respect and appreciation for each otherminds and characters not the unequal and servile relationships that constituted the norm for that time
hi mark

transwestern has drafted the attached rebuttal testimony in response to testimony filed by kern river and the post-interim settlement parties
please let me know if you have comments
i have been working with ramona and lorraine to make system adjustments to tw's lft arising from conclusions made at a northern lft meeting a few weeks ago
one change that has been called for is that if a limited day is called
for now let's say a total limited day
without notifying shippers of any percentages
no lft can flow at any time during that day but the lft shipper would have the option to flow it to the extent space is available
if a limited day were called notifying shippers that only a certain percentage would flow
lft shippers would be able to flow that percentage
and the rest could be scheduled it
drew latched onto this when i mentioned it to him and wanted to debate this change with me
as currently configured
tw's system would allow lft shippers to put in nominations on a limited day
and if any lft capacity were in fact available that lft would be scheduled
similarly
if tw were to notify shippers of a partial limited day
say 0%
and 0% of the capacity in fact became available
tw's system
today
would allow lft shippers to put their nominations in and flow 0%
not limit them to 0%
tw's tariff language appears suitably vague to allow this
a limited day is defined as a day on which tw may choose not to schedule service in whole or in part
and the billing section has a provision for limited days on which any quantity of gas is transported
our question was whether
by changing tw's lft system as described in the first paragraph
we wouldn't be leaving some firm transportation revenue on the table
because the it rate is generally lower than our firm rate
if so
is the change necessary for some other reason
please let me know what you think

i had a fun time this weekend
it was good to have everyone together
glad k&j are relaxing about mema and the baby
she gets such a kick out of seeing her
thanks for the new clothes
i still can't believe we let you shop for us on mother's day weekend
got a message that lois came by and got the dishes
earlier when i was in a meeting she left a voice mail saying she wasn't sure what exit to use off of 0

had another sleepless night sun
and finally took some unisom and had a good night's sleep last night
what a relief
i have really never had this problem before

thank goodness for refundable airline tickets

might you be available for dinner next tuesday or wednesday
these guys like to talk business well into the evening hours
but my interest starts to wane near suppertime and i could probably make excuses and leave
bill and i took a whirlwind trip to arizona a couple of weekends ago
he was in bullhead city
of all places
where his uncle has a vacation home
i joined him a few days later in vegas
luckily he had been to laughlin 0 nights in a row and had gotten blackjack out of his system
we set out for sedona but first had to stop at hoover dam
then a diner in kingman
on route 0 of course
stayed a couple of nights in sedona
where we climbed lots of rocks
which we later found out were protected nature preserve areas
oops
and got real dusty and sunburned
then we drove up to the grand canyon and hung out at the south rim
actually
we climbed down bright angel trail
back up
then drove straight to the las vegas airport
from which we took the redeye so bill could make it to his trial the next day
i would really love to spend more time in the grand canyon
maybe not this fall

on friday the commission issued an order suspending

tw's tariff sheets for acquiring pnm capacity
and calling for a technical conference
the commission stated that while tw's proposal may be in the public interest
further investigation of the issues
including those raised by dynegy in its protest
is necessary prior to authorization
the order does not make clear what issues are to be investigated
but they seem to include
whether tw will
in effect
become a marketer for pnm's services
whether the rates are just and reasonable and whether there is any expansion of monopoly power
additionally
the commission noted that while pnm has certificate
i.e
public convenience
necessity
authority to transport gas in interstate commerce
pnm will
have to either explain how it has appropriate rate authority for transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce
or seek appropriate rate authority from the commission
lorraine has forwarded a copy of the order to pnm so that they can begin taking the appropriate steps
i will talk with regulatory about technical conference dates and will tell you when i have further information
if you would like a copy of the order
let me know

streamlined credit
what does
interested parties
mean
parties interested in bidding
or parties interested in us having a look at their credit
probably need to make this clear
on first reading
looks like obtaining credit approval ahead of time is optional
don't we want everyone to get approval ahead of bidding
page 0
you state that
individual bid transactions are kept confidential
what is confidential
the identity of the shipper
the bid itself
in tw's ios
we post the individual bids as they come in
but do not post the name of the shipper
we feel that the posting of the dollar amount bids helps us get a higher rate as shippers bid against each other
and likewise recommend online bids be posted in real time
i notice you call them
sealed bids
on page 0
not true if we're going to show them
page 0
why not request a little more emphatically that shippers establish creditworthiness at least several days in advance of bidding
especially since we plan to attract brand-new shippers by offering this service
our credit dept
folks would probably appreciate not having to do it all between 0 and 0 on bid day
if we're asking that shippers submit bids to 0 decimal places
our example should be to 0 decimal places
e.g
$0.0
page 0
an
capacity trading agreement should be
a
capacity trading agreement
page 0
so we don't appear low-tech
let's go ahead and tell shippers we plan to have the request for service and the service agreement available for online submittal at some point in the near future
also
we've never asked shippers to submit a request for service with each bid
a shipper may bid and re-bid several times over the bidding process
they really only need to submit the request for service at the time of
or prior to
the first bid
i recommend stating
you must submit a request for service prior to making your initial bid
so they don't think they have to submit a new one every time they revise their bid
page 0
under
when tw will respond
need to specify how notification will be sent

when the commission granted texas eastern authority to hold capacity on another pipeline in texas eastern transmission corporation
0 ferc p 0,0
0
it stated that when a pipeline holds capacity on an upstream pipeline
the downstream pipeline's customers may hold title to the gas transported on the upstream pipeline
the commission recognized this as one of the limited exceptions to the shipper must have title rule
specifically
the commission stated
the downstream pipeline will not hold title to gas shipped on capacity it has acquired on an upstream pipeline
rather
shippers on the downstream pipeline will hold title to the gas on the upstream pipeline
we will allow a pipeline to hold the upstream capacity
we will not
however
allow the pipeline to hold title to the gas being shipped
thus
the downstream pipeline will be the shipper on the upstream pipeline
but will not hold title when the gas is being shipped
this results in a limited exception to the rule that a shipper must hold title to gas being shipped
i believe that if we can address the commission's other concerns about this filing
they will grant a similar waiver for this transaction
you can feel free to pass this along to your contact at pnm

hi to k
and g
in response to your inquiries about whether tw's tariff allows the format posting
bidding and awarding of capacity in our enrononline proposal
here is my 0 cents
worth
the criteria for awarding capacity is found in the right of first refusal section of tw's tariff
for some reason that's never been clear to me
see section 0.a
sheet no
0
all available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures
and transporter will not maintain a firm transportation queue
the rofr section does specify the posting and bidding procedures
including a minimum one month period between posting and the bid deadline
see section 0.d
but arguably these timelines only apply to the rofr bidding process
not to an open season for other capacity
even if the one-month minimum bid period did apply outside the rofr process
the enrononline proposal complies by giving shippers at least a month to submit bids
tony
am i right about this
the only other relevant part of our tariff is the ebb/internet section of the general terms and conditions
beginning on sheet no
0
tw will continue to comply with all provisions in this section
the section even specifically provides that shippers may request service and contract electronically
i've found nothing in else in tw's tariff that would appear to address an online open season one way or the other
i believe our tariff gives us the flexibility to sell capacity online as we've proposed to do
hope this helps
if you want to discuss this i'll be here most of the day
and i will be reachable by e-mail while i'm in san francisco next week
my hearing does not start
til noon houston time on tuesday
so if we need to talk tuesday morning you can reach me at my hotel

is there any other way i can get one

this looks fine to me
please circulate to the appropriate people for approval with a notation that appendix or exhibit whatever provides that the quantity goes to zero during apr-oct
if you need to reach me
i'll be logged in from about 0 to 0 a.m
your time before i go to our hearing here in sf
sorry for the late response
it's been a little crazy out here
approved
since the market affiliate rule looks at business units rather than the function within the business unit
or any firewalls that are set up
since he works for ect i have to say i would be uncomfortable putting him on the distribution list
i know that he has access to the same info
but to give him access to our work product is probably a violation of the rule
i am out of town
but if you have any questions please e-mail or leave me a voice mail
and i will reply after my hearing today
since the contract quantity goes to zero in nov.-mar
they pay no reservation charge in those months
so effectively the rate is zero for those months
i suppose we could draft it either way and logistically it would work
we used a similar structure in a deal we did earlier this year
if i recall correctly
also
i agree that we would need to file this as a material deviation if swg agrees to include the capacity release provision
in case ferc does not like the provision for some reason
do we want to provide that disapproval by ferc will invalidate the whole contract
see language in the recent usgt contract
or do we want it to invalidate just that provision and let the rest of the deal stand
it would depend on how much value the parties are attaching to that provision and whether we would want a chance to renegotiate
and i am assuming we would
christine
let me know which is preferable and i'll send you some language in the a.m

the judge asked you and norm pedersen to work with various other parties to develop an exhibit reflecting capacity at the california border
the judge mentioned she wanted to discuss the exhibit this morning

i would like to review the exhibit as soon as possible

the process the parties agreed upon yesterday is acceptable to tw
sorry to hear there was an emergency at home
i hope all is well by now
luckily
we will have input re
the exhibit
and if socal does not cooperate to make it accurate
we will be able to file our own with an explanation
lad is such a weasel
why don't we try to talk sometime this a.m

i thought there would be a case that stated that if an interstate pipeline posts the criteria under which it will evaluate capacity bids
it must stick to those criteria and not award the capacity to a bidder on some other basis
it seems a simple enough extension of the principle that capacity must be awarded on a nondiscriminatory basis
however
i did not find any case that stands for that exact proposition
as you may be aware
the commission made natural gas pipeline company of america
ngpl
come up with a way to ensure that it awarded capacity one a nondiscriminatory basis
because ngpl was found to have been giving preferential treatment to its shippers
ngpl's solution was to come up with an auction process
and there is a whole line of cases if you're interested
the underlying presumption is that if you set up a system under which all capacity is awarded and stick with that system
there is no way you could be acting discriminatorily
but of course the commission never comes out and says this even though it should be obvious
probably the best we can do is extrapolate from 0
the tariff and 0
the nga
doesn't it also say we have to provide service on a not unduly discrim
basis
also
in your memo i'd give an example
i.e
if we notify shippers of our auction process and set a deadline for bidding
but then award the capacity to sempra
assuming sempra requested capacity after the posting
we will have unduly discriminated against all the other shippers who had to participate in the auction process
maybe in future postings on enrononline we should include a statement to the effect that the capacity posted will not be awarded except thru the enrononline process
now for some trivia
remember we were discussing with shelley whether we could post a different method
other than that prescribed in the tariff
for determining best bid
in my westlaw search i ran across the relevant case
in northwest pipeline
0 ferc p 0,0
the commission stated
the commission has previously given pipelines the leeway
in open season provisions
to either include in their tariff a single non-discriminatory bid evaluation methodology
or provide themselves the flexibility of choosing different non-discriminatory bid evaulation methods for different transactions
provided that the pipeline posts the bid evaluation methodology before the bidding process begins
the only problem is i am not sure we have that
flexibility
since the tariff does not expressly allow us to post a different method
maybe next time we do a tariff cleanup we could add some language allowing us to do so
i have to move on to my next project but if you want me to comment on what you write i'd be happy to
if i remember correctly
we'll need to paper the additional sempra capacity
either with an amendment or a separate agreement
i'll be in the office by about 0:0 and we can talk about it then
phil richardson and sarah tomalty of dynegy say that they would probably
i.e
subject to management approval
withdraw their protest if we would amend our proposed tariff language to limit the quantity of capacity we can acquire from pnm to 0,0/day
their chief concern is to prevent tw from becoming simply a broker for another pipeline's capacity
which has never been our intention
lorraine is discussing this with steve to see whether this is something we could live with
the commission has expressed the same concern in the past
so this might make them more comfortable with our proposal too
comments

i know that you've already indicated that you will circulate a draft of the late-filed exhibit by friday

transwestern has reviewed your draft exhibit responsive to judge biren's inquiry on june 0
we appreciate your work on it and generally agree with the exhibit and the approach taken by socalgas
however
we think it appropriate to balance simplicity with the need to be responsive to judge biren's questions
see the attached marked-up version of the exhibit
we've attempted to streamline the data provided for
non-wheeler
points
and to clarify the footnotes regarding wheeler ridge
also
we've modified the numbers regarding the tw topock lateral to accurately reflect the lateral's 0 mmcf/d physical capability
we've also made some minor formatting changes
let us know what you think
jeff fawcett susan scott transwestern pipeline company
tony
i'd love to see our posting on enrononline
do you know if there's an easy way for us
insiders
to access it
you got mail from norm
in response to your inquiry
transwestern would first like to clear up the terminology being used here
as you know
currently socalgas doesn't assign
primary rights
to deliveries off of any interconnecting pipeline
the establishment of tradeable rights for intrastate capacity is among the issues currently under consideration in the gir proceeding
however
if what you are asking about is what has been the historical or otherwise available receipt capacity for transwestern deliveries at north needles
then let me offer the following
transwestern has always operated on the premise that socalgas could physically accept up to a maximum of 0 mmcf/d at its north needles receipt point
consequently
transwestern has sold firm transportation to its interstate customers for west flow deliveries to north needles not to exceed the 0 mmcf/d limitation
our west flow mainline capacity is 0.0 bcf/d
mike
thanks for the input
we stewed over this for a while but decided to respond
as briefly as possible
rather than give norm a chance to whine to the judge that we were being uncooperative in this somewhat unusual exhibit drafting process
jeff's answer is consistent with what will appear in the exhibit
and from what one can find out about tw in numerous of our ferc filings
for that matter
if norm tries somehow to make jeff's response part of the record you can bet i will object
if it's not on the record already
or on the face of this one late-filed exhibit
it should not be allowed into the record
apparently norm has also called rich hall with annoying questions
i don't plan to respond if he contacts us with any follow-up
but will let you know if he does
wrong
mike
obviously this is unacceptable
norm's exhibit contains factual inaccuracies we cannot live with
i'm assuming the rest of the group will react similarly and norm will be stuck filing his own exhibit
your thoughts
brian
just so you know transwestern's reaction
pedersen's exhibit contains factual inaccuracies we cannot live with
e.g
footnote 0
if he wants to file his own exhibit he is certainly free to do so
we don't plan to offer any comments to norm regarding his exhibit at this time
with regard to the exhibit you sent us yesterday
while transwestern feels there are many different ways to characterize delivery capacity to the border
and we probably would have drafted the document differently
we would support socal's filing of the exhibit with the commission as it is currently drafted for purposes of this proceeding
any questions or comments
let me know

thanks
susan scott transwestern pipeline company
amazing that tw has not one but two people doing this job
your tree-saving efforts are admirable
attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on transwestern
the attachments include a filing letter
proposed tariff language and a proposed form agreement
obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out
i am distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue about the larger issues first
a few that come to mind are whether we want to commit to selling options online
how best to explain or justify the option fee
and what specifically in the industry has changed such that ferc should depart from existing policy and allow tw to essentially reserve future capacity for shippers
please let me know your thoughts on these and any other issues
i would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording
other conforming changes to the tariff
and other comments concerning form until after we have resolved the substantive issues
thanks
with regard to capacity release i think we will have to give the replacement shipper the cash-for-fuel option
because what if we have sold capacity that was created by the releasing shipper's buying fuel from us
if the replacement shipper suddenly starts shipping fuel
that capacity goes away
it's sort of like the efbh/resulting forward haul problem
probably we should require that the cash for fuel election automatically transfer to the replacement shipper
this would probably have to go into our tariff someplace when we make our ferc filing
otherwise it might run contrary to our current tariff provisions and practice
another solution might be to just sell resulting capacity as lft
daily fts-0 or even fts-0 capacity
with some modifications to the fts-0 rate schedule
of course
which would allow us the flexibility not to schedule on certain days
for longer-term deals this might not be practicable
though
further questions
let me know
ramona
total cost commitment
in tw's tariff generally means total revenue to be received from a transaction
taking into account reservation rate
the term of the commitment
and the commodity revenues associated with any minimum throughput commitment the shipper may make
obviously some of these items aren't applicable in the pnr context
the language must have just been lifted from another part of the tariff
for pnr we would just multiply rate times number of days the service will be used
practically speaking
i'm not sure how this is done if you have an interruptible service with no throughput commitment
but i think you should just be able to use the number of days in the contract term
if there's a tie
i.e
more than one shipper willing to pay at or above max rate
we just allocate the capacity pro-rata
we do not have to offer a right to match
this may appear to be somewhat of a random email
but i assure you there exist some semblence of reason
i remembered you mentioning that neither you nor pat have ever made a pilgramige to blanco's
so
i thought i should let you know that there is live music and cold beer on tap tonigt at the big b

lorraine already has a producer/customer very interested in supporting our filing
start the process of getting board approval
sales of options require board approval at enron
meet informally with ferc to discuss
shelley is working on
make the filing at ferc
we did not try to specify a date yet
if you have any further comments please let me know
i am going to try to get a new draft out by next friday a.m
just back in from my front yard
a military jet of some sort is circling my neighborhood and making a tremendous racket
several of my neighbors were also out
so i was not the only one staring at the sky
i don't know whether we'll see fireworks later or if we've already missed them
jose and gigi's party was attended by more kids than ever
there were a lot of west u parents i did not recognize
but there were some lawyers from the latin american section that i know
so we had at least a few people to talk to
we did not stay long
just had some of the good goode
company bbq
helped gigi with the pinatas
and got home around 0
the traffic on i-0 was really starting to pile up so i am glad we left when we did
enjoyed the weekend and i'm looking forward to your visit
love
hi yourself
glad to hear you all had a good time in thailand
although i get the impression you could have done without some of the sights
mom thinks it must be fate that this guy and i keep bumping into each other
along those lines
i had an absolutely incredible weekend
i drove to harlingen saturday morning/afternoon
0 hr
drive
for a friend's wedding and then drove to austin to meet up with emily on sunday
we ate at guerro's and then hit cedar door for a little while
there wasn't anything going on there so i suggested we try cedar street
funny thing is ted
that's his name
walks by our table at the bar
he stopped to say hello and ended up sitting down with us the rest of the evening
his friends joined us as soon as they had been shot down by the girls they had been trying to woo
we ended up going to polly esters for a little while to do some dancing
before we parted ways he asked if we had any plans for monday night and got my cell phone number
needless to say i was feeling pretty good
he called us monday and we made plans to meet up after dinner
we ate at sullivan's
it was very good
his birthday is july 0
how great is that
so i brought him one of those travel size bottles of crown from the honor bar as a birthday gift
big hit
anyway
spent the whole night talking and getting to know each other and all i can say is he seems like a really good guy
one of the best signs was his reproach of denim shorts on guys
especially cut-offs
be sure and tell chuck about that one because i know it's something he feels pretty strongly about as well
so at this point i'll pretty much just run through the stats
weight
about 0 lbs
education
ucla
undergraduate and mba
and law school
i'm not sure where
birthday
0/0/0
yes
he was born in a different decade than me
think it may be more of an issue for him than me
hometown
santa barbara
ca etc
youngest of three children
appears to like/be close to his family
irish catholic
we actually discussed religion
his dad was in the navy favorite movies
fletch
caddy shack
he definitely has a good sense of humor and likes to laugh he really likes texas
would like to have a ranch/lakehouse somewhere in the hill country best quotes
every california guys idea of a dream girl is a girl in jeans a t-shirt and cowboy boots
every texas girls idea of a dream guy is a guy who lives on a ranch
has an good education
is comfortable financially and is also a great businessman
only problem is there are only four of those guys out there and three of them are married
texas girls have the ability to wrap a man around their finger quicker than any group of women i've ever met
i really want to learn how to two step
so
as i'm sure you can tell there are definitely some attractive characteristics to this guy
to boot he was a complete gentleman in every capacity
there are no plans as of yet
but i will be sure to keep you informed of any progress
write back soon and let me know how the apartment
the job hunt and everything else is going
susan
ted
getting back to work has been a bit of a challenge after a weekend of indulgence and excess
it took everything i had to get in the car and start the drive back to houston tuesday night
especially since i stopped by my sister's and tooled around on lake austin in the boat for a while before heading out
as for the birthday shot
you are quite welcome
it was the least i could do
after my expenditures over the holiday
i will definitely be in town this weekend
so
dinner saturday sounds good
as it stands right now
i am having a very pleasant day and i hope you are as well
susan
since i am swamped i've asked steve stojic to take a first crack at it
lorraine
i have no problem with larry's proposed change or his reasons for the change
however
i would ask that we eliminate the word
volumetric
as that has other connotations in the ferc tariff world
i.e
if we were truly to have
volumetric
rates
like northern
we'd have to file a whole new rate schedule
i just don't want to use this word
i don't think it's necessary in order to convey larry's meaning
why don't we insert
on a daily basis only to the volumes for which such other alternate points are utilized
if larry wants to talk about it i'm happy to
if he comes up with any more issues i am sending him to law school as punishment
thanks
donna
good work
steve
apparently i'm developing an overactive imagination when it comes to ferc decisions
in panhandle eastern pipe line company
0 ferc
0,0
reh'g denied
0 approved lft services
the commission accepted the pipelines
statements that they would not sell capacity that is not available
i.e
will not double-sell
rather than limit the service in some way or reject the filings
in iroquois gas transmission system
l.p
0 ferc
0,0
0
the commission approved of the pipeline's selling of capacity that becomes operationally available for various reasons from time to time
but i have not been able to locate the general statement along the lines of
pipelines can use their own discretion to determine whether capacity is available
that i thought existed
ted
i spoke with shanna a little while ago about your friend and the apartment and she said she was fine with the deal
talk to you later
susan
i haven't reviewed this yet but will have a chance to this afternoon
here's the draft i referred to in my e-mail
let me know if you have comments or questions
at pnm's request we are not going to say anything about long-term having a higher priority than short-term
because their tariff simply does not reflect this
unfortunately it would have made our argument stronger if we could have said it
but
anyway
i like what steve has done here
if there is no objection i'm going to have him make the change described above and file it tomorrow
dear judge biren

hey yourself
actually
my day is going very well
it just so happens that my trader is out of town all week so
except for a few stressful phone calls this morning to assess the market
the day has been relatively uneventful
all i want to know is how do i get your hours
or should i say lack thereof
anyway
my roommate and i had already made plans for tonight
but a movie tomorrow night sounds good
just fill me in on the details

just because your trader is out of town on vacation doesn't mean he can't get a hold of you and make life less than pleasant

i tried to send this page a little while ago and i think it failed
so
you may have to actually drop this address into the netscape location section to bring up the site
anyway
there seemed to be a pretty good selection on the web
still
i think the one on this page best captures the kind of image you're looking to project
if you'd rather shop around try these
there are some outstanding designs
disclaimer
please realize these sites were sent in jest
if you actually don any of the items contained within them i may be forced to sever all ties and deny ever having known you
drew
i've looked at this and it is fine
really does not deviate from what we have posted before
one issue that arose friday was whether our all-or-nothing approach
i.e
shipper must take all 0,0 dth of capacity or none at all
or all 0,0 or none at all
constitutes tying
the 0,0 package includes 0,0 to north needles and 0,0 to topock
so if a shipper wants the needles space it has to take the topock space too
this looked like a clear case of tying to me until i remembered that this capacity is now
and has been
posted and available and any shipper can bid on any part of the needles space right now if they wanted to and we'd sell it to them without making them take the topock space
that'll be true during the ios too
i.e
nothing can stop shippers from bidding on the needles space outside of the ios process
this is just a situation in which we're putting a special package together with the expectation that the price will reflect the fact that the less desirable topock space is part of that package
does this make sense to you
if not
give me a call
there is nothing wrong with simple and understated when it comes to a non-native texan acquiring western wear
remember slow and steady wins the race
one needs items they could wear at any given time
red wings a simple classic hat
not just to the vail rodeo
i'm intrigued
what exactly is the hawaiian biker ensemble
i spoke with steve stojic about this and he had the same concern
even though i was trying to keep this out of the new rate schedule requirements by not making it a rate schedule
i believe i still managed to cover many checklist items
one that is not covered is testimony similar to what might be filed in a rate case
in order to justify market based rates
we are planning to include a revenue estimate
i'll go over these and make sure everything is addressed before filing
are you ok with this filing from a general conceptual standpoint
the marketers want to start giving a draft to customers for them to review beginning today
fifth grade assignment the teacher gave her fifth grade class an assignment
get their parents to tell them a story with a moral at the end of it
the next day the kids came back and one by one began to tell their stories
kathy said
my father's a farmer and we have a lot of egg-laying hens
one time we were taking our eggs to market in a basket on the front seat of the pickup when we hit a bump in the road and all the eggs went flying and broke and made a mess
and what's the moral of the story
asked the teacher
don't put all your eggs in one basket
very good
said the teacher
now
lucy
our family are farmers too
but we raise chickens for the meat market
we had a dozen eggs one time
but when they hatched we only got ten live chicks
and the moral to this story is
don't count your chickens until they're hatched
that was a fine story lucy
johnny do you have a story to share
yes
ma'am
my daddy told me this story about my uncle bob
uncle bob was a pilot in vietnam and his plane got hit
he had to bail out over enemy territory and all he had was a bottle of whiskey
a machine gun and a machete
he drank the whiskey on the way down so it wouldn't break and then he landed right in the middle of 0 enemy troops
he killed seventy of them with the machine gun until he ran out of bullets
then he killed twenty more with the machete till the blade broke and then he killed the last ten with his bare hands
good heavens
said the horrified teacher
what kind of moral did your daddy tell you from that horrible story
don't fuck with uncle bob when he's been drinking
hey math-wiz
i completely understand your plight
i too am suffering a two o'clock
post-lunch slump
the coffee is simply not working at this point
anyway
i think a change of clothes prior to steak night is probably a good idea
also
driving tomorrow is not a problem
just let me know the gate code
apt

etc
along those same lines
what time did you want to head over there
for better-safe-than-sorry reasons
due to my job
i think no earlier than 0:0 p.m
is our best bet
hope you're having a lovely day and don't work too hard
ha

sounds good to me
coincidentally
a made service will be coming to clean my car this evening susan
ted
my day is going quite well
actually
i managed to sleep in past 0:0 a.m
this morning and did not work-out so i'm feeling pretty good
i'm not sure if i'll be able to respect you in the light of your
rule-breaking
but i'm going to try to look past that
i'm heading to lunch right now
yes
i am actually leaving the building
so the day just keeps getting better and better
as for last night
i had a really good time too and am glad you were able to look past my bad manners and agree to go out friday
talk to you soon
susan
by the way
i'm very relieved to hear about the buckle

this project

i put together the following questionsthat need to be resolved
some of them have needed to be resolved for quitsome time
tony
let's talk since i think some of these have already beendiscussed and maybe resolved in the context of developing tw's enrononlinesite
and i just need to get up to speed
to the extent there aren't answers yet
i'll get busy researching
drew
comments
shall we all get on thephone
discuss this
list of tw contracting issues 0
reevaluate the following in the context of current ferc negotiated ratepolicy
a
transwestern's current form discount letter states
t
he total charshall include all applicable surcharges
should this language be revisedand if so
how
b
transwestern usually charges one-part rates
and includes language inits discount letter stating that transwestern shall allocate the combinedrate between the reservation and commodity components inclusive of surcharges
are one-part rates really negotiated rates
material deviatiofrom the tariff
c
transwestern's discount letter includes a statement that in no eventshall the contract rate be greater than the maximum or lower than the minimum rates provided in transwestern,s tariff
this was intended as assurance that the contract is not a negotiated rate
is this language still effective
necessary
a
when should ios be conducted
if at all
b
once notice of ios or enrononline bidding has been posted
can the subject capacity still be sold off-line
i.e
pursuant to traditional bidding procedures
c
is our system for ios and enrononline set up to handle max rate biddinsituations in a nondiscriminatory manner and in compliance with the bid evaluation procedures in the tariff
if not
what changes need to be made
tony
the idea we had discussed at our meeting with drew was somehow acquiring capacity on el paso in order to access the south needles interconnect with socal
currently socal lets el paso deliver to s
needles but does not extend the same privilege to tw
i'm unsure how it would work
tw does have a couple of interconnects with el paso's system
i would simply say in the memo that one solution to the constraint at topock might be to get some shippers to switch to south needles
and deliver gas to south needles after twisting socal's arm and letting us in
or somehow acquiring capacity on el paso
or otherwise using their system
to access south needles
obviously we will need to flesh this out from an economic
regulatory and legal standpoint
i will discuss it with jeff when he returns
my apologies for the delay
call if you have any questions or comments to discuss
no probola
it will be good to have an excuse to go to nm
maybe i will go this weekend
so glad you had rain over the weekend
we did too
and we had had a dry spell for almost as long
i hope it was not too late to save my back yard
which was starting to smell like cooked grass
bill and i are on the outs
he just will not do what he needs to in order to make things work
so i have given up
of course now he is trying to be charming
anyway
i will have to tell you the whole story some other time
the kiddies are going back to school already so now would be a good time to plan a trip to d.c
at last
maybe early sept
also i'd be game for a girls
trip to destin
time to work

hey bo
i was checking on some flights for myself and happened to look at one-way tickets from new orleans
it looks like the refundable
no-advance purchase ticket is going to run you about $0 on southwest
lucky for you they do offer a senior citizen fare for $0
age does have its advantages
sissy by the way
i didn't even realise john cleese and denise richards were in the movie
and evidently at some point bond hijacks a submarine
roger ebert actually thought so much of the film he gave it 0 and 0/0 stars
we may have to watch this one at some point
the world is not enough
is a splendid comic thriller
exciting and graceful
endlessly inventive
because it is also the 0th james bond movie
it comes with so much history that one reviews it like wine
comparing it to earlier famous vintages
i guess that's part of the fun
this is a good one
ken
here are the confidentiality agreements that should be signed prior to our providing information to our vendors
each agreement should be printed as duplicate originals on tw letterhead
and signed by an officer of tw
i understand that mike nelson is out due to a death in the family
steve harris is out this week also
perhaps julia white would be willing to sign in order to expedite things
if you have any questions or need further assistance with any aspect of these agreements please do not hesitate to call
x0
or come by
a good wit is a terrible thing to waste
as for the pick up
the sissy crawford taxi is at your service
just name the time and place
also
there is no need to forego the nice fun restaurant for tomorrow night just because i have to be a smart-ass every once in a while

well
larry just won't let go of these contract issues
will he
i believe the answer is that swgas will always be billed based on the one-part rate
regardless of how we choose to allocate the rate components
my understanding is that the reason we reserve the right to allocate the components is simply for internal accounting purposes
to keep any one component from exceeding the max or going below the min
hope this helps
let me know if you have further questions
here is the revised bullet sheet along with the draft agreement
approved
hey handsome
i am taking every step to ensure that i leave this building at a reasonable hour today
unfortunately
it is
bid-week
nat gas trading thing which translates to beaucoup deals/trading
so the odds are somewhat stacked against me
anyway
i'm going to say that as it stands right now 0:0 p.m
is definitely do-able
however
i do reserve the right to alter my estimate when we get closer to 0:0 p.m
and i have a better idea where i stand
don't let them work you too hard down there
remember
your body's not used to it
susan
thanks keith
feel free to coordinate with jeff to put together a meeting to get the info you need
i do not know the answer to your questions offhand
and ron is out this week
this should be so much easier
foti is not cooperating so i am having to spend time hunting down his co
# and rc #
which hopefully estalee will be able to provide
i reiterate my position that lawyers are not the ones who should have to do this
rest assured i'll follow through on this one and lia hernandez
but i also feel we need to approach dave schafer and ask why this is something hr is not capable of taking care of
needs to be an officer or someone with power of attorney
ordinarily
you do not have power of attorney unless there is board of director approval authorizing you to sign contracts on behalf of the company
the point is to make sure someone signs it who is authorized to bind the company to the obligations of the agreement
otherwise they could argue later that the agreement is not valid
i'll drive you to the airport tonight
if i get to come over for a swim sunday
believe me
my motives are purely selfish
your pool is so much
cooler
than mine
by the way
even with our slight car problem i had a great time last night
you're really going to have to stop being so much fun to be around or you'll never be able to successfully ditch me
although last night was a valiant effort
look at you trying to bring me out of my shell
i don't know if i'm really ready though to meet so many new people
remember
i am a shy
retiring
okay
okay
the real susan is back
so
do you think i should sport the leopard pants to the party
by the way
your personal taxi service is on call sunday so just let me know when you need to be picked up
you're flying out of intercontinental
right
i've managed to
handle
myself for almost 0 years just fine
thank you very much
evidently someone thinks they're pretty irresistible
hi mum
sorry i have not called you back
i have been out late every nite and trying just to keep myself in constant motion
am on the trading floor this week and can't really talk b/c too many ears
but i'll give you a call this afternoon
our little bar examinee is alive and well
they've changed the schedule so the exam was over yesterday instead of fri
she joined me and my work crowd last night at la griglia and we ordered champagne
so i've already celebrated appropriately
what do you think of my destin idea
talk to you soon love
matt
here are redlined and clean versions
let me know whether the revisions are acceptable
thanks
susan
evidently
in order for us to actually watch a movie we have to physically go to the theatre
somehow we keep missing that critical step in the home viewing experience
namely the viewing
as you requested
okay
i'm dying to know
what was wrong with the car
along those same lines
did you get them to bring the car to you here or do you have to go get it
don't forget i need to get your parking pass to you
as for the home vs
theater viewing
i seem to be more of a home-body these days as well
here is the agreement with the changes you requested
here is the latest draft of the filing for transport options
significant changes include
added definition of counterparty
added captions and reorganized the filing to more clearly reflect compliance with 0.0
included an explanation of how the option fee will be part of a negotiated rate
added an example of how options will work i think we need to decide whether we are better off with the type of option fee explanation i have in this draft
or whether we should instead state the fee will be market based
and include an explanation that
pursuant to the commission's discussion in order 0
market based rates are appropriate because we are going to commit to an open season process that will be nondiscriminatory and that will ensure we aren't withholding capacity from the market
can we have a conference call to discuss your comments this week
i will have janet call to determine your availability
hey
i know you are monumentally busy this week
but if you get five minutes today shoot me back an email and let me know if you know any of the associates below
they are all going to be at the dinner tonight so any info that would boost my b.s
factor would be much appreciated
i seem to remember you mentioning john massey on a couple of occasions but i have
albeit very rarely
been known to be wrong
hope your day is going well and that you aren't having to carry darren too much
evan betzer jay epstein bill keeney john massey kevin ruscitti jennifer adams gautam gupta claudio ribeiro doug sewell
i finally watched the movie last night
i laughed
i cried
it became a part of me
honestly though
it was a very funny flick
so did john or fritz pass along the
bible
to you
whoever it was you can thank them for me
matt
are you going to have snake hill sign as well
i can e-mail the agreement to him if you prefer
thanks
susan
you have just received the
aggie virus
since aggies arn't very smart and don't have any programming experience
this virus works on the honor system
please delete all the files on your hard drive
and manually forward this virus to everyone on your mailing list
thanks for the info
you are a wealth of knowledge
as for the jokes
i am very afraid and yet undaunted
do me one last favor and tell darren i said he's a real funny guy and that there will
at some point
be appropriate pay-back
you know i was just teasing
right
and
no dating is definitely not a bad thing
as for being or not being fortunate enough
just remember
your good enough
your smart enough and dog-gonnit people like you
have fun tomorrow night and try up that fortune
i do not see any problems with this
christine
see the attached
i've changed paragraph 0 to be like our last posting
and added in a sentence saying ties will be decided by lottery
but omitted reference to the lottery provisions of our tariff this time
my only other comment is that i think the group needs to discuss beforehand how a shipper's request for alternate points is going to be treated
as currently drafted
this notice prohibits shippers from conditioning bids on use of alternate points at the bid rate
which calls into question our granting the winning bidder use of alternate points at a discount
if we do intend to let the winning bidder shippers use alt
points at a discounted rate
we should take this statement out
end of paragraph 0
if we're still living in a max
rate world
though
this really is not much of a concern since use of the alternate points would also be at max
rate
any questions
give me a call
fyi
lorraine
here are a few notes from my review of the val verde contract
and my initial impressions
let's talk more about how to approach the issue after we meet with ron tomorrow about maop
0/0/0 interconnect agreement
sec
0.0 specifies pressures and states that unless there is an agreement to provide firm compression service tw will accept up to 0,0 on an interruptible basis
sec
0 states that the blanco hub maop shall not be exceeded
sec
0.0 limits damages
no consequential damages
the contract also has a fairly standard force majeure clause
0/0/0 letter amendment
sec
0 obligates tw to provide firm compression service in order to accept 0,0 into tw's system
provided mogi has pressure of at least 0 and quantity of at least 0
acknowledges that this is an agreement to provide firm compression in accordance with sec
0.0 of 0/0 agreement
0/0/0 letter amendment
increases quantity to be received at the interconnect to 0,0 once the san juan expansion is effective
my initial conclusions
it is pretty clear we have an obligation to accept 0,0 on a firm basis
provided that burlington complies with the pressure requirements
probably the only way we can avoid this obligation is if accepting 0,0 would cause us to exceed the hub maop
in that case we can argue impossibility of performance
also
we could avoid the obligation because the summer heat above certain temperatures constitutes force majeure
this argument is strengthened by the fact that temperatures seem to have gotten hotter over the years
the fact that we entered into our most recent agreement with burlington in january of this year weakens the credibility of our arguments
they will say we should have known by now
burlington might try to argue that we have an absolute obligation to comply with the agreement
even if it means expensive system modifications
that argument is not a very strong one because the agreement contains no such affirmative obligation and in fact quite clearly describes the facilities that are the subject of the agreement

answer
i would not live forever
because we should not live forever
because if we were supposed to live forever

in mark baldwin's june 0 letter
he proposed the following fee schedule for project development
retainer
$0/month plus expenses accepted project
meets tw's predetermined financial hurdles
proposal $0 each month tw actively negotiating project
$0/month
each project
letter of intent
$0 signed agreement
$0,0 incentive fee
to be determined when i spoke with mark
he explained that this schedule was based on reaching certain milestones in the development of individual projects
in his letter he also proposed monthly fees for regulatory services
$0/mo
and market development services
including socal oir related services
$0/mo
this e-mail addresses the project development fee structure only
the recently expired market development agreement with igs provided for a one-time retainer of $0,0 and a monthly retainer of $0
plus expenses
and an incentive fee structure for any agreement between transwestern and third party
identified by igs under this agreement
as you know
the
identified by
language presented us with some ambiguity in the case of the southern energy gallup expansion contract
in which both igs and the tw commercial group worked on the deal
fortunately
the ambiguity worked to transwestern's advantage in that case
but my understanding is that in ongoing dealings with igs both parties would prefer more specificity in any future consulting agreement
mark's proposal represents a step in the right direction because it provides for payment on a per-project basis
this immediately eliminates the
identified by
problem because we won't be obligated to pay him unless and until he identifies a project we're interested in him working on
i propose that we define some general terms and conditions in an enabling agreement
if mark brings us a project we want to pursue
we will pay him according to these terms
and any other terms and conditions tailored to the specific project
as needed
for each project
we would simply enter into a short letter agreement referencing the enabling agreement
i've outlined the agreement below as a starting point for discussion
the numbers are mark's
we'll have to discuss whether they are appropriate
i've omitted any payment for a letter of intent because since they are nonbinding
letters of intent are of little value to transwestern
call me after you've reviewed this and let's discuss how you want to proceed
from time to time during the term of the enabling agreement
igs may present brief
preliminary project proposals to transwestern
if transwestern desires igs's assistance in developing a particular project
it will so notify igs in writing and shall execute an agreement with igs adopting the following terms and conditions
0
retainer for project development
$0/month plus expenses
project development shall include but not be limited to
research
due diligence
market analysis
negotiation with counterparties
to the extent specifically authorized by transwestern
reporting to marketing representatives of transwestern as requested by transwestern
and preparing a detailed written proposal
transwestern and igs may agree in writing to other project-specific requirements
transwestern shall continue to pay the retainer each month until a definitive agreement is signed with the counterparty or transwestern notifies igs in writing that it has decided to terminate the project
0
if transwestern accepts the project described in igs's written proposal
or with modifications after reviewing the written proposal
it shall pay igs a fee of
the lesser of
$0
or ___% of the net present value of the project
accepting the project
means that the project meets transwestern's financial
regulatory and other criteria and the transwestern commercial group has obtained the necessary officer approval to pursue the project to completion
accepting the project and paying igs pursuant to this paragraph in no way obligates transwestern to pursue the project to completion
0
if transwestern signs a definitive agreement with a counterparty for the project
it shall pay igs $0,0
additionally
the parties may negotiate an additional incentive fee
to be agreed upon and documented at the outset of the project
i will also include provisions on termination
confidentiality
etc

yesterday jeff fawcett
lee ferrell and i met with dynegy marketing and legal/regulatory representatives regarding tw transport options
overall the meeting was very positive
we had nothing but encouraging remarks from the marketing representatives
however
the regulatory people
sarah tomalty
ed ross
had a couple of issues
the biggest issue is a marketing affiliate concern
apparently dynegy is on a crusade at ferc to place further limits on deals pipelines can do with their marketing affiliates
they have run into situations in which pipelines
examples
koch
el paso
have blatantly favored their marketing affiliates to the extent that dynegy cannot even do deals with them
in fact
one of the problems with koch has been koch's price option deals with its affiliate
the perception is that the affiliates
by using
funny money
can always make themselves the highest bidder
with a net benefit to the entire organization
pipeline + affiliate
the remedy dynegy is proposing is to require a marketing affiliate
if it is the highest bidder
to credit back the difference between the price it pays and the price offered by the next highest bidder
the presumption is that the affiliate has an unfair advantage because it is able to pay above market value in order to get the capacity
dynegy's proposal would encourage affiliates to pay
real
dollars
while it emphasized its belief that tw does not favor its marketing affiliates
dynegy would like for us to include in our filing some limitation on options transactions with marketing affiliates
it is likely that other pipelines will file for the ability to sell options once ferc approves our filing
and dynegy would like for this type of protection to be part of the precedent set by our filing
ed hinted that ferc may be considering a divestiture requirement for marketing affiliates
and that pipelines can avoid this extreme result by voluntarily limiting their transactions with affiliates
shelley
i know you've discussed this issue with ed already and our reactions were the same
basically we politely told dynegy that we don't believe we're part of the problem and that we are therefore not inclined to unnecessarily disadvantage our company by further limiting ena's ability to do business with tw
we can probably expect an intervention with comments or a limited protest addressing the issue
the other regulatory question was whether we intend to file each option deal as a negotiated rate
my analysis of this issue is that since we're proposing the option fee as part of the transport rate
options would always be a type of negotiated rate and would need to be filed
if you think this is not the right answer
please let me know because we need to decide it before we file the tariff sheets
sarah's question seemed to be more one of curiosity rather than a basis for protest
like the indicated shippers
dynegy appeared interested in an all-customer meeting to discuss the service
jeff and the rest of the commercial group are looking further into whether and when we would have such a meeting
if you have any questions or concerns please let me know
hey tonto

the play was very good and i think well received
i'd forgotten how blown away i was by some of the songs the first time i saw it in ny
the cast members really have to have incredibly powerful voices to pull off a few of the most poignant numbers
i think this could be your true calling
i caught the third day of corey's jeopardy run last night here at the office
yes
i had to come back after the play
i love my job
anyway
i'm sure i'd mentioned it before but yes she is a very smart girl
as a result of that
she has managed on several occasions over the years to detract from my enjoyment of playing trivial pursuit or watching jeopardy by absolutely obliterating me
the girl actually did her senior thesis on trivia
kori told me she saw you last night at steak night and introduced herself since i failed to do so the last time we went
i should let you know though that she was very offended this morning that you didn't spell her name right in the email
i mean it's such a common spelling
so was darren there last night to meet her or do you just think they'd make a good match
she's a very fun girl
hope you day is going well and that the move to 0 went off without a hitch
good luck with all of the
fun
meetings
shorty
due to the lack of response yesterday
i'm beginning to worry about your success with the road test
i'm going to assume that you didn't get around to it
hey there yourself
sorry i haven't written you guys in a while to keep you properly updated
i am indeed checking on flights to seoul and don't think i'm going to go at exactly the same time as my parents
as much fun as they are
i figured we would probably do some different things than what you have planned for them
as for ted
things are still going well although i haven't see him at all this week
we are two very busy people
but
we had a great laid back day last saturday and i think have hit that comfortable stage
you know
not quite so formal about dates etc
in one sense it's great
but it also makes things a lot harder to read
anyway
i'm sure my mom told you guys but travis and kathy got to meet him and i think it went well
hopefully
if we're still dating come december
you and chuck can meet him when you come back to visit
i'm planning on dragging him to at least one of the u.t
games
i just have to find out when he wants to go
as well as properly prepare him for the scott/kelley/parks/wild card gang and the full-day affair that is a u.t
game
things in houston are good and definitely warm
i went with emily and her mom last night to see the musical
rent
and it was wonderful
also
i'm going out to san diego for the labor day weekend to visit hoot's daughter julie
needless to say i am very excited
talk to you guys soon
susan
i've looked into whether we can terminate our val verde interconnect agreement with burlington
and have determined we may do so only if we take the following steps
0
terminate the oba by giving 0 days notice to burlington
paragraph 0 of the 0/0/0 oba with burlington
as successor in interest to meridian
provides that either party may terminate the oba
at the end of the primary term
or thereafter by providing thirty
0
days prior written notice
to burlington
the one-month primary term ended june 0
0 and has since gone month-to-month
0
on the effective termination date of the oba
terminate the interconnect agreement by giving 0 days notice to burlington
the 0/0/0 interconnect point operating agreement
paragraph 0
provides that either party may terminate on 0 prior notice after expiration of the primary term
this is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire until 0/0/0
however
the paragraph also provides that the agreement
may be terminated by either party upon thirty
0
days prior written notice in the event the oba between the parties is terminated
as we've already discussed
termination of the agreement is an extreme measure from a customer relations standpoint and we probably need to weigh our other options first
let me know if you have further questions
drew
here is lorraine's update on the val verde situation that i mentioned in my previous e-mail
recall that we've been unable to accept quantities of gas from burlington because of the high temperatures at the interconnect in recent years
i've recommended that we seek amendment of the contract as soon as possible to reflect what we can do
the proposed amendment lorraine is referring to
which burlington rejected
modified our obligation to provide firm compression sufficient to accept burlington resources
val verde plant
michelle and i had a follow-up conversation with br thursday
i faxed the proposed amendment to br monday and we hadn't heard from them yet
they claim approximately $0,0/month in lost revenues because we are holding their production down
michele and darrell will work to pull together the data on exactly which days we have not been able to take br's gas
i mentioned to br that we were putting this info together
but they claim since they were told to back off to 0,0
0,0 mmbtu from about mid-june through july
our data would not accurately reflect br's inability to schedule in excess of 0/0
they will not accept our wording in the interconnect amendment
specifically
best efforts
and
subject to operating conditions on tw
so we will need to revise this further
we offered alternate receipt point flexibility at ignacio and alternate delivery point flexibility at el paso blanco on their jackrabbit contract but they do not think this is sufficient to agree to amend the interconnect agreement
they have suggested we consider giving them a deeper discount on their san juan
waha contract
0,0/d
$0.0
term 0/0/0
the ball is in our court
john
i think that sounds fine
i really have no other comments on the org chart or job descriptions
thanks so much for your help
first of all
i'm delighted you want to stay and would not have a problem with deron moving in
however
in return i would ask for increased rent of $0
to take into account the improvements you want and additional water use and wear
tear
after you read this let me know whether you think this is reasonable
i'll try to answer all your questions
q
i believe you had mentioned some termite issues and i wanted to make sure that we would not be doing anything to cause the floor to collapse as we would be removing light items for heavier items
a
i really do not think it is a problem
in addition to the oak floor
there is a subfloor
so heavier items should be fine
i'd draw the line at a waterbed
though
q
the stove is a bit problematic
a
no problem to look into this
i'm sure it can be repaired
i will give the appliance folks a call
q
do you know if the garage apt
would support a 0nd line being installed
a
i'm sure it will
go ahead and do it
if the phone company runs into any internal wiring problems let me know and i'll call my phone wiring dude
q
do you know if the washer/dryer connections in the garage part work for sure
a
i have a bad feeling about those connections
i'll get them up and running
and can get someone to haul the old washer off
q
i am guessing that they would need to be gas
not electric
a
i would strongly recommend a gas dryer because it is so much more economical
plus you would not believe how much faster you can get jeans and towels dry than with electric
if i have to get a new connection installed it will be gas if possible
q
at one point
you had mentioned doing something with the kitchen floor as the linoleum has seen better days
would it be possible to look into this
a
i have always thought linoleum in a black
white checkerboard pattern would look really cute in there
it's cheap to install and fairly easy except i'm leary of taking on the project myself because pulling up the old stuff is going to be a you-know-what
i will call
ask my handyman
unless you and deron are just dying to do it yourselves
q
do you know if any paint is leftover
a
the color i used on the trim was antique white semigloss
there should be some left in the garage
i'll check and if not i can pick up some for you at the paint store as i'll be going there this week or this weekend
the only additional issue i have is parking
dianna is staying with me and helping w/rent for the next several months and i'd like her to be able to use that middle space
i know it's a pain but either you or deron would have to park on the street
the other option is to get one of the back garage doors working so there is access to the garage from the alley
if i did this do you think y'all would use it
or is that too impractical
as for timing with the oven
w/d connections and kitchen floor
i'm taking the first full week of sept
off and it would be easiest for me to get everything done then if that's okay with y'all
call if you have further questions
the counterparty for that deal is enron omaha and the contact is larry paulou
i am working on clearing up any other deals booked with the counterparty as new this morning
let me know if there is anything else you need

what else
i agree that the proposed facilities could be constructed under the prior notice provisions of tw's blanket certificate if the cost and environmental requirements are met
the facilities appear to meet the criteria for an
eligible facility
under section 0.0
b
0
i
they are necessary to provide service to big sandy within existing mainline certificate levels
and according to my research the facilities are similar to those that the commission routinely has found to be eligible under a blanket certificate
the prior notice project cost limit for year 0 is $0,0,0
sec
0.0
if the project is not within this cost limit we will need to seek a 0
c
certificate
i've researched the incremental rate question and here's what i've been able to find out
in the context of a 0
c
application
ferc generally requires use of existing part 0 rates
this was the case when tw applied for a certificate to construct the san juan lateral
tw requested a separate zone rate for the lateral in that proceeding but ferc stated that a section 0 proceeding was not the appropriate forum
the commission stated
however
that it would be willing to entertain an abbreviated section 0 filing by tw to revise its part 0 rates to inclue zone rates for the lateral
so tw made a section 0 filing and got zone rates approved based on the cost of service for the lateral
whether we construct the big sandy lateral under the blanket certificate or not
it appears that we would have to file a limited section 0 if we want to implement rates for the lateral that are different from the west of thoreau rates
as for whether an open season would be required
i assume it would not be if caithness is going to fully subscribe the capacity on the lateral
however
if other shippers are interested and we want to get the best rate we'll probably want to have an open season
in any event
in the context of a 0
c
application ferc is going to put us at risk for recovery of costs
so it would be to our advantage to sell 0% of the new capacity
at this point i am uncertain whether we even want or need different rates for the big sandy lateral
ultimately it will depend on the cost of the project and what rates would make it economic for tw to proceed
i hope this helps
if there are further questions or if any of this does not sound right to you let me know
same dude
and he is good
we're going to steak night tonight at little woodrows which of course makes me happy
also
i just sent him a list of all the ut games so he can start planning to attend
as soon as he decides on a first game i'm going to have to start preparing him to meet the family and others
that's a lot of prep work
lesli
i am indeed the right person and will be happy to rebook the deals below

there are going to be several more deals that will need to be rebooked as soon as the cp's are set up

cinderella in her later years
cinderella was now 0 years old
after a fulfilling life with the now dead prince
she happily sat upon her rocking chair
watching the world go by from her front porch
with a cat named bob for companionship
one sunny afternoon
out of nowhere
appeared the fairy godmother
cinderella said
fairy godmother
what are you doing here after all these years
the fairy godmother replied
well cinderella
since you have lived a good
wholesome life since we last met
i have decided to grant you 0 wishes
is there anything for which your heart still yearns
cinderella was taken aback
overjoyed and after some thoughtful consideration
and almost under her breath she uttered her first wish
i wish i was wealthy beyond comprehension
instantly
her rocking chair was turned into solid gold
cinderella was stunned
bob
her old faithful cat
jumped off her lap and scampered to the edge of the porch
quivering with fear
cinderella said
oh thank you
fairy godmother
the fairy godmother replied
it is the least i can do
what does your heart want for your second wish
cinderella looked down at her frail body
and said
i wish i was young and full of the beauty of youth again
at once
her wish having been desired became reality
and her beautiful youthful visage had returned
cinderella felt stirrings inside her that had been dormant for years and a long forgotten vigor and vitality began to course through her
then the fairy godmother again spoke
you have one more wish
what shall you have
cinderella looks over to the frightened cat in the corner and says
i wish for you to transform bob
my old cat
into a beautiful
and handsome young man
magically
bob suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in his biological make-up
that when complete he stood before her
a man
so beautiful the like of which she nor the world had ever seen
so fair indeed that birds began to fall from the sky at his feet
the fairy godmother again spoke
congratulations
cinderella
enjoy your new life
and
with a blazing shock of bright blue electricity
she was gone
for a few eerie moments
bob and cinderella looked into each other's eyes
cinderella sat
breathless
gazing at the most stunningly perfect man she had ever seen
then bob walked over to cinderella
who sat transfixed in her rocking chair
and held her close in his young muscular arms
he leaned in close blowing her golden hair with his warm breath as he whispered
i bet you regret having me neutered now
don't you
this one kind of gives you that warm
fuzzy feeling inside
knowing that you are benefiting mankind by working for the big
e
read it and weep
just let me know if you want me to bring some sand back with me in case you don't make it out there this weekend
i'm thinking i may need to get julie to hook me up with a job like hers
if it will allow me to live like we're evidently going to this weekend
shorty
julie
everything you have mentioned up to this point sounds incredible
i would love to see the symphony
got to a polo match or the races
etc
etc
i've made everybody here at work green with envy talking about my trip
i'm going to email you back tomorrow with a much more detailed response to your emails because i'm trying like mad to get out of work before 0:0 tonight
anyway
like i said it all sounds great and i am very excited about the trip
believe me it's much needed
susan i'll give you the exact times tomorrow
but my flight gets in around 0:0 a.m
on saturday and doesn't leave until around 0:0 p.m
on monday
talk to you tomorrow
not sure of the topic of our meeting but here's the options filing in case you need it
do we need to talk
here is the draft for distribution
in addition to the customer-friendly
looking forward to meeting with our business partners
language i know you'll include
i'd suggest including something like the following
attached are drafts of the proposed tariff provisions
including the form of transport option amendment
and a filing letter
we are providing these draft documents to you in advance of filing them with ferc as part of a good-faith effort to resolve any remaining issues with our shippers prior to filing
the drafts are for purposes of discussion by workshop attendees only
and we ask that you not distribute them to persons outside your company
additionally
while we hope that these drafts are close to being in final form
they are of course subject to revision and final management approval prior to filing with the commission
hey darren
i haven't forgotten that i still owe you a birthday beer
in fact
ted was kind enough to point out my failure to do so and add to my already heavy feelings of guilt
anyway
i know you guys are working hard getting your presentation ready
but if you need a break i'm planning on meeting a friend at kenneally's tonight for a little pizza and beer
let me know if you have any interest in collecting
if not
you can just hold on to your raincheck until another time
susan
attached is the proposed contract with oneok
since it is a maximum rate deal
there is no discount letter
however
i am circulating this for approval because it contains a special provision
found in the
other
section
regarding marketing of capacity for release
as allowed by section 0.0 of the general terms and conditions of transwestern's tariff
christine
you and michele will need to fill in the address and account information
my sincerest apologies for operating outside the usual contracting procedure but since time is even more of the essence that usual here
i felt it was best to get a pro forma version of this out for approval as soon as possible
please e-mail your approval to christine and me by noon tomorrow if possible
thank you
the offer still stands but the location has changed
we're meeting at the gingerman instead of kenneally's
so alas no pizza
but oh
what a selection of beer
the attached letter agreement reflects my discussion with drew about the marketing fee
the fts-0 agreement will just be a plain vanilla agreement
i.e
minus the marketing fee language
and the parties will execute the attached instead
questions or comments
let me know
lesli
all of the deals listed below have been rebooked to their respective counterparties
susan
julie
sorry for the delayed response
i can't express to you how excited i am to be coming out there this weekend
after the last week and a half of work i am in desperate need of rest and relaxation
that of course means lots of shopping
as far as activities go
i'm pretty much up for anything
my guess is i'm probably going to want to take a quick nap when i get in saturday morning before starting the weekend's activities
but after that i say we just get going
the symphony sounds incredible as do the races or the polo match so i'll just leave the final choices to your discretion
i would definitely be up for a trip to the zoo if you want to go
but considering i go there every time i'm in san diego i could miss it in order to do/see some other things
the only things i insist upon are ample time outdoors and good seafood
anyway
i arrive in san diego on america west flight 0 at about 0:0 a.m
and leave monday at 0:0 p.m
so we've almost got three full days to work with
love
susan
also
if you could give me an idea of what kind of items i need to pack depending on our activities it might prevent me from committing gross
i thought you'd really like the one in blue
my fav's the one in red
hey pavarotti
hope you day is going well and that everything is coming together for the big presentation tomorrow
my day is going significantly better than yesterday so i am pleased
plus
my friend just emailed me from san diego to inform me that she can get us a great table to see the symphony's last performance of the season on navy pier
so i've got that going for me
which is nice
by the way
what did you end up deciding to do about this weekend
or haven't you decided yet
the latter would not surprise me in the least
you're a fly by the seat of your pants kind of guy or a slight procrastinator
i always get the two confused
now for the rule-breaking
i realize it's already wednesday but i wanted to see if you had any interest in going to grab a bite to eat or just a drink after work tomorrow or friday night
in light of our heavy work loads
etc
i hope you can forgive my rudeness
both you and darren looked pretty whipped last night and i'm sure tonight will be more of the same
you better be careful
i think this project is starting to give you gray hair
shorty
i forgot to tell you last night that my 0 yr
old niece got in trouble on the way to school yesterday because she punched a little boy in the eye
evidently
he was bothering she and her friend reagan
i think my sister's biggest fears have now been confirmed
little sally may have taken after her aunt sue sue a little too much
lesli
both deals have been rebooked
susan
em
glad to hear that you arrived safely in your new home
i'm sure you'll be adjusting to the time change for a few days
but hopefully this time you won't get sick
say
hi
to katy for me and tell her i will email her soon to try and figure when is the best time to come visit
now on to the business at hand
thought i'd let you see the last email exchange between mr
noble and myself
start from the bottom with my email and then read his response
i would love to hear your insight on it all
here's my thought at this point
i think ted is an extremely linear person
in that his focus can not be split between too many different things at once
to that end
i believe this project
to which he has dedicated many hours
has literally harnessed all of his attention
realizing this
i'm not sure exactly how i feel about it
any thoughts
sue
all legs of the deal have been rebooked
susan
deal is rebooked susan
sometimes i really worry about you
i know it's not kind to laugh at the misfortune of others
but i must say i was rolling when i read your email
it's a good thing i didn't send the other card i was debating over last night which alluded to the possibility of you and darren spending too much time together
not as funny in light of your shack last night
so how did you explain your attire this morning to your md
hope the presentation was a rousing success
shorty
i think ted needs to read this
no horse gets anywhere until he is harnessed
no stream or gas drives anything until it is confined
no niagara is ever turned into light and power until it is tunneled
no life ever grows great until it is focused
dedicated
disciplined

fyi
i haven't sent a quote in quite some time
but this one really spoke to me
first things first
yes
i am still alive
things with wonder boy suck
and for the time being i think we should refrain from calling him wonder boy
i'll be leaving for austin friday night
0st football game of the season
but will be back sunday and definitely want to get together while you're in town
hope all is well with you and that you had a fantastic holiday weekend
mine was incredible
i visited a friend of mine in san diego and had the best time just hanging out
shopping
hitting the beach and attending the symphony
on the water no less
it was definitely a good trip for my psyche as ted has been less than impressive going on almost two weeks now
i'm certainly not pleased about the situation
but at no point have i lost site of what a catch i am
and if he's not bright enough to see or appreciate that fact then i don't think he's bright enough for me
talk to you soon
susan
em
i cannot believe you ran into ben affleck
i'm sure it's just the first of many celebrity sightings you will have in jolly old england
i had an absolutely incredible time in san diego with julie
we went to the beach
where i was able to lay-out and not sweat
shopped a ton
attended the symphony and got messages
all in all it was an extremely relaxing weekend
yesterday
i was in austin for a recruiting trip and got to see corey's new house in hyde park
very cute
so i got back to work today
wednesday
and still no word from mr
noble
just to refresh
the last time i heard from him
email
was thursday morning
you'd be proud of me though as i have refrained from any form of contact and plan to continue that route only deviating if/when it becomes necessary for me to have a formal close to things
i'm still hoping that will not be the case but am fully prepared for the possibility that my brief encounter with dating may be over for a while
sue
here you go cynthia
susan
scott
thanks for offering up your extra tickets to the game this weekend
as it turns out
i don't think i'll be needing them
my sister has extra tickets next to she and my brother-in-law
hope you have a great time and maybe i'll see you at the game
although given the crowd i'm not going to count on it
susan
looks like saturday's going to be a balmy 0
better bring a sweater
lesli
deals are rebooked
susan
thanks again for thinking of me
lunch next week sounds good
any day of the week is fine with me as long as we get started around 0:0
just let me know what day is best for you
susan
dolores
i was wondering who my best resource would be to talk to about the changes to the analyst program and how they affect me
specifically
i wanted to get some more information on the third-year analyst rotation and its requirements
as i am currently half-way through my second rotation
as well as the different tracks available within the program
if you could direct to the proper individual

i would really appreciate it

dolores muzzy gave me your name as a contact for information regarding the redesigned analyst/associate programs
i am currently half-way through my second rotation with the analyst program and was hoping to get a better idea of the different opportunities available to me upon completion of my current rotation
although six months seems like a fair amount of time to plan my next move
i know how quickly it will pass and do not want to find myself uncertain as to what action to take to insure that i am heading in the right direction to meet my current goals
i would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you and discuss the aforementioned topics at your earliest convenience
if there is another individual you feel would be a better contact for me at this point i would be happy to meet with them as well
thank you

cheryl
the deal was done with one of the california power books
we use the ecc/riskmantra to book any deal with an enron subsidiary
not just canadian deals
so
i don't think this deal has anything to do with the canada office
let me know if you need more information
susan
cynthia
all of the deals below have been rebooked except for the one in red
for some reason i can't find the counterparty in the system
you may want to check and see if it has been set up yet
if it has let me know the proper name
i may be looking for the wrong counterparty
and i will rebook it as well

the
actual fuel usage
provision is probably a material deviation from the tariff
unless we cap the fuel rate at the maximum percentage stated in our tariff
i have added language to this effect
if we're using the
actual fuel
language because we anticipate that the fuel usage will exceed the maximum
and therefore we do not wish to cap the percentage at the maximum
we can certainly leave my additional language out and file a summary of the contract
i do not think such a filing would generate too much unwanted attention from ferc or our shippers
let me know
an incident with a love partner throws you for a loop
causing a bit of deja-vu
dwelling on the past is wrong

i was wondering if you had fallen off the face of the earth
it is definitely good to hear from you
i was just thinking about you today and wondering what you're up to
things in houston are pretty good
i went to san diego over labor day weekend to visit a friend of mine there and just went to austin this past weekend for the first ut football game
i know you're not a big fan but they are very fun
as for work
all is well
i'm actually going to meet with the development manager for the analyst program to discuss what my options are after this second rotation is up
of course my goal is to do a rotation in london for a year and then get promoted to the associate program
so basically i'm going to ask this lady tomorrow what i need to do to ensure that outcome
honestly
i think my odds are pretty good
glad to hear everything with you is going so well
not that i'm surprised
congrats on the new responsibilites they must be keeping you pretty busy up there
any trips scheduled to houston in the near future
as for my social life
if you would of asked me a week or two ago i would have said fantastic
incredible
etc
now
i just don't know
for the life of me i am never going to be able to figure out your gender
but as they say
hope springs eternal
and i intend to remain an optimist despite many road blocks
talk to you soon
susan
elizabeth
jeff forwarded me your questions about capacity options
i've answered them to the extent they involve legal/regulatory issues
if you need anything further please don't hesitate to call
can a new shipper who enters into an fts-0 contract with zero mdq in order to purchase a shipper call option or sell a transporter put option be allowed
prior to the exercise date
to transfer the underlying option rights by permanently releasing this contract
yes
will we be required to report these contracts with zero mdq on the index of customers and/or the transactional report
yes
can the releasing shipper permanently release a portion of his existing mdq and choose to keep or transfer the option rights
yes
the shipper could even release all of its mdq
reducing it to zero
and keep its option rights
how is it determined whether a contract with an option amendment is within the min/max tariff rate or needs to be filed as a negotiated rate
the option fee is converted to a per-dth
per day rate and added to the transport rate
if the total exceeds the maximum tariff rate
it's
negotiated
otherwise
our position is that it's not negotiated
we are not 0% positive that ferc will agree with us on this issue
how about tomorrow
i have the new pro forma oba in word format
by the way
should make getting a draft out easier
here it is if you want to take a look
try not to get the juice in your eyes
it really stings well
i'm sure you've already heard through mom
but i think things may be kaput with ted
i say
think
because he hasn't said anything one way or the other
it's just a vibe i have
so i don't think you guys are going to have a chance to meet him while your in houston
oh well
it was definitely fun while things were going well so i suppose i should focus on that
i just want to know why guys can be such
as dad would say
chicken shits
excuse my language but the description fits
but enough about me
so how are things with you guys
i hope all is well and that you're taking full advantage of all the
culture
surrounding you
we went to the first football game of the season saturday
against louisiana lafayette
texas won 0-0
and you wouldn't know if from the score but the 0st quarter was a little bit scarey
0-0
simms started the game but only played about 0 series before they yanked him and put applewhite in to put some points on the board
simms did come back in the second half and through a touch-down pass
the family's good and we're all excited to see you guys in the near future
write back soon
susan ******** humor is the best medicine.******** so i'm thinking of taking the t-shirt ted gave me from beaver creek and writing this on the back of it
i dated ted noble and all i have to show for it is this lousy t-shirt
dont'cha love it
i think that ultimately i would feel ok about giving them #0 and #0 under the circumstances
if these guys are really that concerned about these issues
i really don't think tw is ever going to breach its confidentiality obligations
i need to get drew's clearance for colorado law
i'll get back to you
okay
maybe it's not that good but it's cooked and the beer is plentiful
hey everyone
just wanted to test the waters and see what kind of interest there was in doing steak night tomorrow night at little woodrows
i feel like it's been a while since we really rallied the troops and i know i have personally missed the interaction
it's also been a while since we've attempted to solve the worlds problems over cold shiner and i think the world may be the worse for it
so
get back to me and let me know if anyone's up for an evening of eating
drinking and most definitely being merry
if it looks like
a go
i'll shoot everyone a follow-up email complete with eta
the one and only
if we could just get everyone to close their eyes and visualize world peace for an hour
imagine how serene and quiet it would be until the looting started
christine
i made a few changes for purposes of clarification
hey darren
thanks for the prompt response
sorry you won't be able to make it
but i will definitely keep you posted regarding any future group outings
especially since i still owe you a beer
glad you liked the quote
it does provide a good chuckle
if i'd have known you were going to be in london this week i would have forewarned katy and emily as they're both over there now as well
i assume you're there for work though and therefore a tad busy
anyway
hope you're having a good time and not working too hard
susan
hey katy
sorry no correspondence in a while
i wish it was a case of no news is good news
but if you've spoken with em recently you know that is not so
anyway
i wanted to touch base with you regarding my visit to london
i of course want to try and time it when both you and em are in town
so
i was thinking of flying out on oct 0 and returning oct 0
that way i would have a weekend over there with y'all
i know you're planning a trip to egypt around then so just get back to me and let me know if you'll actually be in london any of those days
hope all is well with you
talk to you soon
susan
thanks for the email
your candid comments make me wish i was over there right now sitting in a pub with you and katy drinking a pint
i am in full agreement that guys suck and have discovered through this situation an area in which 0 does not differ from 0
cowardess
as my dad so eloquently put it
he's just chicken-shit
so
the plan of attack for the time being is none
i am not going to do anything
that means no emails
no phone calls
no nothing
of course it's a lot easier to say that knowing he's in an entirely different state vs
two floors down from me
so next week will be the true test
you will be happy to know
however
that i do have a good support system in monique
she is a firm advocate of the
drop him and make him work should he happen to come crawling back
school
you know what really kills me though is the thought that
yet again
i will ultimately be disappointed by someone i truly expected more out of
i keep thinking about all the times i said
i'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop
well
it dropped
anyway
i've have decided to throw myself into work
books
exercise
etc
in a effort to distract my mind from other things
it's kind of working
i'm really glad you are in enjoying things so much right now
you have to email me back with more details regarding the new pad
like will there be enough room for me to crash there when i come to visit
if not
i'm sure nick would put me up
scarey
also
i sent katy an email about coming to visit so hopefully we can get everything squared away soon
fyi
the longhorns beat louisiana lafayette 0-0 last saturday
the game was fun
but extremely hot
it was a real nail biter
talk to you soon
sue *** don't worry about me thinking any of this is in any way due to a shortcoming on my part
i don't
rather
i am convinced he wasn't expecting the full package when we first went out and as soon as he realized that i was
he freaked
i'm beginning to think it's more than just a coincidence that the last time we went out i let down one of the last walls i was holding up as far as trusting him and it was right after that that he started acting aloof
things that make you go hmmm
i've discussed the
actual fuel
provision with christine and bob and made them aware that this is a nonconforming provision that would need to be filed
since the fts-0 rate schedule provides that fuel payments are to be made according to the percentages set forth in the rate sheets
according to bob's calculations
the actual fuel used by duke under this contract is likely to exceed the applicable percentages in our tariff
i don't think ferc or any of our shippers would have any immediate objection to our charging actual fuel
however
i know that fuel is a sensitive issue on tw so i wanted to be sure to draw your attention to this provision
let me know what you think
you crack me up
i absolutely loved the trading analogy
at times your insight is frighteningly dead on
don't worry about me though
i will be patient and remain optimistic
despite let downs
and
in no way
shape or form will i settle and end up with some dush
you would have been proud of me though
for the first time i was really able to let down a lot of those walls and be a little more vulnerable
i'm thrilled things are going so well with shannon
i think your attitude about the whole situation is extremely healthy and mature
it amazing what happens when you care more about the other person than yourself
talk to you soon
susan * be sure and let me know next time you're coming to houston
we'll go grab a drink and have a good talk
hey scott
hope you had a good time at the game this weekend
despite the heat
i just wanted to see if you were still interested in trying to grab lunch this week
if you do
just let me know what day and time work best for you
thanks
susan
thanks robert
this is a big help
just wondering
you make the statement that
el paso is not directing tw to build the interconnect facilities
do you think that our having an interconnect agreement outlining the specifications for the facilities and setting forth certain indemnities weaken our position at all in terms of saying this is not a ciac
hi mum
what an eventful few days it has been
sorry i didn't call over the weekend
i had my hands full painting my bedroom
it took forever
luckily i got the color right on the first try
the happy yellow looks pretty good
saturday i hauled my paint-covered self to the met for a pro-am tennis tournament
which was fun
it was a benefit for diverseworks
the theater/art group i've been interested in joining
in fact
yesterday i got a call from their executive director asking if i was still interested in board membership
and that they would be voting on me tonight
i'm really excited and am expecting good news
this could be an auspicious start to life after law for me
sure enjoyed my visit to austin
it went by too quickly
i hope you're having a good week
let me hear from you
love
cynthia
i had to adjust the ngi-socal index price in the spreadsheet which resulted in a loss of $0,0

these horoscopes can not possibly be speaking to every aquarian out there

you have a knack for bringing people together and creating peace
part of your success in waging peace is derived from a desire to let go of resentment and a bulging catalog of woe
you're sick and tired of feeling sick and tired
and look forward to a refreshing sensation of starting anew
seriously consider hatching deferred dreams today
what's stopping you

ashley
the oven/stove problem should be fixed before the weekend
if you have any further problems with it please let me know
i realize it's pretty old
i never noticed the control for the oven doesn't even have temperatures marked on it
the repairman is definitely taking care of that too
the handy dudes are coming over to give me an estimate on the kitchen and bathroom floors and i'm going to also ask them to replace the wood around the a/c in the second bedroom
if there's anything else you've noticed that needs fixing let me know
ashley
all that is fine
and i certainly understand
though i would very much hate to lose you because you are a fabulous renter
keep your freedom
stay in my apartment
if you do not want to renew for 0 months and want to go month to month after nov
that is fine
all i ask is 0 days notice before you move out
in any event
i'll probably get the floors done just because i think it would be a good improvement to make regardless
i'll check with you before i get the work done to make sure the timing is ok with you
sunday at 0:0 is good with me as well
just name the place
see you guys then
hey
evidently i'm not the only one slacking on the emails
that means you em
quick update
i may try to come over oct 0
0 instead of the 0
0 so that i can at least spend a little time with katy
how will that work for y'all
sue p.s
thought you'd like to know that i am doing well in regards to the ted situation
i'm actually kind of glad he took this week long vacation
that whole out-of-sight
out-of-mind theory really works
please see the attached and let me know if you have questions
if it looks ok to you and the 0/0 reimbursement arrangement is ok with epfs
please forward to james centilli for his review
thanks
so who's up for doing something that friday night
i'll probably be in austin saturday for the football game
but am definitely interested in getting together with everyone
obviously this is planning way in advance for this group so we can revisit the topic when wilson's arrival is a little bit closer
talk to y'all then
susan * darren
please tell me you have wilson's keys
margaret and i would be eternally grateful
do tell
do tell
darren
what's the word
so when do you head over to london and what pray-tell will you be doing over there
i'm planning on going to visit em and katy around the first weekend of october
sometime between the 0th and 0th
if you're going to be over there we need to all go out
i don't remember if we ever talked about it or not
but i may try to do my third rotation there
the horror
em and me set loose upon the unsuspecting citizens of london
anyway
i'm assuming congratulations are in order
so congrats on the new assignment
here are katy and emily's email addresses
i don't have phone #'s
etc
as of yet but i could get them for you if you'd like
i'll be sure to shoot off an email to both of them to let them know you're going to be over there
susan ps
we will definitely be doing steak night next week if you have any interest
a guy who used to work in ben's old group
and is now trading credit derivatives in london
see how i'm hooking you up with all these connections
will be in town and is dying to go have steak and beer
besides
it would be wrong for you to leave the country without a proper send-off from little woodrow's
now i going to owe you a bon voyage beer as well as a birthday beer
just to forewarn you two
it looks like darren
ted's buddy
is going to be in london for a few months working on a project
when i mentioned you two were both over there right now he asked me for your email addresses
no pressure for you guys to do anything with him
but i do like the guy and think when i come over we will definitely have to do something with him
and nick too of course
maybe the same night
that whole
kill two birds with one stone concept
sue side-note
i'm am dying of curiosity as to why darren is going to london for a project and ted is trading corn here
maybe i'll find out before darren leaves
who knows
maybe if you all see darren over there you can find out what the heck happened with our once so promising mr
noble
hey
try lgillet@enron.com for lisa's email address
glad to hear you're in the new pad
in the interest of saving $$$ i will probably take you up on the futon offer
well
it's monday and i'm assuming ted's back in town
not that i've heard a peep out of him
i'm very much at a cross-roads with the situation
on the one hand
i want to be unaffected and aloof and on the other hand i don't want to make this that easy for him
i think i deserve more that just being swept under the rug
so
my debate becomes
do i just let this thing go all together or do i try and get some resolution
i would love to get a call from you hear at work
the best time for me is probably before 0:0 or after 0:0 houston time
talk to you soon
susan
just so you know
i spoke with the group this morning about contracting practices and they agreed to do the christine/susan/dealmaker huddle prior to sending any contracts out
it helps that i have kevin's support on this
i think it will work fine
tk is going make sure tenaska gets credited
the difference between actual and billed amounts is very little
thanks for your attention to this last week
hi misty
how's everything
are we on for this weekend
let me know
since i have plans to see lyle lovett on fri
night
i was thinking of flying in rather than driving sat
a.m
to save on time
energy
especially since you live so close to the airport
painted my bedroom happy yellow while listening to the u.s
open weekend before last
drank a lot of beer also
am amazed it turned out as well as it did
you said you work with someone named hamlet
right
apparently he used to live across the street from karin and jim
on evans
i didn't think there could possibly be 0 hamlets
small world
susan
approved
subject to drew's approval
drew
the agency letter is the same as the one with oneok
except we've omitted some meaningless language that oneok had requested
okay gang
it's time to rally the troops
evidently last week wasn't good for any of us to get together at our local watering hole
a.k.a little woodrow's
but
i'm hoping the story is a little different this week
our own nick stephan is back in h-town for the week and has made a special request for a full-fledged
steak night
that means good attendance
not that i ever need an excuse to enjoy good company
steak
beer
etc
at lw's
but if i did i could think of few better reasons than a visiting ex-pat
besides
given the absolutely beautiful weather we are currently enjoying
the picnic tables and deck are beckoning
i'm going to set a tentative meeting time of 0:0 p.m
this wednesday
get back to me at your convenience and let me know if we should stick with that time or not
hope everyone had a relaxing weekend and is having a good monday
isn't that an oxymoron
susan
when i read about the evils of drinking
i gave up reading
hey corey
so he's back in town now
the question is what do i do about that
should i
a
completey ignore him and pretend like there was never anything between us or b
call him out and confront him with his own cowardess
i am completely torn on the issue and have actually felt physically ill over the situation the last two days
help
susan
fun quizzes from cosmo
that actually made me cry
susan
be prepared
this one's a downer
but oh so true
email me and let me know @ what time you think you're going to try and call so i'll be sure to stay at my desk
sue
the only things i need from anyone is love and respect and anyone who can't give me that has no place in my life
here are the email addresses again
i'll shoot you off an email before i come over
hopefully
by that time you'll be somewhat settled and have a phone number where you can be reached
or
i may just see you at the office
i have to pay a visit as there are a several people working over there now that i used to work with here
plus
i may try to set up a few interviews
susan
christine
i spoke with drew and he is ok with the changes shown in the attached
questions--let me know
i have confirmations from ben
sunil
and rudi
is there anyone else i left off the email
talk to you soon
susan
you'll have to come up and visit 0 at some point
kevin
let me know if you have any questions
yo
i know
enron capital
trade resources corp
thanks for the advice/humor
i'm feeling much better today
i knew yesterday was going to be pretty rough and not much fun as his communication or lack thereof would speak volumes
and his silence definitely said a lot
everyone's pretty much on the same page as far as their disappointment in said individual goes
i think we all expected a little bit more out of him
oh well
so i'm single again
just think how incredible it'll be when i find someone i feel even more for than ted
at least that's what i'm focusing on
so do we know if pat fitzgerald is single
anyway
i've found i'm not that attracted to cowards
which is exactly the catagory i'd put ted in right now
hope everything's good with you
especially the firm recruiting
i'm coming up this weekend for the game
hopefully friday night
and wanted to see if you and doug wanted to go out either friday night or after the game saturday
i hope you guys are planning on going to the game because i'd love to sit with you
talk to you soon
susan ps
check out the list of individuals for our girls night out the thurs
i don't think i'm going to go
i don't have enough time to waste on people i'm not that fond of
already done
susan
attached is a memo addressing the question of whether tw could acquire capacity on a competitor pipeline in lieu of a physical expansion
please e-mail or call
x0
if you have any questions
or if you would like me to set up a meeting to discuss this further
hey wilson
steak night is on
and
yes darren really did give me your keys and i've already handed them off to ben
also
you'll be interested to know that my parents might make it tonight for a little while so you may get to meet them
see you tonight
susan
what time are you heading out today
i'm soooo good
the chosen path was cool
indifference
so
last night was steak night and with nick and wilson both in town we had a really good showing
i got there about 0:0 with nick
and the group's size swelled to about 0+ by 0:0
0:0
about 0:0 i saw kevin
ted's pal
the one you meet a steak night
wandering around lw's obviously in search of someone
can you believe it
he
ted
knew i had organized this gathering
i know that because nick is working right across from he and darren and overheard darren encouraging ted's attendance
mind you ted was not in the email distribution
and he had the nerve to come
anyway
kevin saw me and came over to chat
he informed me that
our friend ted should be there shortly
to which i responded
you would know better than me at this point
the subject was dropped until he felt the need to raise it again
he asked if ted and i parted on good terms
bad terms
etc
i said there really weren't any terms
i just hadn't heard a peep out of him for about 0 weeks
kevin wanted to know if i was going to break a bottle over ted's head and cause a big scene
when i said no
i think he was genuinely disappointed
i said in order for me to do something like that i would have to care about the
loss
and that
while a week or two earlier i might have cared a bit more
with each passing day the
loss
seems less and less like much of a loss
kevin told me i was better-off without ted
to go even further
he informed me that there is no way he would ever let a daughter of his date ted nor any of his
girl-friends
he said that while he thought ted was a great guy
i.e
fun to be around
good stories
etc
he wasn't good dating material
i agreed with kevin saying
ted is a great guy
he just makes a lousy man
don't you like that one
i then went on to say
anyway
i'm destined for bigger and better things
right
kevin
much bigger and much better
about this time my parents showed up
the plot thickens
i introduced kevin to my parents and since both my dad and kevin were in the navy and attended colorado they had much to talk about
the two of them had probably been talking for about half an hour when
dum-da-dum-dum
ted shows up
he approaches our group because he sees kevin and is forced to make eye-contact with me
i give him a
hey
and he gives me the arm squeeze and a much too pleasant
how's it going
he asked what kevin and my dad were talking about
i told him the navy
he said don't get kevin started or you'll never shut him up
then he walked away
he never acknowledged my parents nor did he ever speak to me again the rest of the evening
the beautiful thing is kevin stays and talks with my dad for another half hour and when darren shows up he hangs out with
my group
for quite a while before going to join ted
my parents and i ate our steaks right behind ted and then went back over to our group at the picnic table when we were finished
it really was a great night
i would almost say i was glowing
i was having so much fun with my friends and family and it wasn't a show for ted's benefit
i really was having a great time
so
when my parents decide to head out they walked over to ted/kevin's table to say good-bye to kevin
it was awesome
ted's sitting right next to kevin while kevin and my dad are talking and appears to be actually shrinking in his chair
yet again no acknowledgement of my parents
he couldn't even make eye-contact
i ended up staying there for at least another hour and then went with a few of the guys to the ale house
needless to say i was very hung over today
anyway
there's the story
he's a complete and utter ass-hole
so i'm done
and no
there is no way he could weasel his way back in to my good graces
now on to a fun subject
my trip to london
i bought my ticket today
i think i got hosed a little bit
but it was the cheapest ticket i could find
$0 before taxes
i will arrive at heathrow airport around 0:0 a.m
friday the 0th and depart about 0:0 a.m
on tuesday the 0th
i'm very excited about the trip
i really need to get out of houston
i leave the activities in your capable hands
bear in mind i will have to see darren and nick at some point
single again
sue
in an effort to save a little time i'm forwarding you the email i just sent my friend emily in london
get back to me if you would like me to expound on anything
turns out he's a real jerk
susan
corey
here's an update
i sent this to emily earlier today
let me know about this weekend
i.e
the game
tomorrow night
etc
etc
susan
for your information
if you have any questions
let me know
it's kind of funny
everybody has the same feeling about the
ted situation
utter disappointment
but yes
it is definitely his loss
and
i loved the fact that kevin
his friend
spent so much time talking to my dad because that had to make ted feel like a complete jerk
which he is
i'm am very excited about my trip to london
the other guy i mentioned in the email
darren
is going to be working over there for a few months so i'll get to see him there as well
plus
in november i'm going to visit my brother and his wife in south korea which should be interesting
the globe trotting continues
your weekend sounds like it's going to be pretty fun
i wish i could be there as well
but it is football season so i will be in austin this weekend
i've signed up for all these internet airfare specials though
so if some great fares come up for houston to san diego i can take advantage of them
talk to you soon
susan
deep down i think i knew there was something wrong with him
i think that's why i never pressed about the past relationships thing
you know
afraid of what i might find out
lindy
ferc has consistently held that pipelines may make
operational
sales of gas
specifically this has included occasional sales of gas resulting from cashout requirements and the buying and selling of gas to maintain linepack levels
tw's sale of excess linepack gas would probably be fine
by contrast
buying gas then turning around and reselling it would be suspect as it would look too much like our unbundled merchant function
let me know if you have further questions
you had a question about the meaning of section 0.0
here's a brief explanation
section 0.0 covers indemnification in case one party gets sued by a third party for damage caused by negligence of the other party
i'm ok with eliminating
stockholders
and the
judgments of any nature
clause you two spoke about on the phone as long as they come out of both subparagraphs a
and b
section 0.0 needs to stay in because it covers any potential action by epfs against tw for damage to epfs's facilities during the term of the agreement
tw is already obligated elsewhere in the agreement to construct and operate the facilities in accordance with industry practice
tariff and dot standards
our policy in interconnect agreements is that if tw complies with these standards we should not then somehow be liable for damage to epfs in case of explosion
etc
in other words
both parties bear the risk attached to something unforeseeable going wrong notwithstanding use of industry and dot standards
by the way
i believe the
notwithstanding anything in this article 0 to the contrary
language should come out
i'm not sure why it's in the draft
any questions
please e-mail or call
0-0-0
i am refraining from responding to this until i have had time to ponder things this weekend
hey
if you want to email me back before monday
you can email me at that way i can read your reaction even though i won't be at work
talk to you soon
sue

issues that have bogged you down are effectively addressed
don't get up and leave until you get every answer you need

sorry i didn't respond very promptly to your last email
things have been very emotionally draining for me around here

after you've had a chance to take in the situation i would really love to hear your opinion

instead of wishing things were different
or woefully mourning the past
build a new beginning
it's pointless to bemoan recent changes or languish over disappointments
you cannot change the past
you cannot change people's minds
either
face your situation and create something wonderful
the longer you fuss about what
should have been
the more likely it is that important opportunities will drift by unnoticed

it is time for change
release frustrations and troubling memories
move on

mine for today quickly get past a troubling misunderstanding once you've released toxic feelings
the atmosphere visibly improves
much to your pleasure
you're able to replace fear and resentment with compassion and understanding
once you know the score
you no longer feel threatened or disrespected

is not appropriate

i'm confident keri and caroline are well

gary p
nunn is going to be playing new year's eve at gruene hall
on the ted front
it's tuesday afternoon and i haven't contacted him yet
i'm planning on calling him at home early this evening and telling him that
a beer and a chat sound like a good idea
how about tomorrow night
i will be requesting that he either call me at home tonight if he gets in early enough or tomorrow at work
this should all prove very interesting
susan
what's the word man
i haven't heard a peep from you all day
even though i know you've seen ben and called kori
i'm hurt
julie
just wanted to check and see if you had received my last two emails
if so
i'd love to know what you think about the whole situation
if not
let me know and i will resend the emails
susan
i haven't done anything as of yet
i just really didn't feel like responding to him on friday
i was still pretty floored by the whole thing
and since he's out of town till tonight i spent yesterday and today figuring out what i want to do
i've decided the following
i'm going to give him a call tonight and agree to meet for a drink/chat
i completely agree with you about regretting the things you don't do more than the things you do
besides i'm dying of curiosity about what he could possibly have to say
anyway
i want to try and do it tomorrow night so that i can quite turning it over and over in my head
i am absolutely sick of thinking about it
i think it will be hard for me to be anything but distant talking to him because
regardless of his reasons
he definitely wasn't very considerate over the last few weeks
wish me luck
problem is i'm not sure what i really want the outcome to be
susan
part of me is tempted to do the
taste of your own medicine
thing
but i was really disappointed that he took that approach
in this case i think email is very cowardly
and don't believe two wrongs make a right
i insist on taking the high road in this situation no matter how tempting it might be to teach him a lesson
susan
i think this is for you
aquarius
the conjunction between the sun and moon is a wonderful symbol of togetherness and unity
you may have been feeling distinctly out of sorts lately with your partner
and are sorely in need of some tender loving care
perhaps you both need to make the effort to be nice to each other
i mean really nice
not just pretending
see now
isn't that a lot better
there's mileage in this one yet
you forget that i also studied french
mon amie
i may not be able to write it any more
but i can still read it
susan
agustin
i just faxed a copy of the ticket to you
please let me know if it transmitted properly
also
the deal number is q0
let me know if you need anything else
susan
yes
we still do the steak night thing
but i will be unable to attend this evening
dinner with the traders
oh la la
you may want to talk to bfree and see if he or economou are planning on an outing
so when are we going to have a chance to chat
alas
there is no point to steak night without kori or myself
there is good cause for your lack of enthusiasm
tomorrow morning sounds good to me for a coffee/steamed almond milk break
how
bout we shoot for around 0:0
although i can do earlier or later if need be
let me know
as for the week after next
anything from wednesday night on will work for me
i am in full agreement with you regarding a
solid dinner
of limited attendance of course
see you tomorrow
susan
funny thing
ben called earlier to see if i wanted to go grab lunch with him
does he think i'm in a vulnerable/weakened state due to the ted situation
well
he's wrong
agustin
i have booked the trades below into the ena system
the deal numbers are as follows
susan
just talked to him
was pretty jovial
will probably get together tomorrow night
i think his job is really stressing him out
just talked to him around 0:0
don't know exactly how to take that
he was pretty
jokey
we'll probably get together tomorrow night
found out he has bought himself a pair of boots

i don't think he's earned ostrich
i think his job is really stressing him out

i've prepared the attached outline in response to ferc staff's request that we provide
something in writing
this is basically just a description of our proposal
i've tried to keep it brief so that staff members are not reading while we're trying to talk to them
it should be enough information to raise a lot of questions
please wait until shelley or i give you the go-ahead to pass this along to the relevant commission people
i'd like to give the other addressees the opportunity to comment on this to the extent possible
everyone else
please give me your comments asap as nancy has been asked to provide something to them tomorrow
hi mum
not going to dc until next week
any ideas for karin's birthday
maybe we could look for something this weekend
i plan to get out into the nice weather today as soon as i can
going to brennan's tonight w/craig
dianna isn't coming with me to austin so i guess i will just come first thing sat
a.m
i'll give you a call tomorrow
drew
here's my first stab at a rehearing argument
i did not go as far as i could have because i really think we should argue that there should be no limitation at all and that tw should be able to decide for itself what capacity it can sell as firm
instead
i've proposed a solution that will be less controversial
as we discussed earlier this week
if you think this passes the laugh test i can do some rewriting and circulate it
my biggest concern is portraying pnm's capacity as
firm
or
interruptible
since pnm does not use that terminology
in its tariff or otherwise
except to assure us over the phone that it is firm
i'd like to check to see if pnm is comfortable with all this before we file anything
call when you can
this is not due

ted
i made a slight change on the first page
also
the blanks of course need to be filled in for $$ amount and term
do we have other guaranties in favor of both tw and nng
i know we probably do
and i may have even approved them
but if possible i'd prefer to have two separate guaranties since tw and nng are separate legal entities
it is not a huge concern
since we are not jointly obligating the two companies to do anything
if it would cause an administrative hassle to have two agreements
let me know
is that so
well
i think you are quite a catch
no one has ever mistaken me for being a shy or timid person
least of all ted
therefore
telling him about the shirt was right in character for me
i think a part of him probably felt a little ashamed that a 0 yr
old girl with almost no dating experience could handle the situation with more class than him
anyway
there were a few other things established and solidified last night by ted
0
by his own admission
i am definitely smarted than him
while in the past i have challenged that i had to agree last night
0
i am a confident
probably too much so
and well-adjusted individual
merely taking into account those two points
ted in his present
condition
could never be a match for me
i would either always feel like i was carrying him or rolling over him
i'm still absolutely floored by the fact i have now dated a divorcee
does chuck think less of me for being duped
i hope not
he really seemed like a good
to everyone that met him
i think mom
dad and i are all going to fly over on the same flight
singapore airlines
i found a great deal from san francisco for around $0
i of course will have to fly from houston which ups the fare to $0
but it's still the best deal around
i can't wait to see you guys
susan
hey darren
i wanted to try and touch and base with you before my arrival in london
i talked to emily late last week and she seemed to think friday night was a good night to try and get together
i know you have a bunch of people that are going to be in london this weekend
but maybe we could just make it one big group outing
get back to me when you get a chance and we'll try and set something up
susan
so i met him for dinner thursday night
nothing was discussed until we were about to leave and i couldn't hold my tongue any longer
turns out he was married before and may have some issues
pretty big ones in my opinion
case in point
he's been divorced three years and
by his own admission
has dated quite a bit in the interim but nothing that has lasted longer than 0 mos
sounds like a pattern to me
we'll talk more later
i think an original tasters gathering is a great idea
unfortunately
i'm going to be out of town thursday
i'm visiting my friend emily in london and i have to admit i am very excited
if you guys do end up going have a great time
susan
hey ashley
just thought i'd drop you a line to let you know that i will be in london this friday through next tuesday
i'm visiting a friend of mine who is attending sotheby's graduate program
i know it's short notice
but i would love to see you at some point while i'm over there
if you get a chance email me back and let me know if you're free any of those days and how i can get a hold of you while i'm over there
hope all is well
susan

is there any way you could give me a little more information regarding the times of the presentations for each of the respective schools

hey
it's 0:0 and i'm still at work
did i mention i really need this vacation
anyway
i have a couple of questions for you
is there anything special you'd like me to bring over
that your mom isn't getting for you
i talked to your mom yesterday and she mentioned a craving for turkey jerky
if you want me to bring some over just let me know where to buy it
also
do you have any predictions for the weather
i'm planning on bringing the following
jeans
sweatshirt
black pants
skirt
black cardigan
rain coat
i put it in quotes b/c i know mine won't be official
some
go out
close
running shoes
heels
and boots
0 sweaters
varying tops
and a pair of shorts
i always end up over-packing
but i'm really going to try to pare down
i'm assuming you have a blow-dryer so i can leave mine at home
i talked to darren today and he said friday sounded good
and
i sent an email to nick so hopefully it will work for him as well
i also emailed jessica's friend ashley who's living over there and she wanted to get together maybe for lunch or something over the weekend
i've been checking out the tube maps on the web and don't think i should have much of a problem getting to your place
i assume i'm going to want to get off at the holland park tube stop
should be a piece of cake
right
any bright ideas of how to get your extra set of keys to me friday morning
i guess there isn't really anywhere for you to hide them around your flat
i.e
under the doormat or over the door frame
see you soon
susan
i may have to pump darren for a little bit of info friday night
subtly of course
like did he know that i didn't know about ted's
past
maybe you can find out why the marriage ended
sorry i never called yesterday
i had turned my phone off and didn't realize you'd called until last night
i'm still at work right now and therefore am extremely tired
hope you got everything you needed to accomplished this weekend
i had a good time at the game and
thanks to travis's pledge class reunion
have come to the conclusion that 0-0 is a better age range for me
there young enough to excuse being single due to career focus and still old enough to know who they are and what they want
some critical things happen in those 0-0 years from a man's late twenties to early thirties that can expose so many
issues
examples of which i got to see several of on saturday
talk to you soon
susan are you and doug going to ou
i always forget what the time difference is so i thought i might be able to catch you
real time
i went to the game saturday with travis
corey
mike and a friend of his
kathy was getting her certification for spinning classes and thus i was given the responsibility of baby-sitting corey and travis
anyway
trav's pledge class had a reunion at the house after the game and i think it may have single-handedly cured me of wanting men in their early thirties
the single guys from their class are definitely still single for a reason
also
you've gotta tell chuck that kinzer's date for the game was a year younger than me
although i will say
after meeting her
you would've thought she was much younger
i think 0-0 may be a better range
old enough to know who they are and what they want
but still young enough to explain their unattached status on career focus
talk to you soon
susan
do you know where the texas exes watch the games in london
it might be kind of fun to watch the ou game somewhere
even if just for a bit of it
just a thought
i am very excited about my trip to london
for one thing i get to visit emily
but at this point more importantly i don't have to think about work for 0 days straight
you guys are going to have a great trip to china and i say if you find a rug that you really like
i.e
you're not just getting one because you think you should
you should definitely get it
just think what a great conversation piece it would make over the years
and don't worry about my appetite for travel getting spoiled
that is impossible
i can't wait to see you guys
i think that you being in korea and emily being in london has made this whole ted situation that much harder to deal with
i've realized how much i appreciate y'alls insights now that they aren't as easy to get
love ya
susan

i completely forgot to turn in my expense report from last months recruiting trip
things around here have been absolutely crazy
as i'm sure they have been for you
in addition to the attached file below i am forwarding the hard copy to your office
let me know if there is anything else i can do to help with the process
thanks
susan
here you go cynthia
i feel pretty confident that everything is correct this month
however
i'm sure i'm being overly optimistic on that front so call or email me with any changes
deal #q0 has been rebooked in tagg
let me know if either of you need anything else
thanks
susan

determining that the socalgas/topock delivery point is fully subscribed on a firm primary basis

into socal/topock on a secondary basis only
socal states that it has experienced daily cuts of up to 0% and averaging 0%
if you would like a copy of the complaint

i will plan to attend

that is fine

to the state of oklahoma
the answer is yes
if you have any questions
please call me at x0
take a look at the attached and let's talk tomorrow if at all possible
i want us to have a consensus among ourselves on this draft before i circulate it more widely
i neglected to include some of drew's comments in the version i sent you a few minutes ago
use this draft instead
ted
see the attached
i've made a couple of changes
hey girls
i'm back from london
the trip was incredible
and would love to see all of you this thursday
i hope we can all make it

here is my draft of a rehearing request
as i mentioned
our outside counsel is going to try to add a few sentences
i haven't heard back from them
but will send you the revised draft when i do
i'd be happy to copy jay golub too
please send me his e-mail address
in the meantime
let me know if you have any comments
we plan to file on monday

thanks
susan
trip was excellent
i took pictures
but most of them where taken inside pubs so who knows how they'll turn out
i definitely thought about you and how much you would love the area emily's living in
very upscale
english and proper
i also had an impromptu interview thanks to dave oliver so we'll see
i will talk to you more later as i am in the thick of calcing and am suffering a bit of jet lag
susan
ashley
i am so sorry we never managed to meet up while i was in london
emily and i spent all day sunday gallivanting around the city to the markets
etc
and monday i ended-up spending a lot longer than i planned at the office
on the bright side
i was able to have an impromptu interview and meet quite a few people while i was there
i'm hoping to be over there and gainfully employed by early next spring
hope things are well with you and the next trip i make over there we will definitely get together
susan
hey darren
just wanted to say thanks again for including em and i in the outing friday night and joining us for dinner monday
hope things with work are going well and that you're managing to reinvent the wheel without too many problems
cheers
susan
hey guys
well i'm back home in houston looking out at our lovely skyline
okay
maybe it's not that lovely but it is sunny here
anyway
i'm so glad i got the chance to see all of you while i was in london
it seemed as though all of you are really enjoying your time in the uk
which is good to hear given the fact i'm hoping to make it over there myself
hope the approaching close to 0 finds everyone in good spirits
cheers
susan
em
you know i'm in on this one
it's been far too long since we've had a true nb weekend
unfortunately
although not surprisingly
it appears our erstwhile friend alan will claim any excuse
no matter how unappealing
to avoid singing show tunes around the camp fire
your voice will be missed
for the rest of you guys
i hope we can muster a good turn-out as i am in desperate need of over analysis in regards to the problems of the world as well as ourselves whilst in a drunken stupor
nobody does it better
susan
jeremy
i saved the file so that the tab you open it up on is larry's gas daily option model
hey julie
i just got back from london tuesday and am now almost fully recovered from the jet lag
i had an absolutely incredible time while i was over there and was even able to go into the enron office for a while
one of the guys i knew here in houston even set up an impromptu interview for me while i was there so i think my working over there may be a very real possibility
since i'd already done a lot of the touristy things the last time i was in london emily and i pretty much just hung out
we went out to eat friday night and then to a club
i think we got home around 0 am after indulging in some fish and chips
saturday and sunday we mostly just wondered around the city to various shops and markets and went out to various lunch and dinner venues
finally
on monday i went in to the office while em was at school and then had a fairly big last night in town with some friends of emily's
hope everything's been going well with you and that the move into your new place was a success
i'll keep checking for great fares out to sd
i'd love to meet your roommate and all of your other friends i feel as though i know now
susan ps
i think you're right about the california men
i am currently in contact with about three of them and they all have issues
although
i still think ted takes the cake
the attached draft reflects revisions made pursuant to our discussions with ferc staff
you will be receiving a hard copy of the tariff sheets separately
please make sure you read the
waivers
section towards the end of the document as it contains some additional requests for waivers
also
there seems to be some confusion over whether we are going to post all options
not just shipper call options
my previous drafts have provided for posting of shipper call options only
all other types of options will be generally available
on a nondiscriminatory basis
through our tariff
my thinking was that it is commercially impracticable to post the specifics of all types of options
and it's not necessary since options will be noted on our transaction reports required by order 0
let me know what you think
let me know your comments as soon as possible
i understand that the commercial group told stan horton this would be filed this week and shelley reported at staff meeting on monday that it would be filed this week or next week
as soon as i get everyone's comments we can get this finalized
thank you
you guys are going to kill me
but i just got a ticket on the floor for the rockets game tonight
i was hoping i could get cell phone numbers from a few of you so that i could maybe meet up with y'all after the game
i definitely want to see everyone and could
go out
later if anyone's interested
susan
glad to hear things are going so well
no
i haven't spoken with ted since my return
but
i did go out a few of the nights i was in london with an undergrad/grad school friend of his
among other people of course
surprise
surprise he didn't have many supportive words for ted as dating material either
in summary he found ted to lack attentiveness to his partners and maybe even fidelity
he said the break up of ted's marriage wasn't
all his fault
which is a decidedly different slant than the one ted gave me the night of our chat
i also heard that he has worked his way around enron a bit
all in all very disheartening information
regardless
i'm still glad i dated him and think i learned a lot from the whole situation
tell brendan i said
hello
and good luck with the new role at work
susan i have a hold on travel plans to korea right now as work may interfere
oh
well
i left him an extremely short voice mail thanking him for the book and asking him not to contact me again unless his message is kind and positive
i tried to make my tone very pleasant and calm
on ann's and your advice
i'm going to rescue the shredded letter/envelope out of the trash

take a look at this and let me know if you have further comments
here is the latest draft
if you have any comments
please let me know
thanks
susan scott
that is correct
i returned comments to accounting
not aa directly
i don't think i sent my comments to drew
but i don't remember very clearly
hey em
well it's 0:0 friday night and surprise i'm still at the office
i love this place
to answer your question
yes i am definitely suffering withdrawal
i will be working very hard over the next few months to cure that though
nothing really exciting to report here except a
nick called me my first day back in the office to make sure i arrived home safely
i really don't know what to do about all of that
b
ben keeps calling me to see if i want to go out
0 nights in a row in addition to our steak night beer
i haven't gone either night
how ironic is all of this
i've got one guy worrying and thinking of me that i care nothing for
i've got another guy who i at one time cared for but no longer do trying to take advantage of my vulnerable state
which in truth isn't really vulnerable at all
and another guy
who i until fairly recently cared for
who i think could go the rest of his life without ever seeing/speaking to me again
or course i guess the reverse of that is true as well
talk to you soon
susan positive notes
i think ted is getting greying and losing hair with the added stress of corn trading
he looks old and pitiful
attached is the cover letter
this version incorporates the changes we discussed over the phone on friday
stojic
kelly's suggestions
and further revisions by shelley
i've attached redlined and nonredlined versions
shelley and i might have a further revision or two with respect to footnote on monday i'll be in meetings 0:0
0:0 and 0:0
0:0
otherwise i'll be at my desk
please fax me the final version of the tariff sheets when you have them
to 0-0-0
and
please call if there are any remaining questions
many thanks
susan
thanks
i am definitely interested in the parking space at the met
please let me know if it is still possible for me to acquire a space
thanks
susan scott
fyi
many of the customers have requested that we fax them the filing
so i am planning on providing them with courtesy copies
fyi
those were great chris
sorry no emails sooner to tell you all of my trip to london
which was incredible
but alas i am back at work and therefore swamped
mom said you guys had a great time in china
i hope you took lots of pictures
i'm not sure if she already passed along the bad news
but it doesn't look like i'm going to be able to visit next month
work strikes again
i am very frustrated
considering i asked for this time off 0 mos
ago
but there isn't really anything i can do
so
i'm going to see if there's a way i could come over next spring
regardless
i very excited about you and chuck coming back to houston in december and we'll just have to make up some quality time then
talk to you soon
susan ps
isn't it ironic
now ben keeps calling wanting to go out
i mean honestly what goes through these guys heads
they don't realize a
good thing
the first time around and the second time around is too late
the
good thing
is no longer interested
you need to give me your messenger address so we can
talk
just thought you'd like to know that roger ebert gave the movie 0 stars
he had many of the same comments to make about the film and dallas as you
talk to you soon
susan
i just got the email from our ut recruiter naming all of the super saturday candidates
kudos
i'm so glad we didn't embarrass ourselves by overlooking you a second time
i'll see what i can do about getting assigned to your dinner group
see you this weekend
southern trails proposed
at an estimated cost of $0,0,0
a pipeline project consisting mostly of 0 miles of crude oil pipeline acquired from arco
ten percent of the project would be new construction and the remainder would be conversion of the crude oil line to gas service
the pipeline system would be divided into an east zone and a west zone
the east zone
which will begin in the san juan basin and end at the california border
will have 0,0 dth/d of available capacity
the west zone
wholly within california
will have 0,0 dth/d
southern trails received certificate authority for the project on july 0,0
an optional certificate application does not require any showing of market need
however
southern trails did hold an open season from sept
to oct
0 during which it received 0 bids totalling 0,0 dth/d of demand
the order issuing the certificate did not say how much of the capacity had been subscribed
only that southern trails had contracted with its affiliate
questar energy
for 0,0 dth/d of firm capacity in theh east zone for 0 years and one month
and taht firm transportation service agreements of 0 and 0 year terms are
being negotiated
with prospective shippers which
if executed
would subscribe the balance of the capacity in both the east and west zones
tw is an intervenor in this docket so i have received everything that has been filed
i have no further information about any further subscription of capacity
i also have no information regarding any progress that has been made on construction
if you need a more detailed summary of the proposal that was filed at ferc
or if you have any other questions
please let me know and i'll see what i can find
i've got the entire environmental report in my office if we need that for any reason
looks good
thanks for the heads-up
susan

thank you so much for your very prompt attention to this
i definitely had the wrong version of the agreement

he does find it objectionable and will want to modify it
so he will be very interested in seeing your suggested language too

i believe this email was intended for you
i see no reason to acknowledge your presence given the way you are harassing me
i no longer know you
it is also not appropriate for you to tell me what is the right thing to do
please do not attempt to contact me again
hey darren
just thought i'd let you know that billy lemmons mentioned you by name in one of the analyst/associate brown bag lunches
he was talking about the ag trading initiative and who spear-headed the effort
i think the other guy he mentioned was jay fitzgerald
anyway
thought you'd like to now you're definitely making a name for yourself around here
hope things are going well with you
talk to you soon
susan
your welcome
as for myself
i'm doing pretty good these days
i've been up in austin practically every weekend for the games and have actually been managing to go out a bit more here in houston during the week in an effort to become social again
there isn't too much new in tejas
the weather's still warm and a bit on the muggy side
but what can you expect it's only almost november
today is wednesday
so of course steak night is on the agenda for this evening
actually
the guy who trained me for my current job is leaving enron and his happy hour just happens to be at little woodrow's tonight
how convenient
on the man front
i've put myself back out on the
market
so to speak and have a couple of pursuant suitors right now
although
i don't know that in the end any of them will pass muster
unfortunately for them i am somewhat sceptical of guys in general these days
especially ones that i can't get background information on through friends
but i'm trying not to let that color my opinion too much
not to worry about your former neighbor either
i haven't seen or talked to him in a couple of weeks and that's okay with me
drop me a line when you get the chance
susan
i don't want to stop being nice
but i think it gets me into trouble
it's muster
to pass inspection

so
can you cover me for one night next week
i could be back the next morning by 0:0 am
no need to apologize for keeping me out wednesday night
it was probably more a case of me keeping myself out
i have been known to do that on occasion
i'm sorry i didn't return your call yesterday
but i had a pretty crazy day here and that mixed with me only running on about two cylinders effectively cut me off from the outside world
as for being upset about anything
don't worry i'm not
you know me well enough to know that my actions are my own
i'm not sure if i'm going to stay in austin saturday night or not
but in case i do my cell # is 0-0-0
susan i'll see you at purvi's happy hour if you end up going
the post-ted susan is out of control
in less than a week's time i have mugged down with 0 guys and have a fourth one emailing me to go out sometime
funny thing is i'm not really interested in any of them
just having fun
hope all well with you
susan
don't know when you'll get a chance to read this
but i must confess it made me a bit teary eyed
i didn't think he had it in him to be so eloquent
as for new year's eve
i have to say i'm kind of with kasey
as much as i'd love to see gary p
i don't really want to risk the drive and i'm guessing no one else does either
hope you had a good weekend and i'll talk to you soon
sue
hey
quick question
i was hoping to go get my car detailed this weekend and i remembered that you had your truck detailed a while back
i was wondering where you had it done and if you thought they did a good job
i'm assuming the place is pretty close to our area of town
i finally got into the parking garage and have decided i now have real incentive to keep my car looking nice
hope things are well with you
i talked to darren last week and it sounds as though he is extremely busy these days
i'm guessing the story's much the same with you
a far cry from the listless days you two spent in net works
anyway
if you could let me know about the detailing i would appreciate it
susan by the way
since there's no telling if i'll have the opportunity to gloat two weeks from now
tech in lubbock is never a safe bet
and while neither season has been one for the record books
except of course for our loss to ou
one of the worst in history
i noticed that unlike the longhorns
your beloved bruins are conspicuously absent from the top 0
oh well
c'est la vie
kyle
i want you to know how much getting your email today meant to me
i was hoping to be able to respond with the same kind of care and consideration you showed
but
as you can see from the time on this email
today has been a bit on the rough side
i will continue my thoughts tomorrow when i have more time to gather them
but until then i wanted you to know that i did get the email and that it contained quite possibly some of the kindest and most touching things ever said to me
and
please know that you would never
ever be put in one of my stalker catagories
you could never be lumped in any catagory with the sp's of the world
susan as for the good-bye
i would have to give it high marks as well

as for getting talked into buying all the extras
i'm not as easily convinced of things as some people i know

they keep the candy in machines and you have to actually pay for it
that just borders on cruel

here's what i've added to my answer to address ni's question
let me know if you have comments
i'll have a final draft out shortly
prior to the deadline for filing interventions
transwestern received a request from commission staff for clarification of the criteria for awarding of shipper call options
the procedure will be as follows
an advance posting will specify the term of the available option
term of transportation service
transportation volume
and instructions for bidding
shipper call options will be awarded based upon the highest rate payable for the option component
here is what i think is a final draft
i'm going to give it one last read thru
if you have further comments let me know immediately
thanks
done
jessica
i'm sorry i never got in touch with you last weekend
but i had the wrong phone number with me and didn't have enough brain power to think of using information
i don't think i would have been much fun anyway since i pretty much just ended up sleeping the whole weekend
in fact
i fell asleep in the car on the ride back to my sister's house after the game and my parents decided to just leave me in the car
i think i was probably out there for an hour before i woke up
needless to say i was very confused
anyway
hope things are going well for you and clay
i know everything must be kind of crazy for both of you right now with finals coming up and all of the interviewing you've both no doubt been doing
i really want to get a chance to see you and chat
i don't feel like we've had a good one in forever
i will be in austin over thanksgiving for the game
so we could try to touch base then if you're going to be in town
if not
i'm sure i can manage at least one weekend trip during december if there's a good weekend for you
just drop me a line when you get a chance and let me know what's new with you

hey kyle
you'll be happy to know that i think i finally caught up on all of the sleep i've been missing out on of late
last week was extremely trying at work
i think i probably put in a good 0-0 hrs
between monday and friday
and thus resulted in me being a complete and total vegetable this weekend
anyway
i'm assuming you've been trying to relax as well and have some fun before embarking on your new career with valero
i'm sure your decision to leave enron and move back to san antonio will prove to be the right one
in regards to dinner this friday
i would definitely like to get together before you leave
given how i've been feeling on friday evenings as of late
monumentally exhausted
sometime earlier in the week might be better
however
if friday's the only time you can do it then friday it is
just let me know what works for you
of course
regardless of what night it is
it's probably going to have to be on the later side to accommodate larry's lackey
i.e
me
susan
marcelo
thanks for the update
i have been given a green light as well to go ahead and start testing my traders deals
let me know if you just need tagg deal numbers for testing purposes
or if i need to rebook deals myself in your test version in order to compare it valuation with the valuation in my excel models
thanks

sagittarius sagittarius since every saj is equal parts idealist and gambler
your relationship should be very interesting
you're great pals
marvelous traveling companions
a pair of high-flying
activist/adventurers
just come down to earth once in awhile
or find someone else to do it for you
this union requires periodic reality checks
you share each others ideals
interests and adventures like no one else can
both of you like to read
study
observe
learn and teach
when you're doing all those things together
life may get exhausting but never boring
travel is part of the glue that holds you together
so here's a warning
separate vacations are a no-no
each of you is such a wanderer
somebody might not come back
or remain at home
the star diva has spoken
i believe she is correct in everything but the last part
if you really wanted to go somewhere by yourself
i know you would come back
and i would miss you while you were gone
i cannot imagine wanting to go on a trip without you
and i don't consider myself a
wanderer
either
here's the service list
here is a very rough draft
an outline
really
of an answer to indicated shippers
protest
please provide comments as you see fit
i will probably not have time to look at them until later in the afternoon tomorrow
at which time i will also do a lot more writing
i.e
making complete sentences
transitions
heading
conclusion
etc
in other words
of greatest interest to me right now are your ideas on the best way to rebut the shippers
arguments
including identifying those that might be safe to ignore
thank you
congratulations
i just found out that you were extended an offer by the big e
i can't tell you how happy i am that i didn't have to question the intelligence of my company
hope you had a good birthday and i'll see you at the a&m game
denise
please put these meetings on my calendar
thanks
hello dave
my understanding is that ferc does not yet require electronic contracting
but that many pipelines do offer it voluntarily
best regards
susan
today the commission issued a tolling order on our request for rehearing in the pnm capacity docket
as you recall
we asked for rehearing of the commission's requirement that tw's acquisition of capacity be limited to the summer months
the tolling order is simply ferc's way of buying time to consider our request
in the absence of commission action within 0 days of our rehearing request
our request would have been deemed denied
so we're doing well so far
there is no deadline for the commission to act on our request
i'll watch to see whether it appears on the commission's agenda
gregory
the book code is xzp for all of the basis option deals
the book code does not change month to month
it is always xzp
thanks
susan
thanks for the attached deal information
shouan
looking at the data i feel confident that
once we are past the first day of the month
the gas daily options curveshift is valuing correctly
however
i am still concerned with the valuation from 0/0
is there anyway to see same breakdown on 0/0 and 0/0 for 0/0's position
if you could send me that information in the same format i think we may have an answer for the changed deal value we saw fall out of my trader's book on 0/0
susan
low blow with the
weekends are my time
comment
anyway
friday should be cool so just go ahead and give me a call in the afternoon and we'll go from there
susan
gas prices up almost $.0 in two days
it is a madhouse around here
get me a ticket and i'll see what i can do
i call later
ted
here are a few suggested changes
also
regarding the language you crossed out at the bottom of paragraph 0
about notice of default
payment within 0 days
etc
i do not think that language was objectionable from a legal standpoint
and might actually be helpful as far as giving them a payment deadline
however
if it's inconsistent with your procedures
or you just don't like having to give them notice
i see no problem at all with crossing it out
ted
i made one addition
hi mum
so good to see you this weekend
it was great to meet eric
what a sweet man
fun too
i can see why you are so crazy about him
craig realenjoyed meeting you also
our trip home was somewhat hair-raising but we made it back safely
i can't believe i am still here at work
took a break to make my list foryou
it is somewhat random
feel free to collaborate with k&j

i am trying to confirm the counterparty on one of your deals so that it can be properly assigned in tagg
the ticket for the deal in question reads barcel mexico
however
i spoke recently with beatrice reyna who informed me that you believed the counterparty to be one of the bimbo companies
if you wouldn't mind looking into this and getting back to me with the correct counterparty name it would be much appreciated

as we discussed
here is the negotiated rate tw deal which tk did today under rate schedule its-0
the term is one day
nov
0
i know this is a bit unusual
we are just going to have to ask the ferc for a waiver of their
before gas flows
filing requirement
given the price spreads and the shippers
willingness to pay more than max
rates for short-term deals
we might have more deals like this
we probably need to put our heads together to come up with a better procedure for when this happens
it would be so much better if we were able to send tariff sheets via e-mail to our d.c
office
call if you have questions or need anything
p.s
the tariff sheet we need to file is 0b.0
mary
i finally was able to locate my copy of the alternative rates policy statement and found the following language
a pipeline may file the numbered tariff sheet implementing the negotiated rate at the time it intends the rate to go into effect
the commission does not intend to suspend the effectiveness of negotiated rate filings or impose a refund obligation for those rates
for these reasons
the commission will readily grant requests to waive the 0 day notice requirement
i think it might be fair to interpret the first sentence such that it's ok to file on the same day
this reinforces my belief that our waiver language is fine as is
still need to add a few things
but most of it's already there
the only things missing are the gd files we created and the gd fom valuation problem that i've been working on with shouan and jeremy
there was a bug in the code
ted
see minor changes on the attached
try to get them to agree to texas law
might help to point out that our interconnect agreement with calpine as well as any transport agreement will be governed by texas law

the california puc issued an order instituting investigation into the adequacy of sempra's
socal's and sdg&e's planning of socal's and sdg&e's gas transmission system and what measures should be taken to correct any deficiencies
the parties have been ordered to appear and show cause at a hearing
to be scheduled by the assigned alj
demonstrating that
sdg&e has adequate gas and transmission supply for the 0/0 winter heating season
as well as the longer term throughout the year
if such supply is not adequate
sdg&e shall submit plans for obtaining an adequate supply
sdg&e's gas and transmission supply is adequate to meet anticipated need for gas-fired electric generation
if not
sdg&e shall submit plans for obtaining adequate supply
sdg&e's gas transmission service is not being adversely affected by interests of its corporate affiliates
recently added demands on sdg&e's capacity are not negatively impacting supply for sdg&e's customers
and are otherwise consistent with representations to the commission
sdg&e's current gas curtailment rules are just and reasonable
if not
sdg&e shall propose changes
a written response from the three parties on these issues is due on november 0
other parties may file comments on the response within 0 days after the response is filed
the commission also ordered sdg&e to evaluate whether an interim
interruptible program
which will provide cost incentives to those customers voluntarily electing interruptible service
is needed this winter
if so
sdg&e must submit a proposal for expedited commission consideration
the oii represents the commission's response to an advice letter filed by sdg&e requesting emergency review and approval of its proposal to temporarily revise the gas transportation service level elections of its large electric generation customers
the advice letter was heavily protested and was withdrawn by sdg&e
in my conversation with mark baldwin regarding our pending consulting agreement for monitoring california regulatory matters for transwestern
i asked him to watch for sempra's nov
0 filing and to advise whether he believes transwestern should file comments or appear at the hearing that is to be scheduled
i will follow up with mark

from astrology.com
must i beware of overindulgence in such websites
i like the part about charm and charisma and think it is very true
sagittarius and sagittarius when two sagittarians join together in a love match
the truth-loving natures makes theirs a near perfect relationship
this couple views the world around them with an educated eye and both share an intense hunger for more knowledge
they will engage one another in pleasant conversation and banter that challenges and tickles the mind
an occasional hotheaded dispute can erupt in the sagittarius-sagittarius relationship
when one fact-fanatic sag partner carries things a little too far
easygoing and independent
these two are compatible when it comes to balancing personal interests
they've never known jealousy
and each partner keeps busy with personal projects when not with their lover
when they are together
however
they do all they can toward pleasing their partner and satiating common interests
although they are adaptable and modern
they can
at times
fly off the handle
however
it is not in the archer's nature to hold a grudge or let disagreements fester very long
sagittarius is ruled by the planet jupiter
luck
expansion is the key word here
as both partners enjoy the acquisition of knowledge
they will carry over exciting ideas into their relationship
they must be mindful of over-indulgences
as such gluttony will only distract them
their charm and charisma make them a very pleasant couple not only to one another
but the entire crowd
first of all
this is a brand-new contract
not a modification of one that used to be it
it's for lft space that we have posted according to our usual procedure
a receipt point has now been specified
bloomfield compressor
our tariff allows us to cancel lft up to 0 days a month
but it also provides that the parties can agree that the number of days can be fewer
so sempra negotiated us down to only one day
tk worked with darrell schoolcraft on this and they determined this would be acceptable from an operational standpoint
scheduling will happen pursuant to the lft priority set forth in our tariff
i left a message for you just now
call when you have a minute
demetrius
what i nice e-mail
it was great to see you too
unfortunately i have a really busy short week this week
we are trying to get something filed at ferc
if you're in town next week do give me a call or e-mail
i hope you have a happy thanksgiving
susan
strangely enough a tuesday night would probably be better for me too
i think an all girls gift exchange would be really fun but
as you guys well know
i'm up for anything
as for restaurants
i just tried this new place called bossa's and it was really good
it's right across from the rice hotel downtown and has a neat atmosphere
of course there are also all kinds of places around our
area of town
that would be great as well
pf chang's
mi luna
americas
la griglia
sp
etc
etc
just let me know the time and place
thanks again lisa for organizing all of this
you're the greatest
susan ps
if any one has an urge to grab a bite to eat or coffee either tonight or tomorrow night let me know
i feel like i haven't seen you guys in forever
hey
i'll try and give you a call tonight at your flat
as far as
free nights
over thanksgiving go
i'm pretty much open tues
wed
fri and sat
katy and i are very excited about taking you out to get some real margaritas
i can't remember where your favorite ones are
but where ever they may be the drinks are on me
although given your increased tolerance these days
you may break me
the reason i was asking about when you were coming home is
jeffy jeff is playing gruene hall the 0th and 0th of december and if you were up to it
i thought it'd be a good weekend trip for you
katy
myself and whomever else may want to tag along
especially since it doesn't look like we'll be making it to gruene over new years
plus
if we did go i think i could swing leaving friday night and not coming back until monday morning
the outlet mall is calling your name
talk to you soon
susan ps
i have encouraging news regarding london
i'll tell you more about it when i talk to you
like i was saying the other night
there are a lot of funny emails going around these days
travis thought you'd get a kick out of this
thought you'd like this one
hey wilson
yep
i'm still in houston for the time being
i'll probably be here through march of next year when my current rotation ends
everything's going pretty well
work is still consisting of long hours but i think ultimately the hard work is going to pay off
in fact
the whole london thing is looking pretty good right now
there might be an opportunity for me to get into some structuring and originating roles over there which is much more along the lines of where i'd like to go
versus this whole trader support thing
great experience for the time being
but definitely not a permanent role
glad to hear things are still well with you
sounds like you're still the same old wilson
working deals and hooking-up
you'll have to let me know when you're going to be in town so we can get the gang together to go out
it looks like darren's going to be back in town for about 0 weeks or so coming up so hopefully we could all make a steak night reunion
i've been going out quite a bit as well and have had a couple dates
but nothing really to speak of
i was kind of on a rampage over the last month just messing with guys heads
flirting
getting them to buy me drinks
giving them my number and then completely ignoring them
i think it was some need i had to treat your entire gender like shit
i'm pretty much over it though
it's not really in my nature to be like that
just a reactionary thing for having been treated like crap myself
keep in touch and let me know when you're going to be in town
susan
hey darren
it's funny you mentioned wilson because i just got an email from him this morning
he seems to think he'll be in houston in the near future as well
hopefully
we can all get together and go out or hit steak night for some cold ones
so h-town for six weeks hugh
why the mixed feelings
are they work related or were you just starting to get settled in london
anyway
i'll have to give nick a call about the big news
i may have an idea what it's all about but then again maybe not
so what's with this kiwi girl
because
i actually have made some progress regarding london
turns out there may be some structuring and originating opportunities for me over there which would be much more in line with where i'd like my
career
to be going versus the other opportunities i was being offered
either way
i won't be going over until march or april of next year so it's still a ways off
as for the guy scene
yes
there has been some courting but nothing really to speak of
i've gone out on a couple of dates but i can't say i really see them going anywhere
most of the guys around my age are still pretty insecure and i'm never going to be the kind of girl that wants to
shape and mold them
into men
i just don't have the patience or the inclination
and the other end of the spectrum
single guys in their late 0's/early 0's
who seem to hover around like gnats just give me the creeps
oh well
as i've said before
hope springs eternal
talk to you soon
susan
it sounds great
we'll figure out a good time then
i've really missed you guys these last few weeks
i've been completely mia
i completely forgot to call you this afternoon
it got kind of crazy around here
if you're going to be at the flat any time tomorrow shoot me off and email and i'll call you in the morning
otherwise i'll talk to you tomorrow when you get to h-town
hey julie
congratulations on the promotion
that's so exciting
i'm sure you've more than earned it
i just wanted to drop a line and see how work
your new apartment/roommate and brendan are all doing
all are wonderful i hope
i realize this is somewhat random
but i just found some great airfares from houston to san diego
$0 each way
and was wondering what you were doing the weekend of dec
0
i know this time of year is kind of crazy so i will totally understand if you have holiday parties
etc
to attend
regardless
this deal is good for travel through the end of february 0
so
if it doesn't look like it's going to work before the end of the year
maybe i could make a visit mid-january or february
have a great holiday weekend and i'll talk to you soon
susan
i just received a call from nancy bagot informing me that ferc has issued a draft order suspending our proposed transport options tariff sheets until may 0
0 and accepting them subject to the outcome of a technical conference
the technical conference is to take place within 0 days of the order and will address issues raised in protests
i should be receiving a copy of the draft order soon
please call or e-mail me if you have questions
fyi
jan
i know shelley's out
i left her a voice mail
couple of minor changes
looking good
okay
there's a flight out of houston on the 0th that gets into sd at 0:0 pm and the return flight is on sunday around 0:0
if that works for you i'm going to go ahead and book the ticket now
i'm so glad to hear that you're move was such a rousing success
as for myself and all of the guy juggling
i'm trying to get that under control
truth be told
none of them are worth a dime
i think it was more of an ego thing on my part
anyway
i still can't see the point in wasting time on guys i'm not interested in so
like i said
i've ceased the rampage
i'm not taking any time off for christmas so this trip would be a very welcomed respite
let me know about the times
susan
does anyone know this person or his organization
is this something our membership might be interested in
frankly i have been too busy to think about this
if you have any comments let's talk
susan scott
here are a couple of deals to look at
thanks
susan
drew
i worked with jeff on this draft so it already contains my comments
this would be analogous to every time you send me an e-mail
i forward it directly to drew and maria
how do you tactfully advise your coworkers about corporate etiquette
i wonder
on a substantive note
i sincerely believe the analysis mkm wants is beyond the scope of this letter
and would have no qualms about sending it
for bullets
as to your question about what's going on in california
i've done some reading and here are my thoughts
the nov
0 ferc order in docket no
el0-0-0
in which the commission ordered a $0/mwh price cap
among other things
was predicated on the commission's authority under section 0 of the federal power act
specifically
the fpa provides that if the commission finds that
any rate
charge or classification for jurisdictional services
or any rule
regulation
practice or contract affecting such rate
charge or classification
is unjust or unreasonable
the commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate
charge
classification
rule
regulation
practice
or contract that should be in effect
the commission recognized that certain areas of the flawed california market are not within its jurisdiction
but
fixed
the areas within its jurisdiction
apparently the california governor agrees with me that the commission's jurisdiction in the area of wholesale electricity prices is questionable
in any event
if the commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigate the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates
its authority to do so would be much clearer
the natural gas act expressly authorizes ferc to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just and reasonable
just and reasonable
has been interpreted in many different contexts and the commission has significant discretion over what it means
as we all know too well
the commission sometimes acts unpredictably
however
my feeling is that it will probably take more than 0 or 0 above-max-rate contracts to motivate the ferc to act to declare a negotiated rate deal
struck within a pipeline's tariff authority
to be unjust and unreasonable
the california proceeding was initiated after entire communities of individual consumers suffered 0-0% increases in their electricity bills
the prices for electricity in california were outrageous across the board and affected everyone in the state
by contrast
tw's transport rates for its short-term deals are far removed from end user prices and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not widespread enough for anyone to notice
it is far from being a consumer issue
and besides
the elections are over
however
as you and i have already discussed
we must be wary of parties like dynegy that do notice just about everything and who might try to draw it to ferc's attention
we do need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving california are doing the same types of deals
kathy
why don't you and i discuss a system of monitoring the contract information postings of el paso
kern
pgt/nw
drew
obviously i've only scratched the surface here so let's talk if you want a more in-depth report
sorry it took me so long to get back to you
unfortunately
i'm not a betting woman
i'm afraid any team i bet on is automatically jinxed and i can't vote against my alma mater
so i will kindly refrain from any wagers
have a great thanksgiving holiday
susan the options book is still the options book and i think i will have put in at least 0 of my 0 hours this week
i know
i know
i'm not working hard enough
hey chris
i was wondering if there was a fax number at the base so that my apartment complex can send you some info
regarding getting your name taken off of our lease
if there is
just shoot me off an email with the number and i'll pass it along to them
hope things are going well and that you're not too homesick with thanksgiving and all
i have a feeling i will be talking to you guys tomorrow along with both of our parents and extended family members
have a great holiday and root on the horns
i think this is going to be a tough one
love
susan
for your information
the outcome was great for tw because the cal
puc adopted our receipt point proposal
eliminating the danger of mandated restriction of tw's deliveries to the california border
the outcome is not so great for enron overall because they rejected our proposed settlement
the receipt point proposal was able to survive since it was part of both of the competing settlements
i'm still trying to get thru the whole order
let me know if you have questions
well
given the impressive results of friday's game
i suppose i should've taken the bet
i mean i knew we were good
but i didn't realize we were that good
watching the game i couldn't help but remember some comments made not too long ago about this being a building season and that the horns would be a force to be reckoned with come the next two seasons
i love it when i'm right
with an increasingly more confident sophomore quarterback leading the charge and three
count them three
very mature freshman receivers all eager to make big plays
not to mention last year's top quarterback recruit chance mock serving as a back-up
next season promises to be something to watch
my condolences on your prospects not looking quite as bright
hope you had a nice thanksgiving and good luck helping all of your aggie co-workers through this trying time
susan
oh and chip
i'd store the gig'em sweater-vest away for the next 0 days or so if you want to avoid any post-game ridicule
in a round about way you are an
ag
man now
remember we need to make a filing for our bp energy deal
which becomes effective dec
0
mary
i think you and i talked about this several weeks ago
the contract simply includes a right of first refusal for bp energy
the contract is such that the shipper would not have been entitled to a rofr under our tariff
which is why it's a material deviation
the filing will simply need to reference a tariff sheet on which the contract provision is described
let me know if you need anything
a copy of the contract
for instance
i have a conf
call from 0 to 0 but otherwise should be available if you want to give me a call
although
as a women
cojones
aren't necessarily the best attribute to have
there never has been
nor will there ever be a question of my possessing them
even you would have to concede that much
as for the bet
if i recall correctly
and i always do
someone once said they had a little bit of a
problem
gambling and i could not in good conscious have acted as an enabler
and
a true fan
longhorn or not
is there through the good times and the bad and believe me i been there through it all
a degrading loss to your alma mater
as well as an unbelievably beautiful victory over nebraska
always managing to stick it out no matter how bleak things got
speaking of which it must sting being beat by the last place team in your conference
but i'm sure the pac-0's record against non-conference opponents is really helping to ease that blow
speaking of feather's in the conference cap
looks like our next national champion is going to be from the big 0
will wonders never cease
my monday is going great
thank you very much and i will show extreme restraint and refrain from any chips comments
besides
i don't have time to type that much
ucla could stand a chance next year if the nfl doesn't prove too tempting to some of your vets
how does that saying go
like rats fleeing a sinking ship
it was very small and petty of me
but i couldn't resist
start with the last message and work your way up to get the full story
good luck studying
susan
start at the bottom and work your way up
i'd forgotten this is how i get over guys
flush-out the shortcomings of their wit
lindy
fyi
this is just really informal so i'd prefer you not forward to anyone yet
drew and maria are most familiar with this so i'm going to get their feedback first before setting up a meeting
i'll get with you before i set a meeting time to see when you're available
i'd told my theory to my friend linda
who wanted to be a social scientist and was always coming up with theories herself
i'd concluded that breasts were to sex what pillows were to sleep
guys might think they want a pillow
but they'll sleep just as well without one
she'd said
guys will sleep anywhere if they're really tired
i found the picture from tin hall the other night and that guy at whataburger was definitely one of the
cute cowboys
how weird is that
anyway
hope you're flight home and immediate transition to the classroom went smoothly
i guess i'll be seeing you in about two weeks and by that time
hopefully
i'll know more about my london prospects

okay
so here's the debate
there's a flight out friday night leaving houston at 0:0 pm and getting into sd around 0:0 in the morning
the next earlier flight leaves houston around 0:0 pm but unfortunately there's no way i could make that one because of work
the other option is to fly in saturday morning like i did last time
i'm leaning towards leaving friday night and just taking a cab to your place as long as you don't mind waking up to let me in
that way we'd have all day saturday to do things and i wouldn't leave on sunday until around 0:0
or i could even leave around 0:0
anyway
i was just wondering what you think about the various options
let me know and i'll try and book this thing today
susan
okay
my itinerary is as follows
arriving in san diego 0:0 am friday night
i'll need your new address for the cab
and departing sunday at 0:0 pm
if you just want to leave the key under the mat that would be perfect for me
i'll probably crash immediately anyway
i am so excited to be coming out there
i really need a break from houston
not to mention work
the gas lamp district saturday night sounds like fun and i would love to meet your friends
also
please don't feel like you have to plan the whole weekend
i have no problem going with the flow
see you in a couple of weeks
susan
i am free for lunch on 0/0
i'll see if frazier's available
why don't we choose a venue somewhere between duke and downtown
hi ashley
a couple of things
first of all
my new renter
doug
wonders whether he can just call the utilities
phone and transfer from his name to yours
rather than you cancelling and him having to pay any re-hookup fees that may apply
i don't know how it would work
maybe he could conference you in when he makes the calls
for what it is worth
he is a very nice guy to deal with
but it is totally up to you and i really don't care one way or the other
also
i'm having someone come clean the place so you needn't worry about it
in case you were wondering
i will take care of it
it looks pretty clean anyway
please let me know your new address and i will send you your deposit refund next week
merci

doug
ashley's e-mail address is in the cc line if you want to get in touch with her
i hadn't thought that she might have had to put down a refundable deposit
rather than a hookup fee
for some of the utilities so logistically switching to your name might not be worthwhile
but it may be worth asking
remember i have water covered
call or e-mail if you have questions
actually
if you don't expect me to keep up with you the whole 0k's
i could probably muster up the energy
besides
i'm planning on sleeping the entire way out there so i'll end up getting more sleep that night than normal
do i need to do anything to sign up for the run
the deals included below are strictly index flat gas daily options
i'm going to send shouan an index +
deal as well so that he can verify that the basis offset is valuing correctly in both situations
if you could run the same valuation for deal #'s qc0.0 and qc0.0 using post-id 0
we could verify that they changes you've made correctly value the basis offset whether a deal index flat or index +
call me if you have any questions
thanks
susan
well
how does it feel to be back
i'm sure
even though our fair city can't compete with london for history and culture
there are a few things you've missed about this place
hope the flight back was good and i'm sure i'll be seeing you around
susan
i believe leslie does regulatory/legal work for ena on a contract basis
frazier tells me he's available
how about 0:0 at little pappasito's on kirby @ richmond
let's plan on friday before christmas
and craig will join us
i'm sure
please stay over at my place that night
that way you would not have to worry about driving all the way back to tomball after partying downtown
and we'd get to visit longer
right now i'm home with some nasty bug that's been going around the office
it is a big drag
sheila came down with pneumonia right after thanksgiving
and had to be hospitalized
i think i should count myself lucky i only have the office bug
she is back home now
and begging me not to make the trip to austin
sounds like she is feeling a lot better
we're having a surprise party for craig's 0th on friday
i don't know whether he suspects anything
time for more cough medicine
i'm dialling in from home
got the bug that's going around the office
i'll call you in a few

good wrap-up

noon to 0 our time
steve and lindy
as i mentioned in our staff meeting
it is probably not going to be possible to solve our max rate cap dilemma by making a tarifffiling unless we can 0
get ferc to change its mind about its policy thatrecourse rates always be available as an alternative to negotiated rates or0
prove that transwestern lacks market power and should therefore be allowto charge market based rates
the following is a very brief outline of what would be required to prove laof market power
a warning
lack of market power is very difficult to prove
koch
a pipeline that most in the industry would agree does lack market power
tried and failed
the deck is already stacked against us intw's case given the withholding of capacity by el paso's affiliate and theprice conditions in california
however
we do need to analyze the possibilities for tw
if not to the cal
border
then on other parts of oursystem
additionally
we need to discuss acceptable incentives for shipperto pay negotiated rates if we do not end up changing our tariff
would you be availabile on tuesday to discuss this
please let me know
ithe meantime
here is a summary of ferc's policy on market based rates
to obtain authority to charge market based rates
tw would first have to request a declaratory order
and in its application provide information showing it meets the requirements outlined below
if the commission findsall requirements have been met
it will issue an order and tw would then mathe appropriate tariff filing to put market based rates into effect
application for declaratory order must include
0
detailed description of the services proposed for market-based rate treatment
i assume in our case it would be firm transportation service
0
a statement defining the relevant product and geographic markets necessary for establishing the applicant lacks market power with respect tothe services at issue
the commission requires a narrow definition of themarket
firm transportation
is probably narrow enough
but for our purpwe might want to narrow it down more
i.e
firm transportation east of thoreau
we have to define substitute services available to shippers
opipelines are a
good substitute
only if shippers can obtain the same quality of service on a timely basis
and if the other pipelines offer suchservice at a price that would deter tw from raising its prices more than 0%
all relevant
origin markets
must be defined
panhandle
west texas
as well as
destination markets
and alternatives for shippers in those markets identified
transportation alternatives are only good alternativesif they provide a netback to shippers that is roughly the same as if theyused tw
note that the commission has rejected capacity release as a goodalternative since it does not guarantee a shipper its desired contract quantity
0
market share and hhi calculations
discussion of other relevant competitive factors
commission looks at size of market share
mitigatingfactors such as ease of entry
and market concentration as measured by hhi.market concentration has to be calculated for each relevant receipt point adelivery point
hhi is calculated by adding up the total market share andsquaring it
there is a presumption of no ease of entry for transportationservices because of the expense involved in constructing facilities

proposal for accounting for costs and revenues
the apartment complex needs for you to fax them a statement saying you are no longer living in our apartment and they need it by tomorrow morning
if i don't here from you via email/msngr by the end of tonight i'm going to forge one and fax it to them
actually
i can do that regardless if you don't mind
just drop me a line and let me know what works for you
hope things are going well

and we did not file an answer to that

i am currently sitting in the coal group's old area on 0
while dealing with some computer issues friday
i came across an expandable file full of coal related documents buried beneath my desk
the documents and contracts seem pretty old
which is why i assume no one has missed them
still
i wanted to contact you to see if you would like me to run them down rather than simply discard them
if you could email or call me at x0 and let me know what i should do with them i would appreciate it
as you know space is limited up here
thanks
susan
kevin
i've looked at the pooling agreement and i agree with you
i don't believe taking the compressor down is at all limited under the agreement

please include my name on the list of attendants for the brown bag tomorrow
thank you
susan scott
call me with any questions
i'll send you the final version when i have the official ngi settle prices
susan
well
i have definitely taken a turn for the worse
lots of drainage and coughing up green/yellow stuff
no fever at all
though
i go to the doctor tomorrow and hopefully will be on the road to recovery before saturday
received jim's capilene shirts
they are nice
but i wanted to double check with you to make sure i got the right ones
he wanted the medium-weight ones that are sort of like long-sleeved t-shirts
right
the reason i am asking is that patagonia also makes a capilene that is more like a fleece fabric and comes in a v-neck style
i will hold off on the bathtub spa for mema
the last thing i want to do is buy her something she does not need
will stick to my pedicure gift certificate idea
so glad you are doing better
too bad there was a delay in the flu vaccine this year or we both could have avoided a lot of trouble
sorry beatrice
i sent this to greg and forgot to send it to you as well
this is a preliminary file until i have the official ngi settle prices for chicago city gate and socal
let me know it you have any questions
susan
hey lisa
good job on the organization
do you have any recommendations for what i could bring or is there anything you think we really need
also
just to double check
we're getting together next monday night right
susan
here are some of the main curves
attached is a file containing the rest
can we get together tomorrow to discuss the market based rates issues i raised last week
if you can do it tomorrow

susan
we did not answer protests to our order 0 filing
the gist of pnm's protest in rp0-0 is that we shouldn't be able to charge a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service
i agree with pnm that our tariff language is vague in this regard
what exactly do we mean by
no additional cost
unless through the allocation process
quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel
can someone help me with this
since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway
i would say we probably wouldn't mind if ferc rejected our tariff sheet outright
however
it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our language
or they could tell us to remove the
subject to transportation and fuel
provision
if we want to preserve our right to charge transport and fuel
it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer
however
i am going to need some assistance in understanding what the language means and why we think we can do it
so i can justify it to ferc
any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated

hey bronwyn
i just realized i never emailed you back
i am a bad
bad person
glad to hear things are going well with you
it was so neat to run into you in houston
i see your brother around the building quite a bit but i don't think he recognizes me
i'll have to make a point to reintroduce myself the next time i see him
so what's new with you
have you moved
i know you were thinking about la a while back
i've got a couple of friends from high school who are living out there and are really having a good time
anyway
i completely understand the urge to try something new
i too am thinking of making a move before next summer
i don't know exactly where
but somewhere outside of texas
i really need to experience something different
speaking of which
emily is in london going to graduate school right now
i've already been to visit her once there and she's trying to talk me into moving over there
i would actually love to go
if there was a job with enron there that interested me
as for my dating life
it is relatively unchanged
i was seeing one guy for a while
really liked him
things were going great
i thought
then he seemed to loose interest and decided 0 mos
into things to tell me he has issues and that he'd been married before
needless to say
that was pretty much the end of things
it's made me a little hesitant when it comes to meeting new guys
but at the same time i had so much fun in the beginning that i'm still optimistic about my dating future
how about you
concerning kappa
i'll give you a run down on everyone i still keep in touch with
corey's in law school at texas

i'll bring you the printouts of the relevant el paso tariff provisions

you all know me well enough to know that this a huge step on my part
i am not the world's best emailer
anyway
i feel like i'm out of touch with what's going on in your collective lives and am thus missing out on some pretty wonderful
exciting and special things
so when and if any of you get a chance shoot me back a quick note and let me know what's new in your life
love you guys

hey sweetie
i am so sorry i couldn't make it to your shower in sa

hi

emily
i really want to hear how your thanksgiving went with thomas and the
fam
knowing thomas it went great and your entire family
especially your mom
is absolutely in love with him
keep me posted on your plans for the future
i'm curious where you're going to end up geographically
also
i thought you'd find it interesting that i may have an opportunity to work in your old hometown
chicago
any thoughts
elizabeth
i have really been out of touch with you and i am very mad at myself for letting that happen
please write back soon and let me know how school
your family and this new man in your life
okay
i'm not completely out of touch
are all doing
my guess is you're going through exams as well right now so i'll wish you the best of luck and infinite success
contrary to popular belief i am alive
the 0nd works for me too
although given my current work situation i'm sure i'd be late
better late than never
right
anyway
both of the current suggestions sound good
i've been to benji's
great food and heard really good things about ousie's table as well
but laura was right
lisa is currently my social planner
how scarey is that
so she'll make sure i know what's going on
can't wait to see you guys
susan
i am destined to be a dork
it's in the genes
have to agree with your assessment
and
i promise she will try like the dickens to do stuff with niklaus
sp
maybe at the expense of doing things with you
mitch is the guy she's been seeing for about a month now
he came over last night to watch the oscar's with us
me in a wing-back and lisa and mitch holding hands
rubbing arms etc
on the couch
this is the second time i can recall since being in the apartment with her that i've had to witness the
cuddle fest
not to mention the
cuddle fest
we all witnessed with chad at europa
maybe if she does come over you could be the little red devil on her shoulder encouraging her to hook up with nik
force her to make some sort of decision about all these guys
she's in heat right now i swear
every 0 sec
there's some new guy she thinks is hot
the guy serving us at jason's deli might be the next victim
she's totally out of control
i must say i loved the way she casually suggested the nik probably wasn't your type anyway
covering all the bases
it's really pitiful you know
i'm just glad we will never have the same taste in men
did i mention that laura white's fiancee asked laura what was going on with mitch and i at kenneally's b/c i was spending more time with him than lisa
she was of course performing the role of social butterfly
like i said
it's pitiful
in actuality
i think i'm the only one of her
friends
that have met mitch and think he's all right i'm pretty sure everyone else has told her they think she can do better
i beg to differ
knowing lisa a little better than them
i.e
the many faces of eve
and would argue instead that he's a pretty good catch for her
caves eventually but not perceived
at least by her
as a complete push-over
perfect combo for our ms

i know
it's still weird to me
while i thought it was great that lisa was holding back on the physical side of this relationship early on
i'm beginning to wonder if she really likes him
or just likes having someone to talk to who will cater to her
i mean
i'm all for prudence when it comes to the physical side of relationships
but after a month of constant contact and interaction i would have to question the fact i didn't feel compelled to completely jump the guy
that's not to say i would
but i'd still have to question the lack of desire to do so
i just don't get the impression that she is that attracted to him
seems more like
good buddy
to me
i think she misses the matt's
alan's
thatcher's
etc
that she got that from in the past
on the plus sides
he is a very happy person who loves to smile and is pleasant to be around
i just get squeamish watching people cuddle so much
i'm having flashbacks to sharing a room with jen when craigers was in the picture
it's not a pleasant memory
trust me
i do think it's weird that lisa never wants me to leave their presence

i'm curious to see how all of this plays out
she keeps looking for signs to know whether mitch is right or not
i told her it's pretty unlikely that anything's going to whack her over the head so she's just going to have to figure out for herself what she thinks of him
she's got such a tough life

civil war may be sold out
i'm checking on it
julie
i don't know if i told you before
but i'm leaving tomorrow for a long weekend in the caymans with my new group
i can't tell you how much my life has changed in the last three weeks
i'm getting out of the office no later than 0:0 everyday
and it's usually closer to 0:0-0:0
and i actually have time to do other things with my life
i went to the symphony last week
am going to a reception at the mfa next week
joined a volunteer organization geared toward young professionals and am thinking about joining the church i've been going to the last couple of months
all in all life has improved
still nothing new on the guy front
but i'm in no rush so it's not that big a deal
i am so excited about my trip out to san diego to see you
i promise to be well rested and ready to shop
eat and go out
or just sit on the beach
like i said before
i'm up for anything
hope things are going well with you
the job and brendan
drop me a line if you get a chance and let me know what's new in your life
talk to you soon
susan
yup
i leave for the caymans today
our flight out is at 0:0
so we'll probably be leaving the office around 0:0 this morning
i am
understandably
very excited
we will definitely talk more about tuesday night either sunday or monday
as for civil war
i'll keep checking to see what the deal is with the tickets
the going away party for kenny should be really fun
i'm glad you're in the states and able to see him off properly

which always makes the drive that much more enjoyable
as for the
manicures and pedicures for the girls
i would like to put my order in for a turkey breast sandwich on white
i can't wait till next weekend

the cayman islands we're leaving in about a 0/0 hour for the airport and i am extremely excited about the trip
i will be sure to take lots of pictures and drink many fruity drinks
actually
i'm going scuba diving tomorrow and then we're taking a catamaran on saturday out to some island
i will be taking full advantage of the sunning net for the trip out to the island
additionally
we've got first class dinners booked every night and i should be able to fit in a massage
i know
it's sick
also
i'm sure you noticed that i emailed niclas about you so the door has been cracked open
just a warning though
based on a tuesday night conversation with lisa i'm afraid our dear mitch may be biting the dust soon
we'll see though
she has become very flighty
okay
is flighty
when it comes to guys
sue
i'm leaving shortly for the airport
but i will give you a call when i get back so we can discuss transport to sa
i am way too excited about this trip

i just checked my messages this morning
i didn't think people could leave messages anymore after i was put on a trading phone but low and behold they can
if you ever want to get a hold of me in the future
the best bets are email and cell phone

i'd be happy to chat with you if you still need to
just let me know a time and place and i'm there

hey
very jealous about the canary island trip
that sounds wonderful
take my advice though
use sunscreen
i was really good about applying everywhere except for my lower back and the back of my thighs and i've paid the price
kind of looks like i was scolded with boiling water
so i've got lisa's wedding this weekend and my san diego trip the next
i'm taking friday off this week so i can go to the bridesmaid/house party luncheon in san antonio and we've got good friday off from work the next week so i'm looking at two four-day work weeks
my how things have changed
i think katy and i are going to a corporate sponsors reception at the mfa tomorrow night and lisa has expressed interest in going as well
but we'll see about that
she's always enthusiastic in the beginning
all in all things are pretty good

hey
just wanted to make sure you're still up for the mfa reception tomorrow night
i told lisa about it last night and she said she'd like to go as well
so
the reception is supposed to start at 0:0 and go until 0:0 and i figured we could either go to an early dinner
or cut out of the reception a little bit early and go to dinner afterward
say around 0:0
0:0
of course
dinner doesn't have to factor in at all if we don't want it to
just a suggestion
i'll give you call later tonight to hammer out the details
see ya
susan

long time
no nothing
how goes it
just wanted to drop you a line and see how the fam's doing
hope all is well
we really need to grab a drink after work sometime or a late afternoon coffee and catch-up on each other's respective endeavours
talk to you soon
susan
did you just add another ticket under my name or did you request three additional tickets
as for dinner
i just emailed katy and asked for her preference
i think it'd be more pleasant/less hurried if we went afterwards
say 0:0ish
but before would work for me too
i haven't talked to my mom yet about the tickets
but i'll give her a call when things calm down a bit here
talk to you later

theresa and nicole
jay and i were wondering if it would be possible for you to make copies of all the existing transportation contracts for the denver desk and fed-ex them to the houston office
currently we do not have any of these contracts available to us here and feel it would be beneficial to have them on hand
as you know
we are both trying to get up to speed on this book and all it's components and therefore it is important that we understand all of the available options these contracts allow us
below is a list of the contracts we have broken out on a summary sheet
if there are contracts missing from the above list
please include them in the packet as well
thanks for all the help
susan
just got the email myself
will definitely check it out
thanks
when you get a chance
tell me again what your schedule is for the end of april through july
i'm trying to figure when i can come visit and not pay too much on airfare
be able to stay a decent amount of time and not miss critical days at work
i will definitely come over
just don't know if it'll will be when katy does
sue
if you're on the internet right now
i'm trying to call
our meeting was postponed
here you go
katy wrote me an email and said she'd prefer to eat afterwards
as would i
so i say we plan to get to the
reception
around 0:0 and leave for dinner roughly 0:0
let me know if that works for you
yes
i am going home before the reception and am going to have katy meet me at the apartment around 0:0
at least that's what time i'm telling her
if you want to tell laura to meet at the apartment around that time too
i will be there to greet her
i'm going to drop off some dry cleaning
finish my laundry and clean up a bit before they get there
i'm so glad everyone is up for this outing
we are so culturally aware
so that's the plan
i suggest we eat somewhere around the museum district
i'll do some research this afternoon
talk to you later
sue
okay
i'm in for driving together on friday
although i'd love to see my sister and her family in austin
i decided last night that i'm just too tuckered out to make this weekend any more exhausting than it's already going to be
so
we just need to figure out what time we're leaving on friday morning and who wants to drive
i'm going to map out all of the directions for the weekend today so i cut down on my frustration level in regards to san antonio
absolutely no more getting lost for susan
zapps my energy
talk to you later

i would like to volunteer for the information session on september 0
my apologies for not being able to help out with this year's spring recruiting
but from the beginning of october through last friday i couldn't take a single day off from work
fortunately
i'm in a new rotation and they have a bit more flexibility when it comes to my schedule
thanks
susan
actually
i'm thrilled you want to drive
i know i like to drive most of the time
but i'm not kidding about being exhausted and thus wanting to limit my exertion
i think we should shoot for leaving by 0:0 so that if we're running a few minutes late it's no big deal
as long as we're on the road by 0:0 we should be fine
i have no idea what i'm wearing yet either
oh well
necessity is the mother of invention
right
the trip was incredible
my life has done an absolute about face
can't wait to tell you all about it

hey stranger
haven't talked to you in while
how are things going
the trip was absolutely incredible
we went scuba diving
swam with stingrays and drank enough
rum for me personally
to drown a large school of fish
anyway
i've decided i'm a no go for austin this thursday night
i'm already exhausted and jen bowles offered to drive friday morning so i've decided to take her up on the offer
after the caymans last weekend
lisa's wedding this weekend and san diego next weekend i've decided my best move is to try and conserve some energy
regardless
i will see you and doug saturday night and we'll do our catching up then
my parents are coming to the wedding as well so i'm sure they'll want to have a nice chat with you and doug
talk to you soon
susan hope law review isn't wearing you too thin
i promise i have not forgotten about you
things around here have just been crazy with the beginning of the month and all
i should have some time tomorrow to get together if you like
just give me a call
talk to you soon
susan
we know about merle
don't know if i'll be able to go though b/c i have to be in san antonio at a bridal luncheon by 0:0 on friday
there's no reserved seating anyway so i think i might be a bit of a mess
remember how crowded the bellamy brothers were
as for the trip over
i'm arriving on the 0th
wednesday morning at 0:0
and i'll be leaving the morning of the 0th
not perfect
but if something looks appealing on the mid-week trip front let me know
i'll have a total of 0 full days over there
plenty of time to do something interesting right

hi yourself
i swear you read my mind sometimes
i was just about to email you
anyway
things here are good and i am equally
if not more
excited about my visit
i know the weather's been kind of funky the last week or so but i've been hearing the same rumours as you regarding a weekend warm-up
therefore
i'm still bringing my suit/beach clothes and will just make sure i've got some stuff in case it stays on the chilly side
i'll also make sure to include some work-out clothes and sunday attire
i'm assuming a skirt or dress will work okay
no worries about the need to study
i've been go-go-go the last couple of weekends and would not mind at all having some down-time during the day for naps
lounging
walking
etc
while you study to your hearts content
honestly
we've got plenty of time to do things so it's no big deal
my flight is supposed to arrive thursday night at 0:0 and i leave at 0:0 sunday afternoon
i got direct flights this time so i won't be nearly as tired
hope this week isn't too crazy for you
of course
if it is you'll be more than ready for a little r&r

hi ashley
it's so funny that you emailed me today because i was just telling jessica this weekend that i needed to drop you a line
unfortunately
i'm no longer moving to london
i was offered a job here in houston trading and just couldn't pass it up
however
i will definitely tell my friend emily about the flat
she's always looking for ways to save a little bit of money
i'll also keep my ears open for any enronites who are looking for places to live
actually
the reason i was going to email you was to let you know i'm coming over to visit again this june
i will be in town basically the 0th through the 0th
flying in on the 0th and departing the 0th
i hope you're in town at least some of that time
i'm still frustrated we never had a chance to hook-up last time
food for thought
there's an eagles concert on the 0th and my friend already has tickets with some buddies
i'm was planning on just getting a single ticket and hopefully squeezing in with them
but if you have any interest please let me know and we could just get tickets together
talk to you soon

i failed to comment on your movie question
no
i haven't seen any lately so that sounds good to me too
i've been going crazy on the internet today looking for things/places to do/go

okay
given the weather conditions out there right now i'm going to have to put a little extra planning into my packing
i figure we'll be engaging in the following activities
beach
shopping
dinner
going out
church and i think you mentioned something about a museum
given those various situations
i was wondering what you suggest i bring along
for instance
am i going to need a jacket at night or is a sweater sufficient and what do you suggest in the way of
go-out
clothes
also
let me know if you hear anything about the spas
that way i can try and make a reservation
i figure friday mid-morning would be a good time
we could go for a run in the morning and then i could go for the massage while you study
supposedly
it's going to be warmer on saturday than friday so maybe we should plan saturday as our beach day
of course
i'm completely flexible
as for brunch on sunday
i did a little research yesterday and came up with a few suggestions
george's on the cove
the marine room
brockton villa
trattoria acqua and pacifica del mar
all of these
with the exception of pacifica del mar
are in la jolla so i suppose we'd have to take that into consideration
there is a presbyterian church in la jolla that could be an option
but if your friends have suggestions i defer to their judgement both religiously and gastronomically
all of the places mentioned above
in addition to the fish market
cafe japengo and en fuego cantina
grill
also sounded good for just regular meals
depending on local culture
and your own opinion
i was just going to let you know that i can go straight from the airport somewhere if you want on thursday
i didn't know what time people typically go out to eat or if you even wanted to go out thursday night
i know
i know
i had way too much time on my hands yesterday
in the end
i'll really do anything and go anywhere
just thought i'd help out with a few suggestions
love
susan
i'm checking out the l'auberge website as we speak
it sounds wonderful
as for baseball
i'd love to stop by for a few innings on saturday
it sounds like fun and i wouldn't mind checking out the stadium
i can't stress enough how flexible i am on all this stuff
we can wait a while before deciding which is our best beach day bet
i'll check out the spa's schedule regarding massages to see what kind of flexibility there is there
as for the clothing i will try to remind myself sd is casual
houston's gotten pretty sassy over the last couple of years
i always feel underdressed when i go out here
thursday night sounds great
two days and counting

okay
on friday they have openings at 0:0
0:0
0:0 and saturday there are openings from 0:0 to 0:0
either works for me
the packages i'm looking at are about and hour and a half long and i thought to buy you some more time i could just visit all the shops
here are the two packages i'm looking at
what do you think
the lady at the spa recommended the second one
fruit body facial
a double-exfoliating facial for the entire body leaving the skin feeling silky smooth and shining
ideal before a wedding or a special occasion that's just right for that backless dress
you are first exfoliated with crushed californian grape seeds followed by a light misting with an orange blossom aromatherapy oil
after a brief shower
you'll enjoy an all-over message with a facial quality message lotion
then it's your choice of either an invigorating peppermint glycolic or a calming aloe vera/grapefruit finishing skin treatment
benefits
skin feels rejuvenated and healthy
circulation is stimulated and the skin has a healthy glow
time
0 minutes pacific paradise body scrub
massage
pineapple papaya lotion is the moisturizer and california grape seeds
nature's anti-oxidant
are the exfoliant in this 0
0 minute body scrub
you'll feel like island royalty as warm coconut kuki oil is used as the lotion during a 0-minute message that completes the treatment
benefits
rough skin disappears as the powerful moisturizing properties of tropical oils sink deep into your skin

we tried so hard to make things better for our kids that we made them worse
for my grandchildren
i'd like better
i'd really like for them to know about hand me down clothes and homemade ice cream and leftover meatloaf sandwiches
i really would
i hope you learn humility by being humiliated
and that you learn honesty by being cheated
i hope you learn to make your own bed and mow the lawn and wash the car
and i really hope nobody gives you a brand new car when you are sixteen
it will be good if at least one time you can see puppies born and your old dog put to sleep
i hope you get a black eye fighting for something you believe in
i hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger brother
and it's all right if you have to draw a line down the middle of the room
but when he wants to crawl under the covers with you because he's scared
i hope you let him
when you want to see a movie and your little brother wants to tag along
i hope you'll let him
i hope you have to walk uphill to school with your friends and that you live in a town where you can do it safely
on rainy days when you have to catch a ride
i hope you don't ask your driver to drop you two blocks away so you won't be seen riding with someone as uncool as your mom
if you want a slingshot
i hope your dad teaches you how to make one instead of buying one
i hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read books
when you learn to use computers
i hope you also learn to add and subtract in your head
i hope you get teased by your friends when you have your first crush on a girl
and when you talk back to your mother that you learn what ivory soap tastes like
may you skin your knee climbing a mountain
burn you hand on a stove and stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole
i don't care if you try a beer once
but i hope you don't like it
and if a friend offers you dope or a joint
i hope you realize he is not your friend
i sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your grandpa and go fishing with your uncle
may you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy during the holidays
i hope your mother punishes you when you throw a baseball through you neighbor's window and that she hugs you and kisses you at christmas time when you give her a plaster mold of your hand
these things i wish for you through tough times and disappointment
hard work and happiness
to me
its the only way to appreciate life
send this to all of your friends who mean the most to you
we secure our friends not by accepting favors but by doing them

much scarier than pina colodas i assure you

worldly men swarming the beaches with even cuter dogs
i spent a large part of the weekend with my tongue hanging out
it forced me to the realization that the men in houston
and much of texas
are soft

no exciting stories though

hey lisa
hope you had an absolutely incredible honeymoon
i'm sure it was a blast
the reason i'm writing
actually
is because i left something at the church the night of the wedding
i thought it had been taken to the country club but the wedding co-ordinators didn't have it
basically
it was a white plastic bag with a little kids t-shirt and a little girls shorts
tank top outfit
along with a little hand painted picture
i bought the clothes in the caymans for my niece and nephew
so ideally i like to track them down
i was hoping you could tell me who i should contact about items left in the bridesmaid's room in the church
i think the bag said the wharf on the outside if that helps at all

hey girls
just wanted to let you guys know that southwest has vacation specials to new mexico right now
i priced up a 0 day
0 night trip with air/hotel/car to albuquerque
we'd have to drive to sante fe
not bad
i've done it
and it came out to about $0 a person
personally
i think this is a really good price
i was just wondering if there was genuine interest in taking this trip and if so what the best time would be to go
we could also check on getting flights from la for kasey and jen
anyway
drop me a line when you guys get a chance and let me know if i need to keep doing more research
i was figuring we could leave in a thursday and come back on a sunday
talk to you soon
sue p.s
katy
my friend julie's email address is julieg@qualcomm.com
i'm sure she'd be happy to answer questions
check out the southwest website if you get a chance
it's got all the data
i'm going for lowest cost on this sucker if we go
so i may have to forego the fancy hotel in favor of whatever's part of the package
that way i can spend more on food and drinks
we can definitely look into a mother/daughter trip

what's the scoop golf-pro
are you in for tonight
fyi
the weather is gorgeous outside
i hate forwards
but i do like champagne
i think there's probably a lot of truth to the eric theory
the retaliation/numbing afforded by using people and tossing them aside can be tempting
my mini-rampage after ted was totally based upon treating any representative of ted's sex like dirt
fortunately
my behavior was very short-lived and i completely recognized what i was doing
i wouldn't worry about the lecturing
it happens when one has a bit to drink
that or just utter flapping as in my case
thanks for the compliments
but i find it's easy to be around all of your friends
that whole like attracts like thing
as for the email from clint
he's a cutie
speaking from experience i'd watch myself if i were you though
the flirtation is fun and harmless at this point
but i get the impression that you're just clint's type and unless you have reciprocal interest i would just guard against things getting to be too flirtatious
however
if there's part of you that is curious
like i said
i think he's a great guy
okay
enough of my lecturing
i've just been caught in a couple of situations at work where someone decides to confess their feelings to me and i'm forced to tell them i just don't feel the same way
something that's hard for them to grasp given the fact that some flirting at some point did owell
i'm off to vegas this weekend
my guess is i won't be getting much sleep
oh well
life is tough

i think it's probably a good idea not to contact eric for a while
truly what purpose would it serve
as for my work situations
they aren't that exciting but have made for some highly uncomfortable moments for me
i'll tell you about them on my next visit
see
i've already come up with a reason why i have to come back out there
please don't worry about flapping sat night
i certainly do not think less of you and completely agree about the life lessons part
to tell the truth
i worry at times that i'm not learning enough of the life lessons
just kind of staying in a very safe
secure place and missing out on a big part of the overall picture
enough self-analysis
have a good evening
you should his jazz night at epizote just for me

sorry we didn't get much of a chance to chat last night
but i hope you had fun at steak night
it's too bad you didn't make it to sierra's
you could have seen a true dancing display by yours truly

if everyone wants to meet at ale house for a drink today why don't we try right after work
susan had a very big night last night and needs to be in bed early tonight as a result
i can't wait to hear about the honeymoon either
the email was titled
nothing bad
so you wouldn't immediately trash it for fear i was dispensing some more of susan's homespun wisdom
i know you can't get enough of that stuff
as for the revenue generation
i've heard what a boon the ag group has been to egm
from what i understand you guys are carrying the rest of that company on your backs
keep up the good work
and yes
the world you live in does revolve around you ted
it's just that no one else lives in that world besides you so it stands to reason that would be the case
your welcome for the email
i really am happy for you that things seem to be going well and that you appear to be enjoying what you're doing
i haven't heard any of the
when i grow up i want to be a
comments out of you in a while
a sure sign of contentment and maturity
okay burgeoning maturity
in regards to trading
i am absolutely loving it
i've been on eol for a little over a month now
although my trades go into one of the other trader's books for the time being
i should get my own in a couple months
and am really enjoying the new life/perks this job allows
case in point
took my mom to see hakeem's last game with the rockets on one of the brokers
center court seats
she was thrilled
and am off to vegas this weekend to
meet
with some of the power traders from portland
so much for the 0-0 hour days i was dealing with for a year or so there
given present circumstances it was all worth it
no need to
let me of the hook
for my candor last night
i meant everything i said and i wanted you to hear those things
in a quest to be an oh so witty smart-ass
sometimes i forget to just tell people what i think/feel
always catches up to me in hind-sight and if the opportunity presents itself for me to rectify that then i don't believe in passing it up
contrary to what you may think
i'm a big girl who thinks for herself and always acts on her own volition
and i think i either mumbled last night or your hearing is starting to go in your old age
but i said
clod
not
god
subtle but important difference
shorty
you missed an impressive dancing display at sierra's last night
i think i may have frightened some people
like i said
i'm in

hey there
bummer about next weekend
although i'm not even positive i'm going so the frustration may be for naught
as far as the wedding thing goes
thanks for the offer but i wouldn't worry about it
i think i have a wedding in houston that weekend anyway
i'll talk to jen about coming up the weekend of the 0th so maybe jessica
jen
you
me
my friend corey could all get together
i've been needing a good austin fix
the trip to san diego was awesome
we ended up blowing off most of the plans we made so we could just hang out at the beach
drink wine
and eat cheese and crackers
oh yeah
and watch the sun set
i did find time to go to a spa and get a bodyscrub/massage which was amazing
i'm off again this weekend so i have to go through the whole packing routine again tonight

i'm sure she knows you're cc'd her on the email
she wants you to witness the flirtation
she told me about the exchange last night and was wondering how he got your email address
i told her i sent it to him
she said
i didn't think you knew his last name
to which i responded
i didn't
but i called you and got it remember
i thought i told you i was emailing him to give him emily's email address
i'd promised him at kenneally's that i'd send it when i got the chance
lisa was none to pleased with me
she wants you to have nothing to do with him
but i told her she has to share the wealth and quite being such a boy hog
i promised her we'd find her a new boy toy closer to home
speaking of which
she and mitch had the
let's just be friends talk
last week
which i think was the right move
glad you got some good sleep last night

okay
so i'd really like to make a trip up there this weekend
i haven't spent a weekend in houston during april and can't imagine why i wouldn't just make the month a clean sweep
anyway
i know you're unbelievably busy right now and spending an entire weekend with me would not help you in the least
so
here's my suggestion
i could either come up friday night and we could do a late dinner
say 0:0-0:0
and then find someplace to hang out for a while or just rent a movie
on saturday we could get up
work out
grab something for brunch/lunch and maybe even go to barton springs
depending on the weather
and then i could take off and leave you the rest of saturday and all of sunday to work
we could even skip the barton springs piece
the other option is to just shift everything a day forward
i'd come up on saturday and leave sunday
either give me a call or email me if either of these sound good to you
i will also completely understand if you just really need to work/study this weekend
sue ps
i'm dying for someone to chat with about vegas
can't really talk to my roommate since it was work related
hey girls
i hate this
but i may be out thursday
please still let me know where you guys are going to be and if anything changes i'll meet you there
otherwise
have a great time and to both lisa and jen
i need to see you guys and hear all about the honeymoon and the proposal
both are very good things and i love good things

i've got deborah vest's wedding next weekend so that's a no go
but i was thinking about coming up the weekend of the 0th so maybe that will work
i would actually love to skip out on the wedding
however
since the wedding's in houston and i live here
i don't have a very good excuse do i
and don't worry
we could wait two years and i'd still want to chat about vegas
one of those things you'll never really forget
i'm sure i sounded funny and i was definitely tired

what may be an option is me taking part or all of monday off and just heading to austin sunday and coming back monday
i'll talk to my trader about the possibility

i was walking with the trader i work for when you called
so it was obviously a little difficult for me to discuss vegas at the time
if you get a hankering to talk in the morning you can try me on my cell phone
midnight
0 am isn't too late for me
which i think is between 0-0 am your time
right
i know this is obnoxious
but i can't talk to lisa about this and i need a co-conspirator
sue
that's okay
i'm used to it at this point thanks
are you still alive
i'm just checking b/c i haven't heard a peep out of you in a while
drop me a line and let me know what's up
what happened to you last wednesday
were you too pooped after you soccer game for a cold brew
hope you had a good weekend anyway and that things are in general are going well
i just dropped the earl a line to see if he's still breathing
i'll let you know if i hear anything back
just heard from the earl
he said he's okay but has just been really busy the last few weeks
i encourage you to drop him another line sometime in the near future and suggest lunch
as he seems receptive to interaction at this point
as for last wednesday
we had actually moved on to steak night by 0:0 and then were off to sierra's
needless to say it was a big night
glad to hear the game was good and i'm not suprised in the least that you have
get-up-and-go
i've seen you when an attractive woman passes by
i'm a no go for thursday as i've actually already made dinner plans with a friend
besides
dean's is the ex's favorite thursday night hang-out for the reason you mentioned and for that same reason it sadly is not mine
i'm sure after this response ben will be convinced i'm avoiding him
but i assure you that is not the case
cheers i should be in town this weekend if anything is going on

now here's the stooping part
do you know what time your neighbor is heading home
disregard the last bit of the previous email
i tracked down a ride

could you drop me a line at your earliest convenience and let me know if it will be possible for me to obtain a space

susan m
scott
i think there was a problem when i tried to send this before
so here it comes again
looks like the curve was marked around 0.0 for jun/sept
but you'll have to talk to keith holst to get an absolute price
george
you'll be taking the may'0 options out of the file today
monday
and adjusting the p&l to reflect the may option value
stop by if you have any questions
susan
i believe this message was intended for the other susan scott
i'm with nat gas trading
thank you
sure
i probably won't be able to come by until after lunch though
susan
here you go
if you pull the curves up under pub names you should be able to tell if the have any omicrons attached to them on the erms side
if the do
then you have to talk to nilay basu to make sure they are mapped on the germs side
if they don't
then you'll have to attach an omicron and then speak with nilay
i can swing by later if you'd like me to explain in a little more detail
susan
i'll stop by while making my rounds this afternoon
and
you'll have to get someone else to tell the stories
i don't remember much of friday night and
as a result
susan had a
come to jesus
meeting with herself this weekend
may be the last of the truly good stories involving me for a while
no problem
i've been good
just busy with the new job
all of the sudden i actually have time to do things so i spent the last weekend just trying to get my life re-organized
not a very exciting weekend
but extremely necessary
what's up with you
ditto
yes
that time works fine for me
i was wondering what happened to you
i had emailed you after you left the message in houston and never heard another peep out of you
hope things are going well and i'll talk to you around 0ish
this is for the other susan scott
i sit on 0
thanks
no problem
it makes me feel important
hey julie
i just wanted to check up on you and see how the trip to new york went
las vegas was way too much fun
so much so it's quite possible i did permanent damage
i managed to stay in town this weekend though and catch up on some much needed sleep and organizing
hope everything's good with you and i'll talk to you soon
susan
any chance either or both of you could get together this week for coffee
dinner
ice cream
etc
also
are you all going to deborah's wedding
talk to you soon
sue
adriane
thank you so much for helping me out friday night
just one of those things
you think you're doing great and the next thing you know you feel like you've slammed into a brick wall at 0 mph
i have now barred myself from any sort of contest with bass
they always turn ugly
and have instituted a personal limit for myself
hopefully
i'll find the maturity that was missing during our gathering at teala's and will be able to stick to the new limit
thanks again
susan

you've got the wrong susan scott
you might try sscott0@enron.com
that's the address i use to forward things to her and it seems to be workthanks

i should be
talk to you then
hey paul
jay's already left for the day so you'll probably have to get with him first thing tomorrow morning to get his bid
i'll be sure to let him know about the deal if he calls to check in today or first thing tomorrow morning if i don't talk to him before then
thanks
susan
yes
hey em
hope the parental visit is going well and that you haven't lost your mind yet
i just wanted to drop you a line to share with you my latest little upset
aside from getting physically ill at teala's friday night
it was ugly
nick emailed yesterday and said he wanted to call and catch up
when he finally did call i knew within the first minute why he felt the need to call
the engagement is off
they evidently decided to postpone about two weeks ago and the final blow came friday night
to top everything off
he's moving back to houston in three weeks
ughh
obviously
given my last conversation with him in london
i'm a little concerned
oh well
who wants a non-stressful existence anyway
ta for now
sue
finally met ashley mace's man saturday
ran into them at the cd store
he's seems nice
but not at all what i would've expected and/or pictured
it was strange to finally have a face to put with the image i'd conjured up
ciao
i would definitely be up for tonight and a walk sounds great
i just need to swing by the grocery store and the dry cleaners after work
so 0'ish is probably best for me
let me know if that works for you and also where you'd like to meet/walk
lisa
if there's a good place around your duplex i'd love to come see it and show you the pictures i took from your wedding
there's a great one of you and brad dancing at the reception
anyway
drop me a line and we'll figure out when and where to meet
sue
would love to get together again sometime
but i'll think i'll let someone else take over as far as the shot contests go
i was the champ
though ultimately of what i'm not sure
frightening as it is i felt fine on saturday
however from what i've heard that wasn't exactly the case with bass
thanks again
susan
you'll probably be receiving words of gratitude from me for a while to come
that's great
i look forward to the day
by the way
are you coming in town this weekend for deborah's wedding
sue
you're not slow at all
you just have to figure out which region they're in and ask the appropriate trader which gas daily volatility they'd like to use
congrats on
the move
o'neal told me the good news
they should if they are dealing with transport
gas daily options
etc
which are effected by the omicrons
i would typically go to the leads of the respective regions
tell them which curves are unmapped and let them decide what omicron curve to use
a lot of times they just asked the trader in charge of that point which curve to use
if the leads don't know what the omicron curves are the company's in trouble
lupe
i found a couple of checks that were for expense reimbursements
they are past the 0 day period
what can i do to have these checks reissued
thanks
susan scott
this is the engineer you wanted me to give a shot
let's bear in mind our initial meeting was before christmas and i've never agreed to meet him
yet he still persist
i can only hope i'm not the only one he's showering with attention
hey guys
thought i'd drop you a line and catch up on life
if i'm not mistaken you're actually in australia right now doing all kinds of fun and active things
so you probably won't get this for a few days
i can't tell you how glad i am that you've had a chance to take advantage of all the travel possibilities on that side of the world
and not just a little jealous
i think all of these experiences are going to leave you with some incredible memories of your time in south korea
as for myself
this weekend will mark only the second in the last month and a half or so that i will be spending in houston
i figured by now i'd be traveled out but i can't get enough
the caymans were incredible
we ate at great restaurants
not bed unfortunately
but i did see it
got to go scuba diving off the east end and swam with a slew of stingrays
actually
i was holding onto/bonding with one of the stingrays
just floating with the current
for about 0 minutes until i had to gently shove it off and swim back into safe proximity of the boat
it was a completely surreal experience
plus
the trip solidified my appreciation and fondness for the new job
and more specifically the new co-workers
which is never a bad thing
speaking of the new job
things are going well
i still have a ton to learn but i have a feeling that will be the case for a long time to come
there is just an overwhelming amount of information
not to mention strategies and nuances to learn about gas trading as a whole and in particular the western region of the us
i've been actively trading for well over a month now and am getting to know all the players in my market as well as gaining confidence with each additional trade
so far so good though
i'm definitely glad i made the choice to stay in houston and take on this role
i had a pledge sister's wedding in san antonio a few weeks ago
which was fun
and another
sister's
wedding this weekend here in houston
i tell you
it's out-of-control with all of my friend's weddings
engagements
two weekends ago i got hit with 0
yes you heard correctly 0
new engagements of close friends
i am very rapidly becoming out-numbered on this front
still
the only thing that crosses my mind each time i hear of a new one
aside from being thrilled for the happy couple of course
is that i am a ways off from such an endeavor myself
i just have the feeling i've got a lot of changing to do in the next year or two
or more
and am not sure that what i'd want now is what i'll want then
okay
change of subject
getting to deep
two weekends ago i went with a few of the traders from the desk to las vegas
we went to meet some of our power traders from portland to discuss west energy issues and to try and squeeze in a little fun
fortunately or unfortunately
depending on how you look at it
i think we managed to squeeze in more than a little fun
i think my earliest arrival back at the hotel room that weekend was around 0:0 am
i don't know if it's the oxygen they constantly pump into the clubs and casinos or the steady flow of free drinks
but you really do lose all track of time there
i feel certain any duration longer that a weekend would either kill me or force me to take another vacation just to recover
i managed to walk away only $0 bucks in the hole so all in all i was feeling pretty good
what the future holds
i'm planning a trip to london in early june to visit emily and then she comes back to houston for about a month
so i'm really looking forward to that
and
i'm still trying to figure out when i'm going to come visit you guys
i was thinking august
given your trip to hawaii in july and my trip to london in june
so let me know your thoughts
september is also an option if that works better for you
i think i'll try to take 0 or 0 work days off so that we could travel while i'm over there if we wanted to and so we'd have two weekends
anyway
it's obviously still in the incubation phase
hope the trip was a rousing success and i'll talk to you soon
sue
my new cell # is 0-0-0
i'd love to indulge you all with a repeat performance but i fear alas my liver would go on strike
and from what i understand the liver is a fairly vital organ
my stomach already expressed it's frustration with my behavior last friday
despite all of this i still look forward to engaging in engrossing and coherent conversation with those of you who decide to show tonight
susan by the way
do we have a particular time in mind
i'm sure you don't want me to remind you in detail of your own birthday experience
europa
the shrubs across the street
and it wasn't 0 hours
more like an hour to an hour and a half
besides
i think bass spent a little more time than myself praying to the porcelain god
at least i had the good sense to just pass out when i got home
oh
it's on
alright guys
you have to know we're kidding
i don't think either of us are going to be wagging that war again any time soon
bass isn't even going to be there
hey
just remembered that cory morrow is playing at the firehouse friday night and owen temple is going to be at the mucky duck
if you have any interest in doing something friday let me know
maybe we could grab dinner and go see one of these guys play
i figure you'll be shopping and jaunting around town all day saturday with mom
and sunday is mother's day
so friday seems like the best day to get together
either email me when you get a chance or just give me a call sometime this week and let me know if any of this sounds good to you
susan
sorry i didn't return your call last week
i actually didn't check my voice mail until friday after work and thus saw little point in calling back as you were probably in some remote area of pristine
scenic beauty by that time
hope the camping trip was a rousing success and allowed you to reconnect with your old friends and old self
i am in desperate need of natural beauty and negligible pollution but have alas been trapped in houston the past couple of weekends
i see a road trip in the not too distant future for myself
if only to get a way for a while
susan
okay
you asked for it
the mind i love must have wild places
a tangled orchard where dark damsons drop in the heavy grass
an overgrown little wood
the chance of a snake or two
a pool that nobody's fathomed the depth of
and paths threaded with flowers planted by the mind
i absolutely love this quote
it manages to state
significantly more eloquently than myself
my own personal mantra of the last few years
i want to be pleasantly surprised
which is ultimately why i don't see it within my power in the near future to settle
maybe years down the road when desperation has set in i'll break down and throw myself at some sub-par individual
but let's hope it never gets to that point or if it does that i'm bordering on senile and just don't know any better
anyway
i'm so glad we got to spend so much time together at deborah's wedding and i love hanging out with you mom and becka
sp
they crack me up
if there's anything i can do to assist you with this wedding
let me know
even if you just need someone to run errands with or support your ideas
i'd love to get together sometime this week for a drink
coffee
dinner
or whatever if you have any free time
maybe lisa would be available as well
talk to you soon
sue
em
glad you had such a good time
sounds like norm may have even had a little bit of fun
anyway
must agree on the ex-fianc
front
i am understandably nervous about said individual's return to houston
have to agree on the german beer/food front as well
i loved everything about that country while i was there
especially the people
they were all so jolly and round
talk to you soon
sue had another pledge sister's wedding this weekend
deborah vest
and it was beautiful of course
happened to run into doug george
a.k.a big ken
and he said to say
hello
he's living in austin these days and is planning on going to grad school in a year and a half or so
though hasn't applied yet
he said he saw t.l
recently in dallas and taylor has gained about 0 lbs
gone off his rocker
and is dating a girl who used to have purple hair
all sufficiently disturbing news
anyway
maybe we'll be able to get in touch with doug if we end up going to austin while you're in town
airfareplanet.com supposedly has flights around $0 at the end of the month
may be worth checking out
i keep trying to msngr you at lisaenron and it say you're not available
are you not signed in or do i have the wrong address
are you using aol or msn msngr
don't know what you think
but duncan sheik is playing at the mucky duck tomorrow night
thurs could work for me too
we'll see
what do i need to do to get the vcr fixed
i need to rent movies
no problem
i'll give you a buzz if they show up at my desk
please call
will be leaving in about 0-0 mins
so disregard phone message and call around 0:0 your time
i believe this was intended for the other susan scott
i'm with nat gas trading
thanks
i think it's supposed to start around 0:0 and the tickets are either $0 or $0
any interest
i don't know about the seating
do you have ncl tonight
i can't remember if it's monday or tuesday
anyway
if we got there early enough
say 0:0 or 0:0
i bet we could find somewhere to sit
is that something you'd be able to do
duncan comes on at 0:0 and the tickets are $0
not for me
i'm probably heading out of here in a few minutes
so call me on my cell phone
katy said she was up for going tonight too
i think she's going to come over to my apartment around 0 or so
talk to you soon
sue
i just checked some of the air fare sights and there are flights available for around what i paid for mine
not sure what i'm going to do regarding the roomie
really will have to tell her soon
i'll be thinking
let me know if you come up with anything
drop me a line and let me know when you think you'll be getting in on friday
also
did you have any interest in doing something friday or saturday night
sorry i was in such a funk last night
i'm not really sure why but i assume it will pass soon
anyway
got an email from emily this morning and she said another trip should be planned to go over in sept/oct when the airfares are dirt cheap
i'm guessing i'll probably be up for going again by that time if you don't mind waiting that long
my guess is we could get tickets for somewhere around $0 or $0
i think i found a flight for june
probably the 0th
0th
but i'm going to end up spending somewhere around $0
let me know what you think
sue
see
eventually
may go to the museum after work
but it closes at 0:0 so won't be back any later than 0:0 or so
nothing
just want to reflect
british airways
iah to london gatwick
coucil travel youth fare
as usual alan
i am left somewhat disturbed by your words
and by the way
do you ever return phone calls
as for the rest of you guys
i anxiously await our impending reunion in cap city
glad to hear everyone seems to be doing okay
with the exception of emily who appears to be suffering from a severe case of spring fever
jon jon
went to an astros game a couple weeks ago and saw your name on the scoreboard
it made me feel special
the trader i work with
who was there with me
is a huge baseball fan and upon hearing i went to school with you has insisted upon checking your stats regularly
seems you're not doing to shabby
congrats
life for me is pretty good
although i'm in desperate need of a deep
drunken conversation regarding life and all it's complexities
i expect everyone to contribute to said discussion when we convene
i'm sure i'm not the only one
but things just seem to be getting less certain the older i get
don't want to get to heavy now
so i'll saw the really bleak stuff for austin
ciao
sue
still working on it
have to talk about the apartment and leases tonight
talk about bad news bears
i may cruise over to this place later with my work friend monique
would you have any interest in going
regardless
i'd still like to get together for dinner or a drink after work
drop me a line and let me know if you're still up for doing something
sue dan electro's guitar bar the bluesy music at this six-string bar has drawn celebrities and scenesters for years
bar/club profile the scene the bar's large courtyard
canopied entirely by trees
makes outdoor conversation pleasant even on houston's sultry summer nights
the sound patrons
real nice folks
can settle in among the guitars with $0 draft beers and enjoy an eclectic sampling of music
from blues to alternative country
rock to folk
electro-fying blues thursday night's blues jam has been going on for more than 0 years and shows no signs of letting up
especially since it draws the likes of greg allman and richard gere
if you're really lucky
you might even catch jim
the owner
wailing away onstage on one of his own danelectro guitars
melanie haupt
looks like the festivities start around 0:0 or so
which is probably when i'll get there
i will of course have the cell phone in tow if you just want to call after your dinner
maybe tonight will actually work and we can get a much needed live music fix
well
i think i managed to adequately disturb her yesterday
not only did i go to the menil collection by myself
can you imagine
i also went to berryhill and ate dinner solo
when i got back to the apartment she said i should've called and she would've met me for eats
my immediate response
actually
i needed some solo time
subject closed
as for the lease
brought up the subject and it went pretty much no where
discovered we could sign a year lease and if she decides to up and go i can move into a one bedroom if i give the complex 0 days notice
which is what i'm figuring we'll end up doing
i also told her that i got my airplane ticket through council travel on british airways leaving the 0th and returning the 0th
via email yesterday
and she didn't mention it last night
who knows
i'm not going to mention it anymore
it's up to her
and ditto on the witty repartee
going to hear some live music tonight at dan electro's blues jam in the heights
excited to try something different
however
i am ditching kates
lis
and laura j
so mums the word
just don't feel like having a dinner filled with cotton candy chat
i think this was intended for the other susan scott
thanks
yes
except i'm sure it will take six more months before they have all of the information changed in the system
hey there
just wanted to check and see what your plan is for this weekend
shoot me an email if you get the chance and let me know when you're going to be driving into houston
talk to you soon
sue
that sounds good
don't push yourself to do too much
you need to take it as easy as you can until all of your internships start this summer because you know they're going to be tiring
plus
you'll be busy introducing me to all of the cute single guys you'll be working with
talk about exhausting
i'll either chat with you tonight or tomorrow and we can figure out what
if anything
we want to do
personally
just going a having a good meal coupled with good conversation sounds great to me
nothing big
perfect
katy also just called to let me know that john conalee is playing at the tin hall tomorrow night
so that of course is another option
there's a song both you and mary are currently playing with the following lyrics
and now i know for the first time too
all of the ways i've been lying to you
it's not that i don't think we can't open up in time
it's just that i'm afraid of what we'll find
could you enlighten me as to the artist's name
i keep forgetting to write it down
thanks
susan scott
i am genuinely flattered that you are asking for my reading recommendations
not to mention being associated in any way
shape or form with sam
how is sam by the way
truth be told
however
of late much of my reading material has been natural gas related and although the industry is riveting
i'm not sure that is exactly the kind of entertainment you had in mind
however
i did read a book a few months ago that you might find rather interesting
the title is the professor and the madman
a tale of murder
insanity
and the making of the oxford english dictionary
i know it may sound a little dry at first glance
but i actually found it extremely interesting
if you go to amazon.com there are reviews on all of the books i've included here
there are also a couple of other books i'm in the process of reading right now
galileo's daughter
a historical memoir of science
faith
and love and eleanor of aquitaine
a life
the galileo book is a little slow to start
but has tons of interesting historical references
as does eleanor of aquitaine
if i remember correctly
you always had a bit of a fondness for history
i also read memoirs of a geisha last fall and couldn't put it down
although i have talked to others who didn't find it as enjoyable
personally
i was completely intrigued by the time period and uniqueness of eastern culture
and the author was meticulous when it came to research for the book
hope this helps you out a bit
as for the
peacers
comment
definitely think we are tested
but i think the tests are there to force us to recognize our own strength and endurance
contrary to god not knowing anything about us
i'm convinced he knows everything about us and has the unique ability to know when we've lost sight of our talents
character and/or zest for life
it is at these moments life seems to hand us the upsets right
but
in dealing with the upsets we come to a better understanding of who we are and what we have to offer the world
or on a much smaller scale
what we have to offer the people around us for whom we care the most
sorry
i know i'm getting excessively deep
but i've been doing a heck of a lot of thinking lately
and much of it at church
disappointed you won't be able to join the gang in austin over the fourth
but we'll be sure to raise our glasses in a toast to you
and
i'll keep looking for you name on the enron field scoreboard
later
susan
was just about to write the check
i'll save it for you
trying to call right now
are you surfing
well
i would certainly be up for a little travel
the following locations looked interesting to me
biarritz
dinard
carcassone
perpignan
st
etienne or nimes in france
cork
kerry
shannon
or knock in ireland
brussels in belgium
turin
pisa
trieste
venice
pescara in italy
and
alghero
however
i'm going home tonight to look in my guide book at all of these places so i'll send you another revised email tomorrow
get back to me when you can and let me know if you have any strong opinions one way or the other
obviously
i'm pretty flexible
sue
hey paul
i'm so glad you emailed
my parents were just asking me what you were up to this past sunday
now i'll have something to report to them
it's good to hear that things are going so well for you and i must say i'm a tad envious you're getting to do so many things you've always wanted to this summer
i'm still trying to figure out exactly what those things are
we will most certainly have to get together next week while you're in town
i may be going to austin for part of the long weekend
but i doubt i'll go before saturday so thursday and friday are definite possibilities
happy to hear about your brother and josh's impending marriages and can't wait to find out what school will next be graced with the presence of paul thomas
talk to you soon
susan ps
alan
you'll have to come out with us now
no more hiding
hey
good to hear from you
can't say i have too much scoop on reliant
although
i do know a couple of people who work and have worked there and i'd be happy to put you into contact with them if you'd like
i'd love to get together while you're in town
tomorrow night's probably best for me so either give me a call at work or on my cell phone when you get a chance
ciao
sue
i've got an opinion now
i think we should fly into brescia
italy
we could fly in and cab it to brenzone
it's on one of those amazing lakes in northern italy
lago di garda
you can go to gardaworld.com and then just click on photo gallery and brenzone to see what it looks like
absolutely amazing
it would be a fantastic trip in my opinion
lots of great wine
plus
you can be the exchange rate from pounds or dollars to lire
i know
i know
she booked the flight right after we all got off the phone
the final blow
her ticket was about $0 bucks less than mine
continental is evil
oh and by the way
i think she may be on your flight back to h-town on the 0th
maybe you can switch your seats to be next to each other
regardless
still think it's going to be fun and the economics definitely improve with more people
she does want to visit with some of the enron people so get ready for a cat fight over precious little niklaus
i figure at least one of the days she's gonna want to see work people so we'll just get some market shopping in then
and don't forget we'll have to escape to discuss my last escapade
anyway
like i said
still thinks it's going to be a good trip
let me know what you think about the italy trip after you have a chance to look
lisa and i have both been to salzburg
but i don't think either of are opposed to going back
the town is adorable and there are scenic vistas
not to mention sausage and beer
ciao
sue
didn't you know
i hold the title of ms
cheyenne
paul
got your message last night and since both nights work for lisa and myself we figured we'd leave the decision up to the more finicky alan
so alan
it's all up to you
will it be thursday or friday
if you're looking for a preference from lisa or myself i think we would both be leaning more towards thursday
so just shoot us all back an email and let us know when
can't wait to catch up with you paul
see ya this week
susan
paul
i got the message you left yesterday about the 0,0 of watkins gas from patina
i will be sure to pass that along to jay et al
susan
hope the presentation was a rousing success
for future reference i would highly recommend calling me on my cell phone
0-0-0
instead of the apartment phone
lisa always answers that phone
in fact
she usually doesn't even give me a chance if she's there
who on earth would be calling me
we'll keep working on the
trip
i'm sure something wonderful will come up and it will be a fantastic endeavor
sue
trading'em up old chap
jay was out friday
yesterday and is still out today so the eastern rockies are all under my command
it's been a bit on the chaotic side the last two days so i've really just been trying to maintain sanity
as always
it is a pleasure to hear from you and i would love to gather sometime and flex the brain muscle on something other than bid/offer and spreads
ciao
susan
ok folks
thursday it is
my only questions are
do we want to do dinner
and if so
what time
if no dinner then we can just pick someplace relatively low key to hang out and chat
sorry paul
no downtown clubbing for you
susan
no plans
where were you last night
haven't decided yet
although i'd like to do dinner
any suggestions
thanks
if you don't mind creating the nc deal that would be great
either that or fax the details over and we'll do it here
thanks
do you remember what the deal is with wr gathering
are the deals with england and ejw over at the end of may
that could work
they do have food and it's not horribly crowded on thursdays
ok kids
lisa has made the excellent suggestion of black lab for food and drinks tomorrow
so how does 0:0-0:0 sound to everyone
i think this link will take you to the appropriate map
if it doesn't work just go to houstoncitysearch.com and look up black lab
it will take you to a map
see you then

i get into london on the 0th of june and fly out on the 0th
please let me know if you're going to be in town during that time
i really want to try and get together while i'm there
i may be going elsewhere the 0th thru the 0th
my friend
emily
wants to take a little trip somewhere
but i will definitely be in town saturday night through monday
let me know
i was very excited to hear about caycie too
susan
so are you in
hey corey
i'm thinking about driving to austin this weekend to see kathy
travis's new house as well as the two of them and the kids
just wanted to see what you were going to be up to and if you might want to get together
i know you still have to work at the law review
but i figure you won't be there 0 hrs
a day
course i could be wrong
talk to you soon
sue
think i may head up to austin sat-sun but i'll be probably be here sunday night and will definitely be here monday
did you know luke olsen is playing at blanco's tonight
what are you doing this weekend
sue
my bad
it's not luke
i just called and i think they said the hollisters
anyway
the radney foster gig is extremely tempting but i really need to see my sister and the kids
depending on what corey has to say though
i may just go to austin sunday and monday
we'll see
give me a buzz or drop a line if you want to get together
sue
matty already left work
but i'll be sure to pass the message along
i'll work on the jaunt and will do on the limeade's
talk to you tomorrow
wow
i must say this was the last thing i expected you to be emailing me about
i'll try and give you a call after work
around 0:0 or so
if you want to talk about it some more
just let me know
i do think it's good that you guys are at least talking about all this stuff regardless of what you decide is the right for both of you
sorry to hear about jay
that is horrible
what brings on shingles anyway
i thought it has something to do with stress
but i could be totally off
glad you like the cd
i've been listening to it non-stop
i'm totally empowered after
i'm alright
and then plunge into super-reflective mode with
wildest dreams
get on the kim richey web site and read the lyrics and you'll understand why
by the way
she's playing at stubb's on june 0th and in houston at the fabulous satellite lounge on the 0th
food for thought
as for my call
there was some news
he contacted me around 0 am or so and we chatted throughout the day
i'll tell you more about it when i call
but you're only going to be a bigger fan
that of course is the problem i'm having
talk to you soon
sue
the price should be inside ferc monthly index
the deal has been changed in the system
hi george you will want to liquidate the june exotic options today
using the valuation spreadsheet
basis pipe options 0.xls
as well as update the option p&l file to account for the june exotic option's value you calculate
you will actually roll-over the options p&l tomorrow
after you finalize the 0st's p&l
the final p&l file will include any prior month adjustments as well as broker fees
you will update the basis pipe options 0.xls when the actual published indexes come out
so that will most likely be monday
at that point you can send the file to beatrice reyna in it's final version
if you have any other questions just come by and get me and we'll go over them
susan
hi ivonne
i opened up new bank accounts recently and need to set up direct deposit for my pay checks and expense reports
could you let me know what all i need to do to have this set up
i have already filled out the form available on ehronline.com
if you could either email me with the instructions or call at ext
0 i would appreciate it
thanks
susan
thanks
what is it exactly you need help with
maybe i can answer your questions via email
i've never run that file since it was split out
but my guess is you need to add any prior month adjustments and broker fees to today's file
tomorrow you will want to roll the file over to the new month
errol should be able to help you with that
make sure you also follow the liquidation instructions for the gas daily post-id's
you can find them on that color coded sheet george has
swing by if you need anything else
susan
just called
they're going to put it on our door tonight
we just have to sign it and stick it in the night drop
you guys have fun
sadly i'll be out due to a broker dinner
i'll be sure to catch the next one
way to go
very excited for you
you will have to let me monday know how things went
yes
but we're going to have to pay a late fee
haven't tried
will do so now
i am on msngr as well

i think
also
some annoying requests
katy forgot all the minutemade frozen limeade she'd promised to bring for our eagles marg party
and the jerky from dad
suspiciously
she remembered my pocket-sized neosporin tube
but anyways
it would be fabulous if you and lisa could each cart over 0-0 tubes of the limeade wrapped in plastic
carry-on
obviously could be ugly in non-pressurized cabin in suitcase
doesn't matter if thaws
but will need approx 0-0 tubes for the festivities
plus
dad has that great turkey jerky from nb to send along
fear not
i have the turkey jerky
address
0 portland road
the postcode is w0 and the tube stop is holland park
phone #
0 0 0 0 0
this is with the country code so i'm not sure exactly what you dial in london
i know you have to knock off the 0 and possibly the 0
if you end up taking the tube you'll walk out of the tube station and take an immediate left
walk roughly two blocks and then take another right onto portland road
there will be a pizza place right on the corner
you'll walk all the way down portland road until it looks like the road ends in a cul-de-sac
the roads actually continues on the other side of a little bricked area with benches
a place called janie's wine bar will be on your immediate left
emily's flat is in the row of flats to your right and the number is on the door
which if i remember correctly is blue
see you there
sue
my mom told me about tootsie when we got home
i am so sorry
i know how much those dogs mean to you
as do most londoners based on the picture arsenal
anyway
i'm sure the funk will last for a while
but eventually you'll start to feel better
just take the long weekend to relax and recoup from the news
and doctor prodding
we'll grab a margarita next week sometime
sue
okay
i'm an idiot
i forgot to bring your email address with me to london
it's saved in my contacts list at work
and i can't check my work email from outside locations
augh
yet again
i fail
however
i had such a good time visiting i think i'm going to try to make a quick trip back over this fall when the air fares are a little cheaper
that way
i could see you and jessica and clay
i will stick your phone number in my physical address book and be a better visitor next go-round
sorry again for the oversight
also
the next trip i make will most likely be solo
my roommate in houston came with me this time
so it will be significantly easier for me to maneuver
talk to you soon
susan any luck on the roommate front
do you still want me to talk to millie
cindy
sorry no response from me
i've been out of the country
being a novice
i forgot to look at the clock exactly when i crossed
i know it was 0 mins and some odd seconds
so my best guess is 0.0 minutes hope this helps
susan scott
see
i told you you were invited
i think i must have dropped the invitation or something
let me know what you think
i'd been planning on going to the kim richey concert sat night at the fab satellite lounge
along with corey
doug
and yourself if you were interested
honestly think i'd rather go to the concert
but i would feel somewhat guilty
what are your thoughts
so did you make it in today
hope you're feeling better
wasn't sure last night if you were or weren't interested in the concert sat
night
let me know because if we decide to go i'm going to buy the tickets today
also
boone called about 0:0 last night to berate you for not returning phone calls or emails
the message is on the answering machine if you want to call the apartment and listen to it
be forewarned
there is a lot of rambling
sue
hey corey
was wondering if you and doug still had any interest in the concert sat
night
drop me a line and let me know if you want to go ahead and buy tickets
they're $0 a piece
the box office opens at 0:0 and doors open at 0:0
but the last time i went there there was a line to get in by 0:0
i would recommend showing up around 0:0 or so to make sure you get a seat inside
still trying to figure out how guilty i'd feel missing this bachelorette party
sue
none as of yet
so are you just going to let the party people know tomorrow or what
i figured from your last email you were a lock
as for myself
i'm still waiting to hear back from corey about the concert
so i don't know what i'm doing yet either
i would love to go to dinner with the crew and then transition to the concert but i don't think the times exactly work out
anything in the hopper for this evening
lisa
fyi
you already sent this email to everyone
at 0:0
i think some relaxation time is definitely in order for you
so don't worry about tomorrow
if you're in we can just try and buy tickets there
and if you're out i'll go to the bachelorette party
easy peasy
considering you start this whole ride over again on monday
i would totally understand you wanting to bail out
whatever you decide please do not worry about me
i am the epitome of flexible these days
back to reality with a vengeance
sometimes reality is no fun
i think the weekend in nb will prove beneficial for you as well so enjoy
i'm guessing i'll end up at the party despite wanting to go to that concert at the fabulous satellite lounge
i hate having a conscience
no contact with the guy
although i think he went home mid-week for a friend's wedding
regardless
though it may not sound like it
i haven't been too focused on the situation
on a another
playing with fire
note
went and grabbed a couple pints wednesday with dutch
the old boss
and ended up eating dinner with him as well
he paid
although he tricked me into letting him
said he was charging it to the company so i'd put my money away
needless to say he didn't expense it
we've always been friends so i guess one outing doesn't hurt
but any future encounters may have to include others for safety reasons
i'll see you when you get home
hi mrs
barker
sorry it's taken me so long to respond regarding the party saturday
lisa and i only got back into town a couple days ago from visiting emily in london
i had actually already purchased concert tickets for saturday night
but am currently seeing if i can find anyone willing to buy them from me
if i am successful in pawning these things off i will be present and accounted for to help kelly and the gang celebrate
i will be sure to take your number home with me and give you a call tomorrow to let you know my status either way
thanks again for everything
susan
hey sarah
nice to hear from you
i know you just talked to lisa the other day so i got a little more detailed update from her
i'm sure she told you about our trip over to london
we had a really good time which included me spending a small fortune
oh well
money's meant to be spent
right
anyway
sounds like you've got some really exciting activities to look forward to over the next 0 mos to a year
can't wait to hear all about the baby when it arrives
the first in the family is always exciting
and i know you and mike are going to have the best time jaunting around europe
i wish i was planning the same kind of trip right now
as for your future beyond that
have you been to seattle before
i'm taking a long weekend there with a friend from work and would love to hear more about things to do if you have any advice
otherwise
i'll be sure to let you know what i found on my own visit
hope things continue to go well for you and we'll have to get together when you come back to texas
sue
hey gang
i think i'm in for tomorrow
so barring a snafu
i'll see y'all at the hotel
sue
look'n sharp mr
scott
g.i
joe eat your heart out
i'm assuming this was meant for you
okay
so here's the link
once you get to the sight
click on about apb and then just for fun
once you're on the just for fun page click on derby 0 and go to the last picture on the first row
you can read the names from there
hope the first day at the new office is going well
give me a call sometime and let me know what the scoop is regarding wednesday and the baseball game
i'm anxious to hear if you talked to leslie again after the cryptic phone call on saturday
sue btw
not only no contact
but not said individual's not even logging into messenger
i think this where people tend to say
stick a fork in it
hey friend
i just got your card yesterday in the mail and am so thrilled that you've asked me to be a part of your wedding
i will try and give you a call later on today or tonight to talk in person
but i wanted to let you know asap that i will gladly participate in any way possible in the pre-wedding and wedding day activities
this really is such an exciting time in your life and i look forward to all of the festivities
love
sue ps
trish murphy is playing tomorrow night at the mucky duck if you have any interest
just got your email
i'll take a look at it after morning trading
it does sound like it would be fun
what happened to you last night
i was starting to get worried about you
also
we have one of our taster's dinners thursday night and both katy and i are planning on going
any interest
so if i can get tickets
actual seats
not standing room only
are you game for tonight
the concert starts about 0:0 so i figure we would try to get there early enough to get decent seats and possibly eat
let me know
sue sorry no call last night
i passed out cold when i got home
also
i'm dying to hear about the jonatha brooks concert
i had planned on going
but a high school friend's bachelorette party conflicted
i was really wanting to see kim richey
i'm wearing a hole in my cd
so you can only buy tickets at the mucky duck
i may go by right after work to try and get them
do you want me to just call you on your cell phone and let you know if we've got actual seats
me too
diane
i am no longer the book admin handling the trader referenced by the deal below
i have taken the liberty of forwarding this email to the individual now running the book in question
let me know if there is anything else i can do
thanks
susan scott sean
the deal which needs to be changed is highlighted and bolded in red below
susan
have you dropped off the face of the earth
give me a call or email
oh boo-hoo
cry me a river
sorry i missed tuesday
but i went to listen to live music with a friend from ut
how are things going with you
i had a great time in london and came back with some cubans for dad and a 0's platinum and diamond watch for myself
can't wait for you to see it
give me a call sometime
would like to hear what's new in your life
susan
what's up with tonight
the tasters dinner is at 0:0 at some restaurant called fire and ice
shot me an email or call when you get a chance and let me know the plan
sue
tell me more about cara
yes
but i haven't heard the updates post date
hey
i may swing by the tasters dinner just to say
hi
to everyone and then meet you at the forest club
what do you think of that
also
katy and i may go to blanco's later if you and leslie have any interest
so i've decided i will have to crash some of your happy hours and try to meet some decent boys
i'm sick of these crappy ones
sue
hey matt
just thought i'd let you know that i'm thinking about heading to new braunfels tonight to see emily
we were wondering if you might want to get together tonight
we've missed you terribly
you can shoot me and email back or just call emily at the river house
0
0-0
or me on my cell phone after 0:0
0-0-0
sue
i'm taking off right now
just talked to em and her parents are coming up tonight to stay for the weekend and work on the house
call me on my cell phone
i'll have it turned on at 0:0
yes
but i've decided my hormones are about the equivalent of a 0 yr
old boy's
we left about 0 mins after you guys and i drove him to his car
he asked if i minded him calling to ask me out wednesday or thursday of this week as he is going out of town this weekend
he said he'd tried earlier this year
to which i responded
yes
and failed miserably
we'll see
he is a cutie though
i don't know if you'll ever have a chance to look at the picture of you know who
but physically bryan puts him to shame
sue
thanks theresa
do you know if paul did a deal with ejw for july
also
do you know why the psco deal with petrogulf is in the system as 0 on the supply side
i thought the deal was for 0 w
a 0% swing capability
susan
couple other things theresa
do we have sinclair numbers for july
and
are the thermo numbers in sitara good
thanks
you are the greatest
thanks
ours is
my parents is
glad i got to see you this weekend
sue
theresa
you're gonna kill me
but i left all my t-account notes at home this morning
can you shoot me the fugg breakdown again
thanks
susan
i'll give you a call in a few
done
date
0/0/0 0:0 am re
fwd
fw
warning
alcohol
if you get this give me a call on my cell phone
it's 0:0 right now
i'm so sorry i've hurt you boone
never my intention
i had no idea you were so fragile
you hide it well
life at enron is good but things have been pretty busy the last couple weeks
i went to new braunfels last friday to visit one of lisa and my friends
actually it's the girl we visited in london
and then had a wedding to go to saturday night
no big plans for the 0th as of yet
i'm still trying to figure out where i'm going to be
could be houston
austin or georgetown
i know
i know
i'm such a jet-setter
how about yourself
planning another famous boone bbq
cooking commences at 0:0 am
right
hope you're having a nice day
still the wrong one
try sscott0@enron.com
that usually works for me
please don't send me any more compression services emails
i have nothing to do with any of the information below and should probably not even have access to it
the susan scott you're looking for does not have the middle initial m
there is no middle initial shown for her in the system
thank you
you still interested in going to the firehouse on tomorrow night
i just checked my messages at home and bryan called last night
at 0:0
i was already passed out
i know i'm an old bitty
but that is just too late to be calling a working girl when you're looking for a date wednesday or thursday night
anyway
i will give him a call this afternoon but i might suggest we just do something when he gets back from his trip
i talked to katy last night
before he'd called
and told her about the firehouse
she's definitely interested
let me know what you think
sue
thanks for all the info
susan
he's going to vegas i think
and i have no idea when we'd go over there
i'll talk to katy and see what she thinks
so i talked to bryan last night
after a few ritas and beers
supposedly we're going to do something tonight
very curious how this will all pan out
i do kind of feel
old
around him
not because he's immature or anything of that nature
but because i've been out and working for 0 yrs now and he's living at home with his parents and planning on going back to school
just feel like i'm in a very different place
of course
as usual
i'm giving this way too much thought
susan really wanted to go to the firehouse
maybe i can tell him i have to be home early and i could meet you
and katy
there later
i'm so bad
this was intended for the other susan scott
thanks
i think this was intended for the other susan scott
thanks
well
when i was there you liquated the p&l post-id everyday
so unless that's changed you will continue to do that everyday
for the last day of the month you will also want to liquidate the official post-id as well
look at the file i've attached and it will explain how to handle the gas daily book this month since the last day of the month is not a week day
the notes are in blue
let me know if you have any other questions
susan
just tried to call you at the river house
if you're online
shoot me an email when you're about to get off
jeez
i don't care how good things are between them right now
you have to respect a just the girls dinner
call me on my cell phone if you get a chance
i'm leaving the office right now
just wanted to make sure you're okay
woke up this morning and you hadn't come home
i may be heading out after morning trading to go home b/c i feel like dirt
sue
ina
is there something i need to do in regards to this email
i appears some coding information needs to be filled out for my cell phone
thanks
susan
actually
i think this may be for you
i see christi nicolay's name on the distribution as well and i usually assume emails with her name attached are intended for you
let me know if this isn't the case
thanks
susan
stopped by em's last night before coming home and she'd mentioned trying to do austin this weekend
she'd already talked to katy and it sounded like katy was interested in austin tomorrow night and then maybe gruene on saturday night
anyway
wanted to let you know and see if you had any interest
emily and katy would probably try to leave early tomorrow to stop in round top and do some antique shopping
so
if you think you could leave the office around 0:0 or so
of course earlier is always better
we could ride together and at least get on the hov lane
as it stands right now i think we're going to have stay in hotels both nights and we of course currently have no reservations
so it could get interesting
sue
hope you had fun yesterday
i was actually writing to see if you had any interest in going to austin this weekend
emily
katy
myself and possibly lisa are talking about making a trip up there tomorrow
we would be going out with some guy friends of ours so if doug wanted to come he wouldn't be completely outnumbered
also
one of katy's friends manages pat green and he's playing at gruene hall so we were thinking about trying to go see him on saturday
drop me a line and let me know if you have any interest
sue
i forgot leigh ann was going to be in town this weekend
as for this evening
i think we're still on
the movie is showing at the angelika at 0:0 or greenway 0 at 0:0
i'm assuming both of us would prefer the earlier movie
but there is something to be said for proximity
what are your thoughts
we could either take our time with dinner and then do the movie or just go to the early show and maybe grab dessert afterwards
my guess is emily would probably prefer the earlier time
since she may be taking off early tomorrow
i'm intrigued
what prompted the cooking class
if you do end up in austin tomorrow night
we'll have to try to get together
sue
it's been quite a while since we caught up on things
how are you doing these days
things here are pretty good
i went about a month ago and visited emily in london and have been busy with work
etc
hope you had a good fourth of july
susan
it happens to me pretty regularly
time
yesterday around 0:0 pm conversation
him
yo me
hey him
guess what me
what him
i'm an engaged man him
that kind of came out of nowhere huh there was about 0-0 more of conversation which we can discuss later
but needless to say i'm still reeling
so are you heading up to austin today
sue
sorry didn't check email till today
things have just been really busy the last month and i've been doing quite a bit of traveling
i'm out of town this weekend
but maybe next week
no problem
and you still need to see the yankee doodle dandy movie
very patriotic and especially poignant for an independence day baby
as for gas trading land
things are good
everyday i become a little more comfortable with the region i'm trading as well as the ins and outs of the pipeline and storage systems
sorry to hear about the ag group's demise
but i'm guessing there are some great opportunities to be had on the weather desk so congratulations are in order
as usual you have landed on your feet
what's darren going to be up to as a result of this
anyway
glad you got in some vacation time before the move and as luck would have it over your birthday
did you make it back to cali or head to your new second home
austin
i'm assuming the book you are referring to is market wizards
i haven't read it yet
but have heard much about it from some of the other traders on the desk
maybe i should give it a look
if only to see what kind of things i'll need to write about once i join that circle
attitude is key
shorty
thought you'd get a kick out of reading this
start from the bottom up
you'll have to click on the web link to see the e-card i sent ted for his b-day
as monique comically pointed out this morning
bet you never thought somebody would make ted look good
in the land of disappointing men
it's all a matter of degrees
sue
she lives
i know it's been ages since we've caught up on each other's lives
i'm anxious to hear what's happening in yours in the upcoming months
i'll have to give you a call at home some time so we can really talk
as for a visit
you know i'm always up for a trip out to the coast
i'm actually heading to seattle next weekend with a friend from work and then august is going to be filled with a trip to denver
work related
i know tough
and a visit to s
korea to see chris and chuck for a week and a half or so
i'm really excited about that trip
i think we're going to try and take a weekend jaunt somewhere like singapore
hong kong or beijing while i'm there
so given all of that
what are your thoughts on labor day weekend
it's the first weekend of september
automatic 0 day weekend for me
so i could fly in around the same time i did on my last visit that friday and leave monday afternoon
let me know if that sounds good
or if there's some other weekend you had in mind
you'll have to tell both of the eric's and clint i said
hello
i had such a great time hanging out with all of them
and your cousin too
you attract very fun and interesting people
it's a credit to your excellent company
by the way
how are things in regards to clint
still just good hang-out buddies
i'm assuming
since you didn't say anything in your email that things with brendan are still good and if so
i'm glad for you
i went shopping at stein mart recently too and found some really cute things
i absolutely love that store
and
i'm honored to be your shopping muselove
susan ps
the job's still good and i miss you too
i know
i'm a peach
ha
anyway
dinner was really good
we had spaghetti
which john cooked
garlic bread and some of the red wine i'd brought over
and
we watched crouching tiger which i loved
you were right
it is a very woman take charge film
em got the grandparent dinner changed to wednesday night
so we'll be able to get together tonight
she's supposed to give me a buzz later and let me know what she would like to do
odds are we're looking at a happy hour
followed by a nice dinner and then who knows what
talk to you later
sue
fyi
bryan called last night to see if i wanted to go out again
i think we'll probably end up going out on thursday
i don't know
we'll see how it goes
but i don't feel as excited or enthusiastic as i probably should
sue
thought you might be interested in this
last night was good
a nice
relaxed dinner suited me just right
as for a rematch
we'll see
i've got dinner with monique and jennifer
you met her downtown once i think
tonight
so maybe thursday or friday night we could do something
i'll give you a call later
julie's email address is julieg@qualcomm.com sue
i know
it's been ages since we've chatted
i will definitely give you a buzz so we can catch real time
i got clay's message and thought i'd replied
but obviously i forgot
i'm actually going out of town next weekend
which makes me so sad because it would be great to see everyone again
of course
i suppose we'll all be seeing quite a bit of each other with jen and caycie's weddings coming up
i talk to you soon
sue glad to hear things are good
even if they are hectic
did you get that katy
just kidding
i'll see you guys at the apartment
hey lis
how's married life treating you these days
i hope things are good with your job
home
etc
i was actually writing you to try and get bonnie's email address
my friend monique and i are going to seattle next week for a long weekend and i was hoping to get some tips from her as well as possibly get together for lunch or dinner
hope to see you soon and please say
hi
to everyone for me next weekend at the lake house
i'm so sad i'll be missing it
but i'd already booked my flight by the time clay sent the email
love
sue
hi bonnie
how are you doing
lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and have been stuck on crutches
which i'm guessing is no fun when you're riding public transportation
anyway
i was writing to see if you might have some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in seattle
one of my co-workers and myself are flying up thursday for a long weekend in your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers
i hope you're still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago
it looks like you may have changed jobs already
which i trust is a good thing for you
i'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to offer
there is a part of me that has always thought i'd like to live in the pacific northwest for a while
so this will be a little bit of a research trip for me
if you could start thinking of suggestions for restaurants
bars
outdoor activities
etc
that would be great
and maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink
thanks a bunch
susan
it's so nice to hear from you
actually
we're coming this weekend
we get in around 0:0 on thursday night and flight out very late on sunday
at present we have reservations at the mayflower inn
but are debating taking a trip to the san juan's
possibly overnight
do you have an opinion on that
i.e
can it be just a day trip
discovery park sounds great
we are both very interested in doing as much outdoors as possible
to that end
we were thinking about doing some kayaking if you know of any particularly good places
i really hope we get a chance to meet up while i'm in town
you may want to give me your phone number so we can contact you once we're in town
thanks again
susan
hey folks
it's harassment time
i'm trying to put together the contact list to end all contact lists
i was hoping you guys could help me out by filling in any of the info you may already have
i've attached an excel file which has plants
pipelines and storage facilities
fill in whatever you can and feel free to add anything you think should be included
just take a look at the sheet when you get a chance and let me know if you have any questions
thanks for all the help
susan
i've been wondering if you were alive
sorry i missed your call last thursday
i was in a meeting
we seem to be in meetings for several hours everyday lately
anyway
did you have the
welcome back emily party
if so i'm guessing you've been recovering for a couple of days
hope the paper
s
is/are going well
talk to you soon
sue ps
i'm in seattle this weekend
so i'll miss the friend
i actually think we have the monday off
sept
0
so
ideally i'd fly in friday evening and fly out monday afternoon
i'll email more later
but just thought i'd give you a heads up
susan
thanks bonnie
we're staying at the mayflower inn
i'll give you a call on your cell phone when we get to town
it may not be until friday though since our plane gets in late
but i'll call none the less
susan
you added sscott0
not sscott0
to the list
i'm with natural gas trading
thanks
susan m
scott
hey
if you'd like to try and get together thursday or friday let me know
i think a group is actually getting together friday night for ashlea stuart's birthday
but i'd be willing to skip it
or go if you'd like to see some people
anyway
just drop me a note when you get a chance
i could definitely use a good chat session
sue
hey theresa
are you going to be putting in the thermo volumes or would you like me too
i've decided the articles on msn are crap and you shouldn't read them anymore
but this one made me laugh
i heard someone pulled a hamstring trying to be butch w
the military workouts
as for me
the trip was fantastic
mucho shopping and even more eating
not to mention the weather was beautiful and you could actually walk everywhere you wanted to go
the plane flight back was definitely not fun
but i did survive
it reminded me of london quite a bit
although i think the weather is milder
i was actually checking out apartment sites the other day b/c i was that impressed with the place
it has a definite austin vibe
the people are extremely friendly
seem generally happy and there is lots of scenic beauty and tons of stuff to do
oh well
i'll console myself with the fact that i get to live in h-town
always lifts my spirits
sue
i know i've thoroughly enjoyed all the commentary
i can honestly say
i think this is the first time i've been invited to an aggie happy hour
and to that end
kudos to all those who opted out of sam's boat
you now may be forced to deal with a longhorn interloper
before you know it
we're gonna start outnumbering you guys
western civilization was getting old anyway
we'll create a new and improved civilization
i won't give you charlton heston
but maybe marky mark
anne
didn't know if having this would be of any help
but here it is none the less
susan
ina
i keep receiving this message and am uncertain of exactly what it is they need me to do
could you take a look at it and fill me in on what action i need to take
thanks
susan
good luck with the paper
i know how inspired you get when deadlines start approaching
so i'm sure it'll be fabulous
sorry about the pulled muscle
what exactly does that do to the marathon plans
will you be able to compete still
or are you just going to hit all the wine stops now
i think you're right about katy's move to dallas
i have a feeling she's actually going to really like being there and working
i pretty sure the folks are still helping out with living expenses
etc
so she won't have to make too big of an adjustment right off the bat
as for me
seattle could definitely be a destination but it would require a job change
enron doesn't have any offices up there
the closest office is portland and for obvious and now unavoidable reasons i don't see a move there any time soon
you are right about not being able to go wrong with a place possessing austin-like qualities
they are highly desirable
i will most certainly try to keep the september date open
it would be great to see britney and arden
we had susan e.'s bachelorette party saturday night
plus a bridal shower earlier that day
lisa hosted laura white's at the apartment the same night
i got to see and visit with jenny kenair
sp
janie pitman
rachel pack among others
very interesting
the two bachelorette parties met up at black swan for late night dancing
lis was in rare form
i knew it was bad when she ran up and started hugging me
i think she almost crushed susan and kelly
anyway
it was actually pretty fun and i've decided i really like susan's sister betsy
good sense of humor and not at all be-boppy
i did manage to trick her into doing the v-i-c-t-o-r-y cheer at black swan though
i thought it was pretty darn funny myself
she was mortified when she realized i'd got her to do a cheer
once again
best of luck banging out your opus
talk to you soon
sue if you're looking to procrastinate a little this evening you can give me a buzz on my cell
i'd try calling 0 pm or after
sorry i didn't call this weekend
but i was swamped saturday and subsequently exhausted on sunday
i basically rotated from my bed to the couch to the pool to the couch and back to bed
pitiful but much needed
anyway
i was just going to tell you to go ahead and buy the ticket for me
departing the 0th and returning the 0th
which i believe puts me into seoul wednesday night and departing on a sunday
you can either call or email if you have any questions for me
and
i'll decide where i'd like to go for the long weekend
i may pick two and just let you two decide the final destination
sue
get online
msngr
if you get a chance
i'm still at work
it all sounds pretty good
but is there any way to get on an earlier flight sunday
probably not
i know there are only a few flights out a day
but if i could get into houston closer to late afternoon on sunday it would be a better for me
i'd really like to stay that saturday night
so if worse comes to worse
i'll just deal with the jet lag
susan
sounds good
i'd rather be useless a day at work
than miss a day over there
in the grand scheme of life
great
sounds good to me
can't wait to see you guys
i believe this was intended for the other susan scott
i'm susan m
scott with nat gas trading
thanks
i believe this was intended for the other susan scott
i'm susan m
scott and work in natural gas trading
thanks
hello
long time no see
how are y'all doing these days
i'm actually writing bc i've misplaced em's phone number in london and wanted to give her a buzz
do either of you have it on hand
if so
could you please email it back to me
thanks em also mentioned something about nb in mid sept
i'd love to see y'all if you decide to meet up with her
susan
ugh
sorry i missed your call last night
i can't find your phone number either
i'll give you a call if you email it to me
otherwise
just give me a call later today
thanks anyway
i eventually tracked it down yesterday
and yes
the real world emphatically sucks
emily's got the right idea
avoid it at all costs
still
work's going all right for me
my hours have dramatically improved
which is nice
and they actually let me take time off for vacation
i'm reserving the weekend emily mentioned in september so hopefully i'll see you there
susan
i'm sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you
i would definitely enjoy the opportunity to answer any of your questions about the various opportunities within enron
i know what an overwhelming place this can be at times
i'm actually heading out of the office today for a conference in denver
but if you want to just email me some questions or pick a time that would be good for you to meet that would be great
susan scott
sorry it took me so long to respond
it's been really busy here lately
you're going to be so disappointed in us
but we never ended up kayaking
monique and i were so glad that you and luke came to meet us for drinks
it was so fun getting to talk to y'all and hear all about seattle and vancouver
the weather actually turned out to be really good so we spent a lot of time outside
the market was fantastic
we actually bought some boiled shrimp there and took in back to the hotel for a little in room picnic
we also hit
the bite
which was really neat
glad you and luke had a good time in the mountains and please let me know the next time you're in houston
it be great to see you again
thanks again for everything
susan
paul
so nice to hear from you
i hope things are going great for you as well
i'm actually going laura jahnke's wedding that same evening
otherwise
i would have loved to have gone
please tell nathan i say
hello
and wish he and his new wife the very best
so when does school start
and
how are the small businesses going
have a nice time at the wedding
susan
hey ted
do i even know this guy
or has someone yet again confused me with the other susan scott
since your one of the only names on this thing i recognize
besides margaret's
i thought i'd ask
susan
just wondering why my ice cream and bean burritos were in the frig instead of the freezer last night
you come up with some new storage methods
so what are you up to tonight
sue
for you
i know
i know
i dropped off the face of the earth for a while
i've actually been in denver all week for a natural gas convention
as for labor day weekend
i'm not sure if i'm going to be able to make it
i'm leaving for s
korea next tuesday and don't get back until the weekend before labor day weekend
so issue one is
will i have enough energy to make the trip
the other issue is a friend's wedding in park city that same weekend
i'd feel bad skipping her wedding but still going on a trip
so
i was thinking maybe it'd be better all around if i came a different weekend
why don't you take a look at your calendar and let me know what other dates in september look good to you
susan
also for you
ditto
another misdirected email
i'm sure it is
i'll just keep forwarding the emails to you as i get them
however
i will warn you that i'm on vacation from the 0th-0th of august
i'm going to visit my brother and his wife in s
korea so it should be interesting
anyway
you may want to give a heads up to people to make sure they're sending the information to the right person
susan m
scott
hey
was wondering if you want to split this month's electricity bill
last month was $0.0
this month is $0.0 and we've also started paying for water
which was only about $0 last month
anyway
just let me know
i won't make the full check out now if you want to split
sue
charles bradley
sally scott i'll try giving you a call tonight just to catch up and see how things are going
were you planning on going walking
sue
becca
i am sooooo sorry i'm not going to be able to make the party
please give everyone my best and tell jen i would have done everything within my power to embarass her
i'm actually going to be in s
korea visiting my brother and sister-in-law
so i do have a legitimate excuse
see you at the wedding if not before
susan
i'm flying out for korea tomorrow morning
but give me a call when you get home from your meeting
i'm sure i'll still be packing
congratulations
that's wonderful news
i think laura is such a fantastic girl and i wish them both the very best
thanks ash
i actually don't think i'm going to go
but if i change my mind at the last minute i will definitely take you up on it
talk to you soon
we really are going to have to get together with all of the married couples roaming about
if you email me while i'm out of town
go ahead and sent it to my hotmail account
susan_m_scott@hotmail.com i will definitely do my best to make it out there before october
ina
i keep getting this invoicing message
could you run me through getting this resolved
thanks
susan
you've got the wrong susan scott
you may want to try her married name
which i
unfortunately
don't know
did you finally talk to him today
i'm definitely interested in the movie/dinner
i have a couple things in mind
but it probably won't be till around 0 o'clock or so
if that's ok with you
unfortunate
but you also don't want to go getting yourself attached to someone whom you ultimately don't have enough in common with to sustain the kind of relationship you're looking for
off the soapbox
i'm going to the grocery store
forgot some things
the dry cleaners
running and finishing up laundry detail
so that will take up a bit of time
sure
consider it done
ina
could you send in a request for unify and dart for me
thanks
susan
in order that people may be happy in their work
these three things are needed
they must be fit for it
they must not do too much of it
and they must have a sense of success in it

i'm here
what's your yahoo msngr name
mine is sscott0_0
if you go to yahoo's home page you can try to install it yourself
eek
or use the search on your computer
go to start
search
for files or folders
and type in yahoo messenger
if you still have it on your computer it will show up in the search area and you can just double click on it
that should bring it up
i'm doing alright
and you hit the nail on the head with the josh comment
that's exactly what i've been reminded of
that feeling of uncertainty
loss of youthful bravado
sadness
injured sense of security
all of it
everyone in the scott household is fine
dad actually flew over ny yesterday morning before the first plane hit
he was coming from manchester
nh
he said is was an absolutely beautiful day and that they flew right over central park
no idea how dramatically that skyline would change
the first they heard of the events that they must have just missed was when they landed in nashville
he's still in nashville right now obviously
but he's okay and that's what's important
i'm hoping with the limited flights they're allowing that dad will be able to make it back to houston soon
but it appears the faa's just trying to get the passengers who are stranded back home so he may just be stuck somewhere else as a result
chuck and chris were supposed to fly out tomorrow morning from seoul but they too have been delayed
indefinitely
the army has put a hold on all duty station transfers which means we have no idea when they'll be leaving korea or where exactly chuck will be going
the stories and connections of the people on the news and those around me is horrifying and deeply saddening
a large number of people we do business with are based in ny and have lost countless friends and colleagues in the wtc's destruction
chuck has some pledge brother's who are working up there
but we've heard that both of them are okay.i wish you were back home as well
i was on the phone with my mom off and on all day yesterday and i must say it would've been nice to been back home on the couch with her
i did talk to jen yesterday worried about la and what was going on there
but she was fine as well
she said they'd shut down the airport and several major roads surrounding it
but nothing else of concern
we evacuated the enron building around 0:0 yesterday morning
it was disconcerting
i walked down the 0 flights of stairs to get to my parking garage and had only one desire
to get out of downtown
there were rumors flying that houston was another target and given the size of our building
our international presence
esp
in regards to oil/natural gas
and our ceo's connections to the president
i think everyone figured enron would be a logical target
fortunately
those fears were unfounded
on a lighter note
i'm very anxious to hear all about your marathon experience
including the trip there
sounds like it was a doozey
love ya
sue
please tell me you're safe and well in san diego
i just got to thinking of you and the possibility that you'd be flying between dc and la
hate to be the party pooper but
based on the events today and this entire week
a shot contest is the last thing on my mind
don't know
not positive i'm going
i'll give you a call when i'm about to leave the building
no offense taken and i'm agreed on the camaraderie aspect
just don't think excessive drinking is an appropriate response
and
though i don't think you intended to
please don't ever imply that i would crawl in a corner and be afraid
not in my nature
that's exactly the sense of pride in ourselves and our country we need to be displaying right now
go for it
was debating sleeping but don't think i have a choice now
however
due to early morning run i will only be there briefly
odds are you're on the internet right now b/c the hillegeist phone is busy
you are impossible to get a hold of
i must have called 0 times yesterday to no avail
give me a buzz at work when you get a chance 0-0-0
lisa said she emailed you about dinner sometime before you leave
as if without her aid i wouldn't have seen you this visit
ha
anyway
talk to you soon
sue
say they make the offer
what then
evidently only for a select few
this sucks
can't nom until the internet's up how much would someone have s**t bricks if'd i'd made the same request
actually
the thought of that email response
or lack thereof
is making me laugh right now
here's the deal on the arm
just got bk from france late mon night
had lots of fun
race was ok
but looooong
triped on harry potter's cape and had to go in ambulance to emergency room to get x-rays on my arm at the finish line
quel surpris
sustain injury to my arm while running a marathon
as for tomorrow
talked to em this morning and she's on her way to nb to meet with the tile people
said she'd be back either late tonight or early tomorrow morning
as for tomorrow night
she's waiting to see about grandparents
etc
but may be able to meet if it's early
she's supposed to give me a call later so i'll let her know about the colina's thing sue
i just know how big you are on feeling you owe people sometimes
i just think you have to remove that a bit here
that sounds like a very good plan
you look very intense
what happened to the pwr meeting
like the pendulum would be anything different after one of those
i was considering a position as fry master at mc d's i now completely understand suzanne's comments about condescension
i feel it non-stop
the
watch out
maybe i should get my resume together
comments are rubbing me the wrong way
i need to give thomas a call
i feel a boxing urge coming on
you would think
the 0st time you hear the comment
but those have been made now with careless abandon
everyday
regardless of whether i'm doing good
bad or even breathing
i think i'd make an excellent ski bunny
fun
likes the outdoors/being active
loves the water
i.e
hot tubs
and can top anyone in the
roaring fire/glass of merlot
department
that would look great on an application
how do you feel you've prepared for a career in foreign service
i served people from all over the world booze during their ski trips
why don't you figure out what the heck you're doing before you try to rope me into something
you watch
0 yrs
i'll still be in the same desk
i'll be larry
stuck
either
the man is one
giant stress ball
lost hair
overweight
just look what i have to look forward to
sometimes fate plays a little bit of a hand
but for the most part i agree
i was hoping you could email me a list of eligible caterers
thanks
susan scott
em's with the grandparents tonight
so she's out for dinner
said maybe next week
still don't know when i'll be getting out of here
also
just b/c india may be out doesn't mean the possibility of leaving ceases to exists
remember that
they don't mention india in the 0th paragraph
trying to look on the bright side
what's your extension
it's not in the computer
if you're on the internet
call me when you are off
sue
so
talked to emily last night and here's the deal
she left sometime this morning to go to round top for a big antiques fair and will be spending the night in nb tonight
no one has talked to katy as of yet to see if she's going to austin this weekend or not
emily talked to matt and he said he was out for doing anything this weekend
but that next weekend would be good
and i think one of emily's pledge sisters and her boyfriend/his friends may try to meet emily in nb next weekend
so it looks like next weekend in nb is a definite gathering
as for this weekend
depending on work today
which will suck
i may try to drive to nb tonight and spend the night there
i have a feeling i'm going to be relegated to lots of family time on saturday and sunday in austin b/c tons of family/friends are coming to the game this weekend and want to spend time with chris and chuck
therefore
if you want to go to nb as well tonight we could certainly ride up together but i'd check w
emily about a ride back to h-town b/c there's no telling when i'll get out of there on sunday
either give me a call later or email me back w
your thoughts
sue
are you going to the game tomorrow night
i'll be in town
wanted to see what your weekend looks like
emily may be going as well
she'd in town sue
analyst
as far as i know
sorry i didn't get back to you sooner this week about dinner
but things have been crazy
my brother and wife left yesterday to drive to kentucky and their new base so most of my free time was spent with family
lisa
this article's pretty good and it does mention india in some context
so i thought you might be interested
the india comment is several paragraphs in to the article
sue
any luck w
my paycheck
okay
i haven't made a check out yet if you still want to pay this one
i can bring it home tonight
wow on the priya thing
that really stinks
rumor has it you went and got engaged
i'm so excited for you and brendan
i'm going to have to give you a call sometime so i can hear all of the details
still want to come and visit if i can
love

there are some really cheap tickets to san diego right now
i'm getting the urge to jet set
know i'm extremely late on the response
but i'd be thrilled to hit the mucky duck
let me know if there's anything i can do to help out susan
i sustained injuries from friday night
two minor scratches on my index finger due to the cat
and a sore neck from head banging to limp bizkit
think mo suffered from the neck injury as well
hope your roomie wasn't irritated by the ruckus
that's amazing

i'm guessing he'd had a few cocktails too
btw
shame on your for trying to get me to go in there as a joke
i almost did
until i remembered i'm not in college anymore and this guy works at my company
course that all came to me in a flash as i was turning the door knob

joefreid
there is a new mba guy doing a rotation in trading
his name is edmund gaither
have you met him
very large
strong looking guy joefreid
infectious laugh joefreid
i went to tuck with him txsscott0
no
do you know what trading group
joefreid
i'll ask him when i can get him on the phone again
monique's name was familiar
i think he just started in whatever group he is in txsscott0
hm
but he's on the gas floor
joefreid
i think
but not sure
will find out txsscott0
ok
i can probably track him down
txsscott0
mo thinks i was a search dog in a former life joefreid
are you one of those people that can find anything on the internet in less than 0 minutes
txsscott0
had a huge debate at work yesterday txsscott0
is there such a thing as too much water
for consumption purposes txsscott0
i was battling almost everyone claiming that the law of diminishing returns applies even to good
old-fashioned water joefreid
personally
or from a macroeconomic sense
property rights in the west
blah
blah
blah txsscott0
personally
as in water in-take into the human body txsscott0
and there is such a thing
and it can cause a condition known as water intoxication
txsscott0
it's so gratifying to be right
joefreid
yes
i buy into the law of diminishing returns
i've heard of water intoxication and i agree with your assessment joefreid
that doesn't mean you are right joefreid
though txsscott0
why not
joefreid
my bad
because you found info on water intoxification you are right
i though you were saying b/c i agreed with you
you were right txsscott0
people were attacking me
saying
no amount of water can be bad for you
etc
etc
txsscott0
and i replied
at some point your body can't process the water
the system has to overload
joefreid
too much of anything is bad for you
way to overpower them with your tremendous intellect txsscott0
ha txsscott0
i think i've scared them all know txsscott0
now joefreid
cow them into submission txsscott0
i always do
could be why i've heard the words
you're intimidating
more than once in my lifetime txsscott0
oh well
i gotta be me joefreid
not necessarily a bad thing
when used in moderation joefreid
law of diminishing returns again
it is everywhere txsscott0
ha txsscott0
so true txsscott0
seriously though
i may have issues w
challenges and/or the gauntlet being thrown down
i hate being wrong
but i'd rather be wrong than not know the correct answer joefreid
so as long as you can gain the knowledge you are ok
joefreid
insatiable intellectual curiosity
txsscott0
oh
i'll be a little bitter for a while that i was wrong
but i get over it and then i have the knowledge from there on out
so i come out ahead joefreid
i am the guy that will look out the airplane window and marvel how the
wing
provides lift
the physics of it all and who in the world came up with that
txsscott0
that one still gets me txsscott0
i mean
really
how cool is that txsscott0
this giant heap of metal
airborne txsscott0
i took the aviation ground course in college as an elective joefreid
is it and extrapolation of bernoulli's principle txsscott0
ok
engineer talking to business major txsscott0
heard of the principle
but couldn't define it for you joefreid
i realize the whole greater distance over the top of the wing creates a faster wind velocity above than below the wing and therefore causes a pressure differential
low above
high below and this
lifts
the wing
but it the newtons of lift is dependent upon the shape of the wing
the airflow over it
etc
txsscott0
ok
i'm officially impressed
my dad could talk to you for hours joefreid
that is why for the longest time
maybe even still today
the wings are the most difficult aspect of the plane to reproduce
other countries would love for boeing to outsource the construction of the wing so they could learn how to make it
joefreid
i'm sure your father would shame me txsscott0
no
i doubt
but it would make for some interesting discussion
hey cindy
i went out to the web-site for the 0k to check my official time and i'm not listed anywhere
i have a feeling something could have been confused with my number switch
etc
do you have any idea who i might contact to get that information
thanks
susan
hey lis
i'm sorry i was late last night and not in full party mode
i too was in a bit of a mood
anyway
was going to see if you wanted anything special for dinner tonight
i thought maybe i could cook something and that we could do presents etc while watching the ever popular felicity
let me know how your day is looking and if there is anything i can prepare/pick up tonight that strikes your fancy
i'd be happy to grab berry-hill as well if that would hit the spot
sue happy birthday again
i can't the weekend of the 0th b/c of a 0k
but maybe the 0rd
just wanted to say
thanks gals
for dinner last night
to be honest with you i had had a pretty bad day and the rest of the week hadn't been much better
but i had a really good time last night
i forget sometimes how nice it is to share so many great memories with old friends
not to get too sappy
but i really treasure our friendships and i'm not sure you all realize how much i depend on you guys
i know it's rarely overt
but i've leaned on the stability and solidness of our friendships on countless occasions and just don't know what i'd do without that safety net to trust in when things are rough
sue
hey
just an fyi
we talked last night
conversation took less than 0 mins and i think somehow whatever i needed to hear was said
or not said if that makes any sense
anyway
i'm definitely up for a drink tonight as well as shutting this door behind me and keeping an eye open for the next one ahead
the guy actually said that he was
bummed
that choice of words did wonders for me
i mean
you get bummed they don't make your favorite candy bar anymore or b/c you had a disappointing meal
it's just not enough that someone be
bummed
by the prospect of never being with me again
talk to you later
good luck w
the car shopping
i'm anxious to hear what transpires
as for me
i was off last night and maybe if we have some time this weekend i can fill you in on what's happened to me over the course of this week
but the bright spot in the whole thing is that dinner last night reminded me of the person i've been and how far i've come in the last 0 or so years of my life
and i think it gave me the extra shove
push or whatever you want to call it to really end the rotten situation i've been mired in
i don't know that the dinner was to blame completely for my sudden
illness
b/c a large portion of it may have been psychological
i had an appointment for a final chat last night
and i think i was getting sick just thinking about doing what i had to do
but i did it
on my terms and there weren't any warm fuzzies or expressions of disappointment on my part and i rejected his suggestion of a shift to friendship
so there it is
now it just up to me to
stay sober
so to speak and kick the habit for good
talk to you soon
sue
look at you
such a hoax spreader
ha anyway
i was so busy yesterday i didn't have a chance to do anything about it anyway
so no harm
no foul
how are you doing
as for enron
as you well know our stock's not doing so great these days
but i'm not overly stressed
we are still a sound company and shouldn't have any difficulty rebounding from this to a certain extent
i'm actually thinking about buying in to a greater extent at these levels
can't wait to hear how your preparations are coming along
for the wedding and the move
btw
have you set a firm date yet
talk to you soon
susan
i got this a while ago from my dad
but i found it so moving i thought i should share it with all of you
tobin
i was deceased
but i have arisen from the ashes
how are you
i want to hear all about the uk and how you are fairing there
if i can manage
it i'd love to make a trip over there and see your pad
etc
sorry you never managed to meet up with emily
but she was actually in the us when you emailed and then only back in london for about a week to pack up and head home
so you need to give me a kind of schedule for where you're going to be and when
i.e
uk vs
us for holidays and what not
if you have a messenger account let me know
i'd love to chat
real-time
with you
susan btw
i'll be in portland mid-november for work
if you happen to be home then
i'd love to see you
otherwise
any suggestions would be much welcomed
hit really close to home for my particular tribe
figured out what it is that grates on me w
smith
he is monumentally patronizing to me
and i really don't like being talked down to or made to feel inferior
if i'm not on my guard
my reactions to this behavior run the risk of being swift and strong
just put it in the outgoing mail
should be good to go
hope you're feeling better today
didn't want to add minutes to the cell phone bill so i'm emailing
just wanted to make sure you're feeling ok today
talk to you later
nice
fill me in on your work schedule for the next 0 weeks if you please
checking some stuff out right now
contemplating a visit
hey edith
jennifer wanted me to let you know that she's having a little soiree friday evening around 0 pm
very casual
but feel free to bring others
hopefully we'll see you there
susan
at her place
i'm not sure of the exact address
but if you need that information i can certainly get it for you
smith
pallen and others are talking about a ski-trip asap
as in leaving this weekend
and smith has recommended visiting you in deer valley
just wanted to give you some sort of fore-warning on the matter
chat w
you later
ps
he has also said he may stay longer
eek
hey holly
just wanted to drop you a line and let you know how happy i was that we were able to get together for lunch on saturday
i really enjoyed meeting you and hearing about your experiences in seattle thus far
hope all is going well with you and that you continue to enjoy your new home
susan
hey bonnie
how are you doing
i just had dinner w
lisa last night and some of the ut girls here in houston
she's was so excited to hear that we hung out as much as we did last weekend
i wanted to write and thank you again for being such a gracious host
i had the best time hanging out and fell in love with seattle all over again
it is truly a fantastic city
hope all is well with you
and i'm continuing to explore the possibility of joining you and holly in the emerald city
have a wonderful holiday season
hey emily
was just wondering what you're going to be up to this weekend
found a pretty good deal to boston and was thinking about making a trip to visit
totally last minute thing obviously
if i did it
i'd get in saturday evening and leave either monday or tuesday
drop me a line when you get a chance
hi sarah
so nice to here from you
i'm actually still employed right now
but don't have a heck of a lot to do around here
we're all in somewhat of a holding pattern
waiting to see what happens with the bankruptcy etc
hope all is well with you
i haven't made any real decisions regarding my living situation
my roommate and i have movers coming the weekend before christmas and as of right now i had just planned on moving back in with the folks
on a temporary basis of course
anyway
i'm just not really sure where i'll be 0 or 0 months from now
so i'm obviously reluctant to sign any long term leases etc
if a temporary roommate is something you guys would be interested in i'd certainly like to discuss the prospect w
you
but i would also completely understand if you'd prefer to get somebody in there who's more permanent
my number at work is 0-0-0 and home is 0-0-0
talk to you soon
susan
once
a long time ago
i think you copied some words of wisdom for me from the importance of living
if it wasn't you it's not important
because the point is that i recently found them again and reread them today
i think you should read them too
if not for the first time
then again and with fresh eyes
the ancient people who desired to have a clear moral harmony in the world would first order their national life
those who desired to order their national life would first regulate their home life
those who desired to regulate their home life would first cultivate their personal lives
those who desired to cultivate their personal lives would first set their hearts right
those who desired to set their hearts right
would first make their wills sincere
those who desired to make their wills sincere would first arrive at understanding
understanding comes from the exploration of knowledge of things
when the knowledge of things in gained
then understanding is reached
when understanding is reached
then the will is sincere
when the will is sincere
then the heart is set right
when the heart is set right
then the personal life is cultivated
when the personal life is cultivated
then the home life is regulated
when the home life is regulated the national life is orderly

then the world is at peace

the cultivation of the personal life is the foundation for all
it is impossible that when the foundation is disorderly
the superstructure can be orderly
there has never been a tree whose trunk is slender and whose top branches are heavy and strong
there is a cause and a sequence in things
and a beginning and end in human affairs
to know the order of precedence is to have the beginning of wisdom
right now i think both of us are at the beginning
i.e
exploration of knowledge of things
and i think the
things
in this instance refer to those
things
in the past year which have dumb-founded us each individually
i know you want to get to those heavy and strong top branches
and i think to a large extent children and caring for your partner in old age represent those branches for you
but they will not come without the trunk
you can't jump the sequence of things
now is the time for exploration
and i believe you are well on your way in that regard
but above all you must remember that time is the key
and that you can't rush yourself in this processhope the skiing is great and i will talk to you soon
hey sarah
thanks for the update
i was going to let you know that i'm heading out to my parents tonight to help decorate the christmas tree
but maybe i can come by one day this week to check out the house
just let me know what day or days would work best for you
thanks again for thinking of me
susan
i decided to go ahead and come in to the office
you can contact me via this email address or at 0-0-0
thank you

julie
i've been having some difficulty accessing my hotmail account and therefore have been unable to check for your response to my last email
if you don't mind
could you resend the response to this email account
look forward to speaking with you again soon
thank you and happy new year
susan scott
hope you had a good new year
talk to you soon
susan
hey
my phone's not on at the apt anymore
therefore i'm only checking hotmail at my folks
if you want to reach me quicker
i'd recommend the enron address
i should be back to daily access with hotmail shortly
hope you had a great new year
so
i'm doing my post new year's check to see when and if you want another visitor
as i told you before
i am completely flexible in regards to this weekend vs
some other time
and actually
i'm probably more flexible than just the weekend
things are still dead around here
you just have to tell me yeah or neah
i feel like you might need to share a good bottle of wine with a good friend and just release
let me know how your schedule is looking and whether you're up to hosting one more visitor to your fair city
ok my dear
you just tell me when a good time is for me to visit and we'll go from there
i got your x-mas present last night
thank you very much
i'm anxious to start reading it
if you do check email today
give me a shout back
we can have an old fashioned email chat
i'm worried about you mo
i've been praying for you
for all that you're struggling with
but i'm stepping it up double time
please don't completely retreat inside yourself right now
that doesn't mean you need to talk to me
but talk to someone
love
and mo
i don't need to ski
or be active
or be entertained
if you have some time off and you just want a shoulder
i can be on a plane whenever
hi julie
thanks for resending the message
i shouldn't have too much difficulty arranging travel
but i wanted to run a few things by you first
it seems to me that it would be preferable to fly in thursday evening
therefore freeing myself up to come in friday at whatever time of day best suits yourself and the rest of the group
if no one minds
it might even be nice to see some of the activity on the desk during cash trading
also
i anticipate staying through the weekend to see a bit more of the city and surrounding areas
but plan to cover those expenses myself
if all of this is acceptable to you just let me know and i will begin making all of the necessary reservations
i look forward to seeing you and meeting the rest of the group
if you need to contact me for any reason
my mobile is the most reliable way to reach me
0-0-0
thanks again
susan scott
hey bonnie
wanted to wish you a happy new year
and let you know that i'm seattle bound one more time
i have an office visit on the 0th of january so i should be getting in on the 0th and staying through the 0th
hopefully you're going to be in town and able to do something during that time
let me know how your schedule is looking
can't wait to see you again
who knows
this could be the precursor to an actual move
eek
see ya
susan
hey old married woman
what's up
i got your x-mas card
that was too cute
i hope all is well with you and that you had a fantastic new year
i'm also glad you and matt liked your wedding gift
i absolutely loved that pitcher
i knew i wanted to get that for you the second i saw it
really too cool
didn't hurt that my parents wanted to pitch in on the gift
anyway
i really just wanted to touch base and see how life's been treating you and your new hubby
i had a good christmas w
family and an extremely low key new year
which was definitely ok w
me
hope to see you soon
susan
just an fyi
it's about 0:0 houston time and i'm planning on being at the office for a while
like maybe a couple more hours
so
if you wanted to track me down i'd try here first
i'm studying
ha
i just realized that i hadn't emailed you yet
shame on me
em and i
yes
it was just the two of us in nb
oh the shame
tried to call you on new year's eve
but you had already checked out of your room and i assume were staying with priyah
i know i butchered that
whose last name i do not know
anyway
i did talk to your mom the day you arrived in madras and knew you were there safe and sound w
a new friend too boot
hope you're doing okay and starting to adjust to the new surroundings
email me when you get a chance and let me know all about your trip
good luck and talk to you soon
sue
i'm kind of between places right now
so it's probably best to just send things to my parents house and i would suggest trying to reach me via my cell phone
0-0-0 i guess i'll see you at the next tasters
forgot to tell you
talked to jennifer bagwell yesterday and
she and christian got engaged on the 0th
she's very excited and sounded genuinely happy
just thought i'd fill you in some good news
and
yes
i do think it's a good thing
also
i'm sure tori sent you an email
but
yesterday was her last day w
ene
i'm truly thrilled for her too
i think this is going to be a very good thing
this quote just fell out of one of my spirals

but the stout heart stays trying by night and by day

edgar a
guest
ok
my capitalization skills in that last email were horrible
i was checking it before i realized the next click would actually send the message
my apologies
hey lisa
good to hear from you
hope all is well
i assume you didn't get the other email i sent
no biggie
just wrote to say em and i tried to call ny's eve
but you had already checked out of your room
i guess you were staying with priyah
sp
at that point
talk to you soon
sue
so obviously i decided against coming up this weekend
ha
on the one hand i thought it be nice to hang out today and have a little distraction before your apt
but then i thought it might be better for you to have the day to reflect
prep
etc
anyways
just wanted to see how you're doing and since you do have the day off i figured you'd be popping into the cafe at some point
got an email from lisa
so she is at the school and sounded ok
it was a short mass email
hope to getter a longer one at a later date
talk to you soon
i'm a total dork
before my last trip to seattle i sent away for the visitor bureau's tourist packet
anyway
i was looking through it this weekend and it turns out i actually have a coupon for the symphony
nothing big
something like 0% off
but i'd just thought i'd let you know
hope you had a great weekend and i'll talk to you soon
susan btw
i also have coupons for the imax and some other attractions
hey there chickie
it's about 0:0 houston time and i'm bored out of my mind at the office
no big shock
i'll be impressed if i make it to 0:0
so
i was just going to let you know that i'm probably bolting out of here relatively soon
however
i've found a restaurant that has a little section w
0 computers and a couch that i make go crab a cup of coffee at later
my point being that if you email me back today i probably will have a chance to check it
if i don't chat w
you today
i'm sure we'll touch base at some point tomorrow
and
on that note i hope things go well tomorrow morning
talk to you later
hey i'm back at the office now
and if you're going to be back at 0:0 my time i'll just stick around
glad to here things went well
i'm running to the loo
i'll be back in a few minutes if you're still there
ok
i'm back at the desk
just reread your email and realized you're actually working at the cafe tonight
cool
as for the apt
the first really was bound to be more of a meet-and-greet
lay the groundwork situation so maybe it's just as well is was shorter
next week you'll be able to actually start examining things w
her a bit more rather than merely establishing a starting point
i was reading a bunch of my
with god all things are possible
book last night and there was a passage that just totally hit home with me which referenced jesus
reaction to a sinner who approached him
he neither condoned nor condemned the sin
he understood it
it think this is such an important perspective to gain not only in reacting to those around you but almost more importantly to yourself
bear in mind that this is primarily me talk'n to me
but i thought you might take something away from it as well
like i said
i'm gonna stick around here for a while and then i will
of course
have the cell phone
good luck kick'n the cold
ps
if you need a non-drinking partner at the
annual party
i'm in
doubt you're checking this before work
but if you are
i'm still at the office
hey mo
how's it going
hope you had a good day at work today
mine was boring as usual
just wanted to let you know that i thought i might try to give you a call tonight and fill you in on my plans for seattle
i really feel like i have no idea how this whole thing will pan out
and i'm getting more nervous as friday approaches
oh well
c'est la vie right
i've been trying to freshen up on things and be a little more on top of my game
but it's tough
i've agreed to be out of my apt
by the end of the day monday
saves me about $0
but then the commute starts
yuck
talk to you later
susan
hey
i actually just filled my change of address form out this morning
i figured you'd already done yours
i'm leaving for the airport straight from work tonight and don't get back until sunday night
i can fill it out monday
but if you would like it done before then you may want to try and tap someone else for the job
the reason monday is important is b/c someone wants to rent our place and i've told the complex that i'll be completely out by the end of the day monday
so starting monday night i'm back in northwest houston and w/out a mail key
on the bright side
i'm getting a fair amount of money back from the january rent
which means we're cool rent wise
i.e
you needn't give me any $ for january
i do have an interview in seattle tomorrow morning
i'm nervous and excited
i've been studying a bunch for the last week and a half or so to try and prep myself
i think i'm more nervous about not liking the job rather that liking it or not doing well in the interview
also
i'm going to see
kiss me kate
the musical w
my friend up there so that should be fun
i'm glad to hear that things seem to be going so well for you there
you sound awfully busy
keep us posted on all your many activities
sue
i knew you were going to take like a fish to water w
this thing
never should've worried so much
hi julie
i just wanted to touch base with you one last time before i arrive in seattle and make sure that i have the correct time and location for our meeting
as we discussed
i intend to arrive at your offices at 0:0 am friday morning
to reconfirm
you are located on the 0th floor of the one bellevue center building
0 0th avenue n.e

susan
hey holly
just wanted to let you know that i'll be back in seattle this weekend
tonight
sunday morn
not sure what you're up to
but if our schedules allow it'd be nice to see you again and hang out
i'm staying at the claremont downtown and will have my cell phone w
me

0-0
talk to you soon
susan
hey holly
i wanted to thank you for including bonnie and myself saturday night
we both had a great time
it actually meant a lot to me to have such a fun evening w
almost total strangers
makes the prospect of moving up there a little less daunting
you have a nice group of friends
and i will definitely draw on both yours and their expertise on where to live
etc
should i end up moving
hopefully i will know some more in a week or so
and when i do i will definitely give you a shout and let you know how things are playing out
talk to you soon
susan
we need to chat
didn't know about the other cafe
that's awesome
can't wait to hear more
hey mojo
sry about the missed call last night
had put my cell on silent mode for dinner and forgot to take it off
hope you had a good night
i really want to talk to you about the last week or so
sounds as if was an eventful one for both of us
i'm really curious to hear how your appointment went today so drop me a line if you get a chance today and we can set up a firm time to have a rap session
julie
i just wanted to write and thank you again for affording me the opportunity to visit with you and all the other members of the puget trading team
it was unfortunate we were unable to meet again before my departure so that i could have expressed the above in person
but email will have to suffice
i very much enjoyed meeting with john
mark
dana and yourself
as well as with the other members of the gas and power staff
you have a unique operation and one which appears to have many untapped opportunities that will undoubtedly make your time with the company fairly interesting for the foreseeable future
i wish you the best of luck in your endeavors and look forward to speaking with you again in the future
i went ahead and mailed all of my travel information
including receipts
to jaquelyn lewis as see was mentioned as the travel contact in one of your previous emails
if there are any other measures i need to take on that front please let me know
my previous difficulties with my other email service have been resolved
therefore
all of my future contact will most likely be through that email address
in light of this
i simply ask that you direct any future email correspondence to
once again thank you

anyway
i think we're going to have to have a chat tonight about

in regards to enron
i still know nothing concrete
hopefully by the end of the week we should now something w
actual facts and figures
seattle was a really good trip
hoping to know more next week on that as well

~beauty of a woman~ the beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears
the figure she carries
or the way she combs her hair
the beauty of a woman must be seen from her eyes
because that is the doorway to her heart
the place where love resides
the beauty of a woman is not in a facial mole
but true beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul
it is the caring that she lovingly gives
the passion that she shows
the beauty of a woman with passing years
only grows

end of forwarded message
don't have much to pass along
i've been looking into some places to stay if i come up
i may run a few of the names by you to see what you think or if you know anything about them
i've got to get out of my house soon
mom woke me up this morning to see if i
needed to get up and start getting ready
she'd heard my alarm go off and evidently didn't realize my extensive use of the snooze button
she then followed me out to the car to give me directions on how to drive to work
i.e
which lanes to use
ha
even though i'd made it just fine the day before
on the plus side
my meals are being made for me and there is always cheese and crackers
talk to you soon
pswd
temple
hey ina
couldn't remember if i forwarded this to you or not
pswd
temple
do you think we could me for a few minutes this morning
i've got a couple quick questions
i didn't feel like bugging you over the weekend
sometime before 0 am would be best for me because at 0:0 i'm supposed to attend a meeting regarding the analyst/associate program as it relates to ubs
thanks
karen
a meeting on this subject would be beneficial to many making decisions today
please let me know when and where the meeting will be held if it is in fact organized
thank you

hi julie
sorry to be a pest of late
i was hoping you might have an opportunity to talk this morning
there are some deadlines i am facing currently that make it that much more beneficial for me to talk to you sooner rather that later
if you could let me know if there is a time before 0:0 pst that would be a good time to talk i would really appreciate it
thanks
susan scott
julie
i've been given a bit of a reprieve on the deadline
so
if you could get back to me sometime before this afternoon that would be very helpful
thanks
susan
hi john
i've been trying to get a hold of julie this morning
but am not certain if she is in the office today
my current situation has become somewhat interesting over the last several days and i was hoping to be able to talk over some things with her
if julie is in fact out of the office today would you mind if we talked at some point
i'm under some deadlines around here and would be very grateful to have an opportunity to discuss things with julie or yourself
thank you
susan scott
hey holly
just wanted to see what's going on with you
and to inquire how the long weekend in whistler went
i'm curious to hear how everything played out
also
bonnie wanted to get the name of the guy you knew who's based down in tacoma and went to west point
drop me a line when you get a chance
susan
hey
so i've given everyone the heads up around here regarding my decision
and surprisingly enough they have been on the whole very supportive
frank told me this was a
good thing
for me and that he was jealous
and steve actually said he was proud of me
anyway
it's gone much better than i had expected
still don't know exactly what happens to me now
so we shall see what the next weeks hold in store
i'm still checking into lodging etc
for this weekend/early next week
i can fly in saturday or sunday
but maybe sunday morning would be best
i figure we could touch base and plan the next couple days
plus
i wouldn't have kept you up all night chatting saturday night so that you're exhausted for work sunday
then we'd have all day monday and tuesday and i'd probably fly back on wednesday
just a thought
feel free to share you own
drop me a line when you get a chance
suebob
finally living up the name
well girls
i didn't end up getting the job with puget
i was runner up to a guy with more trading experience
he hadn't decided whether or not he was going to accept
which is why they were waiting to get back to me
i called last night due to the decisions i was having to make around here and the vp i met with there subsequently called the guy to get an answer
unfortunately for me
his answer was
yes
anyway
while that opportunity is no longer
i have still decided to decline my offer with ubs to join the reformed trading organization down here
on that front
i am still very interested in trying to get up to seattle and was wondering if either of you were familiar with some headhunters
let me know if there are any things in particular you think i should be looking into
thanks guys
hey courtney
i'm sorry i didn't reply back to you sooner
but i'm sure you'll understand when i say that things with work have been a bit on the crazy side
i'd like to attend tonight
but have a bit of a scheduling conflict
i was wondering if it would be alright if i showed up between 0:0-0:0 rather than at 0:0
also
where exactly are the festivities going to be held
thanks
so this was my quote of the day
our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be
ralph waldo emerson
writer and philosopher
0-0
wow
huh
anyway
got your email with the articles for wahso
going to read them right now
looks like i may be moving tomorrow
so i'll let you know what the future holds for me when i have a better idea
more importantly
i wanted to tell you how proud i am of you
not only for striking out to park city on your own
but also for making the impression you obviously have on the people with whom you work
it's often hard to see when you are the person in question
but i can tell you from my perspective that the people you work
associate with think very highly of you
and
i'm thrilled that windy ridge vocalized their appreciation of you and your skills
definitely something you deserved to hear
it is a great gift to be a person others have confidence in and want to be around
and those are qualities that you possess without question
driving into work this morning my sister called on the cell phone
said she had a special message for me
then mack and sally got on the phone and they sang happy birthday to me
i'm such a sap i couldn't help but to start tearing-up
after they hung up i took a moment to examine where i am in my life right now
and i'm happy to report that i am pleased
i tried to imagine my emotions had i decided to stay on w
the group and i don't think my optimism would be nearly so great
my point is this
sometimes not knowing exactly what the future holds frees you to imagine and dream of things you normally wouldn't
so to you i say
the sky is the limit
dream
imagine
explore
we are both going to do great things in and with our lives
but what i think we need to realize is the scale of those things may be smaller
or even grander
than we'd imagined
point being
we just need to try and be aware of those opportunities which come along every day that afford us those great moments be they large or small
cheers
hey lisa
what's the scoop with tasters tonight
time and location
i think i'll try to come
even if it's just for a quick drink with the gang
see you soon
this whole experience must be too much fun for you
getting to work with all these young pilots
any of them single
and strutting your stuff
the trip to park city was fantastic
we had some really good meals and managed two solid days of skiing
it dumped 0 feet of snow sunday night so we had tons of powder on monday to ski through
and to cushion our falls
tuesday was absolutely beautiful
sunny but still below freezing
the views from a few of the runs at the top of the mountain were breath-taking
monique took all the pictures on her digital camera
so as soon as she uploads them i'll be able to check them out and order a few
this is my first day back at work this week and it looks as though they're moving me to another floor pretty soon
too much sensitive information up here i suppose
it's fine though because there are a few others from the trading group who declined the ubs offer and will be housed on the other floor as well
so i will have company
i've got a couple other leads to try and track on the job front
another company in seattle and one in richmond
va that my old trader larry told me about
i'm still glad i made the decision i did and am excited to see where that choice ultimately leads me
even tobin
from my first group here at enron
is trying to help my find something in the pacific northwest
i'm really curious to see what he may come up with since his acquaintances run the gamut in terms of interests and occupations
glad to hear you're having a good time and helping out in the
effort
and i'll talk to you soon
love
subaru
hi patty
i apologize for not returning your call sooner
but i was actually out of town until yesterday
if you could drop me an email and let me know what would be the best time call you i would really appreciate it
thanks
susan scott
pattie
i am definitely still interested in the position and will give you a call today between 0:0 and 0:0 pst
thanks
susan
i recently had the following wine at wahso in park city
utah
usa
i was wondering if you could tell me of a distributor or retailer from whom the wine might be purchased
i currently reside in houston
tx but will be making a trip to seattle
wa in the next couple weeks
thank you
susan scott
hey tobin
i just wanted to make sure you got the last email i sent you
in response to your email below
if it's just taking some time to respond no worries
if you didn't receive it for some reason let me know
i attempted to answer the various questions posed
cheers
susan
you are absolutely the best tobin
i think i'm flying back up to seattle next weekend to have a second-round interview with cascade
however
i must admit i'm intrigued by you and your father's very diverse connections in that area of the country
hope you are doing well and that merry old england is treating you properly
no rush on getting back to me
i just wanted to make sure you received the email and had whatever answers i had to give
btw
i'm celebrating my first quarter century today
quite a milestone in one's life
i have to love that i'm essentially unemployed and living with my parents
big pat on the back for that one
ha
ciao
susan question
do you think you will return to the pnw when you finish with school
we hadn't really talked about your future plans and my curiosity is peaked
no worries
we can chat tonight
i wanted to talk to you about president's day weekend anyway
and i need to do some research on that front today
thanks for thinking of me though
if it makes you feel any better
i forgot it was my birthday yesterday morning until mom gave me my present
susan
sorry i missed your call last night
big shock
i was in the bath-tub
anyways
you can definitely give me a call tonight if you'd like
talk to you soon
susan
emily
thanks for the birthday wish
i'm still working on a good time to visit
so i'll keep you posted
hope all is well with you and be sure to say
hello
to thomas for me
i'll shoot you an longer email when i get a chance and fill you in on all the fun stuff i've been going through around here
susan
hey bonnie
ok
first the bad news
i can't come up president's weekend for the whistler trip
now the good news
i'm going to be in seattle next weekend
i'm coming to have a 0nd round interview with cascade natural gas
whose headquarters is actually right around downtown
looks like maybe belltown
anyway
i fly in thursday and don't leave until monday
the interview will be friday
much like my set-up last time
so
if you're going to be in town we definitely have to get together
i think i'm really going to look for housing on this trip
maybe that will be the goal for saturday
talk to you soon
susan
hey
thanks for the birthday wish
i didn't end up doing anything too terribly exciting
met some friends after work
the monthly dinner group
and then went to pappadeux with mom and grandma
i had a kitchen shower/luncheon and a bar shower/party saturday in san antonio
went out friday night with emily till about 0:0 am
perfect nw houston evening
donaraki
sp
and matthias's
got up saturday morning at 0am then drove to sa
out until about 0am saturday night
then up and in austin by 0am
brunch with corey then off to kathy and travis's
left austin around 0:0 and got home a little after 0pm
needless to say i'm exhausted today
as for the job front
i was 0st runner up for the job with puget
they ended up offering it to a guy with more trading experience
go figure
someone with more than 0 yr of experience
ha
had he turned down the offer i would have been packing my bags but unfortunately for me he accepted
as for ene
i was offered a position with the new ubs trading organization but decided to decline the offer
i've come to the conclusion that i just need to make a clean break from this place
i'm actually headed to seattle again this thursday to interview with another natural gas company up there
it's a small company
around 0
and the job is for a scheduler not a trader
but i've got a good feeling about the place right now
they strike me as nice people which seems to go a long way these days
so
i'll arrive thursday evening
interview friday and fly back monday
they said they wanted to give me time to explore the city and look for housing etc
which is nice
if all of this works out it looks as though i could be in seattle as early as march
wow
hope all is still going well with you
i've been so happy to get your emails and know that this experience is turning out to be a good one for you
talk to you soon
sue btw
i got our deposit back from the apartment complex
i'll just write you a check for your half and drop it off at your mom's house
hi suzanne
i wanted to touch base with you regarding accommodations
they last time i came to seattle i used the following web-site and managed to get a very good deal on my hotel
in the past
i've stayed at both the westin and mayflower which seem to be in fairly central locations downtown
i wasn't sure if you would be making the reservations or if you would prefer that i handle that aspect
you can either email me back or call me at the office if you would like to discuss any of this in more detail
my work number is 0-0-0
thank you
susan scott
hey chris
i was wondering whether you thought it would be better to fly in thursday evening or friday morning
honestly
either option would work for me i just wasn't sure if chuck would want to sleep in friday morning since it's his day off
let me know which one sounds better to you
susan
hey holly
just wanted to let you know that i'll be in seattle again this weekend
i'm coming up for a second interview with cascade natural gas
i fly in thursday evening and leave monday
so if you're in town we'll have to get together some night
hope all is well and i'll talk to you soon
hey lisa
i looked in my car and couldn't find your dress
so i'm pretty sure you took it inside your parent's house saturday night
where you put it once inside i have absolutely no idea
good luck tracking it down and thanks again for letting me stay at your folks
i really slept like a log on that bed
hey courtney
i just wanted to make sure you got my membership check last week
if you didn't
or if there's anything else i need to do
please let me know
thanks
susan
mom must be at it again
career meter
you find out late this week that your suspicions were right on
you've known for some time that a particular person didn't have your best interests at heart
and this week's revelations confirm your suspicions
it may be time to take flight and move in a different
more fulfilling direction
love meter
you feel more sure-footed and in control of your private life by the end of the week
mainly because the uncertainty that has hung over you like shroud finally lifts
it's liberating knowing where you stand

for february 0-0
a loved one may make a momentous choice
once saturn and mercury move direct
this could happen as early as this weekend
but may take longer
the point is that your life
circumstances
and opportunities are finally able to break from free the ice
welcome change as the liberating thing it truly is
don't be afraid
for some time
you've known things were not right
and something had to give
be very cautious about who you confide in
at this point
the walls have ears
as you establish a new chapter in your life
play your cards very close to your vest
thought you might enjoy
sounds like loads of fun at the hillegeist household
i'll give you a buzz later

suzanne
the flights sound great timing-wise and i know exactly where that hotel is located
being within walking distance of pike's market is always a bonus
i look forward to the visit as well as the opportunity to finally meet everyone i've spoken with in person
thanks again
susan scott
hey mr
noble
quick question
are you in h-town this week or hanging out on the west coast
susan
ok
the flight option i've selected on continental arrives at 0:0 pm thursday and departs at 0:0 on monday
i haven't actually purchased the ticket yet
so if you want to get back to me to suggest anything else for some reason please don't hesitate
however
if i haven't heard from you in the next hour or so i'll probably assume that the times are okay and just go ahead with the purchase
susan
i may take you up on that voucher
i'll touch base with you tomorrow at some point
i don't know if this will get to you
but i'm on the fourth floor right now
i may stop by to see if you're there
was wondering if you'd like a ride home this evening
also
if janie would like one she's more than welcome to join
you tell me
you're the one that is actually working these days
would you mind mentioning it to janie as well
i'd hate to not offer
that's fine
i can meet you by the elevators for the parking garage
you'd probably better tell me what day works for you
you're the one with the family
i'll give you a call as soon as i can find a phone down here
yes
the email address is susan_m_scott@hotmail.com
larry
i don't have a phone near by
could you log on to messenger
is that your msn messenger contact name
try adding me to your list
hey chance
i'm going to be working on west curve validation
do you have any of the information
joe parks told me to contact you
susan
yes
if you go to
add
then click
search for a contact
and type in my name susan scott
search for the person at microsoft exchange instant messaging
then click next
my name should appear and you can click finish
where are you these days
sure
name the spot
hello pete
let me know if this is the correct email address
i was hoping to pick your brain a bit
thanks
susan scott
hi pete
would you mind shooting me back an email to let me know if i have the right address
brad mckay had actually given me your new work number
but unfortunately you were off the desk when i tried to call a few minutes ago
not too long after you departed
i too ultimately chose to decline joining ubs and am currently in the midst of researching new opportunities
interviewing
etc
on that front
i was hoping to pick your brain a bit about a few things
thanks
susan
hi chris
i just wanted to follow up with you and see if you had a chance to look over my resume
i realize i may not be exactly the candidate you had in mind when you first spoke with larry
but i would very much appreciate the opportunity to speak with you and discuss any opportunities you may have available at this point
as larry can attest to
i've had responsibilities at enron that span from back office to trading
to that extent
i believe i could prove to be a valuable asset within any organization
thank you
susan scott
sure
i don't have a phone
hence no message
thanks kathy
would you mind letting me know when i have access to the curve validation file in the o
drive
or if there's anything i need to do to secure those rights
currently we are actually trying to track down who has the broker quotes
chance rabon has said he will do some research and i've contacted some of the traders from the west desk who were in charge of collecting that information
susan
did you happen to save any of the written copies of the quotes
hey tobin
just wanted to check and see how you're doing these days
i was offered a job with cascade natural gas in seattle this past week
the salary is okay and the location is
of course
desirable but i'm just not completely sure about the job
i have a while to make the decision
they wanted an answer today
but i played hard-ball and told them i had to have more time
so silly
but it's very hard for me to do
in the meantime
i'm exploring every contact i can come up with
anyways
you never got back to me and gave me any sort of idea about what your plans are post-school
i'm very curious to know what you're thinking on that front
drop me a line when you get a chance
susan
could you shoot me an email when you get a chance
i was hoping to ask you a few questions about the west curves that keith holst was in charge of collecting
thanks
susan
keith
could you make this request
hey bonnie
i talked to pattie yesterday and asked her for more time to make a decision
i have basically until the end of the month to get back with them
i'm still trying to check out the other opportunities that might be out there
i spoke to matt on tuesday a bit over the computer
things are weird
he said everything was okay
but i don't think that's really the case
he wouldn't respond yesterday
oh well
c'est la vie
i'll talk to you soon and keep you updated
susan btw
that cute place on 0th ave in queen anne was already rented
hey
how's it going
sorry i've haven't emailed in so long
things have been busy
btw
matt did decide to take the job with ubs
as for myself
i went back up to seattle last weekend for an interview with the other company i'd talked to up there
they ended up offering the job so i'm in the process of deciding whether or not i want to take it
i have until the end of the month to make up my mind
meanwhile
i'm checking out a bunch of other possibilities and seeing what turns up
living at home has been interesting
mom still insists on waking me up personally in the morning and harassing me at every turn
still
the meals are great and it's kind of nice to be at home right now
i'm flying to tennessee today to visit chuck and chris
i'm very excited to see their house and the area
i'll be there through monday and then work on planning my next trip
ha
also
some other exciting news
kathy and travis are pregnant with their third
babies galore in the scott clan
that is
of course
except for me
talk to you soon
the pictures you took were great
can't wait to see more
take care
marion
i apologize for not returning your call last night
i was out to dinner when you rang and by the time i returned home it seemed too late to call back
you should be able to reach me today without any problems
if you would like
you could also just shoot me an email with a time you would prefer to talk and i could phone you
thanks
susan
bonnie
how was the weekend
very curious to see what you crazy girls did up there in whistler
so
i wanted to let you know that puget called me last friday with another job opening
i'm supposed to talk to the guy today regarding the position
i certainly don't want to get my hopes up
but i'm kind of excited about this being something i could actually like
hope all is well with you and i'll let you know how my phone call goes today
talk to you soon
susan btw
messengered with matt yesterday
i guess things are back to
normal
whatever that is
question for you
which section of queen anne did we think seemed better
was is the north streets or the west
and which side of queen anne ave would i want to be on
i can't remember any of this stuff
thanks
hi pattie
i just wanted to make sure that you had a chance to speak with justin fernandez
i thought of him when you mentioned possible candidates for the other open position as he was with our scheduling group and is
i believe
from that area of the country
if you haven't had the opportunity to establish contact with him please let me know and i will be sure to get each of you the other's contact information
hope all is going well with you and i'll talk to you soon
thanks
susan
hey
the trip to nashville was good
chuck and chris actually live in clarksville
which is about 0 mins nw of nashville
we went out to dinner in nashville both friday and saturday night
and spent the day walking around downtown on saturday
chuck drove me around the army base and showed me a bit of the area where they live
we also went to this botanical garden/museum called cheekwood
it's the estate of the maxwell coffee fortune
anyway
it was fun and very relaxing
they're house is really cute and their neighborhood requires at least a 0/0 an acre for each house
so there's lots of land
i haven't made a decision about the seattle job yet
i actually have until the end of next week to give them my answer
in the meantime i've been talking to some headhunters and checking out any other options that may be out there
at this point there is really no telling where in the u.s
i'm ultimately going to end up
which i personally find kind of fun
we got a total of $0 out of the $0 deposit back
not too bad
i just deposited the check so all i need to do is drop off a check for $0 to your mom
which i will do this weekend
hope things are still going well there
keep me posted
sue
here's the new and improved updated version
charles
i don't believe i received the form you referred to during our phone conversation
if there is something you would like me to fill out
please feel free to forward it to this address
thanks
susan
you should check out this website if you haven't already
lots of fun
here's the web-site address for the restaurant i think the wine we had was eberle-syrah
chat with friends online
try msn messenger
energy risk management analyst fundamental analysis.doc
this is becoming somewhat redundant
but thank you
honestly
your endorsement of me with these people means a lot
hello
you can try this one
but she doesn't get to check it as often
have you been getting my emails
i gave this address to moscoso and he said it didn't work
hi sharon
i just wanted to make sure that you had received the email regarding my availability for the week of march 0th
if you did not
please let me know and i will resend the relevant information
thanks
susan scott
hey julie
sorry i've been mia of late
i want to play catch-up with you
but i'm afraid i'd wear myself out typing
i was wondering if there was a good time for me to call
either during the day or after-work
let me know
hope all is going well
btw
i was wondering if anyone is throwing you a bridesmaid's luncheon the weekend of your wedding
hey paul
if you're on the computer could you log into aol
i don't have a phone near me to call you on
we need to go over these curves
francis lim jeremy wong these individuals may now be with ubs
but they should know who to contact on the estate side
it's a very mixed web of information and people
it may take a while
but someone knows where all this information lies
ganapathy is a great information source
cell number is 0-0-0 signal is bad in the bldg so if it doesn't come through i'll just call you back
hey guys
wanted to see what your availability is for this afternoon
also
would you mind emailing the two individuals wei listed and outline for them exactly what information it is you're hoping to locate
thanks
susan scott
hi wei
the pwc guys said that 0:0 would be fine
i have also asked them to email chris and bjorn with their requests
if it is alright with you
we will plan to meet at your desk at 0:0
what is your location again
thanks
susan
jacquelyn
i don't think this was intended for me
thanks
susan
actually
i think the pwc guys will be contacting you to talk about the information they're hoping to locate
i believe we're going to try to meet with wei hu this afternoon to discuss primary and secondary curve mapping/tables
thanks
susan
what's the deal with the exclamation points bjorn
you can't be that excited about this meeting
looks like this visit to seattle is going to be a quick trip this time
i fly in sunday
yes
this sunday
and fly back out after my interview on monday
maybe we could grab dinner sunday night
that is if you're free of course
we could even see what holly's up to
talk to you soon
susan
thank you jacquelyn
i look forward to the trip
hey lisa
i'm probably going to have to head out this evening
i'll call you on your cell phone to let you know if i'll be able to make dinner or not
can't wait to see you guys
susan
hey holly
just wanted to let you know that i'm flying in sunday evening for an interview on monday
bonnie and i are talking about going out to dinner
nothing big
and were wondering if you might have any interest
let me know your thoughts and if i don't here back from you via email i'll just try giving you a buzz this weekend
hope things are going well
susan
sorry mo
certainly didn't mean to bum you out
i'm a torrent of mixed feelings today
between job prospects
my cold and coming to grips with some of the past i've just been a little detached from myself
i was also in the midst of a taxing conversation with ted when we were im'ing and it was bringing back stuff too
i'm just struggling with this pattern of attaching myself to men who are ultimately either literally not available or emotionally not available
and this whole mm not contacting me has got me very conflicted
b/c to be honest
i really hope he never contacts me again
but i also feel like him not contacting implies that he believes there is something wrong with even our casual interaction
and i'm not disagreeing
which ultimately makes me feel guilty and rotten
so anyway
i think i just want something to come along that feels good
whether that be a job,a guy,a location
a massage
whatever
i'm just very disappointed with mediocrity
i feel luke warm about too many things
and the partying comment didn't make me think of us reverting
it merely made me think of mm and a past conversation we had at a point i could have maybe kept things from going too far
give me a buzz tonight when you get home
i'll probably feel tons better after a little nourishment
craig
in an effort to make sure that i am adequately prepared for my interview
i wanted to touch base with you and confirm that i possess all the necessary information and forms
last week i received the packet you had mailed containing the application form and company information
also
i have confirmed my flights
hotel arrangements and the directions to your facilities with sharon roberts
i assume all the information needed prior to my arrival is already in my possession
if you know of any additional information i may need please let me know
the last area of interest i am hoping to address is the actual interview schedule
if it is possible at this point in time
i would appreciate the chance to preview the individuals with whom i will be meeting
if the interviews have not been completely arranged as of yet then simply disregard the last request
i look forward to meeting and speaking with you tomorrow
thank you
susan scott
i will see you there
i'll have my cell
shelly
thank you for taking care of all the travel arrangements and interviews
i look forward to meeting with yourself and the various other members of the aquila team tomorrow in kansas city
the web page links you sent were very informative and certainly gave me a better understanding of aquila and it's company culture
i also wanted to let you know that i did complete the on-line application you referenced in your last email
if there is anything else you need from me
please don't hesitate to ask
thanks again
susan scott
kevin
thank you again for taking the time to meet with me last week
after speaking with everyone thursday it became obvious to me that there are some real opportunities and room for growth with cinergy right now
it was also apparent that it is going to take a good deal of hard work and the ability to tackle many variant tasks to achieve those aims
to that end
let me reiterate to you my willingness to take on a host of responsibilities to aid in that process
as i expressed to you at lunch
my goal is to obtain the skills and tools that will make me a consistent and effective trader
i left the offices thursday with the impression that cinergy
and those with whom i interviewed
could help me to accomplish those objectives
good luck with the many tasks ahead and i look forward to speaking with you in the future
thank you
susan
craig
just wanted to drop you a quick note and thank you again for taking the time to meet with me on thursday
i know your schedule has been busy of late
but i very much appreciated having the chance to speak with you regarding cinergy and the cincinnati area
the types of roles available with the company at present struck me as both exciting and promising opportunities
good luck in the continued efforts to move the company in the desired direction and i look forward to speaking with you in the future
thanks
susan
just got to work
i know
it's ridiculous
anyway
just let me know if you can break for lunch
if so i can meet you in your building and we can hit the food court
lunch can easily be accomplished in 0 mins if you're crunched for time
sue
hey denver
let me know if this email reaches you
i was trying to figure out your yahoo messenger name
sounds good
i'll just hit the cafeteria here
good luck w
the typing
btw
how's the rash
i've lost my link to nymexinfo.com
mine's still plugging away
i'm so bored it's painful
what's the deal w
post work activities
hi herb
tim bowler had actually given me your name and email address a little while back and thought it would be a good idea for me to drop you a line
i have been working with tim for a couple weeks at enron and
upon learning that i was in the midst of job hunting
he suggested i contact you
for the last year i served as an assistant trader on the west natural gas desk
wholesale
for various reasons i chose to decline an offer in february with the newly formed ubsw energy and am currently still working for enron
i'm attaching a copy of my resume to give you a better idea of my background and experience
if you know of any opportunities that seem like possible
good fits
i would very much appreciate hearing about them
thank you
susan scott
are you anti-msn
because that one works pretty consistently
gotcha
hey
who do you know at j
aron
thx
i just email/sent my resume to someone there
a pwc guy's friend
susan_m_scott@hotmail.com is the email address
then the name is simply susan
what's going on
think it went well
they're starting the biz from scratch kinda so a lot is undefined at this point
could be a really good opportunity
hi joe
just wanted to introduce myself and let you know that i received my offer information from jeff rogers
since we didn't have a chance to meet and talk when i was in kansas city last week
i was hoping at some point we might be able to discuss the responsibilities you envision for me within your group
please let me know when would be a good time for us to speak
thanks
susan scott
it was good
i'm actually heading out right now
call me later
got in at 0
just read the article
i agree whole-heartedly
which is why i declined w
cascade up in seattle
totally identified w
his comment about being depressed before even start the job
hey
do you think you could escape for 0 mins
even 0
and if so
when
i thought i'd hit the cafateria in allen center for lunch
hello
hey
just got back from a late lunch
call me if you get a chance 0-0-0
barnaby's
backstreet cafe
mark's
hey lis
as always it's good to hear from you
i've been meaning to write and ask what you think of the food there
although
obviously you are surviving
please tell priya
congratulations
for me
that is awesome
i was actually looking into that program the other day
so on a selfish note i'm really curious to see what she thinks of the school
etc
i think it'd be awesome to work in d.c
or boston or northern california for that matter
you should definitely keep rolling with the momentum you've got going right now
run with it
and
good luck trying to arrange the trip w
niclas
if you do manage to go
just have fun
it doesn't have to be
it
it can just be fun
i have an offer in kc right now
should be getting the formal offer from cincinnati next week and still waiting to hear from chicago
so things are definitely happening
i'm just struggling with this decision a bit and have a real tug to head to france or switzerland for 0 months to become fluent in french
you think i'm kidding
but i've really been checking this stuff out
part of the reason for my seemingly flaky turn is because of a recent sad event
chris went into premature labor on tuesday
she was about 0 mos along
and the baby didn't make it
she had a heart beat when she was born
but it was very weak
they tried to resuscitate her but after about 0 minutes chuck and chris told the doctors to let her go
her name was kelly elizabeth scott
my mom and chris's mom flew out to tn on tuesday and my dad went out there wednesday
they are managing
but it's been really tough
chris is fine health-wise which we are all very thankful for
but everyone is really just trying to come to grips with why this happened
so say a little prayer for them if you can
i miss you too
you were actually in my dream last night
and really hope you're enjoying yourself
take care and i'll talk to you soon
sue
hi jose
i just wanted to check in and see how you are doing these days
and more importantly where you are
i'm still at enron right now working for the
estate
i've been interviewing and have a few offers
but am not completely sure what i will be doing
hope all is well with you and i'd love to hear what is going on in your life
