have you sent our form of guaranty since we're wasting time reviewing several different formats
this should always be our first approach
also
you had best advise the company that we will not provide an unlimited guaranty
unless you've agreed otherwise
ss
per my voice mail
please call asap
thanks
ss
mark
i mentioned this problem several weeks ago
did you ever respond to willie's most recent inquiry
sara
ect and sonoco entered into a one
year
plastics
swap which terminated on march 0
0
doug friedman
plastics trader
has asked that ect formally demand $0,0 from sonoco for underpayment on the swap
sonoco has claimed the existence of a market disruption resulting from price reformation in the plastics publication
monthly petrochemical
pleastics analysis
which caused it to use a differenct floating price calculation
ect disagrees as to the existence of such an event
doug will contact me this week to review our approach
please give me a call
thanks
sara
i spoke with john nassos
he said that the company just hired a treasury/credit person last week
and that was the holdup on negotiating the isda
mr
nassos has my phone number and all i can do is wait to hear from him or his outside counsel
sara
as you may already know
shari stack will be handling this for ect
ss
check voice mail message
need gt&c to make this go
ss
as we discussed last week
ect is sending a demand letter to sonoco for the underpayment of $0,0
i need the attachment which i have identified as merely exhibit
a
to appear on a single sheet of paper
legal is fine
we discussed your revision to cover the entire term of the swap and revisions to the month of january
0 to reflect ect's floating price as
0
which will cause changes to the invoice amount and difference columns
also
instead of the term
sonoco price
i would prefer the caption
floating price recognized by sonoco
please call if you have questions
thanks
sara
i'll send you a fedex tonight with my seminar enclosures
thanks
sara
yes
i need the chart to reflect each month during the term of the transaction
sara
can you eat lunch at 0:0
ss
this evening
ect faxed comments to counterparty's proposed isda to both john joel and douglas marshall
we also resent the credit support annex because counterparty never commented on ours and failed to include one
john joel called me this morning to determine when the lawyers could speak
i told him to schedule a conference call because ect was ready and was faxing comments today
i haven't heard from him
ss
you should receive the fedex package today
i also had a short page of bullet points for insertion
which i'll e-mail
but i was waiting to hear back from chris foster
thanks
sara
did you have comments on the bullet points
sara
fyi
maybe this relates to your pg&e counterparty
need to markup and return to chris
attached is a redraft of your letter
rmt knows nothing about the execution or termination of any collar between elektro and westlb
since rmt was not a party to that transaction
also
we have been unable to internally trace the source of the $0,0.0 received by rmt
we are trying to trace this through chase and expect an answer on thursday
if we're lucky
otherwise
call me about the letter
sara
attached is our form of confirm with attached annex a
general terms and conditions
assume the confirm is governed by texas law
most counterparties sign the confirm and fax it back to us without the attached annex a
is this sufficient under texas law as having received the
executed
confirmation
do we need to modify our language incorporating the annex a
thanks
sara

i have received your message
i had lunch with monty
keith and my dad at the big g and it was wonderful
then i dragged lawyers daigle and burlingame to the offices of gordon

it was supposed to be 0 degrees
and i caught the 0-hour bug in n.y
so
carson
what's new with you
lisa palmer and i had a conference call with the xerox lawyer and commercial person
the main issues are the following
no csa
claim to have over 0 isda masters none of which contain csa's
and not set up to handle collateral
rating downgrade is a termination event
maybe they'll agree to our posting must have cross-acceleration
policy
guess what else
no netting
can't handle netting internally
otherwise
xerox is cool
just got off the phone with the lawyer
we have only minor comments and he needs to check with his credit people regarding the collateral threshold
i will wait to hear back before sending out a revision
sara
per
you don't need to do a thing
sorry for not getting back to you sooner

london traders are transacting from london in the names of both ect
houston
and ectric
london
with dapsa and sempra
the deal tickets are still being sent to houston for confirmation preparation
rather than from london where the trade is actually consummated
with respect to sempra
we were previously advised that sempra would not transact directly with ectric absent a master but this cannot be accurate because some sempra deal tickets recite ectric's name
this message is fyi if there are no regulatory issues involved
houston will certainly document back-to-back internal transactions
sara
dan
please see if the attached draft works
my extension is 0
sara
we have finally agreed as the content of letter and i may need gary to sign it
do you happen to have a copy of an agreement signed between ect

libby rutherford would appreciate a short explanation from you regarding the cross default threshold
she was interested in knowing which financials we were reviewing together with the explanation
our latest draft provides all parties with $0 million
libby's e-mail address is
rutherford@pg.com
i spoke with marsha greenblatt
sempra's trading lawyer
she was unaware of any issues with sempra's dealing with ectric but recognized that
i
this is a credit decision and
ii
trading with ectric has occurred
sempra does have a london trading operation so maybe the london traders for both of our respective companies have been transacting
of course
all confirms she reviewed were with ect/sempra
except for one or two ectric confirms
based upon our recent ect/ectric internal conversation
i don't anticipate further confusion
thanks for everyone's attention to this matter
sara
addendum
i received a phone call from the sempra lawyer this afternoon
she said that sempra has no problems trading with ectric

limitiation of liability all else is negotiable
ss
since the master is drafted for ect/tbs
what does your message mean in terms of moving the isda
guaranty and side letter along
as i mentioned to ted
what ei or an ei project company does outside of the ect swap is not something that i can track
thanks
ss
i just received this message from mark
let's talk and i can see what i can do
i'm not aware of any written broker agreements used by ect for trading other than those for futures and equities
i can check on the physical side
ss
i have an 0:0 am eye doctor appointment tomorrow morning

sara
hello there
i know that you are out of the country
thanks for forwarding the message from andre cangucu
i have been through your materials but do not find any involvement you may have had with specific swaps
the items i found were generic and were in the form of law firm memoranda
e.g
derivatives and fx transactions in brazil
trading with brazilian counterparties
etc
am i missing something
look forward to seeing you soon
sara
per my voice mail
please contact me regarding swaps and other derivative activity in brazil
i am replacing yao apasu as the houston based trading lawyer

brent
andrea and i had a
status
conversation this afternoon
brent will go to sao paulo on july 0 to meet with andrea
randy and commercial people
andrea has requested that you and i go to brazil after july 0 when the outside lawyer is back from vacation
in general
the three of us are conforming and updating physical resolutions
final and proposed
and identifying additional research necessary to address the financial trading issues
these are related to specific deals originating in brazil
which are truly settled financially
e.g
a purported prepay where no physical commodity was to be delivered
and issues arising here in houston
e.g
the hickerson request for fixed income
fx and equity trading
brent will be discussing pending transaction structures while in sao paulo
it appears that brent is the
point person
for dealing directly with the sao paulo office and he will bring me in as necessary
although i will be dealing frequently with andrea
i'm swamped
ss
greetings
hope there's no confusion about my role in brazil
i'm replacing yao apasu in the derivatives area and i thought he was more involved in the process than he apparently was
i'll be taking direction from brent and will be available as needed
thanks
sara
still waiting to hear from you
attached is a refinement of your proposal but i don't know if it accurately describes what you want
ss
looks like our counterparty did not have authority to transact
ss
we still have outstanding issues under french law
netting transactions may not be possible
i.e
may not be enforceable
with any of the french counterparties even if you have an isda in place
if netting is not a concern
then we can have separate and unrelated transactions
are you going to push an isda for sita
let's discuss
michael will have to encourage his counterparties to respond to our french counsel
sita never did
sara
please review and let's talk
thanks
ss
hope all is well
how do i get in touch with you
sara
there was a flurry of activity in march
0 involving petron but it was on the physical side and we never made it to the swap issues

the party that ect has a master agreement with

when you speak with mike billings
you may alert him to this

s
cone counterparty master swap agreements

0
tozzini memos
0/0/0 and 0/0/0
thanks
sara
please send credit worksheet to susan bailey
ss enron capital
trade resources corp
help me understand how many tozzini memoranda exist which address financial swaps and derivatives

i am not clear
i am aware of only two tozzini memos
dated 0/0/0
physical trading of energy
and 0/0/0
local derivatives market
let's all start from the same point

attached is the first report identifying financial master trading agreements generated by ect's derivatives legal group

thanks
sara
under separate cover
i am faxing to you a copy of a
table of contents
for a collection of memoranda on various brazilian issues
physical trading
derivatives
tax
etc
which i have copies of
i have also received from you this morning the response of antonio felix et al to the inquiry of gustavo junqueira
it will become increasingly difficult to monitor our progress with the tozzini firm if the business people have direct contact with tozzini and bypass the enron lawyers
we will not be able to compile a comprehensive review and the requests will become disorganized
requests for legal research by tozzini should originate with the enron lawyers and be addressed to the enron lawyers
we can then discuss conclusions with our business people
and even meet together with tozzini
i hope that you concur with this procedure
if you do
i think that it would be more appropriate for you to contact the tozzini firm to convey the message
and also to our business people
please call me when you are back in the sao paulo office if you have any questions
p.s
i will prepare for you the
mini-book
containing the memoranda referenced above
i would only solicit their comments on other
projects
ss
we can add tgs to this list and remind me on monday to review

i am currently working on guidelines for argentina which will address both physical and financial trading
other
guidelines
exist in limited form for the remote offices in singapore and australia

i'm not exactly certain as to what you are looking for
obviously the foreign offices have issues that may not apply in the us
although la
is about as close as you can get to a third world country
one thing that doesn't show up in the attachment is the swap eligibility issue
let me know how i can help further
sara

it looks like the 0-day l/c issue is an issue

in general there is a netting issue with french counterparties
the
quick fix
is to only permit one transaction using a deemed isda
the broader issue to be resolved is that one of the parties must be a
financial institution
under french law
we tried to push ect into that defintion
but without success
the next step is to require an opinion from outside counsel identifying our counterparty as that financial institution
ps
tanya is well aware of the situation
is out of the office until tomorrow afternoon
ss
fyi
your switchboard does not answer and i'd like to speak with you
please call me at 0/0-0
we'll e-mail two identical schedules to you in word
enron capital
trade resources entered into an isda with barclays in 0 and that schedule was virtually identical to the one we're sending
we therefore do not expect there to be many issues
the banks should serve as calculation agents and confirming agents so we will look to them for the confirmations
look forward to finalizing these documents with you
thanks
sara
i have a 0 opinion which addresses only a few issues but it's a start
let me know if we should proceed further
ss
we are presently contacting morgan stanley dean witter to facilitate opening of an account for ephxii to trade adrs
you will need to provide a resolution authorizing opening of the account as well as an authorized trader list and other contacts
we will provide you with drafts
i am certain that the broker will accept fax signatures and then follow up with originals
for future reference
will this be an isolated instance
i.e
deal specific
or will these accounts become more routine
just wondering if s
cone has a formal trading policy or if trading is still deal specific
ss
aa has real problems with loans disguised as swaps
who is reviewing this from an accounting viewpoint
the accounting treatment could impact the deal

i'm leaving for a 0-week vacation on friday

sorry
i've been tied up all day
rod and i just spoke and he is thinking about the nav issue
regarding setoff
we can agree to tiger's language but credit will not permit ena affiliates to trade with tiger
that's your issue
will you agree
we will not agree that all collateral be held in ny
there is still an issue about relevant price and the possibility of fewer than three dealers
we cannot finalize l/c and mac issues until we see tiger's redraft which we have not received
let's talk
ss
this is an ecm deal which is supposed to fund thursday

i love you so much

my life has always been a mess
i never had a chance to tallk to you about cuba and i'm totally fascinated with the island
i sat next to this lawyer from ny on the flight from ba to miami and he's recently separated and wants me to dump mike
i have a
house sitter
while i'm on vacation
thought i'd try it out since you probably would
mike asked the concierge at
the argyle
to make reservations from a list i prepared
all of your suggestions except parkway grill appear
how do people in la dress for dinner
help
i have to pack tonight

the phoebebee says hi
call me later if you're working
ss
per my voice mail
not today
sara
the only policy that i've seen is the
interim southern cone electricity trading policy
dated july 0th
0 and which does authorize financial electricity trading in brazil
i'm not aware of policy
maybe there is none
or resolution
maybe each will be deal specific
which addresses the opening of brokerage accounts and equity trading
even for hedging purposes
i think we should monitor the activity and see if it's going to be sporadic
i'll be in the office today until 0 pm
sara
let me know if this works
sara
mark
you may recall my memo to you in april
0 which indicated that for netting purposes
the conditions included
0
the transaction must be governed by a market standard master agreement or occur on a french regulated market 0
one of the parties must be
a
an
investment firm
within the meaning of the law of 0nd of july
0
b
an instituion or firm benefitting from the provisions of article 0 of the law or
c
a non-resident entity having a
comparable status
the term
investment firm
embodies financial type institutions which recieve and transmit order for financial instruments for third parties
there are 0 categories of article 0 firms
including bank of france
insurance companies
broker types
etc
for example
one murky designation includes
persons who supply an investment service which is ancillary to their professional activity
provided the rules governing such activity do not prohibt the carrying on of investment services
slaughter and may has advised that they could assist us in determining whether our french counterparty fit this category and it definitely needs to be discussed with the counterparty
and extract a rep from them as well
there are other categories as well
i have a copy of the law if you would like to review
the non-resident entity having
comparable status
is the category we were trying for fit into without much success
tana tells me that i have given you misinformation
perhaps the law has changed and justin has a recent update
ena has a soc gen master
and we have recently sent a deemed isda to a french corporate
one shot deal only
mark and i met yesterday
i am not making my proposed changes to either section 0 or section 0 of the omnibus other than adding definitions for
option
and
floor amount
to section 0
this does not interfere with all of our other general changes to annex a
which include the comment about
total premium
which should conform to the online version
so
annex a is ready to go
sara
guess what
lotus notes prompted me that there was more than one
marie heard
could this be true or do i have a virus
ss
i'm trying to revise annex a
mike etringer
in portland
would like for this to go out today
i'm leaving at 0 pm
thanks
ss
can you talk late this afternoon
in connection with the
trading issue
have you taken a look at the services agreement
hello there
hope all is well
will you be at the legal conference later this month
would you please provide us with information identifying the specific entity requiring the brokerage account and a brief description of the transaction for which the account is required
also
for purposes of your unanimous consent or resolution
you should note that either of ted murphy or rick buy should be one of the two signatories required for opening the account
let me know if you have any questions
sara
i hope that there is no more confusion
the opening of each brokerage account should require two signatures for control purposes
one of those signature must be either of ted murphy or rick buy
their titles frequently change but check the enron corp
corporate workbook
the second signature must be an officer of the entity opening the account
we suggest the level of authority used by ena but certainly whatever appears in the entity's unanimous consent or resolution authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts
i think that marie previously sent you a form
let us know if you have any questions
what is the timing on the enron brazil power holdings xii ltd
account
regards
sara
would you please verify the accuracy of parts c and d of brent's report
thanks
sara
remember this one
does anyone else in underwriting need to see this
ss
fyi
sara
who will be helping me with this confirmation
regards from houston
i hope you are well and busy
i just wanted to follow up on our very productive meeting of september 0
0
enron north america and enron south america are still quite anxious to continue our analysis of the various components of financial trading
i believe that you were going to prepare some type of matrix to help identify the various legal issues and practical aspects associated with financially transacting in brazil
we would then add tax and regulatory analyses to the possibilities
if my memory serves me correctly
we had identified transactions by the enron entity
ene
as follows
a
ene offshore financial institution and brazilian entity
b
ene offshore
not financial institution
through cc-0 account with authorized brazilian bank and brazilian entity note
enforceability issues with 0
b
0
local swaps
a
ene onshore entity and brazilian financial institution
or ene onshore financial institution and brazilian resident
b
ene onshore entity and brazilian entity
not financial institution
registered with the bm&f or cetip through intermediary note
compliance with existing regulations as to specific reference products is required as to 0
a
and 0
b
0
pure
otc swaps
a
ene onshore entity and brazilian onshore entity
b
ene offshore entity and brazilian offshore entity note
0
a
presents enforceability issues under brazilian law and 0
b
presents no issues whatsoever we look forward to your response as soon as possible and would also like to know when we may hear from you
in connection with your response
please note that we are interested in the recent changes to the laws for acquiring banks
bankrupt or otherwise
regards to marcelo and jose emilio
sara
would you please prepare and coordinate with jeff harbert
thanks
sara
hi there
a quick refresher course for me with respect to french derivatives trading
not a bank
in transacting with a french corporate
should we request articles and bylaws for capacity and also a due authorization opinion
i think that this is correct
however
if we are transacting with an
s.a
we should not request articles and bylaws but only the due authorization opinion
my notes on these items are confusing
could you please respond in the morning
thanks
sara p.s
we are currently operating under the
one transaction rule
with french non-bank entities in order to avoid the netting problem
i am forwarding to you several e-mails received today regarding this transaction
we are going to send out another draft confirmation for this commodity spread swaption
sara
fyi
we are trying to revise the draft transaction confirmation per sean's e-mail of date
the original confirm was prepared for
catalytica
inc
and the credit included an additional event of default
cross-default
with thresholds of $0 million for catalytica and $0 million for enron north america
sean has requested that
catalytica
inc
be replaced with the sub
catalytica combustion systems
should the credit remain the same
we are withholding release of this confirm pending a response from underwriting
thanks
sara
in an effort to establish regular communication on the progress of trading issues
primarily related legal and tax perspectives

cone

lucy ortiz on the confirmation desk is awaiting your response re
my e-mail of 0/0/0

if you have any questions
please call
thanks
sara
sean's comments
how would you like to handle
we could do a deemed isda if you feel comfortable that the counterparty will sign the isda
how long is the deal
we will conference you in at 0 am
houston
thanks
sara
hope you are well
i had a wonderful vacation in l.a
i never made it to either the norton simon or the getty
i'll just have to plan another trip to the west coast
in connection with your recent review of our standard isda schedule
credit support annex and legal opinion
the
documents
could you please advise as the whether additional provisions are required or advisable in any of the documents when our counterparty is an argentine public utility
municipality or other type of regulated entity
in the u.s
we use the isda multicurrency
cross border boilerplate and incorporate most of the isda municipal language and some of our own into the schedule for municipals and governmental entities
however
for public utilities which are general corporates
and not governmentally owned
we take a different approach and incorporate language which might trigger an
additional termination event
for
regulatory type developments
e.g
orders issued by a public utility commission
which would cause or might cause our master agreement to become void or unenforceable or similar swap agreements to become void or unenforceable
for example
the filing of a motion
pleading
application or other similar action in any proceeding or action by party b
a commission
regulatory agency or other entity having jurisdiction over party b
in respect of party b
or in respect of any other similarly situated entity organized under the laws of the state
s
in which party b is located or regulated
to the effect that performance under this agreement or one or more transactions hereunder or similar agreements is unlawful or that this agreement or one or more transactions hereunder or similar agreements are void or voidable
by fax
i will send you our municipal schedule
please advise as to changes in both the
i
schedule and
ii
legal opinion for both
a
public utilities
corporates
non-governmental
and governmental entities
municipals
public agencies
governmental utilities
etc
please call if you have any questions
regards
sara
randy
i can certainly participate in your tuesday morning meetings
and i can appreciate the time constraints under which andrea is working
i believe that lynn will defer to rick's participation
please let me know if there is a call in number
i think that i will be able to keep you updated through your meetings
my need for meeting with lynn and brent stems from the fact that we are
offshore
brazil and need to communicate regularly to keep the fires burning

limitation of liability
language
provided
however,that nothing in this provision shall affect the enforceability of section 0

need attachment
shouldn't someone contact amoco
i mentioned this to carol st
clair last week but i don't know if anyone thought further about it
sara enron north america corp
i know that you were in the rio office during the latter part of last week
i sent you an e-mail last week to see how you were doing with the research/memo
i also called marcelo rodrigues and left a message
i have not heard from either you or marcelo and i am anxious to continue our dialogue
please e-mail or call at your earliest convenience
thanks
sara
insert this paragraph as marked on the document
ss
either sounds good
but let's do friday
ss
no way
never mind
ok
have fun
i'll miss you
sara
i am about to engage the johannesburg firm of webber wentzel bowens to proceed with a response to ena's questionnaire
isda has used this firm
has ectric done any previous studies in south africa
please let me hear from you today
if possible
thanks and regards
sara
yes
i've received messages but have not heard from the right person
however
i want to clean up the transaction itself
why is it a swaption
i see that you completed an isda comparison in late september
what has happened with it
smud is calling
can you advise stuart rosman asap
ss
was this meeting cancelled yesterday
it wasn't on my calendar
i am sitting in on this conference call as i write this message
brent just mentioned that you were preparing an analysis addressing
trading locations
to present to don
randy is interested in seeing your written response
do you need anything from me
also
i heard from afac by e-mail yesterday and he said that marcelo was working on a memo
which i was to receive yesterday
we may need randy to intercede and keep the lawyers working on all projects
apparently afac handles all central bank issues for tozzini and cuiaba has these issues now
call me when you're free and we can talk to rolo
i've looked at their comments
sara enron north america corp
afac
thank you for your response
it is difficult for me when i do not hear from you since i am not in sao paulo but i understand that you were engaged in other enron matters
i am looking forward to your response since the trading issues are not going away
the issues seem to only multiply
once
the enron group
has had an opportunity to review
we would like to schedule another meeting with you and marcelo in sao paulo
i look forward to receiving the memo and chart
thank you and regards
sara p.s
please phone or e-mail when you are sending the memorandum
all
i know that afac is busy with enron matters
however
i received this response from him on monday
yesterday
i have not spoken with either afac or marcelo but it appears that they are very close to at least a
first draft
my thought is that we review the response and identify specific areas and/or issues for refinement and then schedule a meeting in s.p
i'll advise as soon as i hear further
sara
i haven't reviewed yet but here it is
sara
yes
this would be a helpful
insert
in the negotiations manual
i always worry that we receive explanations about a variety of issues and we don't keep a written record of the advice received
ss
dale
can you have someone review the transaction terms
i'm not sure that this is a swaption
i'll also take a look
i do not have a voice yet but i am in the office
sara
i know nothing
ss
david
could i see a copy of the amerex below referenced agreement which you approved
i would appreciate your response today
thanks
sara
sorry to have to respond via e-mail but i've got laryngitis
although i should be in most of the day today
the actual opening of the agreement is simple because we have a good broker relationship and the agreement is acceptable to us
but
the broker will not open the agreement until we can submit the underlying authority which includes
authorizing resolutions
or unanimous consent
from the account party trading authorization number of signatures for transacting marie previously sent
samples
of the the underlying documentation to robert george
we have not received anything to date
when we receive the information
we can fax everything to the broker and the account can be opened immediately and then followed up by original hard copies
let me know if you have any further questions
sara
you indicated that you'd be finished by wednesday
can you give me the comparision
thanks
sara
so you were able to put janet in her place
if you have questions
please come in my office
i can write and shake my head
yes
or
no
sara
mike
thanks for your patience
i have severe laryngitis so i cannot even speak
i received a copy of the index for the utah statute to which deseret is subject
i'm afraid that i need utah counsel to answer my questions
i'm working on that right now
if you call me
i'll only be able to respond via e-mail
sara
i'd like to attend
ss
sorry i can't wish you well in person but i have a severe case of laryngitis
fortunately
i'm on antibiotics but the doctor said
don't speak for 0 days
i wish my wife would get laryngitis
maybe the desert air in arizona would bring relief
i love saguros
is that right
daddy thought planning for chanukah was a great idea
also
tell daddy that if he used e-mail i could talk to him even when i have laryngitis
love
sas
brent and lynn
i have a severe case of laryngitis and i can't even speak
i'm not sure that i'll be able to
or even should
speak on friday for our 0 am
houston
conference
brent
i was wondering if you would be in houston next week before our legal conference on thursday and friday
if so
then maybe you
lynn and i can meet to assess the situation
if not
then let's please reschedule our friday call for monday or tuesday of next week
i can suggest monday after 0 am
tuesday morning we have randy's call which i may have to begin taking at home due to the early hour so if we decide on tuesday
it should be after 0:0 am
please let me hear from you
thanks
sara p.s
i have not had an opportunity to review the memo but i'm going to take a look today

sara

i haven't looked at your other question yet but i will
sara
the agreement must be executed by a vp or higher level

ss
fyi
i don't know anything about this deal other than the fact that chris foster asked me a question
i referred chris to christopher who had worked on the apea transaction which had similar issues
ss
i thought we had devised a format for any response
i'm glad to meet with you anytime
currently
i have severe laryngitis and i am unable to speak
i will probably be limited on friday as well
we can manage if you come to my office
let me know
ss
ok
let me try to catch up here
brent may not get my e-mail for awhile
i believe that he is in houston today on personal business and will stay until the conclusion of the ena legal conference which is th
fr next week
what is your availability on mon or tues next week
i will try to put something together
at least you and i can have a game plan so that we can plan our next visit to sp
this voice stuff is a bummer
sara
just got your voice mail
i have severe laryngitis and i cannot use my voice today or tomorrow
sorry
we can e-mail or speak through marie
yes
we have a blackline
marie has finished going through it and i need to review
the lawyers blacklined the latest version over the second blackline so we had to revert to a comparision to the first blackline
re
the credit support annex
i believe all is resolved
however
i believe there is still an l/c issue
if there is an l/c default
say the issuer is downgraded
tiger is insisting that we post cash immediately without the right to post a substitute l/c within two days
i am not absolutely certain of this
but carol has a 0 pm call with the lawyers and i will listen
i don't know if tiger responded to our guaranty
i was out sick yesterday
hope this brings you up to date
ss
ok just no voice
thanks
hey
man
what's up
have we thought this through practically
brent is supposed to be in houston but mark didn't know if brent would be in the office today or tomorrow
he has personal business in houston
you might check with taffy
let's do it on tuesday
oct
0 at 0 pm
if brent is available
all the better
let me know if you want to visit enronland
i don't mind the walk
sara
i would like to sign up for the following presentations

thanks
sara
speak of the devii
i just had someone leave a voice mail for counsel
who is at an outside meeting
i will definitely have a lawyer call tomorrow morning
is utah in your time zone
sara
don't you recall that we created a response or amendment format
what am i recalling
ss
sounds like a great idea to me
sara
i have not yet had a response from argentine counsel
i will speak with them again
sara
patricia
i was just checking to see if you have had an opportunity to review our isda schedule for the referenced entities
please let me know if you have any questions
i believe that susan flynn in our office faxed you a copy of our form of schedule last week
i look forward to hearing from you
regards
sara
i still can't talk
i think that our response should be final except that there may be some agreed to changes on the l/c side
carol st
clair is addressing that with jennifer and miriam
in any event
i believe that tiger needs to
ok
our response of yesterday since there were some errors on their redraft
marie is not in the office today
if you want to speak to a person
call susan bailey and she can come into my office and we can manage
have a good weekend
sara
fyi
i have a pretty bad case of laryngitis but i still have to eat lunch
maybe i can find a
talking person
to join us so you won't be bored
sara
sorry
but i still can't talk
although marie is not in today
i can have susan bailey
ext
0
contact morgan to alert them that the faxed docs are coming
we also will need a signature on the agreement itself and i can't recall if marie sent that already
please call susan so that we can be more specific about what might happen today
and whether it can wait until monday morning when marie returns
i have not received anything from robert
thanks
sara
yes
as long as the tiger lawyers do their bit
please call susan bailey about the guaranty and she can have it prepared for execution
question
are we only preparing the tiger guaranty or other animal guaranties as well
it looks like we won't have to open the account today
however
we should send the account agreement to the person in brazil who will sign
or we can send it to the lawyer in brazil whose name is robert george
come see me to explain further
thanks
ss
yes
i'll call you ss
yes
the lawyers have requested separate guaranties for each fund
ss
brent is in the office and would like to finalize the isda master
i believe that we need to send our guaranty
chat briefly with brent about this and let's finalize
ss
i would suggest the following
this is a confirmation of an option offered by ____________ to ena and accepted by ena pursuant to a telephone conversation on ___________ between the parties
i don't know whether this is an omnibus or master but use language accordingly
call if you have questions
ss
sometimes i have brilliant ideas and this may not be one of them
also
it would be nice if jennifer had a singing role but i know how kids can be so don't you worry
i'm not implying that zachary shouldn't sing
or take on an acting role as well
because that would be even better
or we could do a quartet
whatever
but you
dahling
are the centerpiece here because mother and daddy like you best
so here are my preliminary thoughts for an irving houston off-broadway play
naturally this is based on an ada
mike premise

this old suitcase
daddy packed the louis vuitton without wheels a week early but mother wouldn't let him close it and then it wouldn't close

sara
on friday
did you send the tiger guaranty to clem for execution
ss
there are no outstanding issues as to the tiger guaranty
we need to have it executed

sara
i will have to update this document weekly so i'd feel better if you updated
etc
i'll bring the info shortly and we can e-mail to randy's assistant in sao paulo
thanks
ss
we have not heard from the tiger lawyers

sara
john and marc
legal needs your help
as you know
cargill and ena are frequent trading partners
we have never put a swap master agreement in place
in this day and age
we would be negligent to not execute the swap master agreement cargill's legal department received a draft of our isda master agreement two months ago
i need your help to prompt the cargill trader
s
to put some pressure on their legal department to negotiate the agreement with ena
the cargill traders may call phil fantle

you can then give me a call or drop me an voice mail

susan b
should have gotten our draft of the referenced guaranty to you
it still needs to be reviewed by the physical gas group since we are amending their guaranty
do you care about any allocation of payments between hpl and ena
at the moment
i do not have any allocation language in the guaranty
if the guaranty is capped at $0million and payment demands are made by hpl and ena that exceed the cap
full payment cannot be made
should the payments be allocated proportionately or according to receipt of demand
or do we care
i hope this helps

muni's and other public entities
state
local and federal
are the type of counterparties for which we require legal opinions and the whole ball of wax
so to speak
including background documentation
resolutions
etc
if we cannot prove authority to transact
then the agreement may not be enforceable
i.e
if the counterparty owes us money
we may not be able to collect
we definitely need to review certified copies of the counterparty's charter
enabling statutes or legislation creating or authorizing the counterparty
its bylaws
charter or constituent docs
investment policies
guidelines or restrictions
resolution approving the swap
or other
transactions and authorizing a person
s
to transact,etc and a legal opinion
the format of which we always provide to the counterparty
it's best to execute the isda but we do have an omnibus drafted for municipalities
call if you need further help
sara enron north america corp
i thought we sent it but i'll have marie heard email a copy right away
ss
thanks for remembering me

hi christian
i wanted to ask you a few questions about the occurrence of negative pricing on the west desk
i'm getting a differenct response on the east desk
although my interest is financial trading
you may have experieced this issue on the physical side
jeff hodge has not
in the past on the west desk financial trading
any prices which are negative are deemed to be
0
so an average of hourly prices could include some zeroes
the east desk wants to add in the negative numbers
please call me to discuss
i'd really appreciate it
sara
can you recall if the trades
west desk
were swaps or puts
ss ps i'm still trying to resolve
no

welcome back
the disappearance of a price index is a
market disruption event
discussed in section 0 of annex a to the confirmation
unless an
alternative floating price source
is described in the confirmation
the floating price on the first available trading day
without a disruption
is utilized if the disruption does not exceed three business days
otherwise
the price is
determined in good faith by company
by taking the average of two or more dealer quotes
at the moment
your confirm does not identify alternative pricing
there are a few credit issues here
i have a 0:0 am call with cargill

your last entry was 0/0/0
ss
this is a
high volume
trading counterparty
shouldn't we negotiate an isda to replace the existing master
ss
jeff
i thought we should update the situation particularly in light of the problems that willie runs up against
can you give me a call and let's discuss
thanks
sara
the east and west power desks are creating slightly different floating price language for some of the power pools
the west desk wants
negative prices
to be averaged in as
zeroes
the east desk wants to average in all prices
positive or negative
i'm inclined to let the traders do as they wish
i can't seem to get an explanation for the difference in approach
in each instance ena may take either side of the deal
the confirm desk will have to pay attention to the source of the confirms to use the correct pricing language
i don't know if this will create an on-line trading issue
what do you think
sara
are we still on for a lunch at the big g tomorrow
i'm flying to no in the morning
your voice mail didn't pick up on your phone this morning
0/0-0

mark and i met with mark haedicke regarding utilities and the need for a legal opinion from the utility counterparty
we have agreed with mark as follows
0
our negotiations with investor owned utilities should be based upon our standard isda schedule
isda multicurrency agreement
and including the
additional termination event
neither party should be required to provide a legal opinion
0
investor owned utilites will be approved for online trading from a legal viewpoint
the extra
additional termination event
paragraph is not currently included in the gtc's but could be incorporated if there is a revision to the online agreement
0
our position with respect to municipals/municipal owned utilities
federal/state/local owned utilities and cooperatives remains unchanged
we should still utilize and update the
municipal isda
form
and
require a legal opinion from the counterparty
in that regard
susan flynn has been working on an
omnibus
format for an electric co-op
deseret generation and transmission co-operative
an earlier version of which could be used as a template for a municipal omnibus confirmation
fyi
just in case
ss
i have no changes from last week
sara
call me anytime today
0/0-0

citibank
i think that this transaction is called
project moosehead
i have a meeting on it this morning
please comment to the draft i sent to you yesterday
i don't know if the structure works
i couldn't decide upon the format
it also looks like a cap
thanks
ss
recap
this is project moosehead
after the meeting
we determined that the transaction should be structured as a cap and not a swaption
the fixed price is the premium
the strike is the cap price
remember
strikes are for options and strikes are cap/floor in those deals
we'll need to revise today to send in the morning
cp is
merrill lynch capital services
inc
enron party normally is ena but we may change to epmi and create a new isda master for the deal
there must be a zero floor
ie
no negative payments in the other direction
don't worry about weekend quotes yet because we may eliminate weekends and extend the term of the deal
could you begin revising
also
do the calculations work
please feel free to call me as i'm buried in my office today and things change as the day goes on
ss
let's cancel
ok
i'll send you a brief comparison of the erms/merrill isda from 0 with ena's typical isda used in 0 by the morning

thanks
sara
please let me know what you think so that nancy can forward to lawyers
ss
i just wanted to touch base with you about efforts to keep good lines of communication between b.a
and houston about trading activity in argentina and brazil
both financial and physical
i participate in randy's weekly conference calls and brent tells me that you have now undertaken that role in b.a
as you know
sometimes proposals and deals
slip through the cracks
and houston is taken by surprise
we want to remain current and proactive
please feel free to leave me an email or voice mail when you learn of any relevant activitiy
i
in turn
communicate directly with credit in houston
pat cini or rod nelson
and tax in houston
lynn aven or rick hopkinson or michael herman
if you ever feel the need for a conference call
i'm always available and i'm sure credit and tax would be glad to join
also
i hold a weekly friday conference call with brent and lynn to discuss current trading issues in argentina and brazil
thanks
sara
should we invite one of the tax lawyers to our weekly meeting to discuss new forms and answer any tax questions
ss
i am trying to distinguish these two types of entities both practically
what are we able to negotiate
and legally
what do we really need in our schedule
i am also interested in your experiences in dealing with these parties
ena's form of
municipal
schedule
the ena schedule
was essentially taken from the 0 isda u.s
municipal counterparty schedule
the isda schedule
in addition to other provisions
the isda schedule
0
adds reps designed to avoid
an orange county
type meltdown and
0
incorporates the concept of
incipient illegality
which occurs before the termination event of illegality
the
incipient illegality
concept is used in section 0
a
iii
obligations
as well as the section 0
reps
of the isda schedule
the concept is added to the section 0
b
rep
absence of event of default
potential event of default
incipient illegality
and for purposes of notifying the other party of its occurrence
interestingly enough
the ena schedule does not include the section 0
b
rep change
i think we need to add this change to ena's schedule
with respect to ious
we need to clarify our position on
regulatory development
which is actually a watered-down
incipient illegality
concept
if such an event occurs
ena should be advised of the event
notice
but
does ena really want the ability to terminate trades at mid-market
additional termination event
or simply to have this event included as part of a section 0
b
rep such that the occurrence of the event merely triggers an event of default at ena's side of the curve
for breach of the section 0
b
rep
i have found that negotiating with ious for the
notice
provision can be difficult
extracting the additional termination event is tough
arguing for a section 0
b
change may be easier
and would mirror the municipal format
i think ena really needs the ability to decide when to halt trading with a counterparty experiencing a regulatory development
which we may only learn about through notice from the counterparty
thus
i recommend that for ious
we add a notice provision and section 0
b
rep change incorporating our latest definition of
regulatory development
but we really have to negotiate for this protection
otherwise
why bother to include this additional language
what do you think
i have reviewed tana's list of north american utilities and have the following comments
0
i have tried to eliminate all governmentals and regulated entities
however
i suggest that we ask kevin leitao to take a quick review for obvious errors
however
i don't want kevin to prepare unlimited research on our behalf
i'll discuss with him
0
i suggest that we ask canadian counsel to review canadian utilities on authority/regulatory issues
in my experience
canadian outside counsel was reluctant to even comment on utilities located in provinces other than outside counsel's domicile
0
the online omnibus does not contain the isda section 0
c
rep as to absence of litigation
this rep drags in governmental bodies and all agencies
hence
a state puc
thus
online parties will rep as to authority to transact each time they trade but we will not know about potential puc issues
under the isda
a party would have to notifiy us of a
regulatory development
and we may have an event of default for failure to notify
we may also have a termination event under our current format
would someone please provide me with an explanation of the purpose of this account
thanks
sara
please see attached
thanks
sara
i hope bruce's explanation is sufficient
please call me if you have any other questions
thanks
sara
i don't know if you have spoken with susan flynn about her schedule before/after her surgery
but i have some questions that you may have already addressed
such as
has susan prepared a matrix reflecting the status of documentation
i.e
existing masters
agreements to use ena master/terminate counterparty master,etc
with the various ces counterparties
carol mentioned that she could finalize this project
will someone receive be checking susan's email and voice mail and physical mail each day
what efforts
if any
are ongoing with respect to pge
what about existing files
top tens
swiss re
any isda comparisons could be accelerated by giving directly to attorneys
who will prepare reports for legal/credit meeting
who is entering year-end deals onto lotus notes
should susan bailey handle per carol's suggestion
i'm sure that everyone in the group would appreciate a better understanding of how to handle the situation
thanks
sara
can you email a copy of the
loan and security agreement

i am following up with ms but i haven't received your answer
will advise when i hear back
ss
are the certificate
s
to be issued by bony restricted or common
sounds like restricted and to be issued in the name of pep
i think that we can lodge the physical securities at ms
in the vault
for the account of enron
holdings xii with a stock power from pep
are we headed in the same direction here
ss
you'll need this draft for later use
ss
morgan stanley has advised me this morning of the following with respect to accounts
0
the name of the account must be identical to the name of the certificate holder
0
an account holding only a certificate
s
is subject to a minimum equity requirement of usd 0,0
as the certificate holder is the brazilian company pep
the broker will require additonal equity
i am still awaiting a broker response as to whether the certificate holder can execute a stock power in favor of the account holder thereby enabling us to lodge the certificate
s
in the existing
enron brazil power holdings xii
account
alternatively
the certificate
s
can be held in the enron corp
vault
robert
when do you need to respond to bony
could someone please follow up on the status of this cp
thanks

big mistake
tana was explosive

mcisda is sprouting golden arches

i think the cp really wants to develop a long term relationship with enron and will overcome the problem
also
cp is interested in eliminating a credit support annex and will call tanya

happy new year
i was hoping you could respond to some issues raised by enron's argentine commercial group
they have told me the following
0
an association known as the
argentine association of derivatives
has developed a document currently being circulated in the argentine market for use in the near term
it is in spanish and it is not an isda
it is a
short
document
i.e
much shorter than a standard isda master agreement and isda credit support annex
0
this document is being prepared by experienced professionals
are you involved in this effort
is isda involved
perhaps we could schedule a conference call and/or you could provide me with an accurate account of any local activity in connection with the foregoing
if isda is not being used in argentina for commodity swaps and derivatives
enron needs to understand the issues and current discussions about derivatives transactions
i look forward to hearing from you
regards
sara
let's verify that this is an iou
the master should be sent to the attention of dave brown and you should advise cary of when it was sent to the customer

sara
holly krebbs just did a deal with these guys
short form
but they want to negotiate an isda
we need to send an updated form to them
will there be any credit changes
central puerto has been unresponsive to marie's requests for original documents
can someone please contact marie and help us speak with the counterparty
thanks
sara
we will need to update this isda on our new
revised
fantastic format
i'll have to find out who to send it to
ss

brent please call

ss
could this be an alternative to our recording issue
thanks
ss
attached is a short letter advising subs/affiliates of ena of existing brokerage and futures accounts
i thought these should be sent to the general counsel and cfo/treasurer of each company
please let me know your comments
frequency of review
whether any other group should monitor
etc
each attached exhibit will contain only a list of accounts
i have not included account numbers but we can do so and include any other information you consider relevant
remember
the only other
brokerage account matrix
which we have produced is a quick view of brokerage firms and enron companies
thanks
in discussing the omnibus with outside counsel on a deal
i am not clear that the definition of
loss
picks up the concept of
unpaid amounts
arguably it does
although the concept of
unpaid amounts
is built into the ect master upon which the omnibus was based for early termination for events of default but not followed through entirely for accelerated termination date
my guess is that we decided that omnibus
loss
pv of economic loss includes both past amounts owed/subsequent valuation
can you recall
can we schedule a short call on tuesday to discuss the local argentine derivatives issue
i am not free at 0
0 am or after 0:0 pm
houston
also
have you been able to confirm whether don is the man in charge in brazil
sara
great
i'll call you at 0pm houston time

can you give me a little more info on this topic
is anyone in houston involved
i just want to make certain that we haven't missed anything in the process
thanks
sara
fyi
i will be out of the office on feb
0 and 0
let me know if you want to reschedule earlier
thanks
sara
per our conversation with dan f
ena needs to understand issues related to the distinction between
investor owned utilities
or
ious
and municipal utilities
or
municipals
in connection with derivatives activity
in the u.s
this distinction enables us to treat ious as general corporates
thus
we negotiate our standard isda master with an iou
except that we add an additional termination event to prevent the iou from taking an adverse stance in its state public utility commission proceedings
a copy of that additional termination event is attached for your review
our approach with respect to municipals is dramatically different
when negotiating an isda master with municipals
we use a schedule modeled after the 0 u.s
municipal counterparty schedule
having additional reps
the added concept of
incipient illegality
and an enforceability opinion
a copy of that schedule is also attached for your reference
we would like to understand whether this distinction also exists in canada
and if so
in all canadian provinces
and whether there is a distinction when a municipal is an investor in an iou
as we understand that the government may assist a utility to emerge from bankruptcy
in that regard
would you recommend that ena use distinct isda schedules for these types of entities and/or would you recommend specific changes to our format
should we be entrenched in this type of activity
i'm not even sure that we find out about all of esa's ideas
sara
what is the issue
i have no idea if anyone is looking at this
sara
it sure sounds like you have your hands full with the restructuring
i have been trying to get a better grasp of the deal flow in brazil through some type of
deal report
in houston and argentina
the business groups circulate a transaction listing
also
legal in both houston and argentina circulate a listing from legal's perspective
is a commercial team deal report circulated weekly in brazil
and if so
can i be added to the circulation
i will ask randy if he can circulate his list
it would be helpful for me when we have our weekly conference call
in that regard
what is
alcan
the ppa which may eventually serve as a template
i am glad to prepare some type of module as randy suggested which sets forth basic enron corp
and/or trading policy as to certain issues
force majeure
governing law
dispute resolution
damages
etc
let's coordinate for the seminar which you are organizing for march
thanks
sara
looks like he's an expat in singapore
definitely thursday or friday
just let me know so that i don't leave and lock it up
just wondering if you had a chance to comment on the

i would appreciate your input
i'll be out of the office feb

shari stack is negotiating the brokerage agreement with banc one and there seems to be an issue over the interest rate
needless to say
i have never had any conversations with banc one over this issue
ss
carol
i'm glad you've identified these specific line items
i think credit should have a
separate worksheet
and make a determination for each question you've listed
for exampe
i think the gp should be a specified entity
one issue i've experienced with credit is the existence of several lps in a given structure
only one of which owns any operating assets
and there are no financials for that lp
but only financials on a consolidated basis at a different level
how does credit identify the counterparty
much less determine if that counterparty is an esp
i also wonder how many partnerships we have agreements with which may be inadequate
and
when credit approves omnibus transactions with a partnership
is it making a sufficient analysis
a separate list would help in the evaluation
are we going to have another credit lunch
hope all is going well

in brazil
only sami arap

other transactions

per our conversation
brent
attached is a draft memo that lynn and i prepared
we would appreciate your comments
also
who else do you think should be a recipient of this memo
should we prepare a separate
action plan
or strategy to submit to mike
you may recall in our meeting of friday last that mike committed to assess the long term situation in ba
at least i think that's what he agreed to do
and we
foolishly
committed to prepare a review of our activity in ba
maybe we can discuss on friday morning at 0 am
houston
0 pm
ba
let us know if you have any questions
i believe that lynn is in a seminar on thursday
sara
susan

brent
sorry for my poor
attaching abilities
hopefully we will have a lot to discuss tomorrow
lynn has a suggested the use of a separate
action list
to present to mike
ss
the transaction must get papered whether its gtc's or a deemed isda
the convention in the physical world
as i understand it
is that the seller sends its paper
ss
by letter dated 0/0/0
tembec inc
has requested the transfer of
contract no
ej0.0
dated 0/0/0 to the national bank of canada pursuant to section 0 of the isda master

0
but with q0 payment to be made to tembec
we do have a master with the national bank of canada

mother sure is talkative these days
hope all is well sass
lynn aven and i are in the process of finalizing a memo on the argentina trip and we will also have a separate list of

susan is out of the office most of this week
ss
greetings to you both
it has been awhile since we last spoke
i would like to finalize the matrix which we have been discussing since the latter part of 0
although we were awaiting new central bank regulations
i am beginning to think that the central bank revisions will not impact the matrix except with respect to transactions which may be entered into by entities that are the subject of the central bank regulations
please let me know whether or not you agree or can offer any suggestions
thanks and regards
sara

thanks
sara
please review and call me
patricia
i can't thank you enough for arranging the many meetings and introductions for the enron legal group
lynn and i are extremely grateful as it made our lives much easier and our jobs much more productive
as always
i am impressed with the variety and number of individuals with whom you are so well connected
at the moment
we are trying to finalize an internal memorandum addressing the breadth of the tax issues currently affecting our business in argentina
i would appreciate your comment on the following two items
0
can you cite the law that provides the exemption or modification
not sure which it is
that
financial institutions
are taxed
gross receipts
on the spread
is it possible to see a copy
i can probably have it translated
0
i am unclear as to how the stamp tax would be calculated with respect to argentine local parties to an isda master agreement
crossborder trades
or a local master swap agreement
local trades
execution of the master agreement itself does not evidence any transaction
even when any transaction is executed
you are unable to determine net payments owed by either party until termination of the deal
brent thinks that the tax will be based on the product of the
fixed price x volume x term
even though the master agreement will merely provide for netting
can you verify
give my regards to pablo
i look forward to hearing from you
regards
sara
attached is redrafted language which can
stand alone
or we can also incorporate the chart
jared
i think you have some prior language we can use
and we may have to rename one or two parts of the chart
ss
ok
i have reviewed lawhill and aig funds
marie is making changes and the goal is to get blacklines of aig to rod today

i can attend enron north america corp
sheila glover has requested that david vitrella be designated as a second
authorized trader
for the enron communications investments corp
account which was recently opened with morgan
having as its purpose the sale of rhythms stock
the rationale for a second trader is not new to us
in john greene's absence
no one is authorized to trade in that account
it is my understanding that the only activity to occur in this account is the sale of this particular stock which will be
dribbled in
periodically
please let me know if you have any questions
both donna and sheila are very familiar with this transaction
sara
pablo
i am forwarding this message that i send to patricia last week

regards
sara
as we all know
the tbs/enron south america llc
esa
confirmation issue is draining our little brains
let's all conference sometime monday to sort through how these trades should be documented

an inappropriate vehicle for holding trades
maybe one or two trades is o.k
also
any esa documents must be executed in the u.s

i haven't heard a peep about this deal until this email
you may want to check with someone on the weather desk

marty
i will have a response to setoff shortly
with respect to the csa and calculation of the
credit support amount
our change should not create any inconsistencies in the calculation of that amount among your counterparties since it would only change if the calculation yielded a negative number
the only reason for
specifying otherwise
in paragraph 0 is to capture the situation where the pledgor might be holding independent amounts
if there are ever any specified in a particular transaction
of the secured party as cushion
which is not meant to be returned until termination of transactions
and subtraction of that amount would create a negative number when calculating the credit support amount
by specifying that the credit support amount will be
the higher of
the amount calculated
deemed to be zero if a negative number
or the sum of the pledgor's independent amounts
the latter would prevail
this calculation method will make a difference if
for example
the secured party asks for a return amount when the pledgor intends to retain any independent amounts as cushion
such that only posted credit support exceeding the sum of the independent amounts will be returned
i hope this helps
sara
yes
please review and let's discuss
ss
mark
how should we handle this
in the past

i left you a voice mail earlier this week on the single outstanding issue
paragraph
b
of our setoff language
this provision allows the nondefaulting party to withhold any payment it might owe to the defaulting party under the master until the nondefaulting party can be certain in its reasonable discretion that any other payments owed to it
under any other agreements between the parties
by the defaulting party have been paid
cargill does not want to
comingle
its business
remember
we have already given in on
affiliate setoff
the lawyer never raised the paragraph
b
issue until this week
also
cargill has requested that we change our credit support amount definition

and cargill has decided to issue transferable l/c's
please let me hear from you so that we can finalize
i do not know if this is a deal breaker

a message from my crazy sister
hey
sam
great to hear from you and i'm thrilled that your golf game is as good as ever
have you been playing in palm springs or amelia island or the boulders
i was in phoenix last year and thought it was wonderful except for the fact that people age faster
i didn't go to baton rouge for passover since the seders were in the middle of the week
but i know that my sister ordered everything from the second avenue deli in n.y
and various other manhattan establishments
my niece has been accepted at that high school in natchitoches for smart kids and deb is really happy

my parents are fine and my dad is going to have a knee-cap replacement sometime soon

i've decided on in-house training for my dogs and the trainer thinks that chloe needs the most
help

otherwise

we are almost done but pg&e's lawyer has been so busy that we were unable to schedule a call last week
i will send her some suggested comments
tonight

there aren't any problems
sara
fyi new request
what about our master tax agreement
do you need to pass this on to greg
harry arora
e-commerce group
wants to take a look at goldman's online trading operation
his motive is to explore/navigate the site during the next 0 days
but not trade
i told harry that i would need to review the agreement and negotiate with goldman just as i would any agreement in order to not set any precedent with goldman for future agreements
although harry does not intend to trade at all
and we could terminate the agreement when he is done
i suppose gary may want to trade with goldman online in the future
we could negotiate another agreement at a later date
let me know if you would agree to accept goldman's agreement
as is
for the limited purpose of allowing harry to navigate the site
with the intention of terminating the agreement when he is done
although ena would have a password
access could be limited to harry
and whomever he needs to assist
please let me know your decision
thanks
sara
ed
jason peters is an a&k lawyer working with us for about six weeks and he's helping on these agreements

your voice mail does not work
if your phone calls roll over to an assistant or i try to leave you a voice mail
i cannot get there
please call or stop by
sara
robert
susan flynn told me that your client is objecting to the deletion of the first part of the first sentence in the
setoff
language
i just wanted to explain why we are requesting this change
in reviewing our forms during the latter part of 0
we made a number of changes to both our isda schedule and csa
one of these changes was the deletion of the preamble language contained in the setoff provision
we concluded that the phrase
without affecting
all payments will be made without setoff
provided
however
actually negated the effect of setoff which we want to occur upon the designation or the deemed designation of an early termination date
what purpose do you think the phrase serves if left in the setoff provision
please feel free to give me a call at 0/0-0
thanks
sara
i used the wrong email address

i am keeping dummy files until these are finalized
kaye
would you please schedule a meeting with john suttle to discuss harvard
one hour will be fine
thanks
sara
susan
i wanted to clarify whether enron australia pty
ltd
needs to execute isda master agreements with the same counterparties which already have agreements with ena
and vice versa
as an example
i can only rely upon tax advice ena has previously received in connection with the services agreement between ena and ect canada
for book and tax purposes
the trade is recorded on the risk books of the enron affilate ultimately booking the trade but the transaction is actually documented in the name of the enron affiliate having the master agreement with the counterpary
the enron affiliate having the master agreement with the counterparty then transacts with risk management
trading corp
through a bulk swap arrangement
the credit risk remains with risk management
trading corp
through an internal back to back transaction with the
booking
enron affiliate
for which the
booking
enron affiliate will presumably pay a fee pursuant to the services agreement
consider
ena is negotiating an agreement with commonwealth bank of australia
will enron australia require a separate master with commonwealth bank of australia
or will the services agreement permit the hereinabove described arrangement
that's fine but i have to leave shortly before 0 tomorrow
sara
i'm on the conference call now
john novak suggested that you
he and frederico speak
it sounds like commercial and credit need to iron this out together
john is in his office now and the call usually takes about an hour
sara
and i also need a file for
goldman sachs
co
electronic agreement
mark
thanks so much for your explanation earlier today
just one more question
please
is arbitration or litigation the preferance under english law
how often do you negotiate to the contrary
thanks
sara
hey
julian
susan is working on it now
ss
afac and marcelo

susan
would you please follow up with bridgeline now as i am preparing a futures agreement for them
we need them to get their act together
thanks
sara
tanya
there's no short answer with these people
i think we are fine with their setoff language
part a only
because the ndp always has the option to permit setoff to other agreements between the parties as to amounts payable by the payee to the payer
where the payer owes money under the isda to the payee
so here's my recommendation
0
call your friend andre and hear what he has to say
he has some kind of suggestion about part
b
and limiting the ndp's payment to the dp to be based upon satisfaction that
nondisputed
amounts having been paid by the dp
will he also raise the
other agreements
issue here
not a clue
0
if cargill leaves part a in tact and we agree to change part b
i'm fine
i'm fine without part b
actually
0
the potential problem is that cargill and ena view part a differently
right off the bat
i think cargill is wrong because they don't read part a as applying to
other agreements between the parties
but cargill proposed part a and it does apply to
other agreememts between the parties
i don't want to start off on the wrong foot so i'm sure i'll have to discuss this again with marty
thanks for your continued help
sara

need to be consistent for both parties

sara
i would only add the ongoing cash collateral issue in canada
and run spell check
we recently did about 0 weather trades with vitol and i
confirmed
these under the 0 energy price swap master
bad for weather
but incorporated isda definitions
i think we should work toward replacing this master with an isda to eliminate the problem
we did the same with aquila which solved the weather problem
and i realize the aquila is a bigger trading partner than vitol
can someone generate credit
thanks
sara

when we are ready to execute documents

there is a 0 day true up with a 0 day notification period after the correction is announced
upon notification by a party
there is a 0 business day period for payment
this language tracks the isda so that our approach in each instance will be identical

barbara gray and shonnie daniel worked on a q0 deal between enron and texaco to create a jv called bl
i believe that the ownership is 0/0
respectively
bl has its own employees drawn from both companies and elsewhere but is still requiring additional services
the swap group has already opened two futures accounts for bl and drafted resolutions
authorized trader lists
etc
before the closing
there was an
understanding
that enron would assist bl for a short time
until june
0
however
credit
through bill bradford
negotiated a 0-year services agreement for credit services to bl
i believe based upon 0 full-time person run through an entire budget
randy curry
bl's president
has requested that legal
swaps group
consider a short-term services arrangement
i am told by credit this would be for approx
0-0 months
bl looking for approx
0 isda's
by the way
ena is trying to negotiate an isda with bl but we have no one to negotiate with
bl has not yet hired an in-house lawyer
are you interested in pursuing this request
sara
carol
laurel adams was wondering whether any of the paralegal candidates who we interviewed might have a good background for
back office
duties
i have no idea whether salaries are comparable but she needs someone who can spot issues and learn the confirm process at the same time
if no experience in the confirmation area
what do you think
sara
carol
i've been meeting with jarrod about confirm templates
prior to the departures of shari
lynda
et al
there was a move afoot to create an annex of weather definitions which could be incorporated by reference into the confirms
or added to the schedule
either of which approaches would shorten the confirms considerably
jarrod advises that the eol t&c's for the varioius weather products contain the basic information which can be drafted in the annex
jarrod will send us the eol t&c's
i think it's a great idea
jarrod will also send the existing weather templates
which may be slightly different from those shari gave us earlier
we should verify that the weather rep appears in the weather option templates
since we have agreed to remove that rep from the schedule
also
shouldn't we verify that all weather trades are executed under ny law
they probably are anyway
since we now have the opinion from the ny office of general counsel
sara
kelly
ena is opening a margin line with bank one to facilitate nymex trading through the bank one broker

gareth
my comments are generally directed toward the schedule to the isda master agreement between the trust and ubs
please note that ubs is aware of the 0/0/0 master executed between swiss bank corporation and ena
as it was attached to the original fax
the confirms are pretty straightforward
0
is the trust an eligible swap participant
0
the schedule is missing some
standard
enron type provisions
which were in the swiss bank master
these include
limitation of liability confidentiality setoff isn't the trust an enron affiliate
this could impact our approach
0
enron does not agree to the isda standard jurisdiction language
which is non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of ny state and the federal court in manhattan
waiver of all objections
enron's preference is arbitration
with gc consent
we agree to other provisions
e.g
specifice courts
waiver of jury trial
so specific court and no waiver of objections
etc
in the swiss bank master
we agreed to ny law
neither party waived any objections to venue/forum
and parties could sue anywhere
0
is this master to be limited to this transaction only
if the trust intends to use this agreement for future currency
rate
or other transactions
we need to consider the impact of caving on our usual terms
what eventually happens to the trust
also
rod nelson in credit is currently reviewing enron exposure to ubs
call if you need anything else
sara
susan
would you please contact this party to see if they have comments
jennifer says they are ready to sign
we are having a guaranty problem and that's why this party has come up

this is another clint freeland/jeff nogid push for fastow
thanks

jeff and larry
last year
mary gosnell prepared a one page summary which was used by legal and credit to target the preparation of isda master agreements
the summary was divided into two parts
without master agreements
and
with ect master agreements
and included the number of trades for the first half of the year
it is our objective once again to put new agreements into place and upgrade existing ect master agreements to isda master agreements
i don't know if eol trades have impacted the numbers this year and i'm not sure whether we need to create a line item for eol
i'll leave that to your discretion
please let me know if you have any questions
thanks
sara p.s
we were very successful in negotiating masters appearing on mary's list
jarrod

who will handle credit derivatives in your absence
carol
i missed this deal the other day which was originally assigned to marie
in our last legal/credit meeting
brant was going to call christina tice
the cp credit manager
maybe this is a good one for tana to stay on top of brant
your name is on this one
also
nothing happened with credit on friday
although richard inquired about palladium
i let him know that we drew on the lc's last week
according to tanya
sara
rod
and what lawyer is handling this in your presence
this is beginning to sound like koch and all of the koch separate trading entities
my brain is full now
i am a derivatives lawyer with ena in houston and obtained your name through one of my traders who is transacting with jay carr in houston
please see attached message below
when i spoke with jay earlier this month
i asked him for the name of a lawyer but was advised that all vitol lawyers were in new york and that he would pass my message along to a lawyer
i am assuming that you are the trading lawyer who can assist me with negotiating an isda master agreement between our respective companies
if not
please let me know and feel free to pass this message on to the appropriate attorney
on april 0
0
enron capital
trade resources corp
predecessor in title to ena
and vitol s.a
inc
entered into a master agreement which is one of ena's early energy price swap agreements
since our companies are currently trading weather derivatives
i think you would agree that it would be prudent to supersede the existing agreement with an isda master agreement
this relates to my conversation with jay in that we confirmed our weather deals under the existing master but incorporated the 0 and 0 isda definitions into the confirms of our weather trades
please let me hear from you

thanks

tanya
please talk to either carol or tana
maybe they need commercial help to get the guaranty
ss
tanya
please see vitol response below
do you generate the credit worksheet
how does london credit fit in here
another interesting feature here is the use of the multibranch provision for a trading company
vitol isn't a bank
or is it
i have never seen this utilized in practice for a non-bank entity and have resisted the idea for us
there is very little written about the application of the multibranch party and i think that is because it has been understood as applying to banks
however
would this master be a
multibranch master
for us as well
sara
tanya
another vitol message
you'd better be back in town

thank you for the confirmation
i assume that i am not charged until you ship

effective 0
agreement executed between erms and merrill lynch capital services

old isda
this was done to accommadate the merrill lawyer
gary rosenblum
who didn't want to read our schedule
the old isda is not identical to the format used by merrill lynch international today so i'm not sure how hard they will press for other changes
there are two potential credit issues that i see
0
agreement as to the enron corp
guaranty cap
and possible merrill lynch guaranty cap
and
0
our introduction of a mac provision in the form of an additional event of default
necessary because the old isda had a credit support annex and this one does not
i left a voice mail for gary rosenblum and asked that he let me know when he was available on monday to talk and to have his credit person contact rod nelson

sara
rod
what's going on with this dudes
they just sent me a huge agreement relating to their arrangement with the international finance corp
and hedging agreements
sara
for all options for this party
we need to revise the opening sentence to read
the terms and conditions of the transaction
on the trade date specified below
the
transaction
which is an option offered by small ventures usa
llc to ena
and accepted by ena
pursuant to a telephone conversation between the parties
i believe this to be true
i spoke with the utilicorp lawyer when i documented the
australian
weather trade and discussed transfer of the weather deal to the new master
we should talk to our aquila trader
stewart
i'll have to review their master to be certain
and insure that there is no specific prohibition against weather transactions
in general
there is nothing else required specifically
although we may have to add some language to the weather confirmations themselves
sara
please see attached
also
i need to speak with you about brokerage business
it's exceeding swap/derivative work
sara

john sent the email to all paralegals after he and i spoke in the morning
0/0
since we didn't know who would handle
i remember
now
i checked the log in book while susan was at lunch and it wasn't there so when i asked her about it
she told me she was holding a prior confirm for twister
apparently inactive until further notice
and she was now going to handle this one
i reminded her that i was leaving early to fly to no so that i'd have enough time to review
the rest is history
sara
the aaa program was credit lyonnais

sara
please print out the
swap

thanks
sara
fyi
this may be a duplicate
please print from swap 0 to the end
thanks
ss
jen
this is a good question and i think that the pg&e lawyer may be confused here with instructions to her traders
the pg&e trader can call either an ecc or ena trader but a transaction will always be booked and confirmed in the name of ena under the executed ena isda master agreement with pg&e
for internal purposes
the trade will either remain on an ena book or backed to an ecc book
i hope this answers your question
sara
david
thank you for the email
i left a message for you to call
let me know what's convenient and i'll make myself available
because we were trying to make the language generic enough to include all future products which might fall into this category
we considered the following
alternative 0
for purposes of any transaction in a commodity for which there is either no market or for which the market is illiquid
party b recognizes that
i
this market is less liquid than other otc derivatives alternative 0
for purposes of any transaction in which the relevant commodity is traded in a market that is newer or less liquid than other otc derivatives markets
party b recognizes that
i
such market is newer or less liquid than other otc derivatives markets
we also considered adding some type of statement that specifies newer products without limiting future applicability
i.e
including but not limited to paper and pulp
also
newer market
may not mean illiquid
no market
could mean that we are the only market maker
your language places the onus on us to continually identify these illiquid products either in the schedule
by amendment to the schedule or in a separate writing
can we please discuss
i am free all afternoon
thanks
sara
we are continuing to send deemed isda's to this entity
periodically
and have transacted with other glencore entities in the past
i would like to generate a draft isda and send to these guys because it will make our life easier
and we say as much in a deemed isda
thanks
sara
gary
i believe we are having our guaranty executed
we haven't seen the draft of yours
please send asap
how long will it take for you to execute
sara
can you supply with an addressee list for potential closure of any futures accounts
there are currently about seven inactive accounts for all types of commodities
thanks
sara

when speaking with you earlier
i completely forgot to mention that carol st
clair

0
will be addressing eol issues arising in connection with enron mexico corp
please forgive me
i know that carol is trying to finalize communications with our outside counsel in mexico
it may be helpful for you to have a conversation with her about your goals
etc
for her to include in her discussions
i am still handling financial derivatives matters in general for mexico
please let me hear from you and i look forward to meeting with you later this week
regards
sara
please let me know if the attached guaranty is identical to the original incoming guaranty in the other merrill file
we're trying to execute today or tomorrow
yes
my other question to gary was how quickly can you have the guaranty executed
susan
this guaranty came from the lawyer
use this instead of the earlier version
ss
jaime
carol and i are available on tuesday
june 0 from 0 am
0:0 am and after 0 pm
please let us hear from you
and who should initiate the call
thanks
sara
this provision is an election which we have added to the schedule for governmental entities
i believe that it is intended to eliminate any confusion that historically arose during the debate between
first method
one-way payments
and
second method
two-way payments
for early termination purposes
although i can't find a good reason to continue to use this provision with an isda
except that it emphasizes the point
i can understand why we may have added it to a pre-isda agreement with a governmental
the only example that i could locate was our september 0
0 master agreement with reedy creek improvement district
for those of you who have never seen this form
it was one of the two types of master agreements developed by ect before we became conversant with isda
because these forms didn't contemplate municipal counterparties
we had to add many of the isda u.s
municipal counterparty schedule provisions
the part 0
b
k
provision originally appeared in this early agreement
it was included in the
event of change
section
0f
0
which is tantamount to the isda concept of
illegality
a
termination event
i think it was probably included because in the isda
second method is the automatic payment method if the parties fail to make a specific designation for early termination purposes
but there isn't a comparable provision in the old ect form
fyi
sheetal
please note that ena will always want to include an annex b with this counterparty
legal will need to review each time
thanks

i think you are trying to avoid me
hope all is well and you are just overworked and overwhelmed
i am now working with moazzam khoja in houston who is part of the enroncredit.com group most of which
as i understand
is located in london
in connection with that group's activities
i have some questions and all fingers point to you
0
do you have credit derivative research that may be applicable for credit derivative transactions
including your online
bankruptcy swap
in the us
i am sure that you've already explored the
insurance
issue and i don't want to duplicate reasearch
if possible
0
what forms have you devised
are they online
should i just grab a password
0
are the enroncredit.com traders in the uk required by the sfa to take an sfa exam
i'm guessing it's a broker or securities exam
is trading in credit derivatives regulated
or regulated differently than other types of derivatives
i am trying to determine whether moazzam needs to take the series 0 here in the us
our traders taking that exam must be dealing in
securites
for that exam to be necessary
0
where is enroncredit.com headed
i would very much appreciate your
prompt

i provided you with a list of the types of transactions originating in kinneman's group by ect investments
do these guys ever need to communicate with credit
how do you monitor
please let me know who i should be speaking with about these transactions
do you think that we should give susan b
susan f
and tana an expression of thanks for their work during marie's departure
i was thinking that a gift certificate would be appropriate
e.g
spa services
enron gift products
etc
and it might send the message that we do know and appreciate their efforts
sara
i made some changes to the language below assuming use for an isda
my onlproblem is that i am not certain that the ipe description is what we use
i'll defer to your verification
but it appears each monthly calculationincorporates pricing from three different delivery month contracts
sara p.s
i would like a copy of the platt's marketwire if you can locate

the market for this transaction is less liquid than other otc derivatives markets and
accordingly
this transaction may be subject to greater risk than other derivatives transactions
this should be added to the confirm as
i
numbered paragraph 0 for the isda confirm
ii
the second sentence
opening paragraph
of the omnibus
i guess you know that mark was inquiring as to who had ordered these
i'd like a copy of the japanese materials
thanks
sara
mark
in connection with susan f.'s departure
could you please provide a copy of her
project list
so that we can follow up on finalizing/redistributing her workload
i have lots of questions which i'm sure can't be answered this minute
such as
shouldn't we help to prioritize her work
will she continue day-to-day work
who will take confirm desk calls
how will this impact samantha's training
maybe the lawyers should be involved now
etc
please let us know when you'd like to
regroup
thanks
sara
all
attached are bob's comments
i have not yet reviewed but will do soshortly
we're making progress on the masters
and it will be important ttrack all equity confirmations
i would appreciate your advising me whenever enron corp
transacts derivatives/forwards
whether in the name of enron corp
or ena
on a timely basis
this will obvioiusly eliminate delays inreviewing the language and will make it easier to speak with both rex andbob

after execution of the assignment
the trades will be between ena and hs energy services
inc
subject to the isda which we are now negotiating
the second doc is an appendix consisting of 0 trades and i have asked the desk to confirm that these are the only outstanding trades
0
the second set
last two docs
is an assignment of trades between j
aron
company and hs energy services
inc
after execution of the assignment
the trades will be between j.aron
company and ena subject to the 0/0/0 j.aron/ena isda
the fourth doc is an appendix of all existing trades between j.aron/hs energy services
inc
i have no idea where this came from but i assume it is part of your agreement with hs
who is verifying the trades and are all trade terms acceptable
presently
the assignment is drafted such that a conflict between the master and a confirm will be governed by the master
tana
jason still does not have access to the financial trading dababase

here's the language suggested by merrill for use in ndf's
i am not familiar with the frequency of our trades
but i'm sure laurel can fill in the blanks
i thought that the process being implemented by the emta seemed reasonable but let me know if this is a fallback that you would agree to use if the ptax rate is not available for settltment
thanks
sara
sheila
looks like rafael never read the email that susan flynn sent to nancy a few days ago
i don't know where this stands

we are
cleaning up
some of the language as it was based on the prior arco deal
when we were ect
please note that enron corp
previously provided a guaranty
i am not certain whether that guaranty is tied to the transaction specifically and i'll try to track down
will ena provide a parent guaranty for the new transaction
please let me know
thanks
sara
joe
attached in draft form is a transaction that chris foster may do with arco today
his number in portland is 0-0
i'm not certain about credit and

sara
jarrod
attached is language which should be added to all paper and pulp omnibus confirms

also
attached is the temple-inland confirm and i have changed only the
credit or other special provisions
paragraph
you will have to attach exhibit
a
which susan sent you last week
p.s
please verify with credit the timing for delivery of the guaranty
i believe that paul told me by wednesday
tana

sara
global finance
susan
steve morus called again and asked that you please email the schedule/csa for comment
thanks
sara
attached are comments
and note that you do not need the defined term
agreement
in the opening paragraph
i do not understand your
notice of exercise
because it describes an option to extend
please call
you are most welcome
hope the food is as good as the other get together
ss
when will you have some time to discuss
a
templates and
b
short dated trades
kevin
we are holding up the execution of the isda master agreement until you finalize your piece
the date of the earliest trade between ena and hs resources is important because we will use that date for the isda
please verify that date as soon as possible
thanks
sara
susan
which paribas are you referring to
please call
i'd like copy of final media general
also
we need to discuss the notice
sara
please see the attachment for a specific definition of eligible swap participant and the trade option exemption
from a legal perspective and to avoid scrutiny and regulation by the commodity futures trading commission
ena must always comply with the trade option exemption when entering into options
as buyer or seller
with a third party
some of ena's trading parties cannot satisfy this exemption from regulation because they are not a producer/merchant handling the underlying commodity
such as banks
hedge funds
etc
even though they may be entering into the transaction for business purposes
if that situation occurs
ena must always be the offeree of the option
as buyer or seller
and ena cannot solicit the party to enter into the transaction
if ena's trading partner fails to satisfy the trade option exemption
our confirmation will explicitly state that ena was offered the option to buy or sell by the counterparty
please call me if you have any questions
thanks
sara
ena legal
john
please call me when you have had a chance to review
sara
susan

before i forget
please document the account in london with csfb that we used to receive money in connection with metals trading
all
attached is a short recap of the items which i have been discussing with clint and jeff
i'd like to get together sometime today or tomorrow
rex and jim
i will fax to you copies of the enron corp
resolutions
some final
some draft only
referenced in the attached summary
i may not have the latest information and perhaps you can update and address when we meet
please call me with a suggested time
this afternoon is best for me
trena
in the next week or so
i will be devoting most of my time and attention to gary's world
i met with gary last week

i am available for whatever you might need me for
my number in houston is 0/0-0

my apologies for asking again
thanks
sara
at last
thursday morning at 0:0 am
rex rogers and jim armogida will meet with me in my office
you are invited
i suspect that much of our conversation will be a repeat of the meeting that you had last week
sara
rod and i discussed this party
which always appears on the legal/credit list
it seem that bp signed a master agreement
our old form
with ectric on 0/0/0 and agreed to sign the identical agreement with ena
absent an executed agreement
ena and bp continue to use a form of
swap contract
which had been agreed to many years ago
similar to our gtc's in the omnibus
which also provides that the parties will negotiate a master agreement
rod doesn't see much current trading activity so we didn't believe this to be a high priority
having said all of this
the form is limited to swaps
doesn't provide for setoff
arbitration
certain market disruption events and several other items which we can review if necessary
please let me know how you would like to proceed
thanks
sara
please advise
sara
here's the email
and thanks for your help this morning
sara
carson
i have been pretty awful

0
i thought that you were going to produce a new draft based upon our discussion
please let me know if i misunderstood or if in fact the ball is in my court
thanks
sara
james
please ignore my earlier email
i do have your email of 0/0/0 and will respond as quickly as possible
thanks
sara
susan
which paribas are you referring to
all
it appears that this is the group which can best address the
derivatives
issues which may arise when enron corp
attempts to enter into equity swaps/options/forwards based upon enron corp
stock
we have all undertaken to provide the group with the following items
0
procedures for executing/documenting/unwinding enron corp
equity derivatives
clint has already circulated a draft proposal
comments are invited
0
the transacting party
ena
with an enron corp
guaranty
or enron corp
rex has no preference and credit's initial response was to consolidate trading in ena
i will revisit this issue with bill bradford
0
enron corp
equity trading resolution rex and jim will handle the drafting and logistics
this will be necessary if enron corp
is the trading party because the counterparty will want to review
and equity trading requires authorization
and also necessary if ena is the trading party because equity trading requires authorization
0
standard form of registration rights agreement rex and jim will handle the drafting
this can be used as our
form
for future transactions
0
enron corp
position paper
addressing equity derivative parameters
preferable methods of settlement
registration rights
etc
i have no volunteers
maybe bob baird needs an assignment
as you know
there are several outstanding confirms which require immediate attention before the foregoing items can be finalized
please let me know if we can establish a timetable for completion of this project
thanks for your help
sara
bill
i have previously discussed this issue with rod
i would like to revisit once again
these transactions include swaps/options/forwards on ene stock
there is a renewed effort coming from treasury to use these tools more frequently than in the past
i am in touch with rex rogers
enron corp
securities lawyer
as registration rights issues on ene stock are definitely involved
our counterparties are telling us that they prefer to look to enron corp
since it is enron corp.'s stock that is involved
at a minimun
even if ena were the trading counterparty
with an enron corp
guaranty capped at an appropriate level
enron corp
would probably have to sign each confirmation as issuer of the stock
and ena cannot make those agreements on behalf of enron corp
i would like to discuss asap as we are in the midst of negotiations with csfb international
ubs ag
morgan stanley capital services
inc
and lehman brothers finance s.a
where does this stand
have you received the guaranty from clem
all
i spoke with bill bradford to get the global credit perspective
and
he is entirely neutral
however
he agreed that it made sense for enron corp
to transact on its own stock
i am prepared to draft new isda master agreements with our remaining potential targets in the name of
enron corp
without credit support annexes
upon execution
the parties generally exchange evidence of authority
i.e
resolution or excerpt thereof
the outstanding confirms are in the name of enron corp
these are
deemed isda's
and no party has asked for evidence of authority
although the parties do represent that they have such authority
please let me hear from you if someone objects to the use of enron corp
thanks
sara
has mark spoken with you yet about latin america
let's talk
sara
susan
please forward your two emails

on a
swap
related note
we have a canadian party requesting the ability to post cash collateral to ena
can you recall where we left off on the issue
i seem to remember conflicting advice
peter's insistence upon the stikeman memo and ena simply not agreeing to accept cash
and uncertainty as to how ena could perfect its interest and what law governs
in cash held in a u.s
account
0
on a
credit
related note
i was forwarded the 0/0/0 margin exception report
originally sent to your attention
what were you doing to follow up on this report
yesterday
mary gave me a copy of a

sara p.s
can you send photos over the net
clint
after the meeting
jim advised me that the ene board resolution will be drafted for the oct
meeting
in the interim
he is convinced that only enron corp
should be a swap party to these equity swaps
forwards
etc
i am going to speak with rod nelson
credit
and make some changes to our approach
this should also make life easier negotiating with lehman and bear
from a credit perspecttive
but we'll reach an obvious stalemate when they ask for an enron corp
resolution
forthcoming after the relevant board meeting
sara
mary
please let me know what happens
all calculations should be made as of a specific date
sara
cathy and i left a message for per since he originates hedge funds
ss
ken
in connection with our new product
and absence of any physical activity in that product
i have the following question
if neither ena nor its counterparty is able to qualify as an offeree for purposes of the trade option exemption
0 cfr sec
0.0
as amended
but each is an eligible swap participant
or better yet
each party has $0 million in net worth as per sec
0.0
can the option still be exempt from cftc regulation under the swap policy statement or any cftc interpretive letters
i have concerns about not relying fully on the trade option exemption but i also understood that the cftc has informally said that the swap policy statement provides a safe harbor for both swaps and options
i am available to speak at your convenience
thanks
sara

mary
i hear through the grapevine that we may be trading through bank one

thanks
sara
edmund

i have questions
also
i wouldkindly appreciate your response on morgan stanley
thanks
sara
the attached confirm is a swap
there is no need for a rep in the confirm

sara
the london office is forwarding recent legal advice from our lawyers in south africa regarding fx clearances
it seems that prior to transacting with a south african party
we need copies of the party's
certification
from the national bank allowing the party to make payments out of the country

such approvals are severely restricted
i will forward the memos to susan bailey for inclusion in our

brent
in connection with the
research memoranda
which i gave to you
the specific issue about whether ena can hold cash collateral posted by a canadian party has arisen in connection with a company named j.d

ena legal has spoken with peter keohane
two canadian law firms and one us law firm
and previously concluded that it was easier to simply not accept cash

i am currently reviewing about 0-0 of these agreements
how should we handle review of the referenced agreements originating from houston

i look forward to hearing from you
sara
sheila
mike fowler is involved in this effort
he tells me that the entity is
enroncredit.com limited
is this info correct
sara
mary
after our last credit meeting
russell's idea of
following up
on this counterparty was to assign it to ed sacks
can you please work with ed
this is one of carol's files
once negotiated
it will serve as the basis for reliant energy services canada ltd
thanks
sara
please print on legal
kaye
please remind me on monday of this

thanks
hope you had a great weekend
sara
mark
i am totally confused
who is addressing cftc issues for mg london
inc
what is alan's involvement
ss
good morning david
just hoping that you could have the confirm sent this morning
i need to review with the commercial guys
thanks
sara
edmund
did you ever have a chance to run my language by your trader
sara
molly
i left you a voice mail this morning about citibank
the file reflects that you received correspondence from citibank on 0/0/0 and carol st
clair had propsed revisions to the existing 0/0/0 isda master agreement
including changes to the csa
have you agreed to those changes
the australia office is inquiring about the status of this master agreement
thanks
sara
i am not aware of the nuances of copper trading
however
i left a message earlier this morning to find out from the mg lawyer
i haven't heard back
the deal ticket should provide for the premium payment date and
if not
i would use our standard language
sara
here it is
molly
i'll send to you the latest draft
shane is looking to do a rate swap and that is fine without fx amendments
but
shouldn't we verify whether our business will include fx
or did you already confirm
thanks
sara
all
i am trying to determine what issues are currently being addressed with respect to mg london
inc
from a u.s
regulatory perspective and who is addressing them
my concern arises from questions i am being asked by gary hickerson's group regarding fx trading and
agricultural
trading where the existence of an enron fcm or cta could become significant
i will try to have a short call arranged so that we can all understand the planned course of action
etc
i realize that other individuals may be involved and we can include them as necessary
thanks
sara
david
i'm just reviewing your fax and although your recap of the floating rate calculation was correct on the phone
there is no language in the confirm
were you going to respond to this as well
interest rate to apply to reduced notional
etc
all
0
please provide the name of the enron party to this agreement
if it is the london credit group
we need to verify authority to execute
i never heard back from paul simons
0
what is the priority
i think we are waiting to hear back from mike because we have had a conversation with the buysidedirect people and can give an additional explanation
sara
all
attached are the following docs
0
talon i llc/harrier i llc equity swap confirm
0
harrier i llc/ebs investments
l.l.c
equity swap confirm
0
revised isda master agreement schedule for harrier i llc and ebs investments
l.l.c
please review and provide me with your comments
i do not have all necessary address and account information
the swaps are subject to the isda 0 equity derivatives definitions
section 0.0
of those definitions
contains the payment obligations and provides that the equity amount payer pays a positive equity amount and
the other party
pays the absolute value of a negative equity amount
also
i believe that accounting issue 0-0 is inapplicable to this total return swap or else we may have issues with the
extraordinary events
elections
sara
kaye
please print out the 0 docs for me
thanks
ss
brent is looking into this issue
what tab
mark
i scheduled a meeting with you at 0:0 pm today to discuss the mg acquisition
in particular
mg london
inc
a u.s regulated nymex clearing member
fcm
cta
no one is looking into this from a us regulatory/legal perspective and i think it should be the swap group
enron's
regulated
product areas are metals
since mg clears its own trades on the nymex/comex and has fcm/cta status
and potentially agriculture if we
some enron entity
choose to become a regulated
atom
ag trade option merchant
from a legal perspective
i think we should have a
whitepaper
drafted by sullivan
cromwell
and
it should include an analysis of the mg london
inc
existing situation
this would tie into the ag regulation
also
have you thought about ena and mg as nymex members and whether we keep both designations
whether we move all/part of ena's existing clearing business to mg
and perhaps eliminate the need for margin/brokering arrangements such as paribas
etc
and any other related issues
for efficiency purposes
donna lowry has asked to join us
donna and i had a conference call this morning with justin
paul
jon barrett
sheila glover and trena mcfarland to figure out who's on first
with mg
also
i am attaching an update of my workload
i have reached the breaking point and i need more help
even with jason's help on brokerage agreements the new electronic trading platform agreements are reaching multiple proportions with a new request for agreements for ena
ect investments and enroncredit.com london
gareth and craig clark want to meet today about the prepay
delta/citibank
and i really need help on the global finance side
see you later
sara
fyi
the interest component was eliminated from the terms of this transaction
as was the switch from a price return swap to a total return swap and the name change
it seems that ben and scott s
had a subsequent conversation
after ours
and the agreed changes were communicated to me
ss
i need someone assigned to assist in amending this agreement
most of the work is done
please let me know asap
jason
before we designate specific individuals
let's think this through
a
generic
address may be more appropriate
which agreement did we recently sign with reference to the
documentation desk
sara
fyi
sam
please get on my calendar for friday
we need to update agreements
status
etc
also
we need to add a
futures agreement
designation to lotus notes
please bring your latest printouts for existing agreements and provide a copy for me
let's take about an hour
thanks
sara ps also
if you have any questions about masters
etc
bring them along
pls print docs
you already knew this was ok with me i hope
shane
here's the scoop
0
ena has an existing isda master agreement with citibank n.a
dated as of november 0
0
the master is not restricted to any particular type of transaction but it clearly anticipates commodity and rate swaps
ena is the calculation agent
also
only commodity transactions are netted
0
citibank proposed an amendment to this master in february
0
the amendment was primarily to amend the collateral annex to increase the collateral threshold to usd 0 million for bbb
and above
rated entities
it also states citibank to be
multibranch
with ny and london offices acting under the master
apparently
the proposed fx language to be added to the master was dropped
i think in the interest of time
mollie harris in credit is trying to have citibank sign the amendment
0
abn amro is in my office ready for signature
i will have it executed and email you when done
samantha boyd
ext.0
will help me with the followup
please let me know if you have any questions
kaye
please schedule sam for an hour on friday
also
when avoidable
i'd prefer not to meet at 0 pm because people are always late
thanks
sara
all
i have once again revised the confirm for the ebs raptor deal
there will be only one swap transaction
harrier i llc/talon i llc
please note the following changes
0
the initial equity notional amount has been corrected
0
i have expanded the definition of cash dividends
0
i have added a provison for
payment obligations
to avoid confusion for those of you unfamiliar with the 0 equity definitions
since i have removed the interest payment feature
the only payments changing hands will be upside/dividends and downside
the
equity amount payer
pays the upside
difference between initial price
on the relevant valuation date
and final price
and dividends
the other party pays the downside
0
i have retained the concept of multiple optional termination dates
0
kevin
i need the harrier account/notice information
this confirm should serve as a template for additional raptor equity share swaps so please review and comment
thanks
sara
darren
laurel mentioned that you were interested in existing/pending brokerage/futures agreements
attached are our most recent matrices by enron company
all of these agreements are negotiated by legal and must be executed by the business unit
vp or higher
and ted murphy
sheila glover always sends a request and explanation for new account to legal
compliance and ted murphy
legal keeps a comprehensive listing by enron company in an effort to avoid confusion
legal updates authorized trader lists and trading resolutions
let me know if you have any questions
sara
i am receiving calls from gina karathanos in global finance about this deal
she's inquiring about preparation of certificates
authorizations and signers
susan
please coordinate with mary on that end
i presume we follow the same format as carol
as far as i know
closing is scheduled for aug
0
apparently
lots of ene officers will be out of town next week
do we know who will sign for ena
thanks
ss
will focus later today
how are we handling abn amro
i want to have executed
were you going to revise the notice page and add the location on the trading floor in the other agreement
please talk to sam
the docs are in my office
i have meetings all afternoon
thanks
sara
kaye
re
my vm about john stoner in california
beware as i may have this meeting
which is more important
maybe stoner can be at the end of the day here
is john also responsible for brokerage/futures
will he run through ted
will we keep copies
sami
congratulations
she's adorable
sara
further to mary's memo of 0/0/0
i would like to add the following comments
0
i initially drafted the share swap confirm as a price return swap
scott then requested a total return swap
ie
dividends included
i met with accounting this morning and
ryan believes that
the swap is price return only
the asset holder is only swapping price exposure and the business unit should recognize the immediate dividend benefit to its asset
please verify whether the share swaps are price return or total return
0
with respect to the right of
multiple optional partial swap terminations
please verify that
a
the business unit has the right to request that harrier partially terminate the swap prior to the scheduled termination
any number of times
without restriction as to frequency
minimum or maximum number of shares
or any other limitation
irrespective of whether the asset owner actually sells the underlying shares
how is this right of termination
and the multiple requests
to be documented
b
the
initial price
of the shares on the effective date of the swap will always be used to calculate the gain or loss
vs
using the share price on the date of each partial termination
mark
0
did you consider my voice mail about updating authorized trader lists and resolutions
by samantha or tana
0
have you thought about electronic notice provisions
shouldn't default/termination notices be in writing to the appropriate counsel/corp
secretary
and
can we agree to
electronic notices
at all
there is no electronic address for a documentation desk or assistant general counsel
i am seeing this type of provision in electronic trading agreements
thanks
sara
tana

for
cash settlement amount
if for any determination period
the floating price is less than or equal to the strike price
an amount equal to the product of
i
the notional quantity per determination period multiplied by
ii
the excess of the strike price over the floating price
which amount shall be due and payable by the seller on the applicable payment date for such determination period
p.s
melissa
in the future
send me the deal ticket for review
i just received this from stoner
tanya
i haven't reviewed this agreement

sara
please remember that melissa murphy

any financial power confirm questions should be directed to melissa
joe hunter's group does not prepare financial power confirms except in extrememly limited cases

brent
just a reminder
we track all trading agreements in our lotus notes database
you can enter negotiating issues
etc
samantha oversees this part of the database
updates ted murphy and has the agreements executed and filed
all trading agreements are signed by ted and the business unit vp
please keep samanthat in the loop
thanks
sara
why don't we talk about this
i have initiated samantha as the trading agreement guru
that's why she needs to be in the loop on all of these agreements
amendments included
let's distinguish margin lines from trading agreements
although the margin line concept obviously includes a futures or other arrangement
i maintain a list
in the pipeline
which i circulate to the hickerson desk since that desk opens the greatest number of trading agreements
sara

greg and i discussed the use of ena's format of isda documentation by midwest and i have a couple of questions about how our docs will be used

we were working with enron corp
treasury to put in place some masters in the name of ena for the following parties
bear
stearns internaitonal limited csfb international lehman brother finance s.a
morgan stanley capital services inc
deutsche bank these masters will be used to for equity deals on ene stock
the treasury group has concluded together with rex rogers and v&e
that enron corp
is the appropriate swap counterparty for these masters and not ena
who in credit will be available to assist me in this process
thanks
sara
call me when you have a chance
is mark sending you these or are you on a direct mail
kristina
as you may have heard
some raptor issues have been raised to a new level
i have waited to further revise the confirm pending the v&e response

the unilateral right of termination is a potential issue

john
i just wanted to stay in the loop for japan as to gary hickerson's fx/rate/equity counterparties
my understanding from gary is that egm
through ena
will continue to hedge the business originating in japan
subject to tax and any regulatory input
i don't know if this has necessitated an agency arrangement between japan and houston
or another office
similar to london or australia
also
for netting reasons
japan would not duplicate existing counterparty isda's with ena
and to the extent japan is transacting with a bank having an agreement with ena
we could amend the agreement for multibranch purposes if necessary
e.g
bank of montreal if the bank is transacting from multiple locations that need to be added to ena's agreement
please advise if you have already had these discussions with mark taylor
i look forward to hearing from you

ena sent comments to ing barings
fka furman selz
some time ago and has not heard back
we were going to dupe for ect investments

denis is the responsible lawyer for enroncredit.com limited
if in fact these electronic agreements should be in the name of ect investments
inc
then we'll negotiate from houston
or divide and conquer
sheila
your email of 0/0 seemed to refer to buysidedirect's agreement with ect investments

sara
just let mr
de dalmas know that i asked someone to respond
ss
the isda master does not circumscribe the trade term or trade parameters
the issue which we discussed is authority
the merced resolution of march 0
0 specifically authorizes the general manager
to develop and provide appropriate information
and certifications for completing master trading
isda
agreements with energy vendors and execute master trading
isda
agreements and appropriate vendor schedules to the isda agreement for the purpose of acquiring energy and stabilizing energy costs
such executions are subject to counsel review of the agreement and schedules as to form
there is no specific mention of authority to enter into transactions
by merced's traders
intuitively one could draw the conclusion that the isda master contemplates transactions
merced authorized the isda master and therefore merced authorized transactions under the isda master
since merced is a governmental entity
the safer view is that we should not assume that merced authorized transactions
merced probably intended to authorize transactions
and if so
should not have an issue with specifically providing a clarifying resolution
sara
russell
thanks for the info
i do need to send a reminder to the credit group about the authority issues raised by municipals
governmentals
cities
etc
entering into financial trades
where can i obtain the most recent list of credit people
you know how those credit people are
who deal with financial trading
thanks
sara p.s
the early production payment docs typically conveyed an undivided 0 % interest in the producer's net revenue interest in particular properties

sharon
thanks for your fax and markup of the schedule dated sept

there is a major issue which we need to discuss and that is the counterparty identity itself
it appears that you have identified a different party to the agreement
namely
a limited liability company named
sita
which is not the entity which we originally proposed
this does not appear to be the credit which we evaluated
also
we insist upon a credit support annex
as you know
the agreement contemplates multiple transactions and the posting of collateral is a major issue
particularly for long-dated pulp deals
can you call me tomorrow
we need to address the major issues upfront
you can reach me at 0-0-0
thank you
sara
are you still working every other day
please see my sita message to sharon lewis and let me know the most efficient way of proceeding
thanks

susan
i work with the fx/rate desk and darren delage is currently residing in tokyo and trading
i have a conversation this evening with alan aronowitz
john viverito and darren to discuss japan issues
at the moment
darren has exeacuted several trades
these are being documented in houston as enron north america corp
trades
i had assumed that all trades would be done in the name of the japanese financial trading entity
i have no idea who is handling back office functions
can you update me
thanks
sara p.s
we must confirm all trades
bob
don't forget
i have several confirms with power counterparties that i need you to negotiate
thanks
sara
bill
i am resending my earlier message which identifies the correct legal entities with which enron corp
would like to execute isda master agreements
for the purpose of entering into equity trades
in addition to the entities listed below
we need to include
merrill lynch international
mli
ena just negotiated an agreement with mli
so the enron corp
master should be fairly simple
also
clint and jeff are interested in transacting with toronto dominion bank
in that regard i note that enron has an interest rate and currency agreement with toronto dominion bank
new york branch
i'll review this agreement to see if it requires amendment
jeff/clint
do want to deal with a specific toronto dominion branch
all
i will expect that bill will provide credit worksheets and i'll either begin the isda process or change
ena
to enron corp
on those agreements which have previously been sent
thanks
let me know if you have any questions
sara
please print the original message and all of the attachments

i left you a vm about prior efforts to amend the ena/citi master

i will need to leave the office at 0pm tomorrow
sara
matthew
we have had some internal discussions regarding the appropriate enron party to this master and have concluded that enron corp
the parent of enron north america corp
should be your counterparty
does this change warrent any changes with respect to your comments
sara
sam
attached is the final version of the csfb futures agreement
by separate email i will send you the draft
i've
eyeballed
it but please verify that all changes were accepted
i'll help with the application
let's have gary sign in the early a.m
or tonignt

because csfb cannot open the account this evening
also
per my vm
we need to ensure that the traders on my email to you
from ellen su
appear on the authorized traders
list

rodney and finley are reviewing the two existing citibank masters
ect/nighthawk

tax ryan siurek
accounting
global finance
bill
how do you feel about the comments
per my voice mail
sara
bill
here's the conference call number
there appears to be a major issue re
cash collateral
see item 0 under the
isda schedules
section of the memo
check out the provisions in the memo about the guaranties
here's the dial-in number if you want to call in to discuss the guaranty issues
attached is my suggested language
the confirms already provide for market quotation and second method
the optional early termination provision should be the only exception for using the calculation agent for termination purposes
of course
the calculation agent will determine aeco prices for payment purposes
but that is not related to termination
please call
0-0-0
sara
rats
please print for me
bill
the attached memo was distributed to legal last week
we have had a number of questions arise on the power side lately regarding financial transactions
ranging from short term to quarterly
with governmentals
as you will see in the memo
the risks are significant
please let me know if you have any questions
sara
the attached swaps have been delivered together with the proposal sheets to lisa mellencamp
thanks for the catch
sara
attached are revised commodity swap confirms
i didn't change the rate swap and we're still waiting for input from the bank
see attached
john
hi
there
as you are aware of the structuring for tax purposes
until the u.k
corporate agent is actuallly formed
there is nothing further that i can do
that formation should happen today or tomorrow
with the actual name and agreements with ena and ect investments
inc
i can provide that information to instinet and the other trading platforms you are interested in transacting on
just fyi
the instinet people are merely waiting for the agent agreement in order to proceed
please let me know if you have any further questions
sara
stephanie and sam need nymex calendars
sheila
please send an email to ted murphy and bill bradford requesting agreements with deutsche bank securities
which enron company
ies
are you requesting these agreements for
stephanie panus will be handling this broker
thanks
sara
sheila
please make your request to ted murphy and bill bradford about the above agreement which john has requested
thanks
ss
no changes
pls put on my calendar
john
the
signature block
for ena and ect investments
inc
trades done through the u.k
agent actually looks different
it should read something like
company x
as agent for ena
for example
therefore
insitnet needs to see the agency agreement between company x and ena
which is in the process of being drafted
you are correct in that the original ena/instinet agreement will be utilized
however
instinet needs to review the agency arrangement before proceeding
you are also correct about the itg agreement
in fact
ena doesn't have an executed agreement with posit
i spoke with the posit lawyer several months ago and was shocked that the service would operate without anything in writing
thanks
sara
i hope this works
i tried to tie all to the specific confirms
sam
please let me know asap whether jason should be marking the deutsche docs based on sheila's message
mark
i know you'll eventually get to this message in the near future
based on the volume of activity
i would like to have a printer in my office if at all possible
thanks
sara
need to enter new transaction
contacts
etc
all
i received another call from gary ordway asking for an isda and our gtc's

spread
credit

you may want to think about the format
have we done this before
did you work on the moosehead
merrill lynch
deal
sara
i just received a message that the deal is in a
holding
pattern
brent
will you please respond to martin
thanks
ss
attached is a first draft of the swap for the raptor 0 structure
please consider the following questions and i will amend the confirmation accordingly
0
i have bracketed the concept of multiple notices for purposes of multiple partial terminations and therefore multiple valuation dates
before we eliminate this concept
i just want to make certain that everyone is in agreement as to how this swap will terminate
do we want partial terminations based upon partial asset sales
0
assuming that termination occurs upon sale of 0% of the assets
i need to be sure that the word
sale
is sufficient
should we use
financial close
or some other term of art
i have concerns that a sale may be contingent or subject to some waiting period
stephanie
are these identical to our docs
need to check asap
please let rodney/finley/tanya know that mary is assisting on the nego of the new master
i'm here if issues arise
also
who is minding the confirms
they need to be revised
ena's master is with td

jason
please hold off on hedge funds for the moment
paul may need to rethink the provisions
sara
i spoke with kim and she would like for tim to explain the rationale
he is traveling today
she thinks this provision
will not hurt
to have in the agreement since harvard does not want to change its form
also
why don't we say what type of entity harvard is
i think it are created by mass
state law
how does it go bankrupt
attached is a revision to the original swap confirmation

you and me
i am available untill roughly 0 am when the lawyers depart for the woodlands

netting
payment or closeout
only applies between the parties under a single master agreement
are you asking about the right of setoff in the event of an early termination under one of the masters
i spoke with steve kessler this morning

which was actually more than he wanted to agree to
however
db does not have the systems to net within other product groups

sara
jim
pursuant to our recent conversation
i have attached below a draft of ena's standard
0
municipal isda schedule and
0
paragraph 0 to the isda credit support annex
these two documents are intended to supplement the boilerplate for the isda master agreement and the isda credit support annex
the forms are generic
that is
they have not been tailored for use by a specific municipal counterparty
they would necessarily be the subject of specific negotiations
energy new england's agency relationship with the various municipalities appears to cover physical trading
notwithstanding the agency agreement
the financial trading world requires much more specificity
including but not limited to
evidence of authority to execute a master financial agreement and transactions thereunder
additional information
including a legal opinion
is also required
i assume from our prior conversation that you already have in your possession copies of the isda boilerplate
please advise otherwise
you should feel free to contact ed sacks with questions regarding collateral support documentation
as i mentioned
the attached paragraph 0 has not been customized
please feel free to call if you have any questions
sara

i have a question that needs to be answered on wednesday morning
what company actually employs john greene
i am now being told by instinet that the company employing the trader must sign a new confidentiality agreement for the uk terminal
for trading by ect investments

please advise by email or voice mail thanks sara

per my email yesterday
we need new credit and a new person assigned
i think rod will handle credit when we dupe the ena master for please let me know who will handle
there are some issues that credit and legal can determine before we resend a first draft
thanks

these are all repos
merrill lynch canada inc./ena merrill lylnch govt
securities inc./merrill lynch pierce fenner
smith
andy
in the spirit of
full disclosure
i thought i would let you know what ena has agreed to on the isda side with various merrill entities
ena has isda's with merrill lynch international bank
0/0/0
merrill lynch capital services inc
0/0/0
and merrill lynch international
0/0/0
there is no arbitration provision in any of these agreements
there is merely silence as to jurisdiction
ena began negotiating arbitration around 0
all of these agreements contain our standard limitation of liability language
in boldface
and all permit some type of assignment to an affiliate
in general
without negative tax impact or with sufficient credit support
all of the agreements provide for setoff
including affiliates of non-defaulting parties
and all contain confidentiality provisions
i would therefore propose the following changes to annex i
change the margin deadline time to 0:0 a.m
ny time
delete par 0
b
and you can send your additional no custody required language delete the arbitration provision in its entirety i hope that you can resond to the remaining issues tomorrow morning so that we can finalize docs by the afternoon
thanks for your assistance
sara
ellen
when you have a minute
give me a call and let's discuss
especially notice
assignability
the big enron issue is limited liability
i have no choice here
setoff can be compromised with credit's approval
paul radous is credit
sara
andy
i am reviewing your comments and will have an answer shortly
i thought
however
that you should know that the limitation of liability provision is non-negotiable from enron's viewpoint
if this is problematic
please advise and we can halt further discussion
thanks
sara

i don't know what time dinner is on monday but i'm assuming it is late enough to allow us to change clothes and shower
and wash hair if we feel like it
the spa has lot's of availability earler in the day and on sunday
so we can make changes
this is particularly important since all changes must be made within 0 hours of the service or it gets charged to my credit card
and i really hate unnecessary charges
on a slightly different note
i am compiling places i'd like to visit since we have no itinerary

sorry for the delay in getting back to you
we have agreed to delete the csa and will return a blackline to you shortly

ena
in the houston office
christian yoder gave me your name and suggested that we speak regarding the eweb transaction
i will be negotiating the isda master agreement with eweb
probably with jmi deason directly
ena requires that governmentals provide specific evidence of authority to enter into derivative instruments
including certified resolutions specifically authorizing execution of the master agreement and all transactions thereunder
legal opinion and additional reps/warranties
i was curious as to the specific documentation you had reviewed from eweb
it sounded from your email which christian forwarded to me
that you were reviewing evidence of authority to enter into physical transactions
i would like to speak with you directly
if possible
i am in a central time zone and my direct line is
0
0-0
i look forward to speaking with you
thanks

joe hunter
x0
is a good start
0
paul advises that you will be transacting pursuant to the existing isda master agreement between ena and csfb int'l
name change from credit suisse financial products
in that regard
you should be sure to add the following items to the confirmation and discuss with your counterparty
a
ena should be the calculation agent for purposes of this transaction
b
you should provide for
payments on early termination
as
for the purpose of section 0
e
of the isda master agreement
i
loss will apply
and
ii
the second method will apply
also
you should obtain evidence of the name change
usually a certificate of name change
let me know if you have any questions
thanks
sara

this is the proposed schedule which we will review and comment
eweb did not send a csa
sara

i would like to discuss ena's view of the csa/schedule relationship
in a nutshell
we provide that a ratings downgrade is an additional event of default in the schedule
normally a mac in the csa
john's preferance
of course
would be a unilateral event triggering an ibj default
which i am sure would be difficult to negotiate
i am not certain of the time difference but perhaps you could call me at the office after 0 pm
nov.0 in houston
and i could then conference in john
alternatively
please feel free to contact me at home
after 0 pm houston time on nov
0
at 0-0-0
i look forward to hearing from you
regards
sara
yes
i thought you understood as much from our meeting
i have asked a&k repeatedly to add you to the email list

it was my understanding from mark taylor that you would be responsible for the
structured
equity derivatives
with assistance from the swap group as needed
please let me know if i'm assuming too much
thanks
sara
holly
i'll try to get something to eweb today

let me know if i can be of any help whatsoever
also
whatever flowcharts or schematics you can offer would greatly appreciated
as well as a list of services agreements
dale neuner is anxious to resolve the issues surrounding fx transactions on eol
have you concluded that we need rmt as the eol party for internal hedging fx products for london and japan
am i correct in the following
rmt will be the party transacting directly with international enron affiliates
i.e
ectric
through eeft
and enron japan
under new/existing services agreements
ena will be the financial party transacting directly with third parties
does ena also act directly with non-affiliated japanese customers
if the situation should arise

brother-in-law and mike to celebrate my birthday so i'm anticipating somewhat of an eating exttavaganza
talk to you soon
sara
all
please note the following based upon my understanding of the parties to this prepay
0
the toronto dominion
texas
master agreement with ect is a restricted master
it was negotiated for a prepay several years ago and is not necessarily market
or ena
standard
it should be reviewed immediately by legal and credit
0
the morgan stanley capital group master agreement is very old
it is not an isda
it is a 0 master energy price swap agreement
limited to simple transactions and commodities
the terminology is not even isda terminology
this master has been on the credit/legal radar screen for upgrading to an isda
rod
you need to take a look at the toronto dominion
texas
master agreement now and we should discuss
treasa
will there be a rate swap
under which master
s
didn't we send this out
ss
hey
russell
are you handling the
cargill-alliant
llc
credit
sara
there are two
0
enron affiliates having master agreements with morgan stanley capital group inc

ectric has an isda master agreement with mscg dated 0/0/0 but effective as of 0/0/0
0
ect
now ena

as of 0/0/0 with respect to the td
texas
master agreement having a

this doc will be useful to you
this is from jason
kevin
this is set to close tomorrow
so far
please look this first draft over to see if you have any issues
thanks
sara
ena and ectric have masters with this counterparty
i need these with respect to the prepay originating from london which closes tomorrow
these are both missing from the files
does anyone have these
please contact me asap
thanks
sara
i guess
working it out
the collateral piece will take a little time and we'll have to run it by japanese counsel
do you have a deal diagram
is there a commodity swap between ena and morgan
the td/ena commodity swap has language regarding
loan repayment
and the
fee
has matt seen this
shouldn't this be in a separate document
also
i'm not sure what td is tyring to net
quarterly payments under the swap with other payments due on the same day in the same currency under the master
do want td to be the calc
agent for the commodity swap and the rate swap
are you satisfied wtih the disruption fallback
which is the same as the master but for the reduction in postponement from 0 to 0 days
i am trying to speak with rod
sara
marcus
the mscg master is not an isda
i am sure there will be problems
matching
terms for the swaps
sara
here's the email

master not ena
sita has
0
requested evidence of eeft's ability to sign for ectric and
0
confirmation that
eeft is signing on the basis of their authority under the investment services directive
would you please provide directly to sita's lawyers as follows
susan hopkinson and sharon lewis at lovells in paris
if you require phone or fax

thanks
sara
richard
i don't know if you were copied separately on this message
can you send a letter after thanksgiving
the first payment should come due the first week in december
thanks
sara
tanya
sita now insists on having the termination currency and the contractual currency
except as otherwise agreed in any transaction/confirmation
as the euro
they will not agree to usd
by the way
sita's lawyers had already agreed to usd
effectively
if we agree to this
the trader will need to confirm each deal in usd
contractual currency
but if we early terminate
the currency will be euro's
termination currency
what do you want to do
other than the enron corp
guaranty
we are finished
sara
treasa
bob bruce told me that there was no
swap
activity on the prepay during my absence
houston is closed down until monday
nov
0 for the thanksgiving holiday
normally
i would ask joe hunter on the confirm desk to take a look at the confirms
i marked up the td confirm to reflect my comments and provide an attached
schedule

volumes and rate payment dates
such a format has worked well in other prepaid structures

ena or peoples
will draft/negotiate isda masters nor have any forms been agreed
but peoples
lawyers have seen our forms and i have seen their forms which are poorly drafted
bill bradford will have the final word on enovate credit
credit has asked us to track enovate masters on our lotus notes database
do you need to follow up with mark about us negotiating enovate's master agreements
or should we just handle as any other project

i don't think it will go out today
maybe
tomorrow
please feel free to call susan
or me
if you have any questions
negotiations proceed more quickly when legal has the name
phone number and email address for the counterparty's lawyer
i know you tried
if the counterparty is truly anxious to trade
the commercial guys will pressure the legal department to pay attention to the documents and keep the ball rolling
otherwise
things will sit around and go nowhere
just remember that an isda negotiation is usually longer with a governmental entity because ena requires more information
legal opinion
copies of statutes
authority in the form of a full board resolution
etc
and government lawyers may be short staffed
sometimes the counterparty will hire outside counsel which may go more quickly
but not always
if a counterparty is totally organized and familiar with financial trading documents
the negotiations may end within a week
but i have never seen this happen with a governmental
otherwise
it simply depends on the issues
sara
can you be more specific
is this for ena
what type of products
susan
here's some more tva information
sara
fyi
please add your outstanding guaranties to susan's memo
thanks

i have not received your suggested language to the deemed isda confirmation

i can provide you with a blackline
please let me know if there is anything further that i can do
thanks
sara
dennis
you have attached a form of confirmation for a very specialized derivative transaction
namely
a credit derivative
the transaction that enron and so
cal
would be executing would be a commodity derivative
that commodity being power
the confirmation format is similar
i will send you an example later
sara
attached is the schedule we sent and par
0
attached are jim deason's comments to the schedule and deemed isda
please note him comments re
enforceability of this financial deal
attached is the latest listing of executed equity agreements
we have a separate listing for futures agreements but the brokers are different from equity brokers
dennis
attached are two
templates
for power trades confirmed under an executed isda master agreement
one is for a swap and the other for an option
cap or floor
ignore the symbols and elections which are only to feed deal terms into our confirmation system
the specific terms of each trade
dates
notional quantities
price indexes and pricing
etc
would be inserted into the format
i hope this helps
sara
thanks

therefore
rank it low
chris
we need to discuss the alternative to sp-0
please see the redline where i have incorporated a
fallback reference price
however
the definition is still vague
ss
this should do it except that i would add a heading
draft
for discussion purposes only
at the top and fix the fallback reference price format and put the phrase
as published in
caliso.com
at the end of the sentence
i will attend
jorge
0
yes
i did verbally approve the merrill lynch
other provisions
section of the rate swap
0/0/0 deal
0
yes
i received your fax of 0/0/0 from bank of montreal with your email to the bank
the language which you sent to the bank of montreal
bom
was to be based on the merrill lynch
other provisions
section of the above rate swap
in that regard
i
you inadvertently left out a phrase when you retyped the merrill lynch language
however
bom's subsequent revision is acceptable
ii
it is not clear to me whether all of paragraph 0 in the original bom confirm is being replaced
your message to bom seems to imply that it is fully replaced
which is what we want
you should definitely verify that this is the case in your latest bom confirm
0
yes
the termination agreement format from deutsche bank ag looks fine
just be sure that all transaction references are correct
sorry for the delay
i am trying to identify another lawyer to back me up
sara
attached is an updated list of brokerage agreements under negotiation

sara
tanya
is lee the right person to approve this change for sita
remember
sita is acutally with ectric

larry
according to steve kessler
the db lawyer in new york who is negotiating the ena isda master
london e-commerce issues are normally handled ty the london lawyer
conrad libischer at 0-0-0-0
if ny trader is also involved
then db must decide on one lawyer to handle password application
etc
the ena isda master must first be approved by frankfurt
i don't know how long this takes
you may want to let the db trader start the eol process
thanks

sara
justin
i am told by theresa brogan that enron networks requires an account with one of the prime brokers frequently used by ena and other enron corp
subsidiaries and that you are handling this particular agreement
ena has negotiated multiple accounts with morgan stanley
co
inc
and morgan stanley
co
international limited
collectively
morgan
we have an agreed form of customer agreement with morgan which has been easy to duplicate for additional affiliates of ena
also
we screen all agreements through credit and risk control
since our resolutions for opening brokerage accounts require dual signatures from both the enron affiliate and risk control
i don't know what your procedure is in london but let me know if we can be of any assistance
theresa is holding the docs until i hear back from you
thanks
sara
stephanie
do we control the drafting
john
thanks for your message

i now need to reread tanya's message
sara
tanya

with respect to the enron corp
master
which will not have a csa or an enron corp
guaranty
what cap should we request from morgan stanley dean witter
co
should it be $0mm as requested in the ena document
please let me know
joe
susan emailed the docs to larry johnson and john porter on 0/0/0
stephanie
can we get the sita blackline out today
we should put ene guaranty in line for execution and let's push clem for friday at the latest
also
matt dawson has requested copy of latest docs and he cannot locate the executed p/a
i think you should try tax

sara

please forward
regards
sara
further to my message of yesterday evening
i have spoken with the mscs lawyer in london and learned that enroncredit.com limited
eccl

eccl is awaiting the ene guaranty
the lawyer is forwarding docs to me this morning and i understand they were heavily negotiated
tanya
will you be handling credit for both ena and ene
i would like to chat with whomever is handling today
if possible
i will forward eccl to you both when i receive
thanks
sara
john
does this look alright for execution
sara
tanya
i've been meaning to touch base with you about
in our form csa
the debt rating change is triggered only off of s&p
i thought this was a carry-over from ene's previous split rating
does credit want to leave the trigger at
below bbb
by s&p
or also add in moody's
thanks
sara
matt and denis
i spoke with matthew flett about an hour ago and he advised that enroncredit.com limited had finalized its isda
i requested a copy burt he has not yet sent it over
both ene and ena want to execute masters with mscs and we would like to work from your document
can you email me a copy
thanks
sara
fyi until i get to it
go to
holli
we need to talk about status
i spoke yesterday with three eweb lawyers and dick varner
i have to comment back on the schedule to the master agreement
eweb has not yet reviewed the credit support annex and needs to submit their proposed legal opinion
eweb is reserving discussion of the confirmations pending resolution of the master agreement
most important
however
is the eweb legal opinion which will be limited by the capacity of eweb's traders to enter into financial trades at any given point in time
eweb is insisting that we assume the obligation of knowing whether an eweb trader is authorized to act and how that eweb trader is authorized to act under eweb's trading policy because
under oregon law
and the law of all states
financial trades executed by unauthorized persons
employed by governmental entities
are completely void
your two trades
which began as physical deals and were transformed into financial deals
were authorized by eweb's recent board resolution
however
you cannot rely fully on this resolution for future trades
before you ever trade with eweb again
you will not be able to rely upon your past relationship with an eweb trader
you will first have to conduct some due diligence with respect to the eweb trader and the eweb trading policy
ena has never agreed to this type of arrangement
let's schedule a time to discuss the agreement further
thanks
sara
i understand your concern but negotiating your future position is part of the agreement
greg
i received the following email from rbc and am attaching a redline of changes
since ecc will be signing
let me know if you have any objections
sara
fyi
tracy
tanya handled this last go round
sara
aaron
i spoke with both matt flett
morgan counsel
and denis o'connell about the isda already negotiated by enroncredit.com limited
each was supposed to send me the draft docs for me to review and comment on for ena
i have not received anything yet but will comment immediately upon receipt
i'll keep you up to date
sara
dana
what would be a convenient time for us to chat briefly about the legal issues associated with derivative transactions between ena and municipal/governmental counterparties
please let me know
thanks
sara
all
to whom should risk management
trading corp
rmt

0 and requires amendment
please let me know

thank you for responding to my message
i still need to know who will execute the confirmation on behalf of enron nordic energy
norwegian branch of enron capital
trade resources international corp
clara is here in houston and cannot sign for that entity
please advise
sara
denis
i spoke with clem and forwarded the attached guaranty
i didn't read the guaranty so i don't know if it was negotiated or standard
you should contact clem about the urgent nature of the request as i am not familiar with the details
thanks
sara
many of you have been involved in recent efforts to either amend documents to provide for rehypothecation of securities or additional collateral arrangements
both resulting from cash constraints in the market
in that regard
it appears that our credit group will be very interested in accepting different forms of government obligations
including treasury bills
treasury notes and treasury bonds
our current version of paragraph 0 does not have the
choice
for eligible collateral consisting of longer dated obligations such as treasury notes and bonds
our earlier version did provide this option
legal
when preparing new master agreements
please be specific about credit requests to include securities and verify with credit the specific types of eligible collateral to be included in paragraph 0
credit
when drafting credit worksheets
please be specific when requesting types of eligible collateral other than cash
we may consider amending paragraph 0 again or adding additional forms of eligible collateral to library doc
david
we are drafting a credit derivative confirmation in connection with one of our year-end deals
will you or jean be able to review the confirm with us
i look forward to hearing from you
regards
sara
brant
please call me or schedule time to discuss bridgeline
cp
in particular
you should note the following
0
cp requests cross default with us 0 million for ena and us 0 million for itself
0
change in ownership as default trigger is different from your proposal
0
cp requests us 0 million enron corp
guaranty and increases its guaranty cap to us 0 million
0
docs to be delivered
only cp's guarantor to deliver annual unaudited/quarterly unaudited consolidated financials
0
review setoff
elimination of affiliates
0
review transfer because cp has a proposal for ena
0
change to collateral thresholds
bilateral us 0 million also
i think susan verified with you that you did not intend to use a non-specific mac
even though the credit worksheet is marked as such
i'll wait to hear from you
sara
janine
with respect to the attached
internal
fx product for eol
i just wanted to verify with you that internal counterparties should transact on eol with
0
rmt
as principal for houston fx desk
0
eeft as agent for rmt
as principal for london fx desk
in this regard
was the services agreement between ena and eeft ever extended to include rmt for internal trades
0
enron japan corp
as principal for tokyo fx desk
there appears to be some confusion since our meeting of november 0
thanks
sara
marcelo
thank you for your response
yes
i am still interested in having the two questions
mentioned in my email to you
answered
we have several derivative transactions with chilean parties and i would like to know of modifications to both the derivatives memorandum which you prepared for us in 0 and changes to our form of schedule
please let me hear from you at your earliest convenience
regards
sara
stuart
i wanted you to be aware of the reason for the holdup on your fx online product
we are trying to resolve this issue as quickly as possible
sara
melissa
were you working on this for chris
ss
janine
thanks for the update
any word on the japanese fx desk principal
sara
blair
i sent this to you yesterday
sara
matt
this is still outstanding and we may have to change part 0 of the schedule to reflect the change
did you speak with our french lawyers
please let stephanie know
sara
great
mark
per our conversation
i understand that the canadian company has a number of outstanding otc fx transactions with one or more counterparties
each of those transactions should be documented by a confirmation which confirms the economic terms of each deal
each confirmation must be subject to
0
an existing type of master agreement
such as the isda
ifema
feoma
0
a
deemed
version of such an agreement or
0
terms and conditions
appearing in the confirmation itself
it is quite likely that in any of these three types of confirmations
there are provisions for assignment of trades
credit event upon merger
material adverse change
additonal events of default or termination
etc
which may be triggered by the pending acquisiton of the canadian company
further
there may be credit issues associated with the transactions and/or master agreements
in the form of specific credit provisions in a confirmation or a credit annex to the master agreement
as a result
a party attempting to
step into the shoes of the canadian company
must review the existing documents
subject to any confidentiality restrictions
in order to evaluate the positions and risks associated with assuming those positions
thus
we need to conduct a thorough due diligence of the financial trading positions of the canadian company
please let me know if you have any questions
sara
carson
yes

one of your confims doesn't match

note to stephanie

eweb has requested a blackline of the isda and is ready to sign next week
your mac references the
electric system
which is defined in the bond indenture which i sent to you earlier today

i'll bring the file to you
details to follow soon
ss
all
following is a list of outsanding items
0
isda master agreement
schedule and credit support annex
i need to better understand eweb's proposed settlement language
ena generally sends an invoice when the counterparty owes a payment
but not when ena owes a payment
the invoice reflects the outstanding transactions for a given calculation period and the net amount owed
ena can generate this invoice in all cases
does eweb intend that both parties always send reciprocal invoices
is is necessary that the calc agent also make a phone call
what does eweb's language
separate invoices and documentation covering each transaction sufficient to permit the other party to comply with its interanl accounting and record keeping procedures concerning individual transactions
mean
please call me to resolve
when can we execute
0
cable huston legal opinion
please add
0
opening paragraph
iii
the confirmations for transactions ena contracts nos
0.0 and 0.0 each dated october 0

the enron trading entity is
enron north america corp
earlier this year
i negotiated this agreement with gs&c
i cannot locate the agreement so gs&c is sending a copy
the enron party is ena
we now need to amend the authorized trader list which i will email to you
ena's use of gs&c's platform is for trading us treasuries
agencies
money market
corporates
jgb's
we need to
0
remove harry arora
who was the sole authorized trader
0
add the following
darren delage shane dallmann ellen su gary hickerson this is a very high priority for gary and we should try to complete today
you only need the
authorized user annex
tom
i'm trying to finalize the isda master agreement with these guys
we have one issue
if there is a long-term market disruption event
i.e
over 0 days
and we have no fallback price
then we negotiate a price and ena would normally obtain 0 quotes and average them
our position is that we prefer to obtain the quotes because if a disruption were to occur
we would obtain quotes for hundreds of deals in the same manner
because our agreements will all have the same provisions
and it is possible that 0 quotes may not be available
nyseg would like for each of ena and nyseg to obtain 0 quotes and then average the 0 quotes
are you agreeable to this
sara
below is a document containing
general terms and conditions
which is always attached to a financial confirmation when the parties have no executed master agreement
if ed
tracy or someone in credit needs to add credit to the transaction
then we also attach an annex b
counterparty specific credit provisions
annex b-0
collateral and exposure provisions
and a letter of credit format
i am only attaching the general terms and conditions
let me know if you still want to see the isda master agreement
preprinted boilerplate consisting of an agreement and credit support annex which i cannot email
together with a sample schedule and paragraph 0 to the credit support annex
which are the two
customized
pieces negotiated by legal
thanks
sara
kaye
i'm having trouble printing the attached
thanks
tana
mike e
kelly
mid market power
would like access to the database
would you please request
maybe some of the other power traders are interested
thanks
sara
vivian
i have not received the copy of our executed electronic trading agreement
please let me know if there is a problem
thanks
sara
per the voice and emails left for gareth bahlmann
you may direct isda documentation to my attention
enron north america corp
is the legal entity
you may use the address information below
our isda template will provide notice information pursuant to paragraph 0 of the multicurrency form
you may use me as a contact lawyer initially
the transaction lawyer should contact you shortly
to my knowledge
we will trade these instruments via internal broker platforms
i.e
ena traders will trade online rather than over the phone
such as goldman sachs
or directly over the phone
all trades will be confirmed either online or verbally and ena will receive a daily statement reflecting trades done the previous day
ena does not prepare a confirmation but will need to check out the broker statements
i believe that these debt securities are issued in either book-entry form
in variable denominations
or as registered certificates
e.g
undivided interests in a mortgage pool
we will trade us agencies and japanese bonds with goldman
please let me know if you have any questions
ed
mike kelly wants to trade with the above counterparty
we have no master
how do you want to handle
sara
mary
please respond to elliot
thanks
sara
actually
bob was handling and he knows you will handle
i believe that this master was based upon the cargill
incorporated master
ss
attached is a discussion outline for our meeting tomorrow
short of micromanagement
i tried to identify areas which might benefit from specific attorney oversight
susan
please prepare a draft isda for the above parties with
0
no csa and
0
bilateral cross-default at us$0 million
i am presently reviewing cp comments to the ena master and may have some changes for you tomorrow
we will send this out on tuesday
clint
first union securities inc
is the bank's marketing arm and is not the correct isda counterparty
i'd like to attend
marcia
mike kelly asked that i send you a copy of our gtc's for financial trades which must be attached to all confirmations
in the absence of an executed isda master agreement
ena has been using these gtc's for quite some time
please let me know if you have any questions
sara
russell
i just received a call from the lawyer for florida power
light company
the regulated utility
he told me that he was sending over isda documents for fpl energy
the unregulated trading arm of the utility
will you be handling credit on this one
sara
i'm not sure who is handling but we need to add jorge as a signatory for ena
jorge is inhickerson's group
let me know when this is completed and if you have any questions
thanks
sara
boy
he sure didn't waste any time
let me know what we need to do
sara
and there's more
call me about this one because janelle needs to review carefully
sara
i'll handle
thanks
jeff
do you have an answer yet
sara
marcus
dte energy trading has told us that they have executed emissions confirms with ena
i am trying to review the gtcs that are sent out when these transactions are done
can you please forward a copy
thanks
sara
thanks
russell
that was precisely the answer i was looking for
ss
tanya
enron corp
global finance
has a fasb 0 structured deal executed in dec
0 which requires amendment for tax purposes
a new total return equity swap on eog stock will need to be executed between ena and rabo
ena must be the swap counterparty
normal course of business
for the legal opinion which must be issued for the structure
i would like to send rabo our isda format so as to avoid any surprises
time is short
i assume we do not want a csa but will require an enron corp
guaranty
do we want cross default and credit event upon merger to apply to the parties
do we want to add/eliminate additional events of default
the ultimate schedule will probably look very different from our standard but we need to urge our format as much as possible
please call me to update
this update is currently scheduled to close next friday
thanks
sara
melissa
you may want to follow up with amy
she should have received my comments last night

chris
there is a march 0
0 master commodity price swap agreement between erms and praxair
inc
however
it is limited to natural gas price swap transactions
this is an extremely old
outdated form of agreement
sara
tracy/chris
we would replace the old erms agreement with an isda
tracy
if you need a copy of the existing credit terms
please let me know
cheryl/sam
please update sheila
ss
kaye
please remind mike and me if i end up serving on a jury next week
ss
i've left a message for dave adams
legal
to call back and described to him the following situation
ena and nrg have executed over 0 financial deals both online
eol
and offline without ever changing any of the gtc's
in the absence of an executed master agreement
we never want the gtc's to change
the reason is that bankruptcy protection for swap agreements requires a single agreement for all swap transactions
if you don't have an isda master agreement in place
you want your single set of gtc's to be viewed by a court as a single agreement
having different versions of the gtc's does not look like a single agreement
i will try to convince dave adams that we should retain our gtc's but move forward on an isda which would then govern all online and offline trades
carol
a rude awakening to the fact that you don't have a phone
please stop by because i think you can help

ix
additional event of default
event on page 0 of the schedule
in the case of party b
enron north america corp
owns less than a majority interest in party b unless within five
0
local business days of such occurrence
party b posts collateral with party a
i
in an amount equal to party a's exposure under this agreement plus $0,0
but in no event greater than 0% of party a's exposure
and
ii
in a form satisfactory to party a in party a's reasonable discretion
exposure
shall mean for any relevant date for which exposure is calculated
the amount
if any
that would be payable to party a by party b pursuant to section 0
e
ii
0
a
of this agreement as if all transactions were being terminated as of the relevant date
provided that market quotation will be determined by party a using its estimates at mid-market of the amounts that would be paid for replacement transactions
as that term is defined in the definition of
market quotation
in order to ensure that party a does not suffer an economic penalty
i think that we agreed on everything else
please send new blackline
thanks

we will also need to change the existing reference in part 0
f
iii
to
negotiated fallback
to section also
the term
relevant price
is used in the
negotiated fallback
definition
we should clarify whether we need to retain part 0
f
iv
of the schedule when using
negotiated fallback
or whether we intend that
fallback reference dealers
be an entirely separate and distinct fallback
i.e
the 0th fallback in our schedule
i spoke with ed and we should use ena's standard setoff language

i spoke too fast
i don't have a

annex b-0
collateral and exposure provisions
but will send the customized version this evening
sara
ed
for purposes of this
omnibus
transaction
con ed requests cross-default to ena's guarantor and elimination of setoff for the non-defaulting party's affiliates
samantha needs a worksheet for the transaction before she can prepare annex b and b-0
we're sending tonight together with the isda schedule and csa
sam
we need to use the same carve-out for setoff in annex b-0 as in the schedule
sara
we need to send the isda schedule and csa and annex b and b-0 to the following people
ed sacks janelle scheuer tom may
fyi
another addressee
carol
attached is a sample questionnaire
terry
please verify that the call tomorrow works for you
if so
i can call you at whatever phone number you designate
thanks
sara
janelle and tom
ed sacks and i need to speak with you in the a.m
about a few issues
i have questions about market disruption because con ed has asked
0
that market quotation apply rather than loss
in the event of early termination
is this a very liquid market
ena agrees to market quotation only for fx and short term deals in liquid markets
e.g
gas
0
to jointly determine when a market disruption has occurred
after consultation
usually ena as the calculation agent makes this determination in good faith
0
to identify two brokers/pricing platforms for purposes of determining the daily mtm each party typically assesses its own mtm for valuation purposes
whether for collateral calls or termination
etc
sounds like ed and i need to know what was said to con ed about marking
0
i think con ed was headed in the direction of asking that we each provide dealer quotes
rather than ena coming up with two quotes in good faith
as a disruption fallback
tom
i think we discussed this in a different situation
ed and i agreed to conference at 0 am houston time to discuss these and the draft docs
which were e-mailed to you
shari
it looks like bob worked on the company above
it it affiliated with consolidated energy company of new york
inc
and con edison energy solutions
inc
kaye
0 am is good
would you please invite the paralegals and lawyers in the swap group
to please plan to attend a meeting to discuss and learn about confirmations and transactions

etc
janelle and ed
i have received two voice mails from con ed inquiring about resolution of the outstanding issues
i left each of you voice mails about these
i'm not revising any documents until i hear back from you
janelle
please let me know if i need to take any further action
thanks
fyi
susan
did you ever receive this from paul
if not
you should please call him
sara
fyi
paul
could you please resend the hedge fund email
thanks
sara
per
i am told that mark taylor sent an email in december to bob shultz at eol addressing the hedge fund issues
and cta issues
associated with online trading and that you and caroline received that email
apparently the hedge fund crises of last year have heightened regulatory scrutiny of the funds
derivatives activity
eol does not want to be subjected to any regulatory oversight
i have not seen the email yet
i will broach the subject with mark when he returns to the office
scroll down for the mark taylor explanation
in an effort to avoid loss of our executed agreements/files
master agreements
brokerage and futures agreements
repo agreements
we are testing out the
library approach
and instituting a checkout procedure
whenever you remove one of these files from the file cabinet
please
hold the file location
with a signed
card
legal sized
available on top of the master agreement file cabinet
you will also see a large sign reminding you to sign out for your file
when the file is returned
just replace the
card
with the file and delete your name from the
card
please be sure to check out all files currently in your office
thanks for your cooperation
0 am houston time
mark and mark
per is continuing to pursue hedge funds offline and called me yesterday about eol hedge fund trading

ca has not accepted our cross default threshold language or guaranty pending a determination from their credit group
please let me know your response

ss
jason
i had only a few comments
attached
also
thanks for your help on moore capital
rose
please email to me the latest draft of the isda schedule/paragraph 0 so that we can comment
also
information about your outside bahamian counsel would be appreciated
thanks
jason
regarding the above party
ena submitted arbitration and the response was to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of ny courts and waive jury trial
you have this highlighted in yellow and flagged the jury trial waiver
can you recall if you spoke with richard about this issue
hey
stewart
it looks like tana has been corresponding with these guys about eol trading
modesto was planning to address the isda after working with tana on the electronic trading agreement
by copy of this message
tana should let you know if anything recent has happened on the isda front
let me know if you need anything further

texas 0
clem
per my voice mail
please respond to the remaining issues raised by coned's lawyer
0
guarantor agrees that its obligations are unconditional and will not be discharged except by complete payment of the amounts payable under the contract
without setoff of the amount payable under the contract
irrespective of any claims as to the contract's validity
regularity or enforceability or the lack of authority of enron to execute or deliver the contract
or any change or amendment to the contract
whether or not approved by or known to guarantor
response
the bracketed language is unacceptable
what about the bolded language
0
this guaranty shall continue to be effective if the guarantor merges or consolidates with or into another entity
loses its separate legal identity or ceases to exist
response
not sure if this will remain effective if a merger occurs and therefore not binding
e.g
merger without assumption
0
what are you looking for when requiring an
explanation of why such payment is due
in the demand section
paragraph 0
is it to identify the type of default suffered by ena
thanks for your response and i'll let you know if this particular guaranty is still a rush
ss
janelle
i reviewed the email of 0/0/0 from ben chu
there are only 0 items listed
0
i will beef up the language to make it absolutely clear that ena can select the price only if it hears from coned first
0
i am not sure that i agree about the ny iso changing pricing after 0 days
we will need to discuss
i have heard that this is not as frequent an occurrence as in the past and we are using the same mechanism as the isda procedure for change in prices
0
other than the foregoing
he had no other comments exept to say that he would review again
a few items to consider for the paralegals
0
we need to organize the various country opinions
isda closeout netting
ena jurisdictional survey
others
so that they are accessible to the group
we should also have a checkout process for the opinions
we should have access to the ectric opinion database
which i believe is organized online
i know that i can look in a particular file cabinet located near susan for the various volumes of opinions
but where can i find an updated listing of all of the above
0
impress upon everyone the importance of entering information into lotus notes
for all types of agreements
0
i believe that sam is in charge of the unanimous consents
for all enron affiliates
i for one would like an updated book of the consents
kept updated
these consents must be maintained and kept current
if sam is out of the office
we need access to the book
0
we should create a
paralegal manual
as we go
each person could be responsible for drafting sections
and you could review their drafting skills
given some time
i could probably help to identify relevant sections
0
agreement checkout
we need to create a
checkout card
for each file so that when files are returned to the file cabinet
the checkout card is retired and placed inside the file for the next checkout
i will volunteer my assistant to help out but i don't want to step out of turn here so i'll wait to hear from you
0
i have the sense from some of the legal-credit meetings that everyone needs to be reminded to follow up on outstanding isda's
mainly the top ten and high priority items
i'll send additional items as they occur to me
thanks
sara
cheryl
i just finished a conversation with mara alexander re
cargill-alliant
llc

david
in the midst of leaving my voice mail
i think i realized my error
i believe that a guarantor can be a
corporation
entity
having total asssts exceeding $0million
however
that subpart
i
guarantor cannot be one that falls into the subpart
iii
category
which is different from the prior law
ny law is fine

what lawyer should review the securities filing
and other securities issues
for gary's group
is it alan or a different lawyer
anna
attached is the form of enron corp

the data will be accessible to anyone
clem
attached to the end of this string of emails is the bear
stearns
co
bear
form of guaranty
my only issue is with section 0
consents
waivers and renewals of the bear guaranty which bear insists upon
although bear will agree to the enron form of guaranty
our par
0 setoffs and counterclaims problematic in light of bear's waiver provision
i'd like to discuss with you
ena has agreed to a securities lending arrangement with bear and the ene guaranty
capped at $0million and restricted to ena's arrangements with bear
is part of that
package
fyi
several enron companies have accounts with bear
when do you think we could discuss
steve
i know that tana has already answered your immediate question
i am responding because enron corp
is also asking for an isda
i am the enron corp
lawyer
can you also send a draft master to me
thanks
sara
cheryl
have you responded to aneela yet
have drafts alreay been sent
i'd like to make sure that our internal process has been implemented so that we can address gary's workload on a timely basis
if we need to meet
please let me know and i'll have kaye schedule a meeting
this should be sent today
stewart is the commercial person in portland
thanks
ss
you are correct in that i do not need the emails
however
when i receive calls from sheila or gary or a counterparty
i rely upon lotus notes and the information is not there
i know that everyone is working diligently to satisfy the traders
requests
the emails you are sending can be entered directly into the database so that everyone can access the information
i will be glad to show you how to utilize this feature
what do you think is a reasonable date to ask sam and stephanie to complete their review of the brokerage agreements in lotus notes
paul
i'll begin reviewing the comments but you'll have to think about the credit related issues
let me know if you'd like to schedule some time to discuss
stewart
i'd be glad to draft a
sample isda
for you and jeff to use
please verify that the type of counterparty you are looking at will be a on a related matter
we are still waiting to speak with ed sachs about the credit rating for the city of portland and should have the agreement to you afterwards
thanks
i'm sure glad one of us is thinking
brant
i haven't heard of anyone pushing this internally but there are serious issues here because of the
agency
relationship that energy new england has with various municipals

how do you want to handle
i am trying to locate the above identified master
does anyone have this file
sara
jorge

gary hickerson is anxioius to get this resolved today so that ena can begin reducing margin rates with bear
thanks
ed
brant
i'm being hounded by ene but no enron traders seem interested
brant prepared a new worksheet based upon which we sent a new isda
ene
represents
four municipal utilities and is trying to negotiate isda's on behalf of those utilities
i think the agent is off-base and i'm not sure that any of the utilities really want to trade financial
ed
shari suggested that you may have some insight into ene
should i drop this one altogether
or are we interested in pursuing
either ed or brant please let me know
thanks
i received a call from doug sewall
midwest power

i am negotiating with first union national bank
party b below
is the following rep ok
party b is a national banking association organized under the laws of the united states of america and is treated as a corporation for united states tax purposes
why does the bank see the need for the latter clause
richard
highlighted below are changes to our standard confidentiality language requested by a banking counterparty to an isda agreement
would you let meknow if it is acceptable

sharon
with respect to the ene form of guaranty
we will agree to delete paragraph 0
setoff and counterclaims
in its entirety
this is a major concession by ene
can you now agree to the remainder of the ene guaranty format
please let me know
thanks
tanya
there are a few issues left
0
re
legal name of our counterparty
according to funb
there is no legal entity named
first union national bank
charlotte
if s&p is including the city where funb is headquartered as part of their legal name
then s&p is wrong
funb has asked that we forward the s&p document that you are looking at
0
re
funb request to provide us with first union corp
financials and your response that it's ok if first union corp
signs on as a guarantor
funb says that first union national bank doesn't prepare annual statements
funb can provide quarterly call reports
with ytd info
which is also available on the fdic page
www.fdic.gov
funb annual financials also available on edgar
i don't know what a call report is and funb did not offer up first union corp
as a guarantor
0
re
0 year bonds which you agreed to accept as eligible credit support
i don't know what the
usual haircut
is on these issues
you said 0% or 0%
legal no longer offers up bonds in our documents which is why we haven't discussed haircuts lately
0
re
the specified conditions of tax event
tax event upon merger and credit event upon merger
funb would rather terminate than collateralize transactions
and eliminate obligations to transfer in avoidance of termination
if a specified condition exists
then there is no obligation to deliver collateral to that party
experiencing the specified condition
and a secured party could exercise all remedies available to it against the pledgor
i think that we have a different philosophy in that we would prefer to preserve transactions
i'm more willing to give in on the tax events
but global mergers could force that issue and the agreement basically requires the affected party to try to transfer the transaction to avoid termination
please let me know if you have any questions
thanks
sara
dee
i am trying to hear from credit on about four issues
namely
the legal entity
need for first union corp
guaranty
due to the availability of financials
haircut on bonds and specified conditions
i would then propose preparation of a blackline to squeeze out the remaining issues
if i hear from credit tomorrow
and i'm pushing
i could have the blackline by wednesday and we could talk
hopefully
we'd be done by this week
hope this works
regards
mark
i vote for a review of the act now
say the last week of february
feb 0
march 0
the isda seminar is the following week if that is an attraction for the speaker
i will give you a list of suggested issues in the next day or so
have fun
tanya
our legal group would like to schedule instructional seminars covering the isda schedule
credit support annex
omnibus and other forms and
specifically
the credit issues which arise in the preparation and negotiation of these documents
our thought is to eventually offer regular instruction every other month but we believe that initially we should offer monthly seminars
in order to avoid
legal/credit tuesday
boredom
we propose wednesday or thursday as a regular luncheon meeting date
how does the week of february 0 or 0 sound
i believe that we can circulate a
curriculum
of sorts to you or at the least a listing of topics
please let me know what you think
as always
we welcome your suggestions
stephanie
did this amendment include the weather rep as cargill requested in late january
see lotus notes entry
no
i received a single page which is the ubs standard blank form for
authorized traders
no names
no addresses
etc
sam
yesterday morning i needed to locate the latest ena consent for authorized trading
is it possible for you to keep a current set of these resolutions in a labelled notebook where everyone can access at all times
i've tabled this one
sheila
here's the email
i'll call sharon now
richard
this is a first for me
i received the following objection to our standard arbitration language
the arbitration does not provide for expedited procedures with limited discovery and limited live testimony
this could take as long as in court and cost more
is this a valid objection
if so
how should we amend our language
or should we be silent as to jurisdicition without waiving any objections
venue
forum
and waive jury trial
i look forward to hearing from you
thanks
dana
i haven't heard from credit
why don't you call tana jones
our eol paralegal specialist
at 0-0-0 and let her know that you want to pursue the electronic trading agreement and gtc's for online trading
i will also provide tana with the background discussion that you and i had
at least she can get you moving on eol and pursue credit at the same time
let me know if you have any questions
thanks
tana
a lawyer from amerada hess
dana dellacona
will probably call you about eol trading
she is interested in several trading relationships which you can see from the email that i sent to tanya
let me know if you have any questions
thanks
i'm at my desk for about an hour
then after 0 pm houston time
cheryl
please handle
thanks
you're right
i can't open the doc
dee
i tried to call you about 0 minutes ago
together with my credit guys
we would really like to chat today

please talk to my assistant kaye ellis

to try to talk at about 0pm houston time
thanks
tanya
first union has asked for the following
choice 0
minimum transfer amount of $0,0/rounding of $0,0 choice 0
minimum transfer amount of $0,0/rounding of $0,0 we're almost done

attached is my
short version
of eligible contract participant
i would generally send to credit
new lawyer
etc
i am still uncertain about the status of the trade option exemption
issue 0
i understood from the conversation that you
brent and i had that the old rules were out
i have heard a different interpretation
what is the status of this exemption under the new law
darren
0
goldman sachs ena executed the client access agreement with goldman
sachs
co
on june 0
0
since you are trading in the name of ena
you should not need to execute an additional agreement
i confirmed this with ted leh this morning
at ted's suggestion
please forward to me the fax number and email address of the goldman person requesting that you execute further documentation
i can fax to him a copy of the agreement and correspond by email
i will also copy ted leh and vivian siao
keeps track of agreements and authorized traders
so that everyone is up to date
i spoke with sheryl gallant
ena and other enron affiliates are already trading on the ubs electronic websites for otc transactions
interestingly enough
ubs does not require an electronic trading agreement to be signed by a customer for online trading
in other words
ena has an executed isda with ubs dated may 0
0
you are an authorized trader for ena and ubs is happy to let you access their platform
sheryl does not know why jun ishi requested execution of a
client user list
i.e
an authorized trader list
and said to forget it
if you would like for me to speak to jun ishi or correspond with him
please send his email address
just let me know
please let me hear from you if you would like for me to pursue further
as a representative of ena
you will probably have most agreements already in place
bob
could you please forward changes to the ag section to kaye
thanks
sara
marcelo
thanks for the info
i'm attaching comments to appendix c
i also have someone reviewing appendix b and am preparing appendix a
clem
attached to this email you should find a marked version of the enron corp
guaranty
a few points
0
bear claims that the
cap
language which we typically include is inadequate because the wording implies
under ny law
that if a lesser amount is owed at any time
then the cap is reduced to that amount
i've not heard of this before
i believe that they can send the treatise background info if you'd like
0
the guaranty covers obligations of ena in its bear account and with respect to the margin lending agreement
bear has added
performance
to the guaranty as a guarantor obligation
ena's account obligations pertain to the payment of money
margin
under the margin lending agreement
ena could have to deliver securities sold short in the market pursuant to a loan from bear
failure to deliver these securities would trigger a default
which is essentially reduced to a payment of money
0
although bear removed our setoff/counterclaim paragraph
you should refer to par
0 to see their own version
please call me to discuss as ena is anxious to reduce our margin rates with bear
the bear lawyer is leaving town tomorrow afternoon
thanks
dee
we are working on the blackline
since the
deal
that you mentioned yesterday has no bearing on the master between ena and funb
there is no emergency at hand
a few things to note
0
regarding
procedures for entering into transactions
my suggestion is that you consider a reasonable time period in which to respond upon receipt of a confirmation
it is in both parties best interest to have an executed
and therefore enforceable
writing this can be accomplished by under the ny general obligations law by our agreement as to a
deemed response
if a party will not sign a trade confirmation
0
regarding the concept of
specified transaction
ena has reconsidered the earlier concession to exclude most termination events as specified conditions
it is not ena's position to unwind transactions upon the occurrence of these events
and
therefore
each party ought to be able to rely upon the protections afforded it under the related provisions
regarding the credit event upon merger
funb is protected with the amendment which we make to section 0
b
iv
i hope that the blackline will resolve our outstanding issues
cheryl
enron credit inc
a delaware corporation
has been created for u.s
debt trading currently handled by ena
as a result
ena will need to transfer its brokerage debt positions to enron credit inc
accounts with those brokers
the brokers include our favorites
bear stearns companies morgan stanley
co
inc
goldman sachs
co
ena will need to assign its positions by the end of february
0
richard sage
london office
will need to see the
sample package
unanimous consent
authorized trader list
will you please see that an email is sent to richard with this information
we should begin the documentation now
let me know if you have any questions
just check with bob late in the morning
trena
attached is an email from joe hunter which has some of your answers
you may want to chat with shifali sharma
i don't know her but will be glad to call
my guess is that many of the crude deals are brokered
maybe that's why the deals originate in houston
i'm also forwarding to you joe's message about traders
please call me if we need to pursue further
ss
cheryl
sheila can print out a listing of instruments to be assigned to each new enron credit inc
account
the portfolio includes high-risk
high yield instruments
we should contact the brokers today or tomorrow for the form of agreements
why don't you ask stephanie or sam to prepare three sets of assignments
they should coordinate with sheila to identify the attachment
clem

stephanie
please see me about a
draft isda municipal format
let's talk as soon as you have a minute and prioritize
thanks
sara
ok
i think i inadvertently registered twice
please delete the duplicate registration
thank you
richard
the corporate workbook reflects that the officers of enron credit
inc
all reside in the u.k
i don't see anyone identified with a power of attorney for executing documents in houston
as there may be tax issues associated with u.k
officers signing
in the u.k
on behalf of a u.s
company
i am asking for verification from janine
my suggestion is that enron credit ltd
negotiate and execute the agreement and include the usual
affiliates
representatives
etc
who may need to know any confidential information
your v.p.'s are all in london
if janelle confirms that it's alright for brown
sherriff or seyfried to sign for enron credit
inc
from london
then we can prepare the document and have a v.p
sign and fax the agreement to the u.s
party
at a minimum
though
we should try to work from our form of nda
let me know if you have any questions
i believe that there is a general consensus that clem needs assistance to respond timely to the mounting number of guaranties requested from enron corp
in speaking with clem
it seems that any evidence of increased and increasing business and demand for guaranties will be helpful for him to obtain help
would your group be able to put together some facts and projections which might address the continuing demand for new guaranties
since you are the first
and most important
point of contact for evaluating potential business
i think that your input would be extremely valuable for clem to
plead his case
stephanie
let's prepare and submit for execution
let me know if you have any questions
thanks
carson
i'm doing fine
thank you very much
it's about time to call donna and raid somene's wine cellar and/or refrigerator
i'm not going out of town any time soon so let's pick a date
guenther
thanks for the response
i'll wait to hear from richard sage as to who owns the information
only officers at the vp level or higher may execute binding contracts for all enron u.s
companies
bylaws
i do not know the
rule
for non-u.s
companies
although i suspect the articles of association would contain that information
laurel
cheryl nelson is handling this and she will be back in the office on monday
by copy of this message
i ask that she contact you

ellen
do you want me to contact the lawyer

thanks
anna

jeff

richard
certainly ecl can execute the nda
i am not the ecl lawyer
tom

sam
the addressee for the guaranty is
mmidden@anz.com
his name is michael midden
the message is
attached for your immediate review is the form of enron corp
enron
guaranty which would be utilized to guaranty all financial trading obligations pursuant to an isda master agreement and transactions thereunder which would be entered into between enron north america corp
and anz bank
jason williams
in enron's risk control group
asked that you receive a copy of enron's form of guaranty if you had not already received one
we are in the process of preparing a draft isda master agreement and will forward it to you next week
please let us know if you have any questions
please copy jay williams and me
thanks and sorry for such short notice
anna
i have not seen the executed enron corp

when we reopen for business
we should talk first thing on tuesday
a couple of items
0
the securities loan agreement is between bear
stearns
co
inc
and enron north america corp
you requested the bear stearns companies inc
as the guaranty beneficiary
although that party is incorrectly stated as being party to the securities loan agreement
i just wanted to verify your preference and we may want to modify the first page to be accurate
0
as you requested that i prepare the schedules a and b
i ask the following
i
as to schedule a
please submit your notice information
ii
as to schedule b
we propose the default interest rate to be the federal funds rate as defined in your agreement
please respond and we can finalize the agreement
please let me know if there is anything further you require

susan is trying to revise the services agreement once again and the
governing law
issue was raised
i do not have any memoranda addressing which choice of law would be binding on enron japan corp
however
i note that the draft isda marked by our japanese counsel for use by enron japan corp
and ibj elects new york law
aa email to me dated 0/0/0
are either texas or new york law preferable for the services agreement
thanks for your assistance
regards
welcome back
i've marked the new guaranty but i wanted to see the assignment first
i have the master file in my office
ss
please assign to the list of new masters for preparation and execution
susan
don't we always include
change of ownership
has credit ever requested anything different
richard
your deadlines for the securities loan agreement for and related guaranties are impossible to meet
0/0/0 was last friday
the same agreement with ena has yet to be completed due to protracted negotiations
please advise as to who in credit approved the usd0million enron corp
guaranty on behalf of eci
also
fyi
bear will not provide a reciprocal guaranty for ena
tanya
further to richard sage's memo of earlier
are you handling credit for the securities loan agreement which richard is asking for eci and bear
and i'm going on friday
0/0 at the same time
per my voice mail
see par
0
second paragraph therein
beneficiary's
is the correct word
your immediate reply is appreciated
sara
cindy
attached
very bottom
is the execution copy of the bear stearns guaranty
please have this executed
together with the appropriate certificates
thanks for your help
also
let me know when the guaranty is ready
sara
richard
further to my message below
after speaking with sheila
it appears that the securities loan agreement that ena will sign
hopefully tomorrow
is actually the same agreement to be used by enron credit inc
eci
i think we can have this assigned from ena to eci
we will have to get a new guaranty from enron corp
i still do not know anything about the bear guaranty that you mentioned in your email
please advise
also
please verify for me which office will prepare confirmations for eci
if it is london
is there a services agreement in place between ena and ei
carlos
attached are my comments to the lme product
also
i understand that the forward and currency swap products are already online
i only noted that the reference to greenwich mean time in your draft appeared as
greenwich meantime
you may have already made this correction
bob
now there's the real reason
if there are two new softs entities
then ena and ectric lose the netting benefits
the tax issues are transparent
it's like the two credit derivative entities
who is involved from credit
we need to discuss the structures with them because credit may be concerned about the loss of netting privileges
also
we need to verify that us entity softs trades will be usd based and the european softs entity will settle in euro or gbp
it seems obvious but a us entity could routinely settle in a currency other than usd
ss
tanya
who in your group handles softs
coffee
sugar
cocoa
as you may know
softs have been approved for otc financial trading
we are currently structuring the softs trading entity
ies
and i think credit should be involved
janine juggins is handling tax
susan
the internal eol fx products will be opened up to third parties shortly
i'm reviewing the gtc's
with respect to the tax reps which are incorporated into the gtc's
i think we need a
universal

the bear/ena securities loan agreement will be signed tonight and bear should receive tomorrow morning
the enron corp
guaranty has been executed as well and will be included in the package
i will also ask bear for an immediate assignment of the agreement to enron credit inc
sorry for the confusion over this agreement
i didn't realize that ena was doing this for eci
janine
congratulations on your promotion
i need an update on the back-office relationship between enron credit inc
eci
and enron credit ltd
ecl
does london confirm the eci trades
if so
i assume there is a power of attorney from eci to someone in london
or will eci trades be confirmed in the u.s
i received a call from someone in london inquiring as to whether greg whalley could sign for ena because he was in london
i believe this was in relation to the credit business
are u.k
traders booking credit deals in the name of ena or is this some type of back-office function performed on behalf of ena
any reason not to use eci or ecl here
also
can you send a copy of the services agreement
if any
between any companies performing services on behalf of either eci or ecl
thanks
anna
i just received your voice mail
the package
including the enron corp
guaranty
has already gone out via federal express to your attention

would like to assign the agreement to enron credit inc
a delaware corporation
would you like for me to prepare the assignment or shall i

0
is it ok for jp to combine our orders with orders of other clients and jp's affiliates

is it ok

do you want to agree to an interest rate
on customer funds
upfront or only
as agreed from time to time
susan
you've just hit the nail on the head
remember
for fx trading ena is always the principal
either in houston
through eeft as agent
under services agreement which i presume covers fx deals
or enron japan corp
under services agreement
most problematic are the counterparties since they could originate from anywhere in the world
i have heard that enron japan had some gtc's that contained
universal tax reps
but i haven't checked it out
why don't you give me a call
paul

i've not reviewed these
my apologies
and i'd ask until thursday
if possible
please let me know
i will block off this afternoon to focus
is anyone familiar with an isda master agreement executed between ena and the above company
i have received a security agreement executed by this party seeking ena's signature and the document references the endorsement
to a policy
what policy
issued to ena on 0/0/0 which defines the isda agreement
this could be related to credit activity in london
i am waiting to hear from jeff kinneman and denis o'connell

all of our master agreements
whether or not related to structured deals
are logged into our lotus notes database to which london has access
please provide me with a list and copies of the isda master agreements
and/or related financial agreements
which have been executed by london in the name of ena
these agreements should also be logged onto the ena database
will these masters be assigned to enron credit inc
will all trades be assigned
if so
will you prepare the assignment for execution
thanks
melissa
why can't we state the total nq in mwh's
rather than simply mws/hr
i think the physicial confirms provide for a total contract quantity
mary
do you have a form of
approved
assignment for transferring trades into the raptor vehicle
cheryl
please be sure to schedule our regular meeting with credit
we missed you yesterday
are the two electronic trading agreements for ena and ect investments with different bear entities

the two referenced agreements

thanks for your help
working great
anna
as promised
i am reviewing your new form of account agreement
as well as the assignment
can you please tell me what document the new account agreement was marked against
it is not marked against ena's existing agreement dated
january
0
regards
i appreciate your message
just let the group know if you're unable to attend
wendi
caroline wants a quick response
what issues do you have
can i have a copy
denis
per my voice mail
please advise which ena officer will execute your documents for ena
when we hear from you
we can have the docs executed and delivered
also
we need copies of the executed ena masters and the information entered into lotus notes
thanks for your help
yes
my recollection is that janelle was negotiating a deal with these guys in january
0
i had conversations with david adams and grant adamson but i can't recall if the swaption was ever executed
i discussed the confirmation problem with david and noted that a small percentage of confirms were being marked inconsistently
in dec
0
after months of trading without any changes at all
he was too busy to focus
and was a new lawyer
i think
which is why changes were appearing in the omnibus
frank
i think his changes were with respect to addresses
accounts
etc
do we need to include an affirmative statement by ag that it assumes all obligations under the master
i'm neutral
frank
do you have the glencore file
susan
looks like it worked
can you please repsond to john's request
denis
please arrange with jeff to have someone available to sign as jeff can explain the purpose of your deal
when executed
we can fax per your earlier email
if necessary
get jeff and samantha on the phone
john
i hope you are able to locate an executed isda master agreement between rmt and eecc inasmuch as neither our database nor files reflect one
i've asked susan bailey to resend the draft schedule
in the event that we need to execute this schedule
you should provide us with appropriate notice information
we can then prepare execution originals
let me know if you need further assistance
thanks
with respect to morgan
i believe that a paragraph could be added to reflect the parties
agreement to a forum other than a contract market
i.e
aaa
and if the customer chose a particular forum for arbitration
then the parties could stipulate that the arbitrators not have authority to award punitive
exemplary or similar damages
because these are fairly old forms
i can't recall the reason for excluding this language
i'll schedule some time on monday for us to talk
i think these guys are trying to create a $0m line
$0m collateral threshold from the isda credit support annex and a separate $0m line for the global agency trading
all trading with cargill will be subject to the isda master agreement and credit support annex
wendi and i discussed briefly and we'll call you later
it seems that wendi has spoken with mark rubenstein who handles credit and there is some confusion
wendi
following is a quick message i shot off to caroline
she will wait for us to call
dee
let me know if we need to discuss anything
i am hopeful that we are ready to prepare execution copies
regards
i don't know anything about these transactions
calculation of floating amount
the floating amount payable by
ena
on a payment date will be calculated for that payment date as follows
floating amount =
notional quantity per calculation period x floating
other provisions
on each payment date
ena
shall pay
a fee of
an amount equal to
usd
0,0
which amount shall be subject to the netting provisions of the
master agreement
how do you refer to the agreement
looks fine

as to daishowa
interesting
morgan just proposed language similar to my earlier email
for a futures agreement but the language mirrors that used on the brokerage side
maybe its unenforceable

i would like to speak with you especially since i'm speaking with credit about municipals on wednesday
as a practical matter
i'm not sure whether we even transact with utilities on the omnibus
perhaps tana can answer the question as to online trading and the confirmation desk as to offline trading
secondly
i'm not sure how often the additional event of default is successfully negotiated into the isda agreement
the latter point might be worth an email to the lawyers
do you have a few minutes today
frank
brant's worksheet contains the remaining items for the amendment to the isda master agreement

all transactions between ena and mirant americas energy marketing should be subject to the existing isda between erms and vastar gas marketing inc
as amended
the existing guaranty from vastar resources
inc
applies to all trades through approximately the end of this week who have you spoken with at mirant as a follow up to our conversation of last friday
it appears that mirant is trying to prevent trading until the new guaranty is in place
frank has contacted mirant legal and are in agreement in principle as to the new guaranty from mirant corporation
however
we understand that this entity will be spun off in the near future and the credit could change substantially
have you given thought to the effect of the new guaranty
also
have we traded today with mirant americas energy marketing
online or offline
we should talk to our traders about apparent authority and/or save tapes if we are having problem call
we will negotiate a new isda in the next few months
all
i have verified with cp that we do not want to stop financial trading between cp and ena
the immediate plan is as follows
0
immediate new guaranty from mirant corporation
frank to send draft in the a.m
0
immediate amendment of the existing isda master agreement to replace vastar with mirant corporation as the credit support provider
cp to send draft in the a.m
0
immediate execution of a short letter agreement to reflect that all financial trades done until the effective date of the new guaranty will be honored by cp and subject to the existing isda master agreement
i will prepare

if anyone has any questions
please let me knowl let's all stay in touch throughout the day to get this done

i thought that wendi was waiting to hear back from cargill incorporated credit
once we understood what cargill was looking for
i was hoping to speak with their lawyer and agree to eliminate all of the provisions appearing in the draft poa which did not really concern ena

that's an internal job for cargill
i hope that we can speak on monday
maybe you can coordinate tomorrow with wendi

the trading limitation language is not intended to kick in for intraday limit moves but only at the end of the day
i.e
closing or settlement price
we want the language to remain the same
hope this works

you can include the witness line for our signatory

thanks for your patience
tracy
i just spoke wtih stewart about this counterparty and the fact that you previously prepared credit
for physical trading
please send a credit worksheet for financial trading and we can deliver a draft isda to the lawyer per stewart's instructions
let me know if you have any questions

choices
for preparing the documents
see part 0
tax reps
and the end of the document which has our
choices
of tax forms
i thought it might be helpful to be very basic about withholding issues
etc
why we need the tax reps
and what questions we could ask upfront about a party that would help us select an appropriate tax module
we tend to not
think
and expect a party
fill in the blank
when we are preparing draft documents
done
don't worry about this
i'll let you know about our next meeting
thanks for your help as i really appreciate it
gordon
please advise carol
mary and me
thanks
mark
this is a chronic problem which i have addressed with cheryl on more than one occasion
hence the email of this morning
her priorities are not currently with the swap group
also
carol will not be a reliable backup for structured deals since julia's group will demand more of her time
i don't know what angela's load will be like as an ongoing substitute
last night we received notice of yosemite iv and i'm hoping that angela can cover
alternatively
we may need to consider frank
francisco or cheryl
russell
i received your voice mail about the one
0
year financial trade done between ena and cp
the three-month limitation on trades is only an internal ena control which was imposed by credit some years ago
please refer to lotus notes for a more comprehensive explanation
the master agreement has been executed
however
cp was unable to render a legal opinion vouching for
blanket
enforceability of the trades due to conflicting puc orders which are still in effect today
what is credit's position when your internal policy is violated
who was the trader
have you spoken with the trader
tracy
thanks for your continued assistance in this transaction
would you please send me a copy of the
schedule i
listing of transactions which were transferred to allegheny
teresa
your emails have not gone unheeded
we were facilitating things for richard and he needs to let us know his slate for the u.s
segment of the london business
we'll wait to hear from richard
if you have any questions please give me a call
thanks
justin
i haven't heard from you in some time now
how is everything
are you going to be in san antonio
i wanted to set up a short call to discuss equity trading and what houston and london can do
are doing
to stay abreast of activity and developments on the trading desks
please let me know a convenient time for you
thanks
yes
we distributed several memoranda to the group before ken raceler's talk
you should have received one
tracy
these guys emailed only names of lawyers
accountants
etc
rawleigh white is the cfo for the tribe
the
broker
intermediary is jeff fuller with power resources managers

who told me that the tribe is an oregon tribe located in bend
oregon
i will separately send you stewart's prior message
i'll send these guys a draft
without credit
thanks
here's the other message
susan
i agreed with kim farr at first union to send our resolution
with certificate
when you have a chance
would you please handle
thanks
p.s
first union will be an important equity trading partner for enron corp
and we'll be dealing with the same lawyers
etc
kim and jay
attached is the format which we last discussed
remember
this is what we require for municipals and governmental entities
call if you have any quesitons
thanks
here's a recap for everyone
our original negotiation with bear
for the securities loan agreement
was in the name of ena
and
ena had an existing account agreement with bear
however
bear insisted that the account agreement was
too old
and that we negotiate a new agreement
i agreed on the condition that this not hold up execution of the securities loan agreement
we have one or two final points remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ena and enron credit inc
eci
we have the authorized trader list for eci and are waiting for richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we are prepared for execution by the existing officers in london
the assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the eci book from ena to eci
it will take only a few days to replace the existing ene guaranty for the securities loan agreement
jeff and sheila
please verify that both ena and eci do not need the securities loan agreement
i believe it is just eci and we can transfer the existing agreement to eci
stewart
i spoke with rawleigh white
tribal cfo
and the tribe's outside counsel the other day
pending receipt of tracy's credit worksheet
i'll send the tribe/lawyers a
sample isda without credit
which is not specific to the tribe
the lawyers will begin to determine if the tribe is an
eligible contract participant
for purposes of the commodity exchange act
rawleigh wants to know if enron is interested in helping the tribe finance the purchase of the two dams
can you please address for west origination and respond to raleigh
thanks
susan
i've spoken with a new indian tribe and need to send the
sample governmental isda
to several people
i
ll forward the names/addresses to you
stewart rosman is the commercial person and he should be copied as well as tracy ngo
please include the following message
verify the question i left for you
with the attachment
per our recent conversation
please find attached a sample schedule to the isda master agreement
and paragraph 0 to the isda credit support annex
susan
can we send
which is not tailored specifically for the tribe
we will be able to provide a specific schedule and paragraph 0 after our credit group has concluded its review
you may already be familiar with the isda municipal counterparty schedule and will note that although we are incorporating many of those provisions
we assume that you have the isda boilerplate
for the master agreement and the credit support annex
please let us know if you have any questions
attached are the email addresses
cheryl
you may want to mention to anna
bear
that ena would like to transfer the securities loan agreement to enron credit inc
retrieve the ene guaranty for ena and have enron credit inc
guaranteed under a new ene guaranty
kaye
please send this fax
i have the info if you still need it
please forward your comments
thanks
sorry
the product must be ready next week
sheila
thanks for the message
i spoke with mike schneider
who contacted me
he's at 0-0-0
to confirm our agreement and wanted to let you know that he was apologetic for having not having
better rates
to charge ena
he said he's been after enron's business for some time and hopes to reduce rates in the course of business
if possible
i thought you might want to have this bit of information
regards
sara
jp morgan is sending the execution copy
here's the list
rex and jim
by this time
i'm sure clint has spoken with you about the ene puts
i am reviewing the proposed language and will advise of any comments
the time works fine

how does the attached work for the bofc/ndf
i am not necessarily proposing that we use this for the eol deal
hey
jason
hope you're doing alright
i received a call from ny and before i called back
i checked the infamous lotus notes
it seems that you were going to send a letter to ny summarizing the outstanding issues
i think there was only one issue
please let me know if this was ever done
thanks
on a sad note
i don't know if you heard but samantha's 0-month old daughter
adoption not final
was killed in a tragic car accident last week
the child managed to crawl under the car while it was in the driveway and sam didn't see her
did you really get to know samantha
if so
and if you would like her home address
please let me know

there has not been a commercial push from the ena perspective to set up a new agreement with fpl which explains why i cannot get our credit goup to react
i'll broach the topic again when i hear from you
please let me know if you have any other questions
maria
i was waiting to see if jason peters ever sent a
position letter
to you when we brought this negotiation back inhouse
absent that information
it appears that we had at least one issue remaining and it concerned the disruption fallbacks
in particular
your request for both you and ena to each obtain two quotes and then average those quotes
the ultimate fallback
we cannot agree to your request
the last database entry i reflect was in october

when we were having difficulty obtaining your response
given the lapse of time
we could try to generate a blackline and review the status
please let me know what you would like to do

how difficult is it to get from the baltimore ariport to you

i'll ask susan b

final version gtc's
the legal terminology is identical for each product
however
stuart needs to provide a title for each product which will also appear in the paragraph 0
the former paragraph 0 has been deleted
it contained the
confirmation terms
and the remaining paragraphs renumbered
justin
will you circulate the revised long description
since your conversation with stuart yesterday afternoon
also
will you let us all know when we are competely done
please call with comments as soon as possible
subsequent to our swap group meeting with clement last week
i have discussed the issue further with jeff hodge
peter keohane
russell diamond and clem
in addition to ena
ecc is feeling the pressure of delays for obtaining corporate guaranties caused by increased guaranty requests
too few signers and insufficient legal staffing to handle the volume
although clem will have assistance soon
we concluded that it would be prudent to begin negotiation of a guaranty immediately rather than wait for the conclusion of the master agreement
or confirmation
negotiations
please try to incorporate this approach
particularly with canadian counterparties
credit will continue to push our internal form of enron corp
guaranty
tracy
the allegheny swap side letter provides that the parties will make a good faith effort to negotiate the isda master by april 0
i am waiting with the firrst redraft of the agreement but can't get a response from anyone as to whom and where to send
via email
i've left voice mails for yair and kate at allegheny and lauren at sullivan and cromwell
can you exert some pressure here
hi
lauren
i cannot find the new email address for the allegheny lawyer for delivery of a revised isda schedule
i left a voice mail for yair yaish and for laurie but have not heard back
can you provide me with the latest information
are you the lawyer who should receive this schedule
please let me hear from you

jorge
i may send you some emails throughout the day to help clarify some things for me
where are your definitions of
calculation period
and
ipa modified calculation period
in your definition of
ipa floating rate payment
you use the term
share spread
which is not defined
what do you mean
there is a dangling definition of
share spread
at the end of the ipa compensation section
but it refers to spreads appearing in either annex i or annex ii
in the
ipa compensation
section
how is

this must be determined on an ad hoc basis
ours
cheryl
glad you got the info
let me know if you need anything further
yes
i did
but i had an error in your email address that i didn't correct
do we need to do something about that
are you supposed to receive information
let's send out this in the morning
if possible
is the worksheet attached
i couldn't access it
we'll need address into from john malowney
portland
if wendy doesn't have it
sounds like keegan has somethig wrong
i have no meetings scheduled with you tomorrow
i don't know anything about a 0 am meeting
the brokerage meetings were originally scheduled every other week until we could bring ourselves up to date
and we met last week
the swap group meeting is always held twice monthly
hope this helps
cheryl
i think it would be helpful for the desk and legal to retain monthly meetings just to stay abreast of activity and expectations
why don't we keep the end of month meetings
i'll resend the schedule to you

aesc and ena entered into a
side letter agreement

ena and aesc have agreed this morning to negotiate and execute a new isda master agreement by april 0
0
until that date
however
we can confirm financial trades between ena and aesc under the side letter agreement
attached below is a markup of an isda form of confirmation which contains language for these confirmations
the draft was prepared for kim hundl handling financial power
please let me know if you have any questions
kim
it looks fine
and
you should use this format until the isda is executed
we spoke with allegheny this morning and they promise to execute next week
diane
attached is a blackline for the first deal
but you should use the language for both deals
let me know if you have any questions
cheryl
just a bit of history
i think that the partial listing of officers on the
authorized traders
list is only meant to be illustrative of corporate officers and directors
the ena unanimous consent for the relevant company is the authority for document execution
if
for example
a vp is authorized to execute for a particular company
by virtue of a corporate resolution or unanimous consent
and that particular vp's name does not appear in the partial listing
exection is not invalidated
the execution is valid
have you had a broker question ena's authority
stephanie
aesc and enron north america corp
have an executed master agreement currently in the form of a
side letter isda agreement
which is enforceable and sufficient to permit online financial trading for gas and power
i have no preferance but it looks like the 0th is best
each period from
and including
one valuation date to
but excluding the next following applicable valuation date during the term of the transaction
except that
a
the initial calculation period will commence on
and include
january 0
0 and
b
the final calculation period will end on
but exclude
the termination date

hi
michael
hope all is well
just curious if london might be interested in a george washington university mba
international business
looking for work in london or europe
she is a family friend
she is bilingual
swedish and english
and fluent in french and german
she also has work experience
i am going to send her resume to hr in houston and suggest her for the analyst/associate program
however
i wasn't certain as to whether the london/european offices worked through a different processs
please let me know if you think there may be some interest
has anyone handled
no
thanks
i'll wait for cheryl's review
thanks
i only asked keegan for the most recent version since i misplaced it
she misread my message
in any event
i told her i'd wait for the updated version
also
you know stephanie is on vacation this week
ed
further to my voice mail of earlier today
the ci guaranty appears to be limited in duration but there is not a specific term
how long must the guaranty remain effective
mara
attached are blacklined versions based upon cargill's comments to both the enron corp
and cargill
incorporated which i received from ed sacks
please note that i added a comma to guarantor's name in the cargill
incorporated guaranty since that is how we executed the cargill
incorporated isda master agreement
also
your change to the setoff language is fine
let's try to agree to everything this week
thanks
ed
for the additional event of default
ratings trigger
do you intend the mac to apply when only one or both credit ratings disappear
tanya
do we need to differentiate between the mac as used in the csa and in the schedule
as an
additional event of default
with respect to the disappearance of a credit rating from either s&p or moody's
or both
based on your usage in power masters
i believe that we agreed that for purposes of the csa
when s&p and moody's are indicated on the credit worksheet
both ratings must disappear to trigger the mac
for purposes of an additional event of default
should we just pose the question to credit
mark
when you have a few minutes
i'm glad to discuss continuing
training
and balancing workloads
mary has no one to unload canada and structured transactions
global finance
since carol does not have time for either
angela has no time for equity deals
i think we need a backup for each
perhaps anne koehler fits the bill
or cheryl
each of anne and cheryl need isda experience
i don't know francisco's longer term schedule and maybe you need to speak with him and/or mark haedicke about his contined international workload
this could turn into a
yao long term project
per my voice mail
second request russ and richard
i have never had a response from anyone at lehman about my prior attached message
will one of you please call me
yes
eligible contract participant
ecp
is an issue
both ena and ectri are delaware corporations and are therefore subject to the jurisdiction of the commodity futures trading commission
the u.s
regulatory agency with oversight for derivatives
as a practical matter
i understand that ectri does have many executed isda agreements
i do not know the volume of
omnibus
trades
however
the ectri omnibus should have ecp representations in the annex
kristina
please call me at work

the general manager or other authorized officers as noted in the power risk management guidelines to execute confirmations of transactions within the limits specified in the power risk management guidelines
each time ena trades with eweb
the trader must verify whether the eweb trader is authorized under the then current version of the power risk management guidelines
each date you execute a trade
0
you will need a list of authorized traders
authorized to enter into derivative transactions
certified by eweb's secretary to be correct as of the trade date and
0
a statement certified by eweb's secretary that the transaction falls within the limits specified in the most current version of the power risk management guidelines
effective as of the trade date
we have only a portion of the power risk management guidelines and it is dated april 0
0
our version is incomplete and probably outdated
maybe eweb will provide you with the current version
it would be a lot easier if eweb's resolution simply authorized it to enter into financial trades documented under the isda
which is what most resolutions permit
however
eweb did not obtain a broad resolution
to melissa
sharen and kim
we should also verify that our confirmations contain these representations
please talk to me
fyi
i don't understand your message
parties must be
eligible
at the time each transaction is entered into
i'm running behind and will try to review first thing in the a.m
please find out if cheryl wants to cancel the brokerage meeting tomorrow
it's fine with me
kaye
can you please email the prior report to me
thanks
jorge
the attached confirmation looks fine
however
you did not attach annex ii which is referenced all over the confirmation
for future reference
calculation period
s
should be used for multiple periods
tanya

please prepare a new isda
i'm waiting for instructions from the counterparty as to distribution
attached is my redline
call me so that we can discuss the remaining issues
including
0
calculation agent
we believe that the existing dispute mechanism is adequate
0
procedures for entering into transactions
there is no procedure for dual confirms
this is too confusing
0
transfer
we cannot agree to your assignment provision as it is too subjective
the other changes were not substantive
diane
attached are my revisions to the form of confirmation
which are not on the actual confirms you will be using
you will need to incorporate the section entitled
additional provisions
and you will also need to add the exhibit a guaranty
please let me
and mark beese
review before this is sent
please call if you have questions.l
susan
this is for the ing master
we need to email to cheryl and her colleagues

ed

inc
this will require changes to the
additional provisions
section
part
b

thanks
dick
attached are my comments to the certificates
we will need to attach the form of confirmation to be certain that each particular transaction is authorized

thanks
sent for execution on april 0
aneela called jp to hurry them along for final docs
you may need to call them as we've not received account information
tracy
please read yair's message and let me know asap
it appears from his email that this is the only remaining issue
i'm in today until about 0 pm houston
i've left a message with tracy ngo
in portland
and will let you know as soon as i hear from her
how long will you be in the office today
stephanie
please note below
ellen
i've reviewed westlb's optional early termination language which is similar to the other's which i've reviewed
e.g
goldman
chase
merrill
etc
here's how it works for your 0/0/0
0/0/0 swap
0
march 0
0 is the
break date
or
early termination date
0
either party can give notice of early termination to the other party on the day that is 0 ny business days prior to the break date
by the way
this is also the day on which the parties must mutually agree on 0 leading dealers in the relevant market in case the valuation process in
0
below is later disputed by the other party
0
the party giving notice determines
in good faith
the cash settlement amount as of 0 a.m
ny time on the break date
which should be the mid-market value of the deal on the break date
0
payment will occur on the break date
0
i am adding a provision requiring the exercising party to notify the other party on the day that is 0 ny business days prior to the break date
there may be a dispute over the calculation and the parties will need to resolve
0
if the parties cannot agree on the cash settlement amount calculation
then the party who gave notice seeks mid-market quotes from the 0 leading dealers
previously agreed to
at 0 a.m
on the day that is 0 ny business days before the break date
the confirm describes how the quotes are averaged
a minimum of 0 quotes is essential
payment is still made on the break date
george
0
please verify that the break date is 0/0/0
my copy is a little fuzzy and the date could actually be 0/0/0
0
i've marked the confirm and faxed it to you
please note that
a
the second paragraph purports to incorporate the 0 isda definitions but the master overrides this language because it incorporates the 0 definitions
as amended
modified
superceded or replaced from time to time
i.e
the 0 isda definitions
there is a problem if westlb disagrees because i've left some language in paragraph 0
as is
since it is based upon the 0 isda definitions
b
no need to say that the calculation agent is
as otherwise stated in the agreement
because westlb is stated to be the calculation agent in the agreement
i'll call in a few
tanya
after the last meeting
i promised to ask you about the following
0
nova scotia power inc
this shows up as
credit review
should this remain on the list and if so
is there anything that legal needs to do
0
occidental energy marketing
inc
this is the new
forest oil
of the list so i say let's forget it
no
seriously
carol did revisit the latest draft and said it was pared down about as far as it could go
further
she cannot get anyone at occidental to return phone calls
please let me know what you would like to do
all

joe and i have reviewed the termination agreement for mercado and it looks fine
0
i suggest that the following language be added to the bottom of a revised invoice
revised because the comment section which indicates the nf0.y is an annuity completed on 0/0/0 is inaccurate
mercado gas services
inc
acknowledges that payment for deal no
nf0.y is made in partial consideration of that certain assignment and assumption agreement dated as of april 0
0 by and among mercado gas services
inc
williams energy marketing
trading company and enron north america corp
mercado gas services

joe and i have the following questions
a
if the assignment to williams was effective 0/0/0
why are we looking at figures from 0/0/0 and 0/0/0
respectively
b
in lieu of
a
above
have ena and mercado already agreed to the numbers appearing on the invoice
tracy
how is this
regarding the
transfer
language for allegheny
party b
we have the following proposal
party b may transfer its rights and obligations under this agreement
in whole but not in part
to any affiliate provided that
0
such transfer will not give rise to a termination event or an event of default
and
0
i
the creditworthiness of the affiliate is not materially weaker than that of party b immediately prior to such transfer
unless party b provides a satisfactory guaranty or credit support to the affiliate
or
ii
the proposed affiliate satisfies the criteria that party a applies in deciding whether to offer or make an extension of credit or to enter into transactions similar to the transactions subject to the proposed transfer
tracy has agreed to the language below which would be added as
d
to the
transfer
section
mark
i have changed my vacation to the week of may 0
0 rather than the following week
tom
i am not certain that the existing resolution permits repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions and securities lending
bonds borrow pledge
etc
as the brokerage consent was not written to accommodate these types of transactions
however
if the repo party will accept our existing format
then we need not worry
i'll call ted leh and try to find the proper goldman person
sorry
but the invitation asked for reply by april 0
i have emailed the feinbergs of my acceptance
yes
i will attend
one person
thank you
i will as soon as i determine vacation plans
sure
i think we should ask paul r
if anyone else from credit is necessary
london
perhaps
and from legal
you
brent and me
also
we need to refine the offsite now that we have a date set
i will be on vacation during the week of may 0
0
were you able to put a list together
yes
it's being handled
thanks

i think i negotiated either a confirm or schedule with a trust
i'll try to find
of course
there are lots of structured deals with trusts

i don't have strong feelings about the offsite
but i'd vote for the a.m
rather than change the legal credit seminar to accommodate the offsite
ldngc series 0 a trust
tom
i forwarded a copy of the eci unanimous consent to goldman to see if they will accept
as is
i have not heard back
goldman legal will email repo docs

don't know who
from london ecl contacted goldman inquiring about repos
i'm happy to facilitate with contacts
etc
so please let me know
carol
i can't recall if we discussed but this was one cp discussed at out last legal/credit meeting
we should update at next meeting

if the consent which i sent yesterday is not satisfactory
please advise as soon as possible so that i can obtain a repo specific consent
also
could you please submit repo documents to me for review
i do not know who may have contacted you from the london group
enron credit ltd
but we can surely coordinate
that entity should have its own form of unanimous consent or resolution
thanks for your help
the prior trading dispute resulted from a plastics deal and doug friedman was the trader
i would check with doug
jim and rex
the lehman bros
form of

dick
i am suggesting a minor change to the
power risk management committee
certificate
to eliminate the reference to the exhibit

if we leave the reference in the certificate
you will always have to label the confirm as exhibit

and resend the completed papers to us
please let me know if you are alright with this change

bob crane did a deal with the canadian party identified below
sounds like he originally told our fx trader that the parties would be egm
actually ena
and enron industrial markets
eim
in the end
eim was not the correct party but the canadian party was the correct party
is this trade between ena and compagnie de papiers stadacona authorized by credit
is the company eligible

were you going to send me a worksheet or email
given that this is a long term deal
do you want to set a deadline for negotiating an isda
and make it an event of default
carol
regarding a
hedge fund meeting
next week
i have spoken with most of the likely participants and everyone is eager to meet next week
i'll fill you in on details in person
i think the following people should attend
fred lagrasta caroline abramo robyn zivic russell dyk you brent me i believe that we have a mushrooming
process
issue
i also believe that the credit group is part of the problem
we should have a separate discussion with paul to discuss potential hedge fund credit issues
maybe there are none and maybe our legal choices are unimportant to credit
my observations are that all hedge funds need not be
last minute
deals
caroline can be our ally and needs to learn our documents and credit needs to advise legal sooner
i have asked caroline to prepare a list of all funds she is currently working with
has already discussed with paul or is considering
afternoon is best
shall i schedule or have you already begun
gail
is the attached master repurchase agreement used by both gs&co as well as gsi

any word on the consent
thanks
matthew
in conjunction with our negotiation of an isda
i thought i'd mention that we may also need a repo agreement for non-u.s
bonds
i don't know which morgan entity would be the appropriate party
would you please advise and forward documentation
thanks
thanks
any word on the consent
gs&co and gsi have different repo agreements and these are generated from different offices
i have been placed in touch with the london lawyer who handles gsi
tom
i have asked again about the form of eci consent

our fx/currency traders in london need an isda with msci
rod prepared a credit work sheet on 0/0/0
the negotiations never went anywhere
msci has now sent their form of agreement

hi
kristina
it was great speaking with you last night
hope your dad is home and doing well
i have contacted two different offices within enron
the first is human resources in houston
i suggested to them that you might be a good candidate for the associate/analyst program but they may think of other positions as well
i don't know how quickly that office might respond so let me know
the second
office
is directly to london
there is a woman in london named anna jansson who is currently leading efforts for the associate/analyst program in the eastern hemisphere
i have spoken with anna and she has asked that you visit the website
www.enroncareers.com
and apply through the site
she already knows your name and i am trying to fax your resume
business resume
to her as well
when you visit the site
you may decide to use a different resume
just let me know
just in case you would like to call directly
anna's number in london
dialed from the u.s
is 0-0-0-0-0
the company directory shows her email address as
anna_jansson@enron.net
which looks a little weird to me
please keep in touch and let me know if you receive responses
or don't hear back
so that i can follow up internally
by the way
you have an impressive resume
please feel free to call me at anytime
i hope we get to meet soon

looks like these were termination events in aig
c
is this deal two-way margining

i'm know we've done others possibly in draft format let me know if you have questions
kim
when you have a minute

chris
we should chat
per the isda
ena is the calc agent and we have already agreed to usual market disruption events and fallbacks in the isda
if you want to change the isda agreement
then we can consider the items which merchant has included in the draft
as calc agent
we should create a draft and send the form to you for review
however
i do need you to explain/verify floating price b
and verify rounding convention which differs from our standard
please call to discuss
stephanie

carson

thanks for your help
i also left a message for jeff because i was told that he worked on the transaction
the name
compagnie de papiers stadacona
stadacona
does not appear on the corporate database so i cannot verify that it is an enron-owned entity
the only question is
can we book the fx trade in the names of stadacona and
susan
laurel adams has an fx deal where rmt must be a party
the counterparty is a 0% owned enron sub named
compagnie de papiers stadacona
when i last checked
nothing shows up in the corporate database
however
i have verified the name
ownership
etc
with jeff blumenthal
i will separately email you the counterparty info that i have
we need a deemed isda for the parties
we should later do the isda when the information is available on the database
which could be any day
i suppose
i would just use our standard rmt format
please assign

i will let you know who my backup will be
sorry
caroline
mark
can you
publish
a list of swap attorneys and their primary/secondary areas of responsibility
for at least the lawyers to use
i'd like to direct random requests to the appropriate people
for example
is brent the only
weather attorney
brent
it's a weather question
looks like carol asked susan or stephanie to let celeste know if weather trades were possible
she thought it was
if weather is a commodity
i guess it works but you'd probably need to inocorporate isda terminology and your definitions
etc
check the blue file
you'll see carol's email
celeste
i've asked brent to give you a call
thanks
yair
please let us know if we can conference as set forth in my earlier message
thanks
melissa
i started with sempra
it's one of the more unusual masters
a
master master
covering both physical and financial
and it's not the typical
ect master
further
it contains no rounding or correction to published prices provisions
we'll have to review these masters on a case by case basis
edmund
would you believe that we do not have a repo template
the repo requests are more infrequent than not
all are negotiated
hope this helps

if an etol sell-off

here's a request from the outside
have we heard from cassandra
mark
attached is my current workload report
i'm beginning to get nervous about meeting traders
expectations as i am taking vacation from june 0
0
seven business days
and i don't know who will be able to pick up my emergencies and routine issues
i have some idea about mary's and frank's workload and i have the impression that brent is constantly busy with weather
i'd like to briefly discuss cheryl's workload i think it would be a good idea to have everyone submit a status report of sorts to you so that you can assess how much is
project
oriented vs
routine
specific commodity areas
and volume
fyi
i am trying to limit cheryl's activity with gary's group to brokerage agreements only
the huge volume of activity on the brokerage end was apparently the result of a recent audit by aa and effort to
cleanup
the agreement status
it should be winding down
i have encouraged cheryl
as have frank and mary
to provide you with a workload report since we really want her to be trained in the swap basics
also
i will try to schedule a conference call with david mitchell
you and me before i leave
topic is online trading of credit derivatives
currently
only ecl is offering the bankruptcy default swap online
and no one is hitting the product
i'll draft the annex without offering up the ene guaranty
although you may have to speak with them since ena offered up a guaranty for its repo
please let me know how you want to handle defaults
can we resolve tomorrow
wenesday
am i being too pushy
thanks
david
attached are the string of emails relating to the issue
i look forward to hearing from you

tanya may agree to allow this trade to margin under the agreement just like the confirm which terminated 0/0/0

ena is requiring two opinions
one from glendale
inhouse
and another which we are paying for
glendale's outside counsel
call me
please do not forward my messages to glendale because we are now at cross purposes
there is no need to alarm glendale about our existing arrangements
sara

before any brokerage account can be opened
you need to advise the rac group
please send an email to the three persons
cc
above explaining what accounts enron north america corp
ena
requires and the purpose of those accounts
if you have not already done so
ena has a brokerage agreement with bear stearns compamies
inc
but not with bear stearns international limited
ena already has resolutions for opening brokerage accounts
mark
you never assigned this one
attached is the eol list
chase merged with jp morgan and we need to upgrade/select existing master
please forward your email requests to the rac group for opening this account
thanks
sara
tanya
eol is asking for the chase master to be amended to eliminate the need for confirms on eol trades

i.e
chase or jp morgan
should be amended

do we want to begin the upgrade process
please call
also
are you available for the 0:0 hanover call
tom

how would you like to handle execution of this transaction
of remaining transactions
scheduling the ve discussion for later this week is also acceptable
we look forward to hearing from you
regards
can you please submit a new credit worksheet
thanks
maggie
i do have comments to this confirm
i have never seen your isda master agreement
master
so you need to have your lawyer review some portions of it to eliminate the possibility of conflict
0
is suntrust the calc agent under your master
should they be agent for this deal
0
need to upgrade definitions to 0 definitions
the 0 and 0 definitions have been superseded
0
are you in agreement with the optional early termination language and all calculations being performed by suntrust in the manner set out
there is no valuation or payment time/date for this termination or details for giving notice of intent to exercise the termination option
this language is extremely vague but perhaps you do not mind
0
do you have existing transactions with suntrust on your books in addition to this one
0
are there any additional termination events under the master
you don't want to necessarily eliminate such events from occurring
also
it is not clear to me if this transaction or any other derivative transaction with suntrust is
related to the loan agreement
for purposes of giving suntrust the right to terminate
is it
0
defining an
event
as either an
event of default
or a
termination event
has different settlement consequences
it looks like you're not concerned as to how suntrust values terminated transactions if this deal is
related
to the loan agreement
i think part 0
d
would be clearer if stated as
additional termination event will apply
the following shall constitute an additional termination event with respect to the counterparty
cite events
i
and
ii
if accurate
for the purpose of the foregoing termination event
the affected party shall be the counterparty
this means suntrust will calculate as if you were in default
or do you want to calculate at mid
0
you should delete par
0
a
i don't believe you have agreed to do this in the past
but perhaps you do not mind
your lawyer should review the impact of stating
this provision shall constitute an additional agreement for the purpose of section 0 of the swap agreement
0
are the economics of the deal stated correctly
0
what transaction
s
are being superseded
has anything from the initial deal been left out that should be retained
per my voice mail
david

jeff and i have eliminated the
agency
issue
jeff proposed that ena transact directly with cincinnati gas
electric company

i just wanted to alert you to these so that we don't
surprise
your customer
give me a call if you have a chance

0
ena cannot agree to arbitrate before the national futures association and you are no longer required to use that forum for arbitration
the situs is fine

please verify all economics including notional
pricing
transaction fees
share caps
no
options
trade and expiration dates
etc
gil
i left you a voice mail earlier
i'm concerned about the definition of
specified transaction
as drafted
i read this as cross defaulting to all other derivative trades between ena and bsil
as well as ene and bsil
i don't know if we have any on the books or will enter into any prior to termination of your trades
but the same will be impacted unless you limit the section 0 definition to your trades only
russ
the forwards and puts should be signed and faxed back to lehman
please note the template for these trades
with respect to the definition of
material
left out the word

tracy
let me know what you think
i'll check with a lawyer from the physical power group
also
we should at a minimum
preserve setoff with respect to ena's affiliates
sara
attached is my updated list
mark
the isda best practices statement did not address opis
or argus
as our proposal did
but for those indexes being at issue
i have a record of the following parties having requested use of the isda methodology

hess energy trading company koch petroleum group lp

i wanted to give you the benefit of some of my thoughts before i considered your annex a which i would like to compare to the ena current version
we are currently considering more revisions so your annex a will help me to think a bit
i have attached a redline of the actual confirm
without annex a
a couple of thoughts
0
for purposes of creating a
template
i gave a choice for termination date
0
i collapsed payment date/invoice because i'm concerned that ejc may forget to send a timely invoice so we need to ensure that there is no issue about whether or not a payment is owed
0
we need to
fix
the floating price language
i don't know where the reference to
north sea
west africa
mediterranean
comes from
i didn't see it in marketwire and london doesn't use it
also
the conversion language is vague
i.e
ttm
ttb and tts are not defined but i suspect they refer to bid/mid/sell
are they references on the bank of tokyo-mitsubishi
ltd
screen
also
it may be better to create a conversion reference to your central bank and not a particular banking institution
you could get caught later dealing with that bank
using the conversion language and then giving the bank an unfair advantage
0
i didn't see your schedule 0 guarantee but i assume that it is the normal ene format
regarding annex a
i quickly noticed an issue with the
tibor
definition
which uses quite a bit of isda language
which can be easily fixed with an appropriate isda reference
give me another day or so to comment
let me know if you'd like to talk
my home number is 0-0-0 if you'd like to call

thanks for the quick response
your
business day
suggestion is fine
with respect to your second comment
ena agrees to aaa arbitration in all phases of its physical and financial business
we are not a clearing member of any exchange so we do not seek arbitration before a regulatory board
hope this helps

i've just reviewed this credit worksheet for a first draft isda

attached is a
recap
of outstanding issues with the utility
i have not had any conversations with anyone at coned
fyi
i did receive a call this afternoon from sylvia dooley asking that i call her about one of the unregulated affiliates
i left a voice mail
let me know how you want to proceed
ed asked that we prepare a blackline and not change items to which the parties have not agreed
thanks
sara
i had a long conversation with sylvia dooley this afternoon
she contacted me about finalizing the con ed isda master agreement and the
related
consolidated edison energy
same lawyer
different commercial
master
sylvia is preparing a new version
we have a lot of open issues
most appearing on the open issue list that i just circulated to you both
however
sylvia and i identified some significant credit issues which we should address now
ed
in addition to finalizing the credit matrix
the big ticket issues include the following items and
according to sylvia
you should probably call triche douglas right away to resolve as she is being moved to another project and may not be available for isda negotiations much longer
0
credit event upon merger
con ed coming back with newer definition of
materially weaker
con ed rejects ena's proposal
0
con ed is still rejecting our setoff language
i will send our newer language but the substance is the same as before
0
will not agree to our transfer language
i.e
always want to consent for purposes of transfer and no carve out for guaranteed affiliates
0
want an extra day for delivering l/c's
0
issue about notification time for requesting collateral
con ed wants 0 pm ny time
we countered with 0 am ny time
0
are insisting that parties obtain consent for substitution of collateral
0
major issue with respect to holding/using collateral
con ed will propose that with respect to ena
only enron corp
can hold collateral and enron corp.'s eligibility to hold collateral will be tied to credit rating of bbb
0
major issue defining mac
no one has come up with a mac given my conversation of this afternoon
please let me know how you would like to proceed

sara
kim
a very general question
shouldn't all of the financial power templates provide for corrections to published prices and rounding to four places for commodities quoted in mmbtus
your template does not contain either of these
kim
i need to verify that the eol amendment changes conform to the general financial power template changes
0
the eol amendment provides that the rounding convention for calculating power floating prices relating to mmbtus is rounding to four places
the current financial power template provides for rounding to three decimal places
which is the correct convention
0
with respect to corrections to published prices
changes will be required to both the isda and gtc formats since the latest eol amendment does not conform to standard isda terminology
there is no corresponding gtc terminology
please let me know about
0
above
thanks
sara
kim
i didn't save the email verison of the
corrections to published prices
so i'll state the changes below and you can revise
0
you will need two different versions
one for gtc's and the other for isda confirmations
0
don't capitalize the word
party
in either version
0
use the capitalized term
interest rate
for the gtc version
0
use the capitalized term
applicable rate
for the isda version when i hear back from kim t
we can finalize the rounding convention for online and offline confirmations
thanks

i need someone to please look into the following trades with various enron entities
other than ena
identified by beth ng of morgan and whether these were booked incorrectly or should properly be booked in the names of the following affiliates
enron liquids enron reserve acquisition corp

there have been trades for physical settlement
such as
an
oil forward
and a
gas tbp forward
maybe jeff knows the answer to this one
thanks
larry anderson with carr has called to inquire about ena financials and an enron corp
guaranty
from an historical perspective
it has always been my understanding that enron corp
did not wish to provide guaranties to brokers and we have been successful in that regard with several recent exceptions
in particular
enron corp
provided carr with a
comfort letter
reciting the corporate
policy of general financial responsibility and interest in seeing that subsidiaries act responsibly
letter dated february 0
0
such letter is no longer sufficient to satisfy credit agricole which owns carr
joe
i believe that larry may have already spoken with you
i don't know if your conversation included discussion of a guaranty
please let me know how you would like to proceed

however
in seeing the ena form of master netting agreement which they may also agree to sign

the eeft version is their primary goal

legal would like to speak with one of you about the
chase
and
morgan
issues surrounding the master netting agreement requests
there seems to be some confusion
i think the chase request came from credit and the morgan request came directly from morgan
the items below summarize what i know about the two different counterparties
0
at the request of chase and with jay's approval
ena terminated the morgan guaranty trust company of new york master energy price swap agreement
all outstanding trades have been transferred to the april 0
0 interest rate and currency exchange agreement between the chase manhattan bank and ena
the chase master
when the merger is complete
anticipated around november 0
0
the survivor jp morgan chase bank will be ena's counterparty under the chase master
see letter agreement dated october 0
0
0
the chase master has been amended several times
most recently to provide for fx forward trades and resolve multibranch issues
0
chase recently agreed that ena propose a new isda schedule/csa
legal has requested a credit worksheet
0
among other things
it appears that the chase master currently provides for first method
this has never been amended
0
the chase master is used for fx/rate and commodity trades
on a different note
0
morgan stanley capital group
inc
has signed
mini-netting
agreements with ectric
morgan now wants to sign similar
mini-netting
agreements with erac and egli
i believe that john viverito is working on these agreements
morgan is currently satisfied with its status with ena but would like to see our master netting agreement and may decide to execute
three outstanding elfi financial trades will be reconfirmed under ena and i am waiting for morgan to forward that documentation
0
both ena and enron corp
have been in the process of negotiating isda agreements with morgan stanley capital services
inc
nothing has been executed
ectric has an executed isda with that entity
0
the names
morgan stanley
co
inc
and
morgan stanley
co
international limited
also appear in our database but you can check that out if necessary
question
the master netting agreement assignment list contains the name
j.p.morgan
legal is waiting for direction from credit for preparation of the jp morgan chase master netting agreement
question
does credit also want to send a master netting agreement to morgan
or should legal merely send morgan a blank template to see if morgan has any interest in executing such an agreement
sorry for the length of this message but the word
morgan
raises all kinds of questions
i hope this explanation helps to identify some of the issues for anyone involved
fyi

just spoke with harvard's lawyer kim noble who appreciated speaking with bill earlier this week
ene has triggered an additional termination event under the isda
commercial paper rating at a-0 and ene placed on
watch
status
but harvard does not want to terminate
harvard will propose an amendment to the effect that our threshold will drop to 0 as long as a short term rating is at a-0
susan
can you please have a copy of the harvard isda sent to tanya
thanks
gil
will you be handling the documentation
does jsb asset
llc have an authorized trader list
a resolution to open the account
fyi
i don't have any idea if this will be routed in accordance with the
process
for ena brokerage agreements do you care
this is the second such brokerage agreement coming from gil
sara
ena received a letter 0/0/0 stating that man would begin margining on a risk-weighted basis rather than using the nymex span calculation
this is prohibited under our futures agreement
man has not formally called for additional margin
which they have the right to do
but rather is withholding about $0m based upon a misunderstanding between traders about moving option positions
i'm not entirely clear about the circumstances
man has never claimed that the $0m was
additional margin
ena faxed a letter this morning to man demanding the return of margin in excess of the span calculation
basically a response to the letter
ena acounting does not have the software to execute span calculations
a recommendation to purchase the software was made by sarah wesner
who then reported to joe deffner
to accounting last year
i understand that john arnold intends to move most positions
including options
from man to paribas
however
this information changes frequently
joe deffner signed the letter and a copy was delivered to louise kitchen
let me know if you need further information
jim
i thought enron corp
would prefer to have an enron corp
lawyer review the form of note
i will ask russ to ensure that you receive the draft sara
tracy
just spoke with michelle sternberg
allegheny does not want to carve out setoff benefit for ena because it cannot take advantage of the setoff benefit
i told her that we still wanted the provision for ena and could continue business under the old merrill
deemed arrangement
which has whatever setoff provision we negotiated
she'll speak with yair
russ
please add jim armogida to the distribution for the note
jim.armogida@enron.com
thanks

we need to remember to terminate the status of this agreement in lotus notes

restated

i hope that you will find my few changes to the most recent version of the itg redistribution agreement acceptable

resending
jorge
please read paragraph 0 of the termination confirmation
it refers to the terminated transaction having
reference number 0
the confirmation that you sent to me
for the terminated transaction
has a reference number 0
the termination confirmation is referenced as 0
you need to correct paragraph 0 of the termination confirmation
then the document can be executed

are you alright with aig disclosing transaction terms to a third party as a possible assignee of those trades
if so
david and i can have the confidentiality provisions of the gtc's waived for this purpose and we can proceed
thanks
sara
tanya
to the best of my knowledge
please see the attached review of equity forward and swap deals which i have tracked for enron corp
you should contact clint freeland

sara
jay
i know stephanie requested a copy of the executed version of the
amendment to guaranty
i need to review that amendment before approving the second amendment
also
did you have a prior agreement as to the effective date of this amendment
thanks
marie
can't find the bear/eci file
did ene offer up a guaranty for the eci account
tom
i just received a phone call from bear stearns inquiring about an enron corp
guaranty for the ect europe finance
inc
brokerage account
have you received approval from credit
if so
what is the amount of the guaranty
are we keeping the enron credit inc
brokerage account or are we transferring all positions to the ect europe finance
inc
account
if so
are we terminating the outstanding guaranty of the enron credit inc
account which was amended to provide for a $0,0,0 cap
please advise me and credit of the status
thanks
sara
fyi
how about changing the last sentence of par
0.0
b
to read as follows
the parties shall designate enron north america corp
as the calculation agent for the purpose of determining breakage costs
such determination being final and binding on ectri
gsci and the parties
and enron north america corp
shall take into consideration the two quotations and the estimate and any other information that it in good faith deems relevant
the above language would preserve each swap party obtaining a quote from an
authorized bank
note
you need to amend the definition of to provide that ena must have the isda with the bank and not ectri
and properly authorize ena to serve as calc agent
which you are
there won't be other changes to the existing sale and purchase agreement
let me know what you think
sara
tanya
we have provided ene guaranties in limited instances on brokerage accounts and futures accounts
with margin lines
e.g
most recently fimat usa
inc
the bear stearns companies is an example of the use of corporate guaranties for the credit business
originally
bear required a guaranty for an ena account
holding credit positions
but that guaranty was terminated when the positions were transferred to an enron credit inc
account at bear with a new ene guaranty
there may be a few others but we'd have to conduct a file review
ect europe finance
inc
is owned 0% by ena
kate cole is revising the corporate workbook to accurately reflect this ownership
tom
please respond to tanya's question regarding the purpose of ect europe finance
inc
sara
ellen
feel free to send the language
i'm not sure peter knows what parts of the agreement need to be modified

thanks
sara
kim
we are still negotiating the isda with reliant and are booking deals under an old erms form of master agreement
which will eventually be superceded
yes
and the template should not be an isda template
yes
all
i am trying to resolve a recurring issue in the financial power group
in the past
we have withheld payment for all swaps with the same counterparty terminating during a calendar month until the fifth business day after the floating price is determinable at the end of a month
as a practical matter
calculation of the payment of an aggregate of daily transactions would conceivably wait until the last business day of the month when a floating price was needed for one or more of the swaps
how do you feel about payment for multiple trades with a party having varying termination dates throughout a given month
is this a cash flow issue
do i need to involve someone from treasury or settlements
please let me know
thanks
tom
you sent me documents for thos
weisel to clear through bear
i guess you are no longer interested in bear
am i correct
evelyn aucoin

power settlements
i left her a message to provide a more detailed explanation

sara
tanya
just let us know the parties and guaranty cap
i am not familiary with any carr arrangements other than the ena futures agreement
also
do you have a contact at carr
thanks
sara
stephanie
scroll all the way down to sheila's original message for contact person and the two enron companies being guaranteed
you will need to verify with london that ectric has a futures agreement with carr
maybe you can get a copy of it for our records
can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask tanya for a cap
thanks
sara
nora
per our conversation
please let me know what you can about existing board resolution or bylaws
we are trying to change the signature card for the enron corp
morgan stanley account to eliminate fastow and glisan and replace with others
the request originally went to sheila glover from tim despain
thanks
sara
spoke with david mitchell
he would like
if at all possible
a
short list
of major issues with respect to the master netting agreement to better prepare for the meeting
an email of topics/questions will be sufficient

attached is a draft confirm for a natural gas efs under the new nymex rules
please review the redlined language
the new nymex amendment permitting efs transactions was originally part of a pilot program for brent crude contracts
nymex rule 0.0
effective september 0
0
nymex notice no
0-0 effective november 0
0discusses the application of the efs for natural gas futures contracts but i cannot find a specific reference to a nymex rule
i assume it is nymex rule 0.0
thus
i didn't know whether it was necessary to cite a particular rule
i also didn't know if i need to reference the number of nymex contracts in my
special provisions
section
further
if rule 0.0 is applicable to the natural gas futures contracts
then i suppose that the confirm should
recite the information required of the clearing member by the exchange
on the other hand
maybe the clearing member's report should contain information such as appearing in rule 0.0a
c
if applicable
and it need not be repeated in the confirmation
can you give this a quick review
trading in the nat gas contract terminates in a day or so
thanks
hey
carson
it's too early for me to tell if this week will work

thanks
carol
as the log is continually updated
we should be clear as to which entities we are reviewing for purposes of informing the book ad mins
to date
we have only focused on
ene ena upstream company llc we have consciously excluded ees and the london entities or us entities trading through eeft in london
such as ectric
since enron global markets
and presumably eim next
is under a mandate for liquidation
don't we need to liase with alan
for his us products
and london
for products such as weather
which are egm products
since ena includes fx/rate
we have included that global product in our original review
this is needed to understand the process of liquidation of the fx/rate book
as netted against other ena outstanding positions
or is our focus still only gas and power
i just don't want to miss anything or slow down the process
edmund
i have not received anything from anyone in london or anywhere else regarding positions
etc
i did speak with a weil bankruptcy lawyer and there were many issues especially with respect to ena positions
and i don't know where the high value credit positions are booked
they believe that we may have structuring issues working through london and not directly with a purchaser
can you send the information over here
kim theriot can probably locate these confirms
edmund

i thought you said that there were specific transactions in the u.s
entities
i need a list of trades booked in the names of enron credit inc
and enron north america corp

i need someone to walk me through the numbers appearing on the charts which you sent me

i don't understand what happened with the anker coal position

approx
$0,0,0
for a net balance of approx
$0,0,0
ect investments inc
sent a demand letter to you via facsimile on november 0

please feel free to contact me
thanks for your assistance

sara
of these positions
where the counterparty has not terminated
and there is only fx/rate activity
i find only
goldman sachs

laurel and clara are reviewing this one
it may be repo activity

after the the termination value brackets
put a period and add
a valuation sheet is attahced

sara
left a message earlier for alex and have not heard back
sara
i have verified that eci
although a non-debtor entity
must have all proposed dispositions of assets or liquidation of positions approved by ernst
young
e&y
brent hendry's memo of december 0
0 contains the phone/fax numbers for cindy ma who is our contact person
cindy's email address is
cindy.ma@ey.com and her cell phone number is 0-0-0
cindy ma is currently in transit back to new york
although she doesn't know who i am
i will leave her an email and voice mail detailing who you are and the urgency of your situation
you should do the same by email
voice mail and fax
i suggest a deadline for e&y to respond to you since i was told in a voice mail from tony buggs that any delay whatsoever will frustrate your process for a sale on friday
december 0
i am not at all familiar with the details of your proposed transaction but i would alert e&y to the reasons why you need their
approval
for which there is no written procedure
immediately or else your
value
evaporates
there is nothing that i can do if e&y is slow to respond
in that situation
i suppose i would keep calling the e&y new york office to request immediate attention to your situation
by the way
i was unable to return tony's message since i received it about 0 minutes ago and it's very late in the u.k
just copy me in case i receive a call
did you guys ever touch base with cindy ma
i can't answer ernst
young questions without knowing what transpired last night
thanks
happy holidays
can we meet in the morning for a status update
sara
i'll check out the big b.r
forecast before i come in
lisa
ena has received a second written request from a financial counterparty
union spring fund ltd
for the return of $0,0 cash collateral plus interest
the cash was posted as initial margin on trade date of the swaps
we have confirmed that all trades were terminated as of mid-december
0
the counterparty has not sent a
termination letter
as there was nothing to terminate
but has sent a letter requesting return of the collateral
although we may not want to return the cash
aren't we obligated to do so
donna
a termination notice of the foregoing agreement was sent to your attention
do you know what this agreement is
could it be related to enron credit limited
which had a position in anker paper
bob and tanya
ena received a termination notice dated december 0
0 from tribune of the 0/0/0 isda master agreement and all outstanding transactions
the early termination date is december 0
0
the tribune claims it owes no payment but is seeking return of $0,0,0 in
damages
we need to identify all trades and identify the settlement amount for our response to them
are we holding any margin
please call to discuss
yes
earlier this year
posted in the form of
up front collateral
how many outstanding trades will we be terminating with this party
is there only a collar
bryan

both are in the office today
can you please prepare a short memo summarizing deal and request for signatures for me to present to them
i am not familiar with either the insurance contract or the credit derivatives
thanks
no
i never heard back
i don't know who sue kelly is so you may want to handle that end
the london lawyers don't need anything further
thanks

looking forward to meeting you
sounds ok to me

give me some advance warning so i'll have it marked
today doesn't work for everyone
how about my office in the morning
please advise the names of any such counterparties
the status and whether you have a file with info
thanks
sara
the following parties have either tired of speaking with us or would still like to agree to settlement
san diego gas
electric
not terminated
rbc francisco was handling sdg&e
i have been working on the latter two
which were both subject to termination notices
dan
we would love to
ss
these are financial
out of the money
swaps between ena and various spv's have been sent to me with the request for
termination
from jesus melendrez who is managing the ecr portfolio
should this be reviewed by the
intercompany contract
group
sara
sam
please see me in the a.m
we are going to use this party as a test case for valuation and will need to organize a binder now
thanks
did we ever receive the executed isda from marta
just spoke with cindy ma who tells me that wilbur foster will be in houston next thurs/fri
she again says that millbank is asking about our strategy for handling in the money gas swaps
i know you guys are managing the ey relationship and i just wanted to let you know how she's bouncing
will you please call ty
whatever her name is
the reason being that their termination notice relates to the isda
i believe
which we do not have
thanks
nancy
i have forwarded this to cynthia as part of the
intercompany contracts
review process
sara
i asked him if he knew of any hedge funds in tx or ca
per our meeting
call me
enron mw llc will be treated like any third party
since we do not have our trading order
there are no unwinds or terminations and we do not have special preference for dealing with affiliates
if this is in the money to ena
we may be able to expedite the process but we are still dealing with a debtor
i'm not sure that the relationship to ena bears different treatment
here's an electronic verison of tanya's 0/0/0 credit ag report
ellen
did ena close all positions
how much margin was posted and has it been returned to an ena account
tom
time is running out for the month of january and we need your list and copies of lc's expiring at the end of the month as well as positions to determine possible draws
are you handling this
i didn't call the meeting
a few questions
0
where does the nymex amount come from
i understand that ena has no open futures positions
is it margin
also
what is that number today
0
why are there entries for both
jpmorgan chase bank
and
the chase manhattan bank
what is the difference
for example
we have a termination notice from chase but not jpmorgan chase
thanks
hey
deb

no
your sister
sas

i misplaced the info i gave you about the deferral plan contacts
can you make a copy for me
thx
and
p.s
thanks for the israel info
are you considering not going
cheryl
gordon heaney tells me that you have received information about non-terminated
defaulting p&p counterparties
on the financial side
we are developing a strategy for handling these types of entities and i want to ensure that ena responds/acts consistently
many of the p&p parties misinterpret the isda documents and i observe that many are in the money to ena
have not terminated and may be in default for failures to pay or post collateral
can you let me know if you actively pursued these parties for bob crane
thanks
sara
i'm sure this is not new to you but cindy ma just called
i guess raj was trying to schedule a meeting today for lawyers
in/out
to meet for several hours with these guys who are only here today

he has an office on our floor and is available through our email system
mark has asked michelle duncan with cadwalader's u.k
office to contact you to explore the possibility of assisting you with ectric and other trading/bankruptcy issues
i was thinking that the u.s
process for trade termination/evaluation could be replicated in london and a cadwalader lawyer
with trading experience
could make use of mark's experience with pre
and post-filing
enron

i think we can do that now

however

usair #0 departs charlotte at 0:0 pm and arrives in houston at 0:0 pm i am certainly open to other options
please advise if there is anything further that i can do

we have an approximate $0 million itm position with goldman sachs capital markets

this is the most urgent matter
with respect to the remaining five bank counterparties
i have collected rate/currency confirms
i need nat gas and liquids confirms
mtm values
etc.to proceed
can you please identify goldman confirm numbers and mtm values now

the attached letter can be used for terminated or non-terminated parties

financial trading is just now gearing up to send these follow-up letters
the few that have been sent have been incorporated into the counterparty files and logged onto the
master letter log
which is updated by stephanie panus
sara
thanks for the info
there are some items that need to be corrected
let's discuss when you have a minute
sara
mark
i don't know what your schedule is this week but i want to discuss ena's response to counterparties who do not respond to our request for settlement calculations and methodology
e.g
goldman sachs capital markets
l.p
j.aron
etc
i understand that you may not be the lawyer to handle a response
this is a
protocol
issue
also
on the financial trading side
i have another
protocol
issue with respect to nonpayment by non-terminated counterparties
under the isda
gtc's or master energy price swap agreement
specifically
let's discuss ena's approach and use of a possible
test case
in this area
thanks
i am not familiar with enron re but on the offset side i'd be concerned about
0
different creditors for ena and enron re and
0
ena's offset position
with respect to the creditor's committee
i am not certain that we have clarified the estate's setoff position
also
are the receivable and trades related

the top ten itm non-terminated ena mtm positions in financial gas
louis dicarlo is assisting the effort in active financial gas
commercially
due to the large number of open gas and power positions
the immediate focus is open gas
financial
power
physical
positions
due to the huge volume of information to be retrieved for each counterparty on a global basis
it is difficult if not impossible for bob hall/beth apollo to complete the data collection if the counterparty is not in this immediate focus group
i don't have the latest electronic version of the counterparty status produced by beth
by copy of this email
i will ask bob sevitz to determine if the top ten ena itm financial gas files have been completed
probably very close to completion
the mtm numbers will then be validated by pwc
the top 0-0 non-terminated ena itm financial gas parties have had their contracts reviewed and we are awaiting bob/beth to collect and validate data
advise if you need an exact count
we are in the process of notifying the parties in this group of possible payment defaults
hope this helps
please let me know if you need further assistance
bob
please advise of status of top ten financial gas ena itm files
sara
that's always been an issue
i don't think that angelo handles all commodities
ena also books financial weather
paper/pulp
rate/currency
crude

etc
credit ag can pick up all products so beth apollo should be able to verify
sara
i need to check this file

just a reminder that ena received a letter from tri-state last month and you are going to verify that deal nos
yb 0.0 and 0.0 are the only active financial deals with ena
if you can confirm
then we can indicate on the master log that tri-state has actually terminated all outstanding trades effective as of 0/0/0
i just received two letters from ir dated 0/0/0 and 0/0/0 which were probably in a black hole somewhere or on elliot bonner's desk
ir is terminating commodity swap y0 and demanding payment from ena
kevin
can you please confirm that y0 is the only active financial swap between the two parties
if it is not
then we cannot reflect that ir has terminated its swap

i heard about your new job and
what can i say except
congratulations
i'm really excited for you
i'm also glad you stuck it out at entertainment weekly because that job will look good on your resume
especially because you had the gumption to remain for a full year
believe it or not
your dad is very
with it
and knows what goes on in the real world
i think that he would probably appreciate a candid discussion with you
the reality is that he cannot control what you decide to do with your life
he wants you to be happy and he wants to protect you from all of the bad things that can happen in life
if he had that power
since you have decided to tell your dad about your decision
i think you should talk to him like you always do and listen to him the same way he will listen to you
you guys have a terrific relationship and you should keep it that way forever
you know fathers and daughters are really special
he may or may not be happy with what he hears but he would rather hear it from you than from someone else
i'm looking forward to seeing you

i agreed to not act today and advise him of our decision

you should show

i don't know when the acquisition took place but we would normally hear from global contracts about name changes
acquisitions
etc
what exactly do you need
i believe the new entity is

you should follow up with susan bailey or blake estes

did stephanie give this one to you for review
we need to clear it up on the master log
ena executed an
assignment and novation of transactions
effective 0/0/0 as to certain derivative transactions appearing on the attached exhibit a reflecting that the hesc position would be assumed by energy marketing
a division of amerada hess corporation
ena was never provided with an executed version of this instrument by the two hess parties
the assignment does not state that the transactions will be subject to the ena isda with amerada hess corporation
amerada hess corporation terminated its isda with ena on 0/0/0
i
we need a copy of the fully executed assignment document
please forward to samantha
ii
you need to verify that all outstanding transactions appear on the attached exhibit a to that assignment
0
samantha
when we receive the fully executed assignment document
we need to insert into the amerada hess corporation file and conduct a contract review
if all outstanding transactions were assigned
we need to note in the hess energy services company
llc file that no further action is required in that file
0
angelo
if all of the above occurs
then we will conclude that the invoices should actually be paid by amerada hess corporation which has terminated
has the account issue been resolved
i'm concerned about the ena examiner and the cash control situation between ena and enron corp
sara
we also need to send the

how are you today
the ball game last night was a disaster
we give the
bad news bears
a bad name
example
runners on 0st and 0nd
i ask the third baseman what he will do if the ball comes to him
he replies touch third base
so the batter hits the ball down the third base line he runs up 0-0 feet from the third base picks up the ball and throws it to the pitcher
i give up
we lost 0 to 0 on a worse note
please don't say anything to anybody but pat just called and said shannon has filled for divorce
i hate to say this but he has created his own worse nightmare
she has never earned a penny of the money she has become accustomed too
yet feels it should belong to her
he has done nothing but foster this attitude
too bad its not legal to spank your spouse
i will let you know what comes of things
why can't everything just work out instead of all this turmoil
i hate all of this shit
it hurts
love jim

i know you are frustrated with the adherence to the var limits or lack there of
so i do not want to frustrate you more
but i would like you to consider the following suggestions
0
it does not seem logical that the var limit between the central
east and texas desk be so far apart
under the current limits the central desk can have a position 0,0 contracts larger than texas and the east desk 0,0 contracts larger
0
when looking at performance ytd i wonder if higher var limits only gives the desks a greater ability to double down to try and make up the ytd losses
var limits desk p/l east $0 million
$0.0
million central $0 million
$0.0
million 0
it also bothers me that everyone else does not hold the var limits in as high regard as tom
i
there are no consequences if the var limit is violated
in fact in days like today you are rewarded for breaking the var limit
i feel that the following should be implemented in order to stress the importance of the var limit
the p/l for any desk exceeding the var limit by more than $0,0 will be decreased each day by the amount they exceeded the var limit
for example if a desks var limit is 0,0,0 and the var is $0,0,0 the p/l for the desk would be decreased by $0,0,0
if the situation is not corrected by the next day the same procedure would be followed
this method i believe makes for an even playing field
under the current procedures what i'm learning is if you ignore the var limits and you are right no one will remember at year end and you are rewarded for breaking the rules
please give me your thoughts when you have a chance
thanks

economics are favorable to keep injecting
i estimate that injections will average around 0tbtu per week through may 0
0 which would result in another 0+ tbtu beibng injected
at the current pricing level this means that aep would owe enron somewhere around $0 million
is this something accounting should be working into the aep settlement to pay enron on june 0
0
should aep be notified of the volume and approximate value
is there anything that needs to be done contractually other than the original agrrement to facilitate this transaction
i just wanted to make sure everyone is aware
please let me know your thoughts
this assumes 0 bcf or approximately 0 tbtu of pad gas
according to this mornings operations reprt there is 0.0 bcf in the cavern
this includes third party storage volumes of approximately 0.0 tbtu

how does the load profile look now and how is the load profile expected to change in the future
0
if there is swing on an hour to hour basis during the day how will this be managed if hpl no longer provides the storage service
before we make recommendations on how to solve their challenges i think we need to fully understand the services they provide to the various texas institutions
sell 0 november nymex contracts @ $0.0 buy 0 november nymex contracts @ $ 0.0
for the first time in 0 years of service for enron i'm ashamed to admit that i work for enron
i have lost all respect for enron senior management and agree with the financial analyst when they say that enron senior management can not be trusted
ethics and morals are either something everyone else needs to have except senior management or somewhere along the way senior management started believing the end justifies the means
the communication the employee's have received over the last few years about values such as respect
integrity
communication and excellence must be propaganda intended to get employee's to believe senior management really supported these values so that no one would really notice that their actions represented something just the opposite
i can not believe that senior management lacks the understanding of human nature to totally ignore the fact that if someone does not trust what you have said in the past you should not try and conceal pertinent information in the future
then to allow an enron spokesperson to speak for enron with the statement
it's just a balance-sheet issue
implies to me that this individual does not know what a balance sheet or income statement is and certainly should not be speaking to the public
if you are going to play the game of lying
cheating and stealing at least be intelligent enough to present a plausible story
to use phrases such as it was a hedge against fluctuating values in some of enron's broadband telecommunications and other technology investments is a complete insult to my intelligence and to the definition of the word
hedge
a hedge by definition implies that the upside and downside exposure has been limited
it frightens me that we are out asking customers to let enron help them
hedge
their risk when i'm not sure enron's senior management understands what a hedge means
i'm also confused as to the personal financial involvement of andy fastow in the investment vehicle that generated this write down
i must be confused in that as a trader enron has asked me to sign documents declaring that i will not have any personal financial involvement in anything involving the natural gas business
this must be an example of as my father used to say
do as i say not as i do
i guess we need to have audits performed of senior managements financial interest to insure their actions are as good as their word
the fact that senior management and the ene board of directors knew these transactions were being used to manipulate earnings and the stock price and took advantage of that knowledge to sell their ene stock options in my opinion is
criminal
it provides me no comfort to know that the biggest perpetrators of this fraud have left enron in recent months
these individuals have stolen billions of dollars from ene stockholders and employees and need to pay the price for such fraudulent activity
they are set for life
having all the money they could ever need
while employees and stockholders have lost their life savings
you have completely failed at the job you were hired to perform
if this type of activity would have occurred farther down the organization no one would hesitate to fire the individuals involved and to institute criminal charges
i for one can not wait until the all employee meeting next week
i do not think anyone wants to hear about third quarter results because how could we trust what is said anyway
instead i feel you owe the ene employee's a thorough explanation of how you failed to perform your responsibilities
what actions are going to be taken and most of all apologize for the job performance to date
laura
please let them know that i do not plan on attending
thanks
i really wish you would not feel that way or make an apology
i do not consider what you expressed friday night was anything other than honesty and true emotion and i would like to feel comfortable expressing those same feelings to you
i trust you and respect your opinion to great extent because of the above
if i can help its yours
smile and take a deep breath
i believe their is a reason for everything
let me know if their is anything you want me to express at the
all employee mtg
swig
sorry about not returning your call this morning
i was trying to finish my questions for the all employee meeting
like it made any difference
they would not address any of my questions
what made it worst is i can not believe how stupid the general enron employee population is
in the midst of the worst company crisis ever
when they have a chance to ask important questions
they ask the stupidest most irrelevant questions in the history of mankind
i have concluded that the employees deserve what they have gotten
i'm not sick just lost my faith in everyone
except you of course
lets talk tonight
jarrod has a 0:0 pm ball game

today is supposed to be close to 0
but then the front moves through and thursday is supposed to be 0 i would like to do the half marathon with you but unless i have allot more free time i don not think i can get into a shape that i could run that far
i'm really fat
i'm getting pressure or inferences that if i do not drop things my bonus might not be there
saying things like it would be a shame to have such a good year and then have it blown in the fourth quarter
they really do not know that such comments just makes me more committed and perhaps with a vengeance
it does get me down because i'm not sure mankind is worth it
if people you thought had standards
ethics and morals are now applying pressure
whets the use
sorry
to be complaining
talk to you later

assuming you can get comfortable with a percentage mmbtu enhancement from someone like garry wilson
the only one i would trust
i would suggest a method that would reflect more than the spread
the way i look at this is that the liquids that are picked up in the gas stream as you withdraw from storage is an unaccounted for gain
as such
if the mmbtu enhancement percentage was 0% i would use a withdrawal volume of 0% of the injection volume
we have to realize that in order to recognize this in the real world
the accounting group would have to implement accounting procedures that would try to capture this value also
because under normal accounting procedures for storage
barring completely emptying the facility of gas before refilling
this gain would merely remain in the ground with the remaining inventory
accounting would have to recognize the difference between the mmbtu factor on the gas withdrawn and the average mmbtu factor of the gas injected as a gain
we still need to live within the physical capacity constraints this method more appropriately represents what you are gaining but increases your risk if the mmbtu enhancement percentage you use is too high
i would appreciate being kept informed of what mmbtu enhancement percentage is used and how it is put in the model
greg
a rumor is going around that andy fastow's employment contract had language that would allow him to be paid $0,0,0 or some amount if a change of control of the corporation occurred
several questions come to mind related to this issue that i would appreciate your response
0
please confirm the existence of such a clause or similar clause in mr
fastow's contract that would allow him a claim of additional money from an enron entity
0
if such a clause does exist what is enron's intent as far as payment or litigation
0
what other enron employee's have such clauses that would allow them to benefit from the merger
your clarification of the above questions would be appreciated
thanks
jim
if the mmbtu enhancement is this high
have we considered whether this liquid content would be to high for the pipelines to accept
exceed pipeline spec's
will additional facilities be needed to reduce the liquid content
for your information
greg
thanks for the quick and candid response
i appreciate it
jim
i think greg whalley and john lavorato are individuals we can trust
i also know that those that we can not trust are aware that we are not afraid to press for answers and action
its interesting in that there seems to be two groups of individuals developing
those that are personally self centered and ask what's in it for me and a larger group of individuals who want to end the selfishness and work for the good of the total company
besides they all know as you do that i can be a real asshole if i don't get my way

bases on the conversations i have over heard i understand there are discussions being held regarding the enron corp 0 deferral plan and the value of the ene stock held in those accounts related to a single sum distribution
as you and i discussed previously i do not fault anyone for wanting to take their deferred values out subject to the 0% penalty
after having struggled with the issue i do find a problem with the various interpretations of how the ene stock should be valued
any method other than the number of shares times the current market value is not fair to the thousands of enron employee's who had ene shares in there 0k account and were not afforded a look back option
some might say this is easy for me since i did not have ene stock in either
but i do feel its a matter of treating everyone fairly
most employee's do not have access or knowledge of the deferral plan so it would probably go unnoticed
but that would not be equitable
the solution in my mind
if the plan participants do not agree would be to deny an early single sum distribution which is a right
per my interpretation under the plan
this may encourage acceptance of the plans interpretation of the ene stock valuation
i appreciate your reading my input

there is around $0 in ene and $0 in one of the other funds
how i got that who know
esop is around $0
the majority has been transferred to my ira's over the years
cash balance plan would not allow me access today
i think it is around $0,0
i believe pat should have a copy of my last statement

i hope this is what you were looking for
jim schwieger
jeff
i finally received the replacement pages for the centana stg contract
the storage contract and firm
interruptible transport contracts should be delivered to you sometime today
please review and initial if everything is ok
can i just sign after your approval or do i need to obtain someone else's approval
please let me know
thanks
jim schwieger
bob
i've not kept up with brian for the past several years
i can say
that during the four years that brian worked for me
he created value every year without having tasks and opportunities handed to him
in fact
even in his worst year
he created $0.0m
brian really started our currency arb's
us/canadian
in 0 when we worked on sithe
the concept of a
virtual power station
was co-created by brian and joe gold
his associate
when they sold a virtual pump storage to national power ltd
after their failed attempt purchase an actual pump storage in the uk
trading peak against off-peak spreads seems to be no great feat today
but no one had ever done one in 0
a lot of what we've done the past few years stems back to many of the ground breaking things that brian and joe started
including the way that we structured the tolling agreements surrounding our sutton bridge plant in the uk
as for enemies at enron---i think that they are all gone
ken
amanda
cliff
john stokes and crew
i think that mark frevert still thinks highly of brian and understands that brian was put in a bad situation
being put in the middle of the ken and amanda thing
i do know that brian has turned around his life quite significantly--he's very christian and has a lot less ego than he once had
if i could hire him back
i would
i'd just cut him loose
ask him to make me $0.0m/yr
and he'd deliver me $0.0m/yr
i'd take as many of those kind of people that you could find for me
let me know if i can help further
dan
pam
i don't see why the clearing of 0 is a prerequisite
let's just get it moved from 0th to where ever so people can see it
i've got a whole floor of people apprehensive about the move and wasting time talking about what the working enviornment might be like when we finally move back
we've got enough to worry about
this isn't worth the noise
if people just see it
they will understand that this is not going to be a minimum footprint sardine pack
and any noise will stop
when can we expect it to be available for viewing
do you want me to have julie arrange it with claudia
also
what has happened to our move
we were supposed to move yesterday
we're all packed up in boxes
and nobody seems to know what happened or when we are moving now
dan
dave
i haven't heard anything about pacer for quite some time
has there been any progress or have we dropped it
dan
fyi
what about our move
we've experienced an unprecedented number of emergency situations during the past several months
weather
terrorist attacks
internet outages
etc
all of which has been handled quite well by our market services group
with the last two incidents being so close occurring within one week our market services group has been worked to the limit
so
if you have the opportunity
put in a kind and supportive word to a scheduler
take a gas controller to lunch
buy a customer rep
a drink
or two
do what you can to recognize their efforts
thanks dan
kent
if we do so
i would assume that the reasoning is based as much on pricing as it is on volumetrics
what are jo and larry's views on the market at this point
dan
rod
i'd love to queue up a discussion about cms and/or wmb
so that the board is thinking
large acquisition
i just don't know if we'll be ready
i've talked with whalley
and he's let us come in at the last minute or call a special meeting if a big deal becomes evident
also
greg wants us to be very sensitive about capital structure in addition to operating cash flow
therefore
i'd like to start getting tim despain involved
does that make sense
dan
rod
i'm a bit unclear as to the source of the information contained in the first two sentences of paragraph 0
i think that they should more accurately be worded
tw benefits from contractual commitments for its firm transportation contracts into california
contracts covering 0% of tw's capacity to california continue through 0
long term risk is mitigated by contracts covering 0% of tw's capacity post 0
and a settlement agreement with current firm customers
this would reflect our position inclusive of red rock
i'm not sure where their numbers on expiring contracts came from
but i wouldn't have a problem documenting these
dan
but isn't that exactly what
interactive
means
i noticed that several people were left off of stan's attempt at an organizational chart
please forgive the oversight and don't read anything into it
as our organization hasn't changed
thanks
dan
but that allows all parties to game the system rather than to bid the capacity at a value that is compatible with the individual party's economics
or does ferc not see that as a driver
values at which a willing buyer and a willing seller would transact
this would always put a seller at a disadvantage
steve
this is landing at a bad time
i'm going to be in omaha going over the 0 plan
and doing other business
unfortunately
i cannot reschedule this one so i'll have to miss the wine fest
kim
i would like to look further into getting onto the mod board
any suggestions on what to do
thanks
dan
cindy
i will handle and respond to the attached
dan
eric
i'd suggest
janet place--legal mary kay miller--regulatory technical
talk with phil sound o.k
dan
stan
i just glanced at your new org
chart and thought i'd make a comment
or really more of an observation
jesus had 0 direct reports and screwed up on one of them
so while i agree that a flat organisation is best
i think that you'd better be very careful or you get a godlike ego
dan
cindy
no
i'll give her mine and eric's
i fear that if she has stan's
he'll get random calls that shouldn't rise to his level
and you'll lose control of your ability to screen his calls for priority
dan
larry
at what point do we consider taking off the
0 hedges
is that a game we should play or not
what is your view of market for
0 and
0
dan
stan
last week we coordinated with steve kean
rick shapiro
joe hartsoe and the washington office
so that they would make sure that our objections
as outlined in dennis's communication below
to certain portions of bingaman's proposed legislation would be heard
they've all been working on the issue this week and will continue through the bingaman hearings
williams
el paso and duke have all done the same
dan
cindy
no
this are working meetings which kick off the due diligence review for each of the withdrawn partners
so
everyone will be sending their worker bees only
dan
stan
take a quick glance at this
dan
stan
the initial numbers from el paso
as a seller of their interest
would have equated to a 0 to 0x ebitda with a valuation more in the range of $0m
while we knew that they wouldn't be a buyer at that price
we expect that they would come in at $0-$0m
they have yet to respond
in the mean time
we are sitting on deb's lowball
by her own admission
offer for two to three more days
dan
eric
julie has asked to take vacation on friday
so we'll need susan to cover phones
faxes
and general office business on friday until 0:0 eastern
0:0 central
based on our efforts in washington this week
friday could be a very busy day
dan
pat
thanks
i appreciate the input
let me know if anything pertaining to the specific routing of the line begins to bubble up
dan
greg
i have no interest for ets
dan
kim and john
i agree with kim's second point
i don't know how ballentine's language works--there doesn't seem to be an offer and acceptance of anything specific
i'd like to at least have a contract that has either been negotiated with the third party of the ability to negotiate it myself
can we clean this language up a little
dan
kim and john
i assumed that we'd moved away from that point in favor of the right to match
is that not the case
dan
stan
the teleconference today
with tcpl
held nothing really new
we did agree not to bring in any other third parties
such as el paso
at this time
tcpl noted that they would be interested in a roles as the developer
and perhaps as the operator or some or all of the new line
and would also expect to be responsible for all canadian legal and regulatory matters
they acknowledged that we have more expertise in the areas of us rates and regulatory and legal
finance
commercial and marketing activities and would expect that we take the lead there
we are working toward a first cut on a jv structure over the next two weeks
dan
no interest
shelley
i haven't seen any invitation list for friday's plan review with stan yet
but we are up at 0:0 and will go until 0:0
i'd like you to be in through the whole thing if possible
after that
do you think that you and i should walk through the whole plan with the key people in your group
and maybe steve's
give me a call if you haven't received the plan handouts by tomorrow
thanks
dan
shelley
i was thinking just revenue
but we can just as easily do o&m
too
which would you prefer
dan
dennis
i'm fine with the letter
and
i think that it should be well received
dan
yes
we wouldn't
i'll talk with kim
eric
i'll be talking with john sometime this afternoon
dan
thanks
eric
fyi
i had my assistant look back through call logs for the past ten weeks--john never called once
i called him yesterday and left him a lengthy message and received no return call
i called again today and received no return call
you may have a good relationship with these guys
but i think that john may be a bit flaky and would question his veracity
i'll try one more time
then i'll call it quits
dan
rod
this would be preferable
but i don't understand what rules could be changed to alter the existing accounting treatment
also
kent's numbers do not decline over the suggested ten year life of the project
and i'd bet that the injection and withdrawal rates decline just like they did after the project was initially developed
the other thing to keep in mind is that there will be no long term contracts securing the anticipated cash flow
we will be relying on our storage desk to secure margins in the short term market
which is the only way to do high injection/high withdrawal storage to capture short term market anomalies
are you okay with that
i am
dan
martha
would you drop me a quick note and update me on your progress
is there anything that you need to be doing at this point
also give me your general feel for the market's receptiveness to date
the caliber of luminent's staff
and how the relationship is going so far
if you have some available time next week
call julie and get on my calendar
thanks
dan
janet
i'd like you to talk with rafael if you have time
he's at columbia on an enron loan through the associate pool
he worked for eric gonzales in spain and for me in ees europe
he's a very bright guy and would add a lot of value where ever he lands
dan
janet
yes
he will be returning as an associate
i don't think that billy is coordinating this trip
but i'll check
dan
mark
i hate losing steve
but the most important thing is keeping him here
as you know
he was an eds employee assigned to enron until about 0
as such
he didn't receive all of the equity upsides that his counterparts did
i know a lot of people have
and will continue to
make runs at steve
so do what you can to keep him a happy enron employee
thanks
dan
mark
would you send me a copy of your announcement
thanks
dan
it's up to you now
steve
i'd like to get one of the blackberry wireless handhelds
how can i get one
dan
eric
should i call dennis
will he call me
or is he satisfied that he can't always pull the string and get a prize
dan
eric
i thought we were moving towards limiting the reference to the withdrawn partners solely to the attempt to reconstitute the old partnership
by a simple modification to paragraph 0
i think it's still pretty fuzzy
don't you
what was wrong with duke's proposed changes
dan
mary kay
the decision couldn't have been better if we had written it ourselves---another big success to add to your 0 list
dan
drew and steve
since our negotiated rates came out so well
is that an indication that the socal dispute is probably a slam dunk as well
dan
john
stan babiuk of el paso called again to express their interest in buying sunniland
how sure are you that this deal will happen
dan
brian
do we have the funds for this
if so i'd like to proceed on this one
what capacity do we have for paa's for the rest of 0
dan
brian
if that is the case
i think that i have $0 left
there was a request earlier this week for $0 from nng
i guess we'll have to put this on hold for now
i'll get back with steve harris
dan
since to bulk of these will be used for employees
i'd like to try and get 0-plus tickets through deb---not hospitality ones
mary kay
it seems that others have benefited handsomely from the volatility in permian/sanjuan to cal
border prices
interesting
isn't it
dan
pam
forget the monitor and video cart
i had julie order them off ibuyit today
who should we call to test the catv cable that was installed
as it appears not to work
and who do we call to remove the 0
tv and entertainment center that was delivered to us last week
thanks
dan
mary kay
just a bit of a heads up--it is looking like the management conference in november is being cancelled
probably to be rescheduled for after the first of the year
we should hear something official in the next day or two
dan
soooo--is it really too late to consider a disaster recovery site that would be safer than ardmore in the event of flood
bio-terrorism
or other crazy attack
that would be marketable to other companies
i think that this a question that one should ask one's self if one was just promoted to a lofty position of authority
dan
i love you
cool is it not
i got it
pal
john
i've been holding babiuk off
but this is starting to sound like vintage ballentine
and i have some doubt that he has any real deal in store
can we sell him an option for $0,0
to accept this deal by execution of our document and payment of the consideration by november 0
0
it would show that he's
at least
serious
or we could break off discussions with him all together and start up with el paso
what do you think
dan
john
that is fine
but i'd also like to see current month to plan as well
as this will be of particular interest next year
dan
mary kay
i still haven't forgotten--i'm talking with stan about the lay/frevert/whalley meeting this afternoon
and i'll let you know
dan
mary kay
i still haven't forgotten about you--i'll be talking to stan about the lay/frevert/whalley meeting this afternoon
i'll give you a call then
dan
okay
eric
bob will be reporting into the asset development group
which is you
but as you well know--we tend to blur alot of lines around here
it is important to tcpl and all of the others to know that bob does have direct access to stan and me
this is consistent with what bill had originally talked to bob about
okay
dan
are you there
message received
thanks
shelley
how are your people coming on the tw and nng contracts
sorry about the short notice
but as usual
it's good that it's in our hands and not someone else's
dan
eric
here is the it backhaul proposal that went to gonzales
you'll note that it is for deliveries west of the florida border
dan
eric
i thought you had talked to susan about covering for julie on friday afternoons
she needs to know that
covering
means she needs to stay beyond 0:0
at least until close of business
which is when she rushed out on friday
i had phones shifted over to audrey after i got a call from cindy looking to find julie or me
if you haven't talked with her
i will i'd you'd prefer
dan
eric
considering the number of fires we have at enron right now this is about the last thing on stan's mind
hill and hartsoe are appropriate to be attending this meeting
again--i think that this is a bit more of dennis
overkill
do you think he goes dove hunting with grenades
dan
john
have craig give me a call--we have alot of new work being done with pg&e and tw
so he could be quite helpful
dan
stan
i have it on good authority that dynegy is making a run at bob hayes
my guess is that bob will call you or me to discuss his status sometime today
dan
john
i want a report that doesn't change formats every time you or anyone else decides to chat about it
all i want is a apples to apples comparison from week to week
whether that comparison is to current estimate
forecast or both
i don't care
just produce a report and then be consistent--starting tomorrow
dan
not yet
i just got off of fifty and there is no news yet
last we heard
chevron's ceo had one more call to make with someone from texaco
and that their response was eminent
dan
we'll have $0.0 b
for about 0 minutes
fran
i've already talked with bob about the specifics of this
so go ahead and forward it to him
he's expecting it
dan
rod
i had approved an offsite happy hour for our market services group following our string of emergencies
about a $0-$0 expenditure
considering everything that has happened
we're reviewing all costs
whether previously approved or not
and cutting where we can
this is one that i don't think i should pull unless you feel strongly that i should
let me know your thoughts
dan
julie
all i really wanted to ensure is that we were striving to get as many tickets as we could
since the employees would take as many as we could get
i was concerned that with all of the cost cutting
someone would just assume that we could get by without the tickets
i thought that deb could get eight
0
i'd buy them personally
and i'd use four
hayes and me
and would give the other four to employees
if mary kay wants four
0
that's fine
let deb know
however
that employees using them for personal use
which i'm sure will be all of them
will be expected to pay for them themselves
dan
julie
deb refers to
bowl tickets
i assume that she means
playoff tickets
since the bowl tickets won't be allocated until teams are selected for the bcs bowls
which is after the playoffs in dallas
dan
mary kay
at what point can we expect the cpuc and is's to take their lumps and get on with picking at some other issues
hasn't kern river done something that they can spend their time fighting about
how do you think this one will go from here
dan
fyi---i guess it ain't over
till it's over
cindy
for what it's worth
i am quite opposed to going forward with the enron christmas party as planned
with as much negative press as we've gotten
we are assured that the local tv stations and the chronicle will cover it
and will put the
lavish
affair in the worst light possible
can't we stop it now
dan
fyi
bob
would you copy me when you send the first draft
i'd like to get a better feel for it
thanks
dan
phil
due to the increasing demands on stan
i'd like to offer our help in meeting and communicating with the field
hayes
harris
neubauer
miller
kilmer
and myself
stan's already taken
and i'm sure that you have taken
more than your share of unwarranted heat and criticism
so we'll help tow the line
would there be an opportunity for field visits in the near future
let me know
dan
stan
eric thode's comment reported by dow jones yesterday that
most of enron's critical employees are under contract
is not sitting well with my people--particularly mary kay
rob and steve
he also made a comment that bonuses were
scheduled to be paid in mid-february
a statement on a delicate subject that did not need to be made
i know that some of this stuff can't be avoided
but i don't think we're even being careful about what is
or is not
said in the media
i want a fair shot to deliver a solid company with good morale and a high self-esteem to dynegy
and mistakes like this don't help morale or the group's cohesiveness
could you raise the concern at you 0:0 meeting if possible
dan
cindy
this was the official response on whether the enron field christmas party would be cancelled
let stan know as well
dan
stan
in response to your questions today
0
research group--while we do use them for options modeling and sanity checks
we employ two of their quant-jocks directly on nng payroll
sean bolks being the lead
as long as we keep these two
we could get by without them all together
0
government affairs--we only use one individual out of the corporate staff
pat shortridge
other than that
they provide no value
0
aviation--will be used be my staff only is cost justified versus commercial
coach
flights
0
strategic sourcing--tap does provide a cost effective service
we could do without it
but i doubt we'd save money doing it ourselves
dan
joel
i truly wish that i had something in my shop for you
but i don't
try geoff roberts at entergy
0
0-0
rich kinder at kinder morgan
0
0-0
or you could try anadarko in the woodlands
i know that duke is still hiring
too
the other alternative is to look outside the industry
which is probably a good idea at this point
you could also contact joe sutton and see if you could get some leads from him
in any event
let me know if there is something that i can do
i wish you the best of luck in your search--we'll keep you in our prayers until we've heard that you're fine
so let us know
take care
dan
mike and dave
as you probably guessed
stan and i will not be coming to the christmas party after all
i will try to get to omaha prior to the party for a couple of days though
dan
kent
i understand your concern
but at this point
i may have to tell you who the
right
person is for the time being
i am working the situation from this end and will advise you what needs to be done
why and when
whatever is done
i can assure you that your
right
choice to fill any position will be from within our group
and will make sense from an overall ets commercial perspective
dan
fyi--this should wind kent up just a bit
matthew
here are mine

take care
dan
drew
the 0 transwestern fuel hedges were all done with ena
currently those hedges are approximately $0.0m in the money
our ena hedges would certainly be rejected by a trustee in bankruptcy
since these were affiliate transactions
i would assume that these positions were all layed off to a non-enron counterparty
is there a way that we can get assignment of the offsetting counterparty transactions
if not
we could have a big hole for next year
dan
john
just one suggestion
i think it's still unclear as to why we needed to file ch.0
in the first paragraph
final sentence
could we change it to read
these actions were necessary to ensure that our loans would not be called by the banks due to the cross defaults
and to preserve the value in our core energy business
dan
greg
i talked with kilmer about the negotiated rate proceeding
and he is fine with it being handled out of omaha
he would like assurances that he and teb are in the loop during the review process
this is not the deal that i had with mary kay
so i will need to confirm that she is willing to shepard this this through
please circle back with rob and make sure that everyone is comfortable that nothing is falling through the cracks
and i will talk with mary kay
also
i do want to be able
at any point
to severe all tw and nng functions iff i'm required to--meaning kilmer has to be in the loop on all tw matters
dan
stan
as of today
el paso's offer stands at $0m
and our value
rod's and corps
stands at $0m
rod has been told by el paso that the deal
if any
is on hold
due to the value gap
we're skeptical that we'd reach terms that we could submit to a trustee
as for the psa
staci has only prepared an outline of the necessary terms and has been told to slow play this one due to the value gap and el paso's signal that this is on hold for the time being
if you'd like us to turn up the fire on this
we can
i am a bit unclear
especially based on mcmahon's comments on sunday as to what is core
how we might restructure
and that asset sales were not on the front burner
as to what our key priorities are besides running the going concerns and preservation of value
let me know your thoughts on this one
dan
richard
thanks for checking in
we are doing fine
in fact
while enron lost 0,0 of 0,0 people yesterday
i didn't lose any
gas has to flow
you know
but most of the people that i've brought up through the organization are gone
i can't imagine that i'll need to layoff more than 0 or 0 people in the near future
none of the pipes have filed ch.0 and there are no plans to do so
judy and the kids are doing fine
we do see london alumni on a regular basis
are you going to be here over the holidays
we'd love to see you guys
let me know what your calendar looks like
dan
no
and i'd like to know who in my group is using it for 0.0/mo
can they tell me that
dan
all
as you are aware
we've let 0,0 full time tenured employees go
our retention of any contractors will be scrutinized to the highest degree
please prepare an explanation for each of the contractors
from the list below
in your area that you wish to retain
upon completion
please forward it to me
dan
brian
i didn't hear back on the ppa for julie armstrong
is it scheduled to be paid
dan
see if you can figure out how to get into this
dan
stan
negotiations with socal have gone nowhere
out of the $0.0m
past and future
in dispute
they have only offered about $0,0 in value
we're taking one more shot at negotiating a deal whereby they would take more capacity going west and/or having them buy out of west texas lateral space which tk and lorraine would sell for incremental revenue
if this doesn't prove fruitful
then i would intend to pursue the ferc decision
agreed
dan
guys
we need to terminate this
unilaterally if possible
or if not
bilaterally
and move towards settlement now
it's better to move to settlement prior to a default which i believe will be on monday
who is not being responsive
i'll track them down and get an answer if i have to
i think that we're too late for today
so let's do it in the morning
dan
rod
i just signed the confidentiality agreement and will track down the ena contracts asap
i'll let you know when i have them
dan
ken
i realize that times are tough
but this is really twisting the knife that is already deeply embedded in the majority of employees
have you ever gone down to the body shop in the mornings or at noon to see how many employees use the facility for health and stress relief purposes
we've done a lot of things during the past few weeks to kill morale
but this is a new low
are you going to do anything about it
i think that a lot of people would like to know
dan
eric
do you have any ballpark idea about where an offer might come in
dan
cindy
check and see if profitx software is on stan's computer
the icon will be on his windows screen
if so
find out if he uses it and let julie know
julie is trying to get it removed from a number of systems as the support for the software is $0.0/mo
and it is not a critical tool for us
thanks
if you need to reach me the afternoon
you can get me from 0:0 on at 0-0-0
dan
dave
fyi
i am still uncomfortable doing anything with nng's swaps until someone can tell me who the swaps are with
who the confirms are with
what underlying contracts are being terminated
and what are the ramifications of the termination
until we can answer these questions
we cannot terminate anything
how can we get these answers
dan
jared
starting when
dan
rod
michelle lokey has 0,0 coming in from wmb as an oba settlement today or tomorrow into the new account
i doubt that it is forecasted
i'll just have her call tracy
dan
rod
fyi---let's discuss
rick
i thought that there was $0,0 due from ena for november capacity release
who are the original shippers on the other $0,0
dan
rick
i guess that we are going to be s.o.l
as an unsecured creditor on the $0,0
how do we get to the $0,0 where they acted as agent
can we go direct to the beneficiaries
whatever can be done needs to be done fast
because people
money and paperwork seem to be disappearing around ena's shop
dan
guys
fran fagan will be sending you a worksheet for year end bonuses for 0 and a worksheet for 0 merit increases
several individuals may not show up on your bonus list since employees who previously received retention bonuses have been omitted
but these individuals will show up on your merit list
please work through these lists and forward your suggestions to fran fagan by december 0
as guidelines
0
we must
in the aggregate
come in below the sum of the proposed bonus levels
0
individual bonuses which exceed last year's amounts will be strictly scrutinized at three levels
me
stan
and the comp
committee
so the story had better be good
0
i'd like to see extraordinary performance during the past few months
particularly in a leadership capacity
heavily weighted in your consideration
fran
if julie's merit needs to be lump sum
just move it over to that column
also
send me eric gadd's sheets as well
thanks
dan
steve

amy and alec are definitely welcome
actually we had already planned on amy and alec coming and a couple who we are friends with is bringing their daughter
our flower girl
who is about 0 years old
we have a whole room to ourselves at the restaurant so amy and alec should be fine
i talked to grandma and she said julie wouldn't be able to make it so i already knew about that
don't worry about having 0 more people
the only reason we were cautious about inviting aunts and uncles was we didn't want to open up the flood gates but most of them already live in houston or aren't going to make it to houston until late friday
as far as the bill just let me know what you are comfortable with and we will pick up the rest
the food bill with tax and tip will be about $0,0
we are very appreciative to have both our parent's help as we quickly found that weddings are very expensive
however
we are both adults with good careers and try to be very self-sufficient
also
we realize that some things we do seem extravagant by our parents standards
we could have just as easily had a rehearsal at a mexican restaurant and it would have been cheaper
however we would rather have things a certain way and pay for the difference
also
i know that you guys are on a tight budget with the building of your house
the bottom line is that we are grateful for any help we receive and have the resources to pay the balance
our most important concern is that all our family and friends to have a great time
while i am on the subject
i hope your mother and grandma ina aren't going to get their feeling hurt about people drinking wine at the dinner
if you think they will please mention it to them on the way down because i don't want them to be offended but i can't change who zooey and i are
just so you know we will have dinner and desert and then there will be several toasts starting with the best man
james cook
and the matron of honor
amber
and then probably ending in zooey and me doing a quick toast
we would love for all our family to be there but if grandmother or betty joyce is going to get offended and don't want to stay i understand
also
do you know if skipper is planning to attend
we haven't received a reply card as to whether he will be there or not
as to this weekend
i am going to try to stop by but don't have a car so just depends what is going on
i will be in dallas so if mark is coming over saturday afternoon i could get a ride from him
i'll try to talk to him and see if that works
finally
we are both really looking forward to our big day and are very glad to have all our family there to support us
if you have any questions please call me tonight at the house
i thought you would be interested in the weather forecast for the wedding
the data includes max temp
max temp deviation from normal
ie if max is 0 and normal max is 0 max temp deviation is +0
min temp
min temp deviation from normal and percent of precipitation
so far things are looking good
we are getting a cold front this weekend
hitting texas on monday
and looks like things should be beautiful for next weekend
i wouldn't be that worried about the rain either
the reason the pop is so high right now is tropical moisture in the gulf of mexico and that will blow through this weekend
after that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get tropical moisture
city forecast date max temp max temp deviation min temp min temp deviation pop
%
hey pops i guess you know that the nasdaq is getting crushed
i think you should be ok but i think we should look at changing some of your holdings
i looked and some of your funds haven't done so well this year especially low priced stock
also
i am worried about earnings for many companies with energy prices so high and the prospect of very high prices this winter
i don't know but it might be prudent to even move some money into cash or up your bond exposure
i'll try to call you and talk about it later
if i don't talk to you in the next couple of days remind me and maybe we can look at some options when you are here for the wedding
credit cards that is
i just requested another $0 macy's gc
this is still the best reward that they have
we have another 0,0 points already
also
i straightened up the deal with at&t long distance and they are going to correct the bill to $0.0 and starting with the next bill we are supposed to get 0 minutes a month of free long distance so talk up
also
two other things
i checked bofa and the negril pulse came through as $0.0 and also i was looking at the at&t credit card and it had a charge for $0.0 from chi's cakes and more
i guess that is just the charge for the cake but wanted to make sure the it wasn't for the cake stands
since we are both big rich types you want to go to dinner tonight
let me know
love hubby

looking at earnings estimates i think they are under estimating the long term shift in natural gas prices
0 days ago they had next year earnings $.0 under this year and only resently have they started to raise 0 earnings to account for were prices are
i image that are still under estimating next year earnings based on where the strip of natural gas is
i don't think most people expected gas next summer to be trading over $0.0 dec 0 mar 0 this year
dec 0 next year dec 0 long term growth current 0 days ago 0 days ago 0 days ago 0 days ago 0.0

0 police follow naked man to pot crop by brian kelly herald writer camano island
a naked man found wandering around stanwood cinemas led police to his indoor marijuana garden after deputies asked the man what he did for a living
police said wednesday
deputies from the island county sheriff's office said they removed more than 0 marijuana plants
including 0 or so mature plants
from a shed behind the 0-year-old man's home on maple tree lane
a dead-end road on the south end of the island
the strange saga began saturday night when moviegoers and diners in restaurants near the theater's courtyard reported seeing a naked man walking around the complex in full view of families dining out
when an officer approached the man and asked why he was walking around naked
the man reportedly said that he felt like it so he just did it
an officer writing the man a ticket for indecent exposure then asked the man what he did for a living
and he allegedly said he grew marijuana
according to a police report
the man then asked for the officer's help in harvesting the crop
the officer said he was too lazy to help but offered to go look at the man's operation
and the naked man agreed
in the outbuilding behind the man's mobile home
police found what they described as a
sophisticated hydroponic grow operation
deputies allegedly found numerous grow lights on timers
fans and a complicated watering system with a line running to each of the plants
police said the man seemed proud of his operation
telling them that the system used no dirt
just lava rock
and he picked a large bud from a plant and handed it to an officer
in a written statement to police
the man allegedly said
i grow marijuana for fun and profit
to support myself and my family
to help bring us a better life
he also said he was growing marijuana for his father
who had a disease
and for other
medically ill people
the man's wife told police she had never been inside her husband's shed
but that was where her husband did his artwork and practiced with his yo-yo
deputies said they asked the man what he expected them to do after he showed them his garden
and the man said he didn't expect them to do anything
police
however
confiscated the plants and growing equipment
the man was cooperative
they said
even helping to load the equipment into police vehicles
the man may be charged with manufacture of a controlled substance
but he is not named because charges have not been filed

i am sorry i forwarded to souad mahmassani
i trade eastern canada not the midcontinent
i guess i have to start with saturday night when we met up with dax and michelle at the horsetrack
i have to admit that i wasn't looking forward to it since i didn't know how she was going to act and if she was going to be bitchy
about 0 minutes after we got there we passed on the way to the betting counter and she pulled me aside and was so very cool
she kept asking are you o.k
and almost seemed to sympathize with me
she said she didn't say anything to dax and would never say anything to him
she was so cool about it i was totally shocked
so on sunday dax calls and says they are going to bw0 so after a couple of hours we go up there to meet them
i walk in and missy and don were there so i was a little surprised
after we had been there for a while z
laura
devon
and michelle go to play darts leaving me and missy at the table
so starts saying so you aren't going to email me anymore and acting all sad
then she said i didn't have any balls
later don is talking about the heisman and what the statue looks like and she looks at me and says i am not giving you the heisman i guess you could say i am giving you the anti-heisman and motions as if to open her legs
it was funny as shit
she also said she dumped dale but i don't know that i completely buy that
anyway
all together it was very interesting weekend
i don't know that i could ever trust missy to be discrete so while it is very tempting it is also very dangerous
thanks for the heads up kevin

i called time warner and basically we were on a 0 month trial package of hbo and showtime for 0.0
after 0 months
the rate goes to 0.0
they charged us for hbo
showtime
and cinemax which should be 0.0 but they overcharged us in addition to the fact that we don't currently get cinemax
i went ahead and ordered the 0 channel package
with cinemax
and they are crediting us for 0.0 for the overcharge
going forward the package will be 0.0 or we can cancel cinemax and save 0.0 a month
i have to set it up in sportsline.com
i'll have it done before the end of the day
i talked to both carmax and honda and basically all we need to do is go in
before 0pm so carmax can talk to honda
and bring your info for the loan
they call honda and get a payoff which is $0.0 and then cut us a check for the difference
we should probably do that about 0pm on the 0th then we can go pick up the lexus from dorland
who much is the m0 field as well
thanks for your help

any truth to rumor that whitney houston died of an overdose
there is a very good website for getting information regarding current events
www.drudgereport.com i highly recommend you read it if you want to get the
real scoop
about what is going on in the world trade center bombings
as to who is responsible there is almost overwhelming evidence that osama bin laden was heavily involved if not the mastermind and/or financier
if you are interested
read the article below that gives a breakdown on who is believed to be responsible
osama bin laden is a terrorist that has targeted american people before
embassy bombings in 0 and attack on uss cole in yemen earlier this year
and it would be in america's best interest to end his reign of terror by ending his life
u.s
focuses on bin laden links with hizbullah
arafat's fatah special to world tribune.com friday
september 0
0 washington
the united states is investigating whether a coalition of palestinian
iranian and lebanese groups joined to help launch the suicide attacks in new york and washington
u.s
defense sources said the pentagon and cia are quickly coming to the conclusion that saudi billionaire fugitive osama bin laden was the sponsor of the attack
but they said bin laden is believed to have used a range of islamic groups for logistics and support
the groups being investigated include the fatah movement headed by palestinian authority chairman yasser arafat
the sources said
another group being examined for a link to the u.s
attacks is the iranian-backed hizbullah
middle east newsline reports
most of it today points to osama bin laden
sen
charles grassley
the ranking republican on the senate finance committee
said
but the speculation at the end of the road is that he and his network were very much involved with hizbullah
fatah and other
grassley was one of at least two dozen house and senate members who were briefed by u.s
intelligence agencies since the bombing
a u.s
official confirmed that the administration has not ruled out that bin laden was provided aid by a range of arab and islamic groups
but the official said no determination has been made
we want to be sure we understand all the connections
not just one connection
the official said
as we find out who actually perpetrated the crime
as we find out who they're connected with
as we find out who could be considered harboring them
i think it'll come clear
analysts and some congressional sources said the bush administration appears unwilling to thoroughly investigate the involvement of iraq in the u.s
attacks
they said that the administration fears that targeting iraq would dash hopes for an arab coalition against terrorism in the middle east
defense secretary donald rumsfeld said the united states has not yet determined who was behind the bombing
rumsfeld said a determination would have to be made soon
the administration has requested $0 billion for a counterterrorism campaign
defense secretary paul wolfowitz said much of the requested allocation would prepare the military for an expected counterattack
i don't think we know the breakdown yet
partly because the needs are so enormous
wolfowitz said
a significant piece of this is going to be to bring our armed forces to the highest level of preparedness
no plans yet
italian festival is this weekend in downtown so looking forward to that on saturday afternoon but no other plans

yep i agree
only problem is his recommendation is that we do nothing and the american people won't stand for that and if we don't do something bin laden will surely strike again

no i have not lost $0,0 but i am following a model and i take all the games it says and there are more than 0 games each week which eats up all the capital until the games are decided
i know the next question and so far i have lost $0 but i didn't take any games this week because there wasn't enough to bet all of them and i would have won $0
anyway
i would like to know if there are any big checks coming otherwise i am going to pulse and get things set up for this weekend

i am not sure if enron's food service department manages the starbucks but you do i would like to report a continuous problem
starbucks has always charged a premium price for a
premium product
recently
the quality of the coffee served downstairs has been miserable
very often the coffee that they serve is burnt and you can tell just by smelling it
it tastes horrible and i know it isn't just me because about 0 or 0 people who sit next to me have all had the same conversation about how the coffee is always burnt
today
i bought a large coffee and by the time i returned to my desk took the first sip and it was horrible
i went back to the lobby and told the girl it was burnt and she smelled it and agreed
then she gave me a new cup that was supposed to be fresh brewed
it was just as bad
it tastes and smells horrible
something has to be changed because the quality of the coffee doesn't deserve a price of a $.0 much less over $0.0

i spoke to you a couple of months ago about purchasing an american drew bedroom furniture set
at the time
i was purchasing the furniture from a company in north carolina after trying to get a competitive deal from one of your stores
we had a very frank discussion about being competitive and you stated that you would be very competitive with any future purchases and i would like to take this opportunity to take you up on that offer if it still stands
after several unexpected delays
i have canceled my order and received a full refund from the north carolina company
if you can get to a price close to the price we discussed before
i would like to purchase the furniture from you immediately
i am sure you are busy
however if you or a manager of one of your stores can call me
i would like to discuss purchasing the furniture
you can reach me at 0-0-0 at work or on my cell at 0-0-0

thanks for your help and tell amanda thanks
those things are such a waste of time
trying to condense 0 points of error and 0 weeks of trial in a 0 minute argument
bill did a very good job
the opposing counsel quickly reverted to personal attacks against bill
which did not go over well
union's main point was that the judge wrongly applied la
law
two of the justices expressed doubts about union's argument
i personally think the choice of law argument is a weak argument for union
the remainder of the time was spent analizing a particular provisition of the gas purchase agreement between union and the utility district

lets get together for lunch
what about hiking the pacific trail from lake tahoe to yosemite in june
july of 0
i talked to mark palmer last week about some other issues and casually thanked him for talking to you
his response was somewhat disapointing
i really enjoyed meeting him and he would be great for our gov
affairs office
too bad they have no openings
sorry for the lackluster interest/bordering on rude behavior
take the transmission wire job
come repackage the deal to enron and get your revenge by getting $mm of dollars from enron
yes
how about this friday
julie has not left yet
she was 0 days away from leaving to start school on june 0th when she
quite by accident
looked at the school schedule for the first time in several weeks
now mind you she had lined up a babysitter
lined up a place to stay
arranged to get a key----to start the 0th
the schedule says the school starts the 0th
pretty funny
how many years will it take her to live this down
looks good---please send
i have no legal issues---send out
after further thought
it seems to me that in light of our fear of litigation w
american coal
we should keep the documents
to further insulate the coal group and you from any claim that enron misused the information,i suggest that you transfer the information to me and i will hold it for safekeeping
today is bad
tommorrow i will call you
did you get my last message
i am not aware of any reason to hold up the suit
ect is ok
fyi
huh
yes if you can tell me who she is
congrats on your new arrival
i hope all is going well
i had lunch w
bill gage today and he mentioned that they had an opening at his firm
i think they are shy about talking to current bracewell attys
i told him that i had talked to you about other opportunities after the partner decisions were made and that i would pass along the information
if you are interested
bill's # is 0--0--0
open new matters
thanks
is this the usual way freshfield bills
out of principle
i would ask for itemize bills
please give me your thoughts
ect is willing to pay 0%,but we will not agree to pick up any of eott's share
pay it
why not alternate between sg and fulbright
flip a coin to see who goes first
it is nice to see that pat oxford came through again
the real question is
did pat not support bruce or does he have plenty of access but no influence w
the future president
maybe this says alot for bush
he thinks pat is as much of a cartoon character as we do and has no reason to take him seriously
wouldn't that be refreshing
you need to get the real scoop before lunch on tuesday w
ileana
the perd is a problem because it cost $0,0 per year to maintain
i guess mom is
justifiably
tired of paying this when it has been used twice in six months
there is really nothing more to it than that
when we0
all get a little older and our kids can play unsupervised,0
are less busy and0
have our spiritual leader back in the land of the round eye
then we will use it alot more
no one is seriosly considering selling the joint
save yvonne
i can probably take off two weeks in august next year to do something stupid w
you
july and june are bad because julie will be in montissori training school in austin
we should do something bold
exciting--not colorado or calif
how about canada or alaska
i never heard from him
the attachment is wrong
it looks fine
the list should be eliminated
just provide that the parties should mutually agree on an arbitrator
who must be a delaware corporate atty
this will confirm that hpl wants a jury trial
sorry i did not get back to you sooner
yes
the position is still open
if you have a resume
please send it
the revised letter is fine
do we want to outline the damages we have suffered
ie developement cost
if so
do it in a general way
i think the list is unworkable because it requires us to do due diligence on all the attys on the list--a daunting task
the suggestion of outlining several firms is a good compromise
the arbitation provision looks good
the kn matter has been settled
fyi also
i talked to john ale
the gc of azurix today
they are looking for attys
i don't know their attitude about recruiters
are you still coming to london
i sent the materials
along with a recommendation
to bob williams
enron international's litigation manager
if you want to follow up w/him
his no
is 0--0--0
i suppose that depends on your approach--weuns cowpokes aint got much use fer you folks in the big city with yer smooth talkin ways
seriously
bob is hard to offend
i will be in london attending the oral hearing in the cats appeal
i doubt i can attend
i have attached a report i asked tim to produce for me in anticipation of possible litigation
this is our judge in the beeson case
i don't like him as a judge but i would recommend that we gave him $0-0
i am ok
but reluctantly
with the settlement
this is the judge in the beeson case
although i am not that fond of link
i think it would be prudent to support him finacially
i suggest $0-$0
of course he will want more after the primary
there is no litigation reason why this contract cannot be terminated as outlined in your email
i am not sure about the purpose of this letter
the better response in my mind would be to have a process server arrive at their door
if we do send them a letter
and i leave that to you
we need to have already filed the petition
then we can attach a file-stamped copy to the letter
pay it
have a nice time
dude
there has been a change in plans
i am arriving on the same day
this sunday
but i have to leave the following sunday
the 0th
let me know your plans
how long is this going to last

need i say more
in this job i am also
on occasion,when the mood strikes her
allowed to ask irrelevant questions to carrin patman about how she is conducting our litigation
suggestions are strictly off limits
i have several recollections
who can forget richard royd's 0am breakfast meetings to answer associate questions
there was a meeting at 0 but there was no breakfast served and no questions answered
sample question
richard
why does every firm other than bracewell have free sodas
response
i'm glad you asked me that question but first let me tell you about the bejing office
what about the oscar madison

does this mean you have heard from rocky
dont give up hope yet
there might be a position not under rick shapiro
wishfully thinking

i do know them
great folks
the lawyer for the plaintiffs--patricia whatever is an awful person
if it is not a bench trial i'll tell you more
the plaintiffs atty--patricia whatever has been against me in two cases
she sued groupmac in one case and enron in another
one day i'm sitting at the house on tosca when the phone rings
its her
she must have seen my name on a list of residents
she starts pumping me for info:have you seen this dog on the loose in the area before
now mind you when i was younger,slimmer and with less kids
i was in the yard all the time
i knew the stray dogs
i told her i had never seen their dog loose before and in fact i didn't know they had a dog
needless to say i never heard from her again
fyi i am no longer on the board
yes
send his resume
why are we meeting again
send brenda---but don't spend too much time on it
yes
i guess things don't move as quickly as you might want
what is the status of this
i gave you matthews ss# several weeks ago
do you know what this is about
i am getting the file together
unfortunately
i am in an arbitration this week
does jolen vs ect ring any bells
i will set it up next week
have we been paid
i am ok with the settlement
i sent it today.please get w

it looks fine to me
i've seen it and it still looks good to me
fine
what are the court costs
i have attached a memo from don black regarding his meeting with duke yesterday
as you will note,this memo outlines the factual differences between the parties
the legal issue is one straight out of first year contracts class
was there a meeting of the minds so as to create a binding contract
when i first looked at this i was somewhat concerned
in response to an email from duke describing a particular index pricing
julian responded simply
i agree
but after talking to don
greg whalley
reviewing all the email correspondence
and
most importantly
listening to the trader tapes
i am convinced that julian never agreed to the index that duke is alleging
in other words i think we can make a good argument to get around the damaging
i agree
email
it is clear that duke's trader didn't
and probably still doesn't understand what index she was usingin her email
the master agreement provides for arbitration in houston with three arbitrators
one of whom must have 0 years of experience in derivatives
i'll take my chances with that kind of panel
i estimate our liklihood of prevailing is in the 0-0% range
let me know if you need anything further
i am good for $0
actually if this case goes to arbitration
it will be in houston
know any good lawyers

lets find out who their agent for service of process is and send it to them
after that i say we drop it
at this point have we dropped this claim
looks good
please send asap
and take all their phone calls
yes and no
i am not listening on the calls

i sent a follow-up letter today
looks good to me
i have no changes
i have asked britt to follow up on this matter
he will attempt to determine who are the targets of these letters
he is also doing some research on whether the atty violated an ethical duty by sending this letter to rick causey and others at enron
i will call him
meeting
dave duran and michele cash should also be involved
fyi
i confirmed that all the lps and gps of ect securities lp are enron cos

fyi
i'll take any game except tonight
let me know if i've won
no need to call
my thoughts are
defeat his motion to stay,win our motion to stay
perfect
i just sent you the letter
i'll be here all day
i guess we will know on tues
we are going around and around with sitler's attorney about the appointment of arbitrators
the
contract
and i use that term loosely
between sitler and cgas calls for the appointment of 0 disinterested arbitrators
sitler has appointed a friend of his who we do not believe qualifies as disinterested
the only claim sitler should have is a request that the district court settle the dispute and order cgas to appoint an arbitrator
i have asked bruce oakley at bracewell to call sitler's atty and fish for information
i'll let you know what bruce finds out
send them to me
i dont think you need to review them
could you get w
eileen and let me know 0
which case this is and 0
what is happening
no
i registered for and attended the first day of the 0 day course on electricity that started tuesday
unfortunately
i was summoned back to houston on a work related emergency
i would like to complete the class if it is offered in the spring
is this possible
this action by the u.s
supreme court may be very good news for the grynberg case
your revisions look good
for the last paragraph,change this to
enron has not asked enerstar to reimburse enron's considerable expenses
i'll be happy to schedule him
what do you think
done
i want you to know that i really keep an eye on the restricted list in hopes that nsm will not show up

i'd feel like a mooch
lets have lunch next week
any day but monday or thurs
tues.is good
i'll call you
obviously
barrett is already working on this
please coordinate w
him
we wrote him a letter rejecting his offer of $0,0 and asked for $0 million
it might be a good idea for you to call him and feel him out
we would certainly take less than $0 million

i'll find you tomorrow so you can translate

we would like to file this next week

my assistant is putting together a conference call for tues afternoon to discuss
please send me his resume
is this call going to happen
i am available
who are the new firms and what do you know about them
i am fine w
the bill
does this name sound familiar
good job on your conversation
unless max wants to pay some nominal amount of money to simply get rid of them
i would advise that we do nothing
we could write a letter confirming the substance of your conversation and warn them not to slander enron,but i think that might be overkill
i forwarded this to derrick and haedicke
why dont you send one out to every other gc
thx
the interest rate is fine
we do not agree to
loser pays
attys fees
the arbitrator has discretion under aaa rules to award attys fees
so we usually leave it open
i would not agree to pay attys fees if someone goes to court for some relief outside the arbitration
please let me know if you have any questions
the phone call to intermesa and votorantim should emphasize the following points
0
the transaction was never consumated
we have consistently stated that we do not consider the transaction a
done deal
until final documents are executed
0
we are no longer willing to consider the proposed transaction
the reason is simple
the market has moved and they failed to act quickly
0
all markets,pet coke markets in particular
are time sensitive
because votorantim has delayed in the execution of final documents
it accepted the risk that
over time
market prices would change and enron would no longer be willing to sign a deal
0
again
we never had a final
enforceable deal
their only claim is that we misrepresented to them our willingness to do the deal and therefor they didn't pursue negotiations with a third party
our response is
we never made any misrepresetation and it is not reasonable to rely on our negotiations as a basis to forego discussions with third parties when enron never sent them a binding offer
i would like to cancel,as long as my rc is not charged
unless i hear otherwise
i will asume this is ok
yes
i will attend
can you get w
staci and take care of this request
the requirement that all three arbitrators have 0 years of experience in unrealistic
we will be hard pressed to find one
most arbitrators are lawyers
with respect to the second change
it is not a change we should make
this changes the arbitration from a party designate arbitration where one of the arbitrators is our advocate
to a totally nuetral panel
i think we have compiled all the information you requested
sorry for the delay
please call linda guinn at ext.0
fyi
fyi
fyi
i just wanted to remind everyone involved with the tva litigation
and potential litigation
to be mindful of the possibility that some of our internal communications in the next several weeks may be the subject of tva discovery requests in the coming months

when scheduling meetings regarding strategy

after reviewing the petition

the plans are up in the air
the first weekend that we are all free is the weekend of feb 0
if you can't make it that weekend
let me know
if all three of us come
there is probably 0-0 hours of work
i would propose that we bring ben,james and ryan only
i will arrive fri night and leave sun morning
let me know what you think
i can't tell what changes he made
can you
both sheila tweed and i have concluded that kristopher wahlers is not a good fit for our position
do you have any other prospects
britt was going to check with all the enron gc's
i assume he got no response
your observations on how to fix the problem are right on the money
the other thing we should have done is confirm that the broker confirm links the two transactions as well
have you received all the information you need
send it to everyone you believe should get it
unless i hear otherwise from you
i will assume you are going to send the letter with attachments today
i have pushed this meeting until feb
we need to meet w/:mcconville
0 hours after barth
barth
first meeting in the morning
and travis.please set up asap
please try to track this down
please call him and set this up
i am assuming this meeting is canceled
bill is a great guy but i have no interest in a presentation
sorry,but we have no interest
i have no changes to the description
what time is the party
whalley's asst tells me the meeting at the px is at 0 am
i have left greg a voicemail indicating that the three of us should talk today about strategy
yes to arbitration
no to waiver of jury trials,unless the counterparty is in the rio grande valley or some other bad venue
i f you haven't already done so
please review the attachments
don't provide any feedback in writing or e-mails,simply talk to them on an unrecorded line
we need to meet with
in this order
brian barth,travis mccoullough,kevin mcconville and john hopley
lisa mellencamp may also want to attend the meetings with the attorneys from millbank
does anyone know this guy and should we interview him
let me know what you think--obviously we need to decide quickly
please drop me a voicemail or an e
mail when you have the time
i am out of town starting today
also
i circulated the resumes of the two canadian attys you sent to me last week
if you have any more comments about them,leave that in the voicemail and i will forward it to shelia and julia

thanks for yor message
on another front
i will be in london next week and i would like to meet with the attorneys who will be pursuing the pacific valour claim
did we ever decide on counsel
i dont care
i have asked bruce oakley for a status report
i'll let you know when i hear from bruce
i am in london this week and will be meeting with david best on thurs to discuss
thanks for your inquiry
i'll let you know after the meeting
actually
my instructions from nowlan are to pursue our claim against mtm
i am in london this week and i will try to meet with our london counsel to start the process
by copy of this e-mail
i have asked linda guinn to pull the tapes before they are deleted
can you work with linda and ed to pinpoint the tapes we need to pull
linda's direct no
is 0-0-0
please send me a copy of the e-mail along with kevin's response
bruce oakley has informed me that we will be filing a motion to compel arbitration
which should stay sitler's ability to take any depositions
either bruce or i will let you know if it looks like the depositions will proceed
in theory
there may be some jurisdictions that do not allow tapes to be admissable because of issues other than relevance--such as authenticity
it is hard to know the evidence rules of every jurisdiction

julie has held her tongue because of her impending 0 weeks in austin this summer
the kids are great
lots of sibling rivalries going i have been biking with garribaldi and worscheh in preparation for our participation in the houston to austin bike tour
garribaldi has a new job with a couple of big projects in the pipeline
worscheh finally got his financing on his project so he is pretty chipper these days
they are pregnant again and out of space in their house
missy medary is running for district court judge in corpus christi
she is running as a republican in a democratic stronghold and her last name is not perez or medarcia so her chances are slim
she is hoping for a george w
bush coattail effect
tom was not all that keen on the idea the last time i talked to him
don't quote me on this but i think he is worried that she is a status seeker and that she will have way too much of what she wants if she is elected
judges tend to have a lot of people kissing their ass
rob and amy are just holding on with their 0 kids
i think rob's job is going well
they made one large aquisition at the bottom of the market and commodity prices have doubled
i haven't seen anyone else,although i did talk to john scott the other day
he works for a firm in dallas that does alot of enron's work
i laughed at him when he told me he is trying to get his kids into country day

thanks for your e-mail about the duke/enron case
there is only one slight problem---we have no idea what case this is
neal manne at susman represented us in a case against duke that settled early last year
we have no active litigation or disputes against duke
my curiosity is pegged out
i asked bob boemer if he could find out more w/in ethical boundries

all attorneys
senior counsel

we don't have the time or the inclination to hold hands
there is no
standard
promotion track
if a senior counsel is successful
a promotion to asst
gen
counsel will happen in0-0 years a promotion to vp is the closest thing we have to
making partner
and generally takes 0-0 years
there is not that much compensation difference between a sc and a agc

the use of enron's name is ok as long as it is limited to that
the lawsuit against agency.com was filed this afternoon
do you know anything about this
can you have lunch on monday
i am very busy and very important but i will make an exception for you
ecogas and its affiliates have claims and lawsuits outstanding against them totaling over $0.0 million
these cases are
for the most part
suits to collect on unpaid debts
for which there are very limited defenses
the likelihood of success on the defenses of these cases is small
where else

my only comment to the interrogs is that brian should use his old title in
paul
plese call lara leibman at enron asap
her # is 0-0-0
did you ever send this letter
if so
please send me a copy
i have not heard from barbara about eitan
but my reaction is that he is not a great fit because of his lack of legal experience
typically
we don't hire first year lawyers unless there is a person who is willing to sponser
train
them
i know barbara has been very pleased with gerald nemec
so her feelings might have changed about hiring someone so inexperienced
however
i know that mark h
and jim derrick will be very skeptical
linda
see if barrett reasoner knows of a video conference in houston

greg
we are not in the market right now
her credentials are good
but her timing is bad
thanks forthe resume
as we discussed
linda's divorce is in judge squires
court
the opposing counsel is susan myres
who i think has recently moved to don fullenwiller's firm
she presents a problem for two reasons
first,she is much,much more aggressive than linda's current atty
at the prelimanary hearing
she objected to half of the question
which the judge sustained
he has asked to withdraw and i say good riddance
the bigger problem in my mind is that her aggression has
empowered
linda's husband
it is pretty pathetic from what linda tells me
he says things like
wait till i tell my lawyer about this
she'll go straight to the judge
linda needs someone that knows what they are doing
is aggressive enough to handle ms.myres
and has some clout with the judge
linda can pay,but has limited resources
thanks for your help
i dont understand your message.squires is the judge
susan myres is the opposing counsel
i cannot make it the 0st
all other days are good
squires is not going to recuse himself
however,he was not the judge who heard the prel
hearing
an associate judge--brent burg
heard the prelim
hearing
i can not make the call at 0:0
i am available at 0:0-0 or after 0:0
if the call can not be rescheduled to those times
please call me to give me an update
hi
the beeson class certification hearing and the hearing on the parties
motions for summary jugdment have been rescheduled to august 0--0
we need to send a cc to his attorney
jim keenan
sounds good
i would be shocked if hh did not have insurance for the line repairs
we should ask their atty about this
no
i already have plans that i can not break
try me next time with more notice
i am a very busy and important person
i have a mediation that day
let me know when you will be in town again
thanks for taking care of this

doug and rob
i left a voicemail for bob williams that i thought jim mccartney would be good
jim is an outside atty who consults with me and bob on complex litigation
he would be a perfect nuetral arbitrator
i am not available on the 0th from 0-0
every other time is good
one percent
lets make sure what durango is going to say
but i am inclined to call their bluff and proceed to trial
lets see what steve schneider has to say

i do not have the pac confirmation email

relax and go back on vacation
i will talk to you on tues
can you go to lunch next tues
wed
or thurs
please put this letter on my letterhead and lets send
i don't know what the deal with doug is
maybe we are a lot more aggressive than you when it comes to inviting ourselves on his vacation
i knew he was going to be there
late last week
julie and i decided to go to austin instead of her coming to houston for the weekend
i called doug and told him we were coming
my approach is that if he wants to say no he has one chance to to so
he didn't say no
i should have called you earlier
julie must have told me to call you 0 times on sat
the truth is i am so freaking tired that i just didn't do it until sun
we did want to stop by and visit but we will catch you next time
love richard
v&e represents us
thanks
unless their is a reason having to do with the case
ie we can somehow recover our attys fees
i see no reason why we should separate the bills.send me one bill
i am now not good on those days
friday is good or any day the next week
what about dinner with me and the kids any day this week
as you will note from the attached e-mails there is some confusion regarding this bankrupcy
i have asked linda guinn to coordinate with you to make sure enron is doing everything we need to do
i am the logical person to speak with b of a
i need to speak to joel or lisa to put b of a's request in perspective
i have asked my paralegal
linda guinn
to help gather the documents
her # is 0-0-0
please coordinate with milbank to get the requested documents under #0
have him send it directly with a cover letter to me
yes
did you know about these
i talked to delainey last week and he said he wanted to have a meeting to discuss
this analysis is interesting
sorry about the delay in getting back to you
i would do a separate heading
i am not sure who needs to approve this other than me
when whalley was head trader and coo
he approved
i do not know if it should be lavo or delainey
if you know
send it to me and i will get it signed
if you are uncertain
my paralegal
linda guinn
will find out
if this letter has not yet gone out
we should include the kitchen sink of perceived problems
i agree that the letter should be short
but lets eliminate their argument that we did not give complete notice
i will call you about this matter this week
has any action been taken on this request by shankman
i am fine with the chamber of commerce arbitration
especially in light of the small amount of potential exposure
could you send me a copy of the opinion from our local counsel
see below
please send the following e-mail addresses and telephone #s to bwhite@ me bruce oakley at b&p steve pruett at enron
he is taken care of
yes
i am the contact person at enron
the llgm attys should send me copies of all pleadings and drafts of any important pleadings--answers
counterclaims or motions for summary judgement--before they are filed
as for contact with the ecp people
i think your litigators can call them directly for incidental information
any strategy calls should be made through me
i would suggest that they give me the option of participating on the initial calls w
the ecp witnesses
i wil
l likely decline because of time constraints
is that as clear as mud
this disclosure is fine
we could agree to non exclusive jurisdiction in tenn
but not exclusive jurisdiction
as for the arbitration forum
my preference would be a major regional metro area--atlanta comes to mind
send the drafts at the same time
new matter
yes
lets meet monday at 0:0
dinner is better
i have all three kids this week because julie has finals the week after next
hows tues
wed
or thurs
we eat kinda early
0:0
the wauna and halsey ppa's with ft
james have been cancelled
sorry for the delay

for your review and comment
please call me about this if you still need help
disregard the previous e-mail

presentation----not only no but hell no
i have not heard anything about it since i spoke with you last month
my guess is mark is not focused on this search
don't do anything
i will keep you posted please respond to makris
this letter could have negative ramifications
however
we should send it if el paso mismeasured the gas
what happened to the conference call
i will
i am sorry that it took so long to get back to you
my paralegal
linda guinn
is the best person to answer these issues
her ext is 0

the check made it to us this time
my paralegal,linda guinn
is tracking down where it went
i am certain the $ was deposited
this rider looks good
actually
i said i did not think we should pursue it
but that i wanted harry to check w
the client/trader to see how strongly they feel about letting it go
we have a lot of dog cases out there that someone feels strongly about
any word harry
ron
i am not sure what this is
can you help me
the signed aff
is on its way back to you
i don't remember seeing this
please resend
when do you think we will here something
if today
if we appeal and win it will be helpful to our claim against tva related to the control area dispute
while we have not heard it yet
tva will argue that although tva did not use the same rational as entergy to deny parking
enron has no damages because of the ferc ruling
what are our chances of winning
by copy of this e-mail i will ask our outside counsel
bob madden
to comment on how he thinks the ferc ruling can and will be used against us
i know you have other things going on but can you draft 0 short letters to jb 0
confirming your requests re wisvest and 0
outling you information requests re ecogas sa
i will edit

can you print out a copy of the legal risk memo e
sager did
or unless the judge has scheduled a conference call for a time certain
you are exactly right---thanks
can i bring my grandmother
no on #0
yes on #0
one thing we may want to add in light of #0 is a confidentiality agreement so that jung ho doesn't find out about the settlement
bill w
ogden
please respond to bogden
tim is available next thurs
does this work for you knox
sounds good
i have not had any contact with the nuetral appraiser
so this speculation is from our outside counsel
jean frizzell inforns me that the nuetral is conservative and he doesn't believe that he will put any multiples on these investments
the numbers should be low
i hope you are doing well
i am forwarding this lawsuit to you
can you handle
we should not respond
can we get together next week so i can get an update
twanda will schedule
remember us
you're not going sharolyn wood on us are you
where are we on this

you can give it to him if you are swamped
perhaps $0-0 per well is what they are looking for
i am talking to bill redmond
that is the plan--although she doesn't need my family
she can always hang out with the cowan family
unless i am around someone really important---like a judge or her family
do these two e-mails relate to the same litigation i sent to you
send it out yourself
not that i am aware of
i will check with our corporate sec
becky

by the way
we have had dealings with carter mathes before
i have been told that exxon/mobil is going to file a lawsuit against ect
kinder morgan and enron liquids holding
have you recieved anything
i have not followed this
should i
i will check with our outside counsel concering whether a new petition has been filed
i am fairly certain there is no new filing
however
the plaintiff's discovery is clearly leading to claims or allegations that kevin mcconville
an ect/ena officer
through his board position and involvement at nsm management co
acted improperly
i wouldn't close your file yet
set up a meeting with the accounting people w/knowledge of these figures asap
i received a telephone call from schultes
attorney requesting that we make barth
mcconville
and the two analysts who went to thailand available for depositions
schultes
atty's names are bill redmond 0-0-0 and joel levin 0-0-0
they have a discovery deadline in oct
i tried to talk them out of it but they insisted
i instead suggested a telephone interview with limited depositions to follow
please call me tues about this
i have called you several times this morning but your phone rolls over to a messaging system that won't let me leave a message
that's ok today because i need to talk to you live
but it is good to know that i can't get ahold of you when i need to
i wonder if bracewell's wash
office has the same problem
joe
how long can we hold off on this
i have left a message for dan watkiss to call me about helping us with an anti-trust analysis
maybe you should also be on that call
he's a goner and he is a democrat

are you now in charge of ebs---put another way are
you da man
the policy is to delete all e-mails after 0 days
unless they are stored in a folder
e-mails stored in a folder are erased after one year
the policy has many benefits
first it clears up computer storage space
the policy can also results in signifigant cost savings in litigation where a judge has required the wholesale production of e-mails
imagine if we were required to sift through and digest 0-0 months of e-mail traffic
this has happened to a number of companies in litigation the us
who have subsequently changed their retention policies
frankly
the microsoft antitrust case opened a lot of eyes to the dangers of not having a policy
in that case
the discovery by the dept of justice produced some very damaging e-mails that were later used to effectively cross-examine bill gates and others
it is unbelievable what some people will put in an e-mail that they would never dream of putting in a
written
document
as for your comment about the subsequent retrieval of deleted e-mails
i
and bob
have been told many times that a deleted e-mail cannot be retrieved
please check with your source
i am happy to discuss any questions you have about the policy
please schedule ameeting w

bonnie is with the enron litigation unit and spends most of her time on ena litigation issues
i know what is happening and i am still very much involved

looks good

sorry bob--too late
this case belongs to you

i have asked britt davis to help me sort this out

proposed answer of cmua's complaint as you have already heard
california municipal utilities association filed a complaint with ferc asking for cost based rates
the following is a briefoutline of an epmi/ees answer to the complaint
the answer is due friday
please send me any comments asap
the complaint should be rejected because it wrongly assumes that the commission has no option to ensure just and reasonable rates but to requirecost based rates because there is no low cost solution to the problems currently faced by the california markets
we should attach our white papeto our protest and state that the paper explains how these problems could bsolved at little or no cost to the customers
i list here
for your information
the reasons cmua claims that markets are not competitive
these reasons will not be re-listed in the pleading
0 prices greatly exceeded 0 prices without regard to load
zonal constrained prices
even in the off-peak hours
do not reflect competitive outcomes for low load conditions
even small players can be price setters
the changes required are additional generation
transmission
and demandresponse and will cost tens of millions of dollars and take lengthy periodsof time to implement
there is no evidence that markets will ensure just and reasonable rates ithe near future
cmua asserts that with the advent of electric restructuring
the commission has increasingly allowed energy and ancillary services to be sold at market-based rates
however
cmua is wrong in the context of the west wherthere has been market-based trading of electricity before electric restructuring
since the ferc approved the western systems power pool,scontract in 0
the commission,s rules didn,t create the wholesale market in the past
the market did and it was running fine until it was messed up by certain market rules were imposed that are enumerated in our paper
the problem is not the market-based rates
the problem is the market rules
cmua,s motion does not address how market-based rates would be calculated for marketers that do not sell power from their own resources
let alone reflect the trading of basis points
almost all of the power epmi sells ispower it has bought from some other marketer or generator
many of epmideals are done through brokers such that epmi does not find out the identitof the seller until after a deal has been struck
accordingly
epmi gets ninformation about the cost of the underlying generation
if ferc doesn,t try to fix the market but simply takes away our market-based rates
since there,s is no basis for us to set cost based rates
we would go out of business
besides there,s no reason to take away ourmarket-based rates because we are not exercising market power
so if ferccould fix the problem with a less onerous solution
as we,ve proposed in our white paper
requiring cost-based rates would constitute a regulatory taking of our business and we would have to be compensated using the constitutionastandard
cmua does not provide any expert testimony to support its position
ratheits evidence is
drawn from materials prepared and testimony delivered by the california iso and other public sources.0 beyond the difficult evidentiissue posed by the fact that cmua cannot swear to the veracity of information produced by third parties
epmi would have no opportunity to conduct discovery or cross-examine of such
witnesses.0
all of thursday morning is good
how long do you think this should take
lets meet wed
at 0:0
i'll hold both of these open until i hear from you
steve allen at buchanan ingersol in lexington ky
please arrange this
do i really need a paragraph
one word-----litigation
wed
the 0st of nov
is good
same time and place
please respond to nlorentzatos
can you attend the meeting and the conference call
kevin presto
what is this
no
i have set up a conference call at 0:0 on monday to discuss
fyi
the e-mail should suffice as an official policy
let me know if you need anything more
the answer is yes but i would like to hear from barbara or shonnie before i give you the go-ahead
ladies
i have a trip to portland scheduled for the 0nd and 0rd
what about the week of the 0th
the 0th
0th
and 0th are especially good
lisa
this looks fine to me but you have a better feel for what you want
i would keep a close eye on the bill
perhaps a maximum amount millbank can bill
bonnie
if you have not already done so
we should gather our documents linda
please coordinate this effort
bonnie white
an enron inhouse litigator
and my paralegal
linda guinn
will gather the requested documents
linda--0-0-0
bonnie---0-0-0
my paralegal
linda guinn
will call you about this
which is another way of saying
my dog ate my homework
although i would love to allow someone else the opportunity to participate in this project
it makes more sense for me to be the enron rep
what do i need to do to begin the transition
the joint defense agreement looks good,except for the application of florida law
have you looked at fla
law
with respect to limitations on possible claims
you have a good point
please look at the limitations issue in light of what you know
an extensive review of the depositions doesn't seem warranted to me
i would also suggest we enter into a tolling agreement w
power systems asap
call me to
this works for me
please confirm if the call is going forward
the attachment opened
yes
she is ex-bracewell and i know her pretty well
the 0th at 0:0 is good

if not
call my asst
twanda sweet
at 0-0-0
call me about this
i cannot get into the system---please send me a paper approval sheet
yes we won
but no we shouldn't change our response
the judge sent us aletter with his rulings
but has not signed an official order
in fact
lasweek the judge heard the plaintiff's motion to reconsider and stated that his letter was not an order
in light of this
i would leave the description thsame

re

second-hand hearsay

sterling's case was weak and 0
she has hired a more reasonable atty
can you look into this
yes
yes
how much
yes
a qualified yes
it doesn't look to me that we have much choice

lets talk about this wed
i have sent the contract and release to pintail's atty
i expect to receive it back anytime now

i am getting crushed
please ask her to be the contact person
i am sending you a letter from their atty
call me to discuss
has liz finished with gathering the documents
my first reaction to this meeting was pretty negative
it seems like alot of busywork
my second reaction was to recognize that enron has a long term strategy of getting to know the insiders at aaa better
so there is some benefit to the meeting
however,there has to be a tightly controlled agenda or our business people
and lawyers
will lose patience quickly
the transactional lawyer who is responsible for enrononline is mark taylor ext 0
i explained what was going on and he is expecting you call
call bob's asst and see if i need to participate
i was supposed to be on the last call
which never happened

any thoughts on this question
knox---thanks for taking the time to consider felix todaro's case
i met felix 0 years or so ago when he was referred to me through the houston volunteer lawyers program
felix wanted a divorce and custody of his then 0 year old daughter
his wife had a drug problem and he did not think his daughter would be safe in her care
after a brief court case
he was awarded custody of his daughter who is now a student at deer park high school
felix called me two years ago and asked if i could help him w
his divorce from his second wife
felix tried to go through the hvlp but was over their income threshold
i asked david schwab
elizabeth dodge
husband
at bracewell to handle it as a favor to me
at the time
felix had a job at a laundry company making an hourly fee
he has since left that job and now works at a garage making $0
gross
per week
he was unemployed for the first six months of 0 and he has no assets
felix and his second wife had a 0 year old daughter at the time of his second divorce
although felix seriously considered fighting for custody
he thought his second wife was a good mother and gave up the fight
felix was named possessory conservator under his divorce decree
felix agreed to pay child support and he tells me he is current
shortly after their divorce
his ex-wife asked his permission to move to iowa
where her family lived
felix let her go
he has not seen his daughter in two years
last month he heard that his ex-wife was dying of brain cancer and asked if he could see his daughter in iowa
his mother in law denied him access
last month his ex-wife died
i wrote a letter to the mother in law asking for the orderly transfer of the child to felix
an attorney called me to inform me that the grandmother would resist
obviously
i am not in a position to help felix
but i was hoping that v&e would take on his case
please let me know asap whether you can help
i tried to call you this week about this
but i understand from your voicemail that you are out
then i ran into jeff and he said it was being handled and that there was nothing for me to do
i will be in portland next week if you want to talk about this matter
as far as the request to avista
i think that we should make such a request
preferably from our business contact--a short and sweet letter should do

my asst
twanda sweet
will get them for you
one of their litigators--steve smith
is representing duke international in a recently filed arbitration against ena in which duke seeks to cancel an lng contract with ena that is valued at $0 million
as you will recall
this representation was the reason that we did not meet with o'melveny when we were in ca last month
as you will note from the attached e-mail
the quinque class action has been remanded to state district court in hugoton kansas
robin gibbs had always predicted that this was the likely result
we will now proceed with the battle over class certification in kansas
which,unlike texas
is not necessarily appealable
i will keep you posted
yes
thanks
what do you mean by
seriously
please direct all future e-mails to
your vice-presidentship
can you take care of these---i have no idea what this or the ones following are about
should i deny the requests
thank you and congratulations to you as well
are you getting this
i would listen in on the first call
but these calls are worthless
for you
for the most part
have you talked to felix
for your amusement
thanks again for your help
i am in
he mentioned some case he had before but i thought he told me he lost that case
he never told me that he would be filing anything
in fact
he asked me to write a letter outlining felix's parental attributes because they were still looking at what to do
i am sorry i am so late in getting back to you
it has been a rough week
it looks like socal ed
and pg&e are really going to file for bankruptcy
we have been working around the clock to review all our contracts with them and attempt to minimize the damage
i will call you tomorrow to talk about how to get your team involved
i approve
you are now in charge
yes
you pick me up
all yours
yes
i have asked doug to set up a mediation
correction
yes i know about it
no i don't need any help

i'm going to be pissed
i just left you a message callme 0
my first choice is carrin patman or bruce oakley at bracewell--tel

my second choices are ron welch and knox nunnally at vinson and elkins #0-0-0
lastly

i might recommend different counsel depending on which judge they drew
if duane has any questions please have him call me at 0-0-0
becky
have we been served with this case
i have not received it
whatever happened to this
there are two lawsuits against ect pending in la dictrict court in california.the plaintiffs are legg mason and farrallon

do you want to meet w
mcconville while you are here
thanks for your help
did you ever talk to jim
rob about how to handle international
should we set up a meeting like we discussed
it should
i am not sure what game they are playing
maybe it allows them to argue their block forward positions should not be liquidated because pg&e is not in default to the px
any day this week
why don't we file a lawsuit in state district court in houston
serve them
and wait for their counsel to appear or take a default
we need to force them to respond
let me know what you think
i just left derrick a voicemail so i should have an answer shortly
out of florida would be better

sorry for the delay
but we can't make it
very busy and important you know
what about next weekend
fri
friday
looks good
i would send it from me to lisa urrick at the px instead
what do you think
enron's press flak is eric thode 0-0-0
looks good
i approve
i will attend
don't ask me for any $
in spite of the raging litigation
i agree with bob
i am not very interested
frankly
i don't remember it
ask linda
are we sure this is an investment and not the name of their earnings strategy
i would involve michelle cash or someone in enron corp who deals with labor/employment issues
i am surprised this issue has not come up before
i told sandy that this looked fine to me but i am not a trasactional lawyer
i just want to make sure you know the obvious
intratex has the beeson case attached to it so we nedd to maintain our ability to bankrupt or otherwise separate this company from mother enron
i am scheduled to be in london next week
i would like to sit down and talk to you about this
may i please have a flat screen
i have called tva's in house counsel to determine how the press learned about the settlement
here is theconfidentiality provision
forwarded by
it is really not the record retention policy that drives this decision
it is the open subpoena from the cpuc and the fact that we have been sued
gary fergus is going to draft a memo for your signature
can you send them the info please
ben jacoby 0-0-0
unfortunately
i will not be coming after all
it looks like we have it covered w/jim,robin gibbs
and mary nell
however
i would like to sit down with you at some point and discuss europe's litigation management strategy
hope all is well
please send this to mark manela by e-mail
mark
thanks for the gift but as i indicated in my voicemail to you last week
enron's policy forbids me to accept this gift
thanks again
we have been sued in cleveland
do you know any good commercial litigators
boutiques are fine
robin or jeff----please call me after this conf
call and let me kow whether there are any developmments
please let ann k
barbara g
know about this case
ronny's response was that he didn't know how he would break the news to his 0 millionaires that they would be splitting $0,0
if only he knew how hard it was to get that paltry sum out of enron
although i did not talk to him
haedicke tells me that jim derrick was very hesitant about making any offer
given jim
s attitude and ronny's flippant response
i doubt very seriously that we will be pushing settlement---certainly i won't be
press on
if we are ever going to pursue this lawsuit
we should do it soon
where do the traders stand on pricing
mtm exposure
thanks
i have no idea why enerson is being so panicky
that all depends on your definition of the word
job
it was actually anticlimactic---mark told bob he needed to stick around on some of the old ei litigation
a fact we already knew
are you at the sempra deposition
how is it going
when is the dinner
iam free the 0th
0rd and 0th
sorry,i can't make it
don't forget to call
my curiosity level is high
0-0-0
sounds good
how much t&e does bruce have left
does anyone know which atty is working on this
which atty is working on this
john odam has asked me to go to lunch w
his new partners
would you like to go
if not
how interested are you in sending them work
i think john is a great guy but he did a marginal job representing ebs on some litigation i was managing
i am checking
this memo looks good
i cannot make it the 0th
the 0th is fine
the 0th looks good for now
please make arrangements to leave on the afternoon of the 0th and return the morning of the 0th
i will stay at the marriott
we are ok with the representation
i will be out of the office next week on spring break
can you participate on this call
please report what is said to christian yoder 0-0-0 or steve hall 0-0
what is the status of this
i agree with your analysis
however,if the core performance bond has been paid or otherwise extinguished and the cts bond in no longer operable because of davis
actions
then why is the px holding on to our collateral
is that question now before ferc
what happens if we lose at ferc---do we still have an argument worth pursuing here
i would like your and gary's thoughts
there is a conference call on monday that i have asked the quinn emanuel folks to participate in.if anyone else wants to participate
contact bill urquhart
i am out on spring break but can be reached at 0-0-0 or
i am sending you a copy of the subpoena
served
on glanville
i have just left him a voicemail to confirm
but the last time i talked to him he told me this subpoena had been sent to reliant's legal dept
you will notice that it is only signed by dickstein shapiro
not a texas court reporter
i doubt it is effective
feel free to call glanville if you like
his no
is on the document
gary grote called yesterday to tell me that kevin was
served
last sat the 0rd
i have asked gary to send me a copy and linda guinn will be following up with him
linda's no
is 0-0-0
gary grote's no
is 0-0-0
of course you can always call kevin
i am on spring break but am checking messages
my cell no
is 0-0-0
i took an online course last month and would like to take another
i have forgotten my password/id and i can't login
can you send me an enail with this info
also
i have lost the course # for the seminar i took last month entitled
ethics for inhouse lawyers
which was a 0 hour course
could you send me this
thank you
i need you to take the lead in devising a strategy for how epmi should respond to these requests
i will send you another on that lisa urick at the px sent to me
in devising a strategy
it would be helpful to know what requests are out there
can you get someone to put together the best list we can
i need to get the form to show compliance
but i cannot get it online--i cannot remember all my passwords
can you get this form for me
thx
please put this in our database
i know you have worked hard on this so i hate to start with a complaint
but this announcement is not the greatest
first
there is no link on the e-mail to make the trip to the site easy
secondly
i tried the website address on several occasions with no luck
i am now giving up
thanks for the update
andy will be handling this one
i know of no reason why we could not deliver this opinion
when i try to approve this
i get a message that the approval was already assigned to michelle cash
what gives
when you rsvp to the enron legal conf
our company no
is 0 and our sap/rc is 0
i notice that chris healy and his partner are going to argue the motion to stay
are we ok with this
also--could one of you call me after the conf
call and let me know if anything important is discussed
yes---dave weiner at hahn loeser
0-0-0
i am not sure i want to coordinate that much
at least yet
key corp refused to wave conflict for several other firms and i still think i might be able to talk my way out of it
do you think that if i went to cleveland and talked to schultes
perhaps with a business person
that we could get out
thanks
if you want to be on the plaintiffs
yes
i found these in an old unused directory
looks good
i am available--what are we meeting about
we have no plans for the weekend of the 0th
why not bring them all
we can get babysitters to help if we go out
which i am sure we will
as for the perd
we are definitely coming
i invited john and yvonne but they cannot come
doug and susan may be coming
someone needs to call steve and jane ellen---would you do this
we will come fri
morning
i have read your explanation of when you are coming and what this easter egg hunt is all about two times and i cannot make heads or tails of it
are you handling this
what is this case
i agree
now i remember
call me if you get this in the next 0 minutes
please make sure my cont
onepass account is credited and my marriott rewards account
my check is on the way
what are you planning on doing with them
i am traveling to la on tuesday and will not be back until late wed
night
plus
your sister lives way the hell out of town
any other time you are available
i'd love to show off my kids
can we talk about this when you have a second
did you do this
did we ever destroy these tapes
also
i am assuming that ngx is well covered and that you don't need any help
if not
please let me know
perhaps i can get info from mark powell--by the way is there some sort of fashion trend in canada invoving shaved heads
have you met mark powell from canada
you should make a serious effort to get to know him since you are mr canada
he is here for 0-0 weeks more learning about the home office
what gives
the draft response looks good
milberg weiss is the main plaintiffs
counsel
they are a well known
and good
securities class action plaintiffs firm
the john o'quinn of la---tom girardi
is the plaintiffs
atty in the somewhat related gas cases
these are not pi types per se
but more commercial litigation plaintiffs firms
sounds great
if you are going there from your office i might want to catch a ride
if not
i got the directions and will see you there
there are no issues with making the litigation reps and warranties
jim
andy edison is getting up to speed on the matters he did not already know about we should be in a position to meet with you next week
i have also scheduled a meeting with you for next week to talk about nsm counsel and california
andy edison is handling this matter
his extension is 0
i am not sure why
but i would like a copy of the opinion
probably for the same reason i slow down in my car to look at an accident
file it but check w/carl ekland at leboef in denver to make sure we understand the risk
looks fine
is it still april fools day
what i meant to say is this request by rebecca that duke pay for her atty and be allowed to interview her has to be someone's idea of an april fools joke
andy edison is handling cc

andy
and me to talk about it
that was our original plan---at this point i have no way of knowing---but i would guess that we would be arriving fri morning
my life is not my own right now because of the crisis in california
last night
i was named as the enron rep

energy creditors committee--a totally thankless and time-consuming job
i may be leaving for ca tonight
either way

i have asked andy to be your contact on this
i gave this to gail to handle
she in turn is getting bob vote to handle
in the documents i received yesterday
i only saw an application for writ of garnishment
not a signed order--do you have one
i gave you what i thought were 0 copies of this pleading yesterday and sent what i thought was 0 copy to bob vote
as it turns out
there may have been separate garnishments against several enron entities
please get bob to track this down
i have called jim
that depends on what this is---i can't tell from the e-mail
i have asked gail to follow up with you and bob
i am reviewing my ethical obligations to see if i can pounce on this reward

thurs of next week looks good

i would call him before you send it

my understanding is that we should send this to el paso
i am ok

please follow up asap

jim and mark
gail and ross rommel at a&k did a nice job on this
i would be interested in how to prevent lc's from being paid
twenty percent of the golfers always drop out at the last minute and you end up with more threesomes than foursomes
you should reconstitute the teams
there are three benefits
play is faster,teams are more balanced,and you get to know more people
it all depends on what the letter says---but i am sure it is fine
i am here this am
howard
i strongly disagree with your conclusions about the retention of the greenberg firm on the commandeering litigation
when we originally hired greenberg
we heard from their litigation and bankruptcy counsel for 0 minutes--0 minutes on their inverse condemnation experience
some in the group thought that they were the right choice over
for example
andrews
kurth
because the issues in the the px bankruptcy would be more focused at the courthouse than at ferc
i clearly think we made the right call in this regard
however at the time we made the choice
i made the comment
which i am sure all of you remember
that if we were going to choose litigation counsel we should go out and hire the absolute best counsel for the job
if that happened to be greenberg firm---great---but they would have to interview like the rest
the fact that they have done research doesn't mean they get the job
that research is transferable.this is a billion dollar issue for the group
enron does not hire attys for cases of that magnitude unless we are absolutely sure they are the best there is
i have talked to the attys for both mirant and reliant and they agree with my position
i think we need to talk about this at length
i am available
i noticed from the attached report that the exxonmobile case is set for trion june 0th
since i have not heard from jim armogida or you about the casi have assumed that you have it covered and that corp has determined that the potential liability lies at the corp level
if this assumption is wrong
please let me know asap
thanks
frankly
at this point
it is anyone's guess how this will develop
given your distance to spokane
is there a local counsel that you would recommend---one with good ties to jugde whaley
this looks good to me
the intratex disclosure looks fine
check with rex rogers about what he wants to do about disclosing california litigation risk
looks fine
please do not send me any other solicitation
i called her twice but never heard back from her
if she is not calling you
i say let sleeping dogs lie
have you heard anything
i don't know them
anyone else
the meeting has been cancelled
there will be a conf
call on thurs
give me some details on the prices and i will run it by our traders
any thoughts
as i indicated in my vm
i will be in la early tues morning
would you like to talk about the isuues before your meeting--or would you like me to go
i never got this
does it belong to me
me too
you know mark haedicke well
the meeting on the 0th has been cancelled in favor of the thurs call
i will be in la la land
the beeson description in the
litigation
section in fine
i have also reviwed the description of the california crisis and it looks good
i have asked gail brownfeld to review the india description
please put me on the same schedule as bob williams
i will take a spot
twanda sweet will coordinate with you to get the dial in number
yes
how about 0 am pston fri
i will call you
this looks fine
are you available
i approve
i did not get the attachment
should we set up a meeting next week w
the coal guys and indiana counsel
do you want me to come
i will not be attending
it looks like i will be joining you and charna in la on june 0th
i heard from steve
you or charna
i think
that the meeting was scheduled for one-half day
that may be enough time
but if you are coming all the way from cleveland
we should make good use of this time
i think we should schedule an entire day
let me know your schedule
i have forwarded larry oscar's letter regarding durrel metal products/sterling foundrey to mike smith and bob williams
0-0-0
at ees.bob is my counterpart at ees let me know if they fail to respond
i would like to attend if possible
if not--good luck
i have asked my asst
twanda sweet
to set up a meeting w
you
jeff dasovich
jim steffes
mike kirby and robin gibbs for monday or tues
regarding the strategy to deal with sen
dunn
should we include anyone else
is it too late to take credit for this
these folks should also be on the sen
dunn call
no thanks
just a late note to say thanks for taking a few minutes to meet w
my friend richard gruber a couple of weeks ago---he described it as a productive meeting
is it too late to help you on your antitrust question
i am around all week
just a quick note to say thanks for hooking up with my brother steve
he is a pretty talented guy and i hope he can help you out
can you forward me some information regarding the french firm we discussed last week
i asked my asst to set up a meeting w
you
it has been set up for the 0nd
i am trying to get a better handle on the neg ctc's--how they are earned/accrue
she should have set it up for your office
i will come to you
can you give me a quick update that i can send to john nowlan re vinmar and the other case
i cannot remember the name of the case
after your arbitration is over
can you give me a quick
and short
update on pacific virgo that i can forward to john nowlan
two questions for you mike
0
what relationship does sen
dunn have w
aguirre or milberg weiss---has hein the recent past
or is he now joint venturing cases with them
0
does the lt
gov have any ability by reason of his office to get access to the materials given to sen
dunn
both
i admit that this is a little unclear--sorry
obviously
i am heading up the overall ca litigation strategy for enron
robin gibbs in houston is our lead trial counsel in all the ca cases
he is out of houston
mike kirby was hired as local counsel in the san diego cases
but both robin and i have been impressed with his judgment and we would like to expand his role a bit
i have asked him to lead the sen dunn response but he is coordinating closely with me and robin
is this as clear as mud
what position should i take
thanks
enron opposes the official ratepayers committee
two names:john quinn at quinn emanuel and susman godrey
la and houston office
thanks for your response
i am planning on attending
call me when you get a second--0-0-0
i need to talk to you confidentially about something---can you correspond by e-mail
if not

john quinn
one of our
many
litigators in california was approached by david boies
firm about getting involved in the quinque matter
he called me
learned that we were a defendant
and declined boies
offer to get involved
i have attached the boies firm response
i think the danger of allowing the quinn emmanuel firm to get involved far outweighs the benefit of getting a release
the release may be shortlived
enron could be added to quinque or a quinque copycat by another plaintiffs atty
furthurmore
their involvement in quinque could result in the development of evidence adverse to our position in the grynberg case
what are your thoughts
i approve

question re
email retention policy hi richard
someone made an inquiry to me regarding the policy
it is my understanding that if email is not deleted or copied into a word document in order to avoid deletion
then it will be
or should be
destroyed automatically after the expiration of the retention period
we have been telling our people to only move information from outlook to word documents if they feel that they need to retain it for more than the appropriate retention period
please let me know if this is consistent with the policy
thanks
and hope all is well with you

mitsubishi has not pushed its demurrage claim of about $0,0
our solicitor
david best
has had confirmed by our barrister that our time-bar defense against the demurrage claim is strong
0
we are paying joint testing invoices 0% and submitting them for 0 % reimbursement to mitsubishi
so far
despite its agreement to do so
mitsubishi has not reimbursed us at all
we suspect that if we push this
mitsubishi will start threatening to start up with the demurrage claim again
at least until we find out what underwriters
position will be
we do not suggest pushing mitsubishi on this
i will keep you advised

non-disclosure agreement richard
i have a company with whom we are negotiating a non-disclosure agreement
we have been working off of their form
but have inserted our arbitration language
we have put in new york as the operative law and they have responded with either minnesota
their home jurisdiction
or delaware
the state of their incorporation
i have told them that minnesota will not work and that we prefer ny
but they are holding the line on having delaware
do we have a problem with delaware for jurisdiction
also
this is a non-disclosure agreement and any subsequent agreement would have to be negotiated as to forum
thanks for your response

disregard my previous messageabout this case
thanks for your assistance in this matter
set up for wed
yes
but lets wait until you and i can talk live
please include on our database
can you make sure that this goes to el paso
i assume that we dont need to do anything else
disregard my previous messageabout this case
thanks for your assistance in this matter
this morning i received a copy of service of process that was served on cogen technologies linden venture in the roger atkinson matter
cogen technologies linden venture had previously been served with a summons and complaint in the atkinson matter in mid april
i forwarded the matter to el paso energy company
who had purchased ena's interest in the cogen companies effective late february 0
el paso retained ed fanning of mccarter
english to represent cogen's interests
we have worked with ed in other cogen matters before
and i have found him to be both effective and efficient
this matter relates to personal injuries allegedly suffered by atkinson while working at a construction site at the linden facility in december 0
david waterson of el paso recently called me concerning potential defense and indemnity obligations that el paso believes nepco may owe cogen with respect to this incident
we will need to review nepco's contract with cogen to determine if any such obligations exist
the document that i received today is a notice of motion to consolidate and to compel inspection
this motion seeks to consolidate the atkinson v
cogen case with a case that was apparently also filed in new jersey state court as roger atkinson v
jedi linden and nepco and to compel an inspection of the construction site where the accident allegedly occurred
i have asked becky stephens whether we have received service of process on either jedi linden or nepco
to date
we have not
however
i expect that service of process is in the works
and i have asked becky to be on the look out for it
as this new suit also apparently concerns personal injury claims
i am forwarding a copy to both rob and bob
so that you can begin to process and investigate the claim in your usual manner
please let me know if there is any other information you need in order to begin our review for potential defense/indemnity to cogen
thanks

although i tried to call today
as david burns may have told you
i was active at first
when i thought my role as comm

unbelievable

one week
we need to lean on him
in the longer term
he is out
please include in my directory
this also
i can't make it but i would like to catch up on the discussion later
the problem with tapping those funds is that the hogs will get fatter
i think we should vote with our overall theme in mind
the px participants committee is out of control and anything that curtails them is good
is that clear as mud
as you attempt to reschedule
just remember the crying faces of ten 0 year olds when coach sanders isn't there to lead them on to victory
gareth bahlmann is doing a big financing and i participated in a california due diligence call last thurs

our attys are at lebouef
lamb in new york
i cannot get them by e-mail or phone

joint energy development investments
jedi

the california state pension fund
lets take a look
i'd like to attend
please get w/twanda
fyi
i told her not to go because we had too many other problems
i do need to develope a plan to deal with fcpa
i would like to mninmize her involvement
but fear this will upset derrick and walls
any suggestions
can't make it
that is my son's third birthday
maybe i should bring him and the rest of my family
and inlaws
and try to pass it off as a joint celebration
no
i agree we should file on monday
i would suggest that we reschedule the conf
call for friday am--0o'clock
we should file on monday
absent some compelling reason.let's postpone the conf.call until friday---same time
i need the draft answer by 0 pm central on thurs
i cannot have a thurs afternoon call
is rick mccombs available on fri am
fyi
it looks like jim is becoming more informed if not more involved
i talked to jempy about this last night.he don't want another meeting
we have a new canidate in the hard-ass client category
no
i am listening now
yes
but if it screws everything up
don't move it
fine
please sign me up for the 0th at 0:0 or 0:0
i tried for 0 minutes to sign up before giving up
this has to be easier
it seems to me that someone at hr doesn't get it
yes
lets talk about all their cases
including the columbian coal case and the j block case
get w
twanda and set aside 0 min
don't know--maybe both
sorry about the conference call this morning
i neglected to get a call in number
i talked to paul simon
who had talked to limor nissan
and among the lawyers
we have no more comments
paul was going to get together with the commercial team and see if they had any issues
paul will contact you today with these changes/additions
if they are not substantive
i don't need to see them
send limor
paul
and me a copy of the filed pleading
thanks for your help
please handle
i have completely lost track of this case
i have asked twanda to set up a call w
you
me
and our outside counsel
now for the 0,0 question----who is our outside counsel
let twanda know
looks good
you are one anal dude
huh
for you to handle as you wish
this is pathetic but i don't know the status of this
what is going on
did we send the letter
i may be too late on this but here goes
if arbitration is out then agree to a forum that is not in their backyard
the issue of the sce bankruptcy will come up again
carl
did you ever talk to reliant or mirant
the next call that you have re the pg&e bankruptcy
i would like to join in and dicuss the issue of an involuntary filing
i know we have talked about it before
but because of the hijackers
we never got the full legal analysis
tom laria at white and case and the mccutchen attys had done some research
they offered to provide it to us
lets take a look
do our own research
and discuss
what is this
who is this
this will confirm that i would like to have an organizational meeting at 0 pm central on tuesday the 0th---one hour
twanda will provide a call in #
by copy of this e-mail
i am asking twanda to set up a short conf.call w/you on wed or thurs to discuss these issues
i am not in a huge hurry
i just want to make sure we have fully reviewed our options now that we have a little more time
llgm should participate on this call and gather all other information available
mirant and reliant legal memos
and lets talk sometime next week
i think llgm is in a better position than enron to dictate timing
so i'll leave the scheduling to you
thats like saying you want to be a prisoner/inmate to get the free cable
sounds like a good plan
andrea
i have asked my asst
to get with you to reschedule
m
haedicke wanted the criminal atty on the call
i tried to call you

steve was referred to us by neal manne and served as local counsel in the glatzer matter
he has done a great job
although i don't have anything now

i just talked to our accounting dept and told them about your proposal to fix the mistake
they are ok with it
just make sure you document it as described in this e-mail
p.s
there is no bigger matter to deal with than your bill
this must be the kind of half--truths that made you the most hated man in sacramento
fyi
thanks
i'll take the third week of february
by the way
if you call the house during that week and someone tells you they rented it from me for $0 per day
that's my brother and no matter what he says
that's only an inside joke in our family
sounds good
all joking aside
we would love to use it
maybe next summer
by the way
although i have not invited you and dave to come to portland on the 0rd
you are welcome
i am not sure it is the best use of your time
i am flying to sf to meet w
gary on the day of the 0rd to catch up on ferc issues you may want to come to that
in your firm's name

is there any benefit to more specifically describing why we
understood
and why they
knew
that the san juan lateral contract would be base loaded due to their long-term firm supply arrangement with pan alberta that existed prior to and after the global settlement rates were negotiated
ferc is aware of this longstanding and complex arrangement involving pgt
nwpl
tw
pan alberta
socal and socal's affiliate
pitco
it would seem a huge oversight on socal's part that this lower rate they supposedly negotiated and agreed to with tw was not memorialized in the global settlement or in tw's tariff
this is a rate that applies to two-thirds of the volumes socal transports under contract 0 and allegedly socal and tw had some verbal agreement
with a 0 year term
that would apply to these volumes
it loods good
thank you so much
i'll let you know if we need anything else after steve looks at the graphs/charts
according to glen
these were just orders granting rehearing on some issues
we still have to proceed with compliance of the requirements
we're submitting our first report on friday for the month of august
i'm sorry i will not be able to attend
hope you all have a wonderful time
no problem-o
i have nothing to report =
good job

i think rich has told you that i spoke with him yesterday and would like to discuss what it would take to get a new ios system up and running for tw
please give me a call or e:mail me to schedule a meeting to discuss
i'm at 0
thanks
lindy
thanks mary kay
i believe what lisa
sawyer
was referring to is the termination of tw's shared cost surcharge effective october 0
0
i don't think there would be any system changes required
typically
tw's rates are entered with a start and end date and
if this is correct
the surcharge should have an end date of 0/0/0 and there wouldn't be anything else to do
if it's not entered that way
an end date could be entered now
whether at the surcharge level or at the contract level
the surcharge applies to just 0 firm contracts
and that should take care of it
elizabeth
is this correct
i know you're on a project
please let me know if you can check this or who can
thank you
lindy
this wed or thurs
could you update the monthly cal
0 prices for me again
permian san juan hopefully
this will be the last time
i need to give tracy the final version of an abbreviated presentation
for ken lay mtg 0/0
by the end of this week
i just wanted to refresh the numbers one more time
i was trying to respond to your message about the ios meeting friday
i lost it
i will not be able to be at the meeting
i am not in the office on friday
please let me know if it will be rescheduled or when we can meet to discuss
thanks again
lindy
yes
i have 0:0-0:0 on my calendar for thursday
october 0th
please let me know the location
where is lisa's office
i just wanted to say it was good to see you the other day
though brief =
let's get together soon for lunch or something
i'm missing my bob time
i have reviewed the la plata facilities o&o agreement
lee
could you please review the same and see if you agree with this assessment
it appears to me that the pigging facilties could qualify as either of the following
special services
this would be subject to prior written consent and agreement between the operator
tw
and the operating committee
tw
nwplrepresentatives
if nwpl agreed
their share of the cost would be in proportion to their ownership interest
if we did obtain their approval
future o&m cost attributable to the pigging facilities could be shared among the owners
we've agreed to a flat fee for 0 through 0 with a 0.0% escalator starting in 0
addition or expansion
demonstrate that the pigging will add incremental transmission capacity
we have to give notice to nwpl and they have 0 days to participate
if they participate
they share in the cost at their ownership interest
but they get a share of the incremental capacity at their ownership interest
if they don't indicate a desire to participate in 0 days
we can proceed with the expansion
without any approval
but also no cost sharing
also
any incremental o&m associated with an expansion cannot be passed on to any owners not participating in such expansion
i think if we went the special services route
we would need to justify the need for these facilities to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the facilities at current levels
i think we would spend alot of time arguing this with them and in the end they would probably approve it subject to them not incurring any cost
they probably don't have $0,0
$0.0mm *
0
sitting around in a budget somewhere that they'd like to fork over for these facilities
rich
what do you think
how difficult would it be to demonstrate that these facilities are necessary for maintaining the current operating levels of the facilities
recommendation
to save us the 0 days notice period of an expansion
i think we should notify them that it's a necessary special service and ask for approval
to pass along their share of the cost
but to be prepared to eat 0% of the costs to obtain their timely approval and proceed with the installation of the facilities
in this event we would need to agree on the inclusion of future o&m attributable to these facilities
fyi
their ownership interest is still officially 0.0% since they have not executed the amendment that has been tendered to them 0 times
first by me and twice by lynn blair
if they execute the amendment that incorporates the 0/0/0 expansion of the facilities
their ownership interest will be 0.0%
kim asked me to send the attached spreadsheet to you
it's my listing of tw's firm contracts where i track rofr
this is a complete list as of 0-0-0 of all long-term contracts
seasonal or longer
any monthly deals may not be included
dennis lee has a report he runs from cbs of all currently effective contracts and contracts with future effective dates for me to cross-check that i have everything
the first tab
rofr criteria
is a complete list of currently effective contracts including
at the bottom
contracts with future effective dates and the red rock expansion contracts
the receipt and delivery areas are noted
the tabs following show the subscribed capacity for certain segments of tw's pipe
west of thoreau
blanco to thoreau
ignacio to blanco
by month through 0
in the morning could you please call to omaha and ask who could print out enough copies of the attached presentation for the attendees of the 0:0 meeting and forward this to them
thanks audrey
fyi
have we got anything set-up with james
gabriel yet
we won't meet with dave until we've had a chance to discuss among ourselves and see what opportunities we've identified
fyi
dave's proposal to steve
let me know if you have any questions or need anything changed
thanks
lindy
i don't know if perry has responded to your request yet concerning what contracts are expiring with wtx pool capacity and about that duke contract you mentioned in our staff mtg yesterday
but i looked at my notes and this is what i come up with
the duke contract that expires 0/0/0 without rofr is already taken into consideration as expired in the november
0 capacity of 0,0/d we derived last week
which we've already sold 0,0/d to calpine
ppl
other contracts expiring in 0
early 0 from the wtx pool are
total 0,0/d otherwise
we have wtx pool capacity every apr-oct of 0,0/d
opposite of swg's seasonal ctrc
the other issue we could take into consideration here is displacement
for the month of november
0
for example
we have 0,0/d of capacity we are including in our wt-0 total that is made up of southward paths
0,0/d for usgt
0,0/d for astra with receipts north of wt-0 for delivery to wtx delivery points south of wt-0
this is the most conservative capacity reservation policy
in the event not enought physical receipts were nominated south of wt-0 to fulfill all physical deliveries nominated south of wt-0
we would need to compress gas south through wt-0 to make deliveries for these two contracts
we may want to reassess this
i took a day of vacation
0 hour day
on tuesday
0/0
i had two sick days on 0/0
0
yes
shelley
i discussed this on monday
isn't that interesting
i wish we could slip this into some data request or something
we held a meeting to discuss the status of tw's 0 imbalance filing
our current position
after discussions about a month ago
has been that we are concerned about filing anything in the 0 docket because it would stir-up segmentation and for now we want to let that sleeping dog lie
we discussed again the possibility of making a separate tariff filing to pursue our oba
wish list
outside the 0 arena and decided again that this type of filing would just get consolidated with our pending 0 filing
after further discussion we decided that the one thing
most narrowly defined
that would really help us out with our imbalances is mandatory cash-out in constrained areas
if defined this narrowly
this is something for which we can clearly demonstrate an operational need based upon historical allocation and imbalance data
we think that we could make a 0 day tariff filing for this one change and have minimum risk of entanglement with the overall 0 filing
glen
mary are going to discuss with mkm and teb with rob
lyn
terry are going to pull together the last 0 months of data for constrained areas on our pipe
ignacio to blanco
blanco to thoreau
thoreau to the border
check with darrell for any other areas that should be included
and increased imbalance levels
we plan to get together next week to discuss further
concerning the rest of our oba
wish list
we are discussing whether to hold meetings with individual protestors to discuss only the imbalance issues of the filing and work toward a
settlement
position on those issues to have ready in the event of commission action in this docket
thanks
here's the rofr spreadsheet
the last time i updated it was 0/0/0
i just had dennis run a report out of cbs yesterday so that i could sync-up the rofr spreadsheet for any long-term contracts
but i haven't had a chance to do it yet
oooh
he is soo sweet
thanks for the pic's
we'll have to get our act in gear here with our digital so we can be hi-tech too
he is darling
xoxo to khalid
you guys too
love
lindy
dave
how are you
i hope all is going well with your new job
i'm sorry we won't be able to meet this friday
can i call or e:mail you to set-up another time
i'll look forward to seeing you soon
thanks
lindy

0 bloomfield compression services agreement or the september 0
0 bloomfield operations
maintenance agreement
referenced in the bisti agreements
james
do you have copies
who else would have a copies
lee huber has located copies of the bloomfield o&m
compression services agreements and a copy of the bisti o&m agreement
she is giving these copies to bill brown
how does this look
rich
give me a call when you have a chance to discuss
thanks
lindy
james
please find the file attached with the socal amounts in dispute as we discussed
let me know if you need any further assistance
richard
we are meeting tomorrow afternoon
internally
to discuss a possible socal settlement position
could you verify the amounts from march
0 through september
0 by lunch time tomorrow
i was using a combination of a spreadsheet linda ward had provided to me a couple months ago and inquiring in the cbs invoice system
i want to make sure i have the most current information
if not
let me know your timing
also
have we been billing interest on the disputed amounts
i don't see anything in the invoice system
please let me know
thanks
lindy
attached is a spreadsheet where james has calculated the interest owed by socal
the interest totals about $0.0 mm
we have not been billing interest
the system does not generate an interest invoice until the disputed amount is paid
then
based upon when it's paid
the interest is calculated
the last slide i'm working on is the
detail of market value
slide
i have a draft completed
but steve has not been able to review it
as long as i can get time with him in the morning and the changes aren't significant i should be able to have the presentation to you
could all y'all check my work =
before i send this out to everyone
scroll-down to the highlighted areas
thank you
thanks mary kay
how's this
please print a few copies of this spreadsheet and take them to tracy in her meeting this morning
thanks
lindy
i faxed it to you

go to sheet 0
0

attached is a revised offer per our conference call yesterday
the 0st tab is the summary

as well as for the other alternatives we discussed
oh
doesn't he just steal your heart
thank you for the pictures
i have the 0rd one on my screen background

this is when he's referring to tony with a blanket wrapped around his head like a scarf
milk
water
beans
hush chloe
i get binky
he is wonderful
sam
i are bonding this weekend
the kids were all 0 going to nyc with lisa for the weekend
but anthony doesn't want to go
so
he's staying with us
but he and tony are going to the river in utopia
tx to take anthony deer hunting for the first time
they're staying at tony's grandma's house
she's very excited to see them
anthony is very excited and wanted to know if they could get him some
camo
friday night
it's all about the clothes these days
that's about all i know
it's good that you're going into work and getting out of the house
it sounds like you're hanging in there
i hope you're able to get some more sleep
i'm sure it won't seem soon enough
but you will get to sleep again sometime in the next year or so =
it does sound like a long time when you say it out loud
sorry
it'll go by fast
i'm excited that khalid will be baptized by your friend
he sounds like an enlightened man and i think it's nice for him to recognize both your and ahmed's faith
khalid is a lucky baby
i wish we could be there
take care and tell ahmed hi
give khalid a kiss
a squeeze
love
lindy
let me know if we're syncing-up
if we're off in june
dec
check what i have for the red rock adm ctrc
i know dennis made some changes
i think i have the most current
but possibly not
thanks
lindy
yes
i did receive it
but i was going to call you because it was issued under my previous married name
lindy h
currier
how could i get it issued in the correct name
lindy donoho
please let me know
let me know if you need any help for thursday's meeting
perry had asked me whether this contract had rofr or not because he thinks it should be terminated
but cas is still reserving capacity for the contract because it has a rofr flag on it in cbs
i think that this contract does not have rofr
but could you confirm this for me
if my memory is correct
i thought that this agreement was always done just a month or two at a time and that at the end of each term it was negotiated with the price desk
more recently tk
to roll for another month or so
if i'm thinking of the right contract
that would mean that it did not have a rofr
because it was not for a year or longer
and that it terminated 0/0/0
could you check the contract file for me and look at the amendment history to confirm that the agreement did not have a year or longer term
if not
then this agreement should not have the rofr contract on it
let me know
thanks
cas continues to reserve the capacity under the contract
as if it's not terminated
as long as there is a rofr flag on the contract
rofr indicates that the customer has a contractual right to extend the contract pursuant to certain parameters in the tariff
i have nothing to report
lindy
thanks
fyi for our meeting tuesday
0/0 at 0:0 with dave
it had come up in a meeting that tw was being allocated some $$ associated with nng personnel
probably storage desk in houston
omaha and risk management people
is there anyway that you can tell us the people
partial people
who are being allocated to tw
i'm a little nervous actually commenting that we have shipper imbalances
here are my comments
i like terry's suggestion
in fact
in the preceding paragraph and the following paragraph where we refer to
shippers
we could refer to
customers
instead
my other comments on the tariff sheets were as follows
section 0.0 0nd paragraph
0rd sentence
explanation of
incremental revenue
when we talk about revenues which tw already receives from reservation charges being paid prior to the bid period
what if we're taking bids on future capacity and we're trying to get revenue that is incremental to reservations charges we're not necessarily being paid yet
the language is so specific
can we change the language to refer to revenues incremental to what tw already has contractually committed
0nd paragraph
last sentence
the phrase
guaranteed throughput volume service applies only in the case of a negotiated rate
what does this mean
tk
i were both a littles confused by this language
0th paragraph
0th sentence
the phrase
the value of the index based rate bids will be calculated using the applicable published indices available on the bid deadline
tk
is the phrase
published indices
generic enough or should we use something broader that might encompass basis quotes
i realize it will probably have to be something that is published
amy confirmed for me that usgt's scheduled volumes west on ctrcc 0 since 0/0/0 total 0,0
she is not including the volumes for today
0/0
since it's not a final volume for the day yet
attached is the slide detailing expansions to california as of 0/0/0
please review and forward as needed to jpmorgan
dan asked me for a copy of the offer we sent to socal on the billing issue
i must have deleted the e:mail
do you still have it electronically
if so
could you forward it to dan
he's interested in the excel spreadsheet with the $$ impact
thanks
lindy
i have a 0:0 meeting with a customer
it should only last about an hour
but i might be able to be there until 0:0 or 0:0
how does this look
also
i did change some numbers in the excel spreadsheet
the ignacio to blanco subscription levels were pulling from the row excluding rofr capacity in the supporting sheet
i changed it to be consistent with the other capacities
which include rofr capacity
shelley had made some assumptions about east of thoreau capacity subscription
such as
the usgt 0,0/d contract would remain subscribed
it doesn't have rofr
and she had included the extension of 0-0 other contracts that don't have rofr
these contracts were then dropped after 0
i continued the extensions through 0
i changed the east of thoreau capacity to 0,0/d from 0,0/d
would you be able to attend this meeting at 0:0
i will be there asap
maybe at 0:0 even
but i'm meeting on the electric compression agreements at 0:0 and i think i may not be able to get to this meeting until 0:0 or 0:0
please let ramona know
thanks
rick
for your review
amy mulligan gave me the volumes each month for calpine
griffith
we used actual volumes delivered
not scheduled volumes
per question #0
either time is good for me
yes
please
i need the 0 at-a-glance
the smaller one with one month per two pages
please see my current calendar on my desk if this does not make sense
thanks audrey
i can be there
per our conference call today
here are some ideas to get tw settlement value
0
socal to commit to tw to let us schedule transport at the socal/topock
south needles
delivery point
0
socal to turnback 0,0 to 0,0/d of receipt capacity from the wtx pool
at no cost to tw
socal continues to pay for it
0
tw has been scheduling pg&e's payback to socal at socal/topock to help pg&e and socal
socal to schedule this as transport from pg&e/topock
as a rp
to socal/topock
dp
and pay tw transport fee
0
socal to agree
in writing
to dedicate to tw the incremental 0,0/d at needles becoming available jan
0 until red rock expansion in-service
0
socal to amend their oba to dollar-valued
from volumetric
and cash-out their existing oba with tw
at tw's index value
0
socal to sell storage to tw
0
socal to purchase incremental thoreau to west of thoreau capacity from tw
0
extension of socal's mainline
or san juan lateral contracts
or early notice of termination or early notice of rofr trigger
so that we would have the opportunity to remarket it
can we all plan to get on the phone with maria tomorrow
thurs
at 0:0 to discuss some questions with elizabeth about east of ca
we've apparently been inconsistent in our interpretation for different purposes
reporting and system mod's
etc
and want to get it all straight
elizabeth
can you come to th 0th floor and then we'll grab a room/table/office and call maria
thanks
maria
please let me know when you can meet tomorrow
tk is out tomorrow through dec 0th
but we can't meet this afternoon because elizabeth is out today
so
let me know when elizabeth
i can get with you tomorrow
please let me know a soon as possible this morning
by 0:0 if possible
what the annual dollars are we collect from nwpl
pnm for the blanco hub and from nwpl for the la plata facilities
i need the total dollars
both the operating and market services together
i just need a ballpark number
whatever was the agreed to budget for 0 on the blanco hub and whatever that flat fee is for the 0 years on the la plata facilities
thank you
lindy
kevin needs to know how much money tw made in 0 on excess fuel sales
whatever is the most current number
0rd ce
and then he would also like to know revenue in the 0 plan dependent on excess fuel sales
let's use the plan numbers as submitted in nov
fyi kevin
we are re-looking at the 0 plan right now
there could be changes
in an effort to get cash in the door for tw and to maximize revenue opportunity for tw in the coming year
i think we should look at getting two proposals on file with the ferc as soon as possible
one would be the oba filing we have been discussing
and trying to support with historical data
to get automatic cash-out on oba's in
constrained
areas on tw
second would be to look at filing for scheduling by price at alternate ft points
this may be the time
the market to california is not so hot
to try to implement this
i know we will have to look hard at the cost of the system modifications required and whether we can justify them
glen is already scheduling a meeting next week for further discussion of the oba tariff filing
could we discuss scheduling alternate ft by price at the same meeting
the total number would be $0,0 per year
thanks for your prompt response
thanks glen
thanks audrey
thank you for all of your help
i appreciate your quick response
lindy
amy
ahmed
thank you so much for the pictures of khalid
we are so disappointed we will not get to see him at christmas

per our discussions yesterday
i did find an iroquois gas transmission system
l.p
order on rehearing in my file
dated august 0
0 in docket no
rp0-0-0
0 ferc p0,0
concerning scheduling alt ft by price
on reviewing it again
some key points were
allocate based on the highest percentage of the maximum rate
the rate used being the rate for the package of services that includes those secondary rights
the commission maintains that all firm capacity
once scheduled
be curtailed pro rata
without regard to price
panhandle also filed on march 0
0 for scheduling alt ft by price at docket no
rp0-0
it's referenced in footnotes
but i don't have a copy of the filing
craig
what is the definition of

for your purposes
give me a call to discuss and i'll verify
x0
thanks
lindy
thanks for setting this up
we spoke briefly with randy this morning and let him know that richardson took the gas in dec the 0-0
he was okay with this
he wants to wait to change the volume until the 0th
we told him you would let him know later today the amount he should nominate for jan 0-0
here's our calculation
please confirm or correct and forward to randy when you get in this afternoon
thanks

could you run that report for me of the current and future effective firm contracts on tw
thank you
lindy
thank you for your quick response =
hi ken
i heard in our staff mtg that you were
going over to the other side
=
i will miss you
but i wish you good luck
when you have a minute
call me and let me know your reflections on your new opportunity
i hope you're doing okay
going with the flow
who knows
in a few months we could be reunited
stranger things have happened
lindy
absolutely
currently
my title is
director customer service initiatives
i think
marketing
transwestern pipeline company
the only thing i have to add
if this is our premise
williams field services is not an
owner
of the blanco hub
only pnm
nwpl and transwestern are owners and should be the only parties that can transport gas across the hub header system without a fee
because they are in effect transporting on their own pipeline
i'm wondering if it's appropriate for wfs to have a
hub
agreement
if the purpose is for the operator
tw
to be able identify transactions scheduled across the hub on the owners
capacity
i taked with kathy about wfs
they are not an owner
but are transporting on nwpl's capacity in the hub
please see the attached revised document where i've added to the explanation of the hub agreements
please see the attached powerpoint presentation
this is a first draft of certain sections
industry environment
competitive environment and revenue generation
of the tw ratings package
thanks
i just wanted to know the schedule to see if we needed to leave a key out for ya'll on thursday or anything
sam
i will be home by the time you get to the house
friday is my day off
so that works out well
we're looking forward to seeing you guys
get ready to be
bossed
by the master =
sam's running the show
love
lindy
i am planning on taking vacation on the following days

lindy

thank you
lindy donoho
amy
ahmed
sorry it's taken me so long to reply
thank you for the darling pictures of khalid
i'm going to have to change my screensaver here at work because i still have one of the
washed in stardust
pic's and of course he's totally changed
he's so handsome and has such a pretty complexion
and those beautiful
big
brown eyes
what a sweetheart
we had a great visit with
papaflo
dad
cal our dad
taught sam to jump
sort of
and now he's unable to just walk anywhere
but has to jump his way where ever he goes
thanks dad
i think papaflo
which now refers to your mom and dad simultaneaously
got satisfactorily worn-out by their toddling grandson
we went on the slide
go to swingies
play-da-cars
draw-da-picture
play-da-firetruck
ride-da-wagon
and
read-da-book
and i was happy to hear papaflo proceeding each of those phrases rather than mommy
sam is busy
i heard khalid had a cough
i hope that clears up soon
i also heard you were looking at a new house
that's exciting
i'm sure you could use the room
good luck with that
tony is on the third week of his new job
it seems to be going well
he was bored
but now they gave him two houses in the sheetrock stage to finish
i hope ahmed's new job is good too
amy
i heard your job was working well from a flexibility standpoint with khalid
that is really a blessing
i won't mention how my job is going
except i'm still here and we don't know anything you don't know
we were sad to hear about mr
sutton
the kids are all fine
missy was disappointed she didn't get to see your mom and dad while they were here
she probably thought she might get a present =
i need to get out the digital camara and get some new pic's of sam
i'll try to get those your way soon
i'm sure dad
flo will have some from their visit too
take care
love
lindy
tony
sam
the kids
ken
did you tell me once that you had documented the calculations contained in the daily balance report
i'm thinking
oh-oh
that i might not be able to talk with you after friday and i wondered if you could send me a copy of your documentation
or let me know who will have the file
richard hanagriff
thanks
lindy
how are you
it's so good to hear from you
of course i get the updates from lorrainey
i knew about your new job
i hope everything is going well there
lorraine said that you really liked it
i thought of florabama when i heard you were hired at duke
lucky we didn't do anything truly offensive
i don't think
in our negotiations with them
we need to meet you for lunch someday
it would be great to see jeff too
if we could get ahold of him
he called the other day with a building question
he sounded good and said lisa had some irons in the fire
everything here is
wierd
and it's pretty sad
the nng commercial people go over
red rover
red rover
to dynegy starting friday
this would include mary kay
talk about a midlife crisis
it's all pretty sad
along with lay resignation
baxter suicide
etc
the new guy started today
who knows
how is craig
it looks like calpine is holding their own
i've left some messages for diana
but haven't heard back from her
sam is wonderful
he is talking alot and he's very busy
my dad and my stepmom
flo
were here this last weekend for a visit
tony and i got to go out to dinner and to a movie
wow
thanks for keeping in touch
let's rally the troops soon for a ladies luncheon
lindy
can i help you with anything else for the tw presentation
fyi
status of tw presentation
march 0th would be good for us
thanks
lindy
it's a kids weekend
so we'll see if we can get babysitters
here is a diagram of the general segment capacities on transwestern for the past 0 analysis
please let me know if you have any questions
thanks
lindy
jan already has tw's average historical rates derived from tw's actuals
contract rates and throughput/maxdtq's
totaled up to tw's contract paths for 0 and 0
i am going to use these numbers to allocate the path average rates to the pipeline segments in davis
template
here's the file
michael
i prepared the tw marketing slides
i have been incorporating kim and steve's comments
you can work with me on any questions you have or any additional information you may need from marketing
i follow-up on your notes in red
lindy
here's what ron worked up
the
total 0 revenue
number for slide 0 is $0,0,0
the percentages are
texaco 0% duke 0% el paso 0% burlington 0% agave 0% other shippers 0%
$0,0,0
the source for
growing power generation markets
pie slide is the arizona corporation commission
this is arizona's puc
the note
need to verify
appears on this slide
after the bullet
0,0 mmcfd annual average increase
i calculated this average annual amount from the first bullet
ca's natural gas use will increase from 0,0 mmcfd in 0 to 0,0 mmcfd in 0
the first bullet and the third bullet are from the same source as the graph
the california energy commission
specifically
it's from their
california natural gas analysis and issues
staff report
dated november 0
the cec's more current report from october
0
did not include specific long-term demand projections
it is focused on infrastructure issues
that's the source of the numbers on this slide
you are correct
i've got my units confused
the amount on slide #0 should be 0 mmcfd
on the san juan slide #0
i've left out a phrase from the report
the report reads
total basin wellhead production peaked in 0 at 0.0 bcf/cd and is expected to decline almost 0%
about 0.0% per year
to 0.0 bcf/cd by 0
in the tabular information of the study
0 begins with 0,0 mmcf/d and 0 ends with 0,0 mmcf/d
i talked with steve about this bullet
let's insert the phrase
due to capitalizing on market volatility
on slide # 0
as we discussed yesterday
i think we'll have to do without the 0 throughput numbers because the ferc form 0's aren't published yet for 0
we could update the presentation when the numbers are published
on slide # 0
there's a note at the bottom
% of revenue
what do we need here
do i need to get you a number
s
i would recommend the following assumptions for capacity resubscription frothe historical average rates should be assumed for the resubscription of east and ignacio to blanco capacity rolling-off during this time period
the forward curves that have been discussed represent the value of capacity to california
not east to east or ignacio to blanco capacity
i don't think that max rates for the capacity represented in these groups is appropriatethe max rate at $.0 is appropriate for the san juan group
the appropriate max rate for the west group is $.0
the volume of ignacio to blanco capacity available for resubscription should be reduced
today
we have contracts from ignacio to the blanco hub that then continue on transwestern on another contract
these contracts existed before transwestern owned this line and were assigned to transwestern when we purchased the facilities from nwpl
because of this
artificial break
in the contracts
transwestern is collecting the san juan lateral rate once on a contract from ignacio to blanco and then again on another contract from blanco to thoreau
or to the ca border
in the future
when this capacity is resubscribed
the contracts will most likely not be split at the blanco hub and transwestern will only extract the san juan lateral rate once from ignacio to thoreau
or to the ca border
jan and i will look at the ignacio capacity that has historically continued on transwestern south of the blanco hub
vs
delivering to el paso at blanco
we will come up with a % to be applied to the ignacio to blanco capacity that should be resubscribed at a zero rate
or the capacity to be resubscribed can be reduced
whichever is easier to put in the model
attached is the spreadsheet updated for the i to i deals
please see the first tab for summarized info
i took vacation
0
on february 0st
it's showing the percentage of capacity subscribed vs
total capacity
the fuel assumptions to be backed-out of the spread should be
0
0 san juan to ca 0.0% 0
on san juan to ca 0.0% 0
on permian to ca 0.0% kevin
tracy
steve
paul
let me know if you think these are not the right assumptions
this morning in our meeting
we discussed 0 cases to be run in the tw 0 model
i've summarized them in the attached spreadsheet so we can keep track of our variables
i will be sending you additional info for the various cases
please call to discuss
thanks
lindy
here's the spreadsheet with numbers for the 0 cases
please refer to the assumptions tab
updated numbers in the summary
fuel price
rates tabs
what is the status of the draft from gina taylor's group
will they be sending it to me for review
the revenue impact of the in-service delay of the red rock expansion is as follows
volume plan revenue month trsp/fuel 0,0/d 0 days 0 0
june
made no subscription assumption in plan
total $0,0
fuel calculated at 0.0% upside
i didn't get a response from tracy yesterday
so i'll ask you
is gina taylor's group working on a draft of the business plan
i understood from tracy in our meeting with steve last friday that someone in gina's group would be working on a draft of the text version of the presentation
do you know if that's happening
i've attached michael's most recent version
from friday
of the powerpoint presentation i put together and i've incorporated tracy's comments
from yesterday
ron matthews had drafted a history for tracy
it appears on a slide in the presentation
this is all we have as far as a basic overview and history
attached is redlined draft
plese see changes to the history and customers
contracts sections requested
here is the summary of the expansions currently included in the 0 year projection.i received from james
please sign me up for the monday march 0th session at 0:0
will you be sending the location
what is the question
sorry
i didn't see the questions below
we were using historical rates
no fuel adjustment because we collect it in fuel sales
through 0
after 0
i calculated an adjustment to add to the historical rates
assuming that we would recapture some of the value of the spread in the rate
and it made the rate greater than the max tariff rate
davis and i discussed that we didn't think we should assume anything in the models over max rate
so davis said he would use the max rate after 0
all of this is just pertaining to the west rates
the historical average west rate is $.0
the historical west rate with fuel adjustment added is $.0
the max rate is $.0
it's the same thing someone commented below
in blue
in response to the question
if we are at average rates we would be able to get it back
fuel over-retention
up to the max rate number
it's just one slide
the 0nd bullet is true in the recent past
but not necessarily going forward
i'd have to check with jan tomorrow if the 0th bullet is in the ballpark
neither of these bullets represent a timeframe
gina said this is very high level
i guess the last bullet kind of sums up our caveat
let me know if you have comments
gina said she had been running this all past rod
tracy had suggested that we leave the marketing strategy to the end after we put together the 0 year plan so that we could address how we plan to meet it
i had included in my drafts to kevin the mktg strategy slides
0
from our 0 stuff
but we probably need to expand that to address expansions etc
but i was waiting until we finalized what we were going to project in the 0 year plan
the strategy should be the same for the rating agency slide bullets as for the business plan text
did you have any comments
want anything changed/added/deleted
jan
i had a number from you for one of the presentations we put together
but i wasn't sure if it was the final
actuals for 0
what was tw's total actual throughput for 0
jan
what percentage of our revenues from from demand charges in 0
gina has a bullet here that says
over 0%
is this in the ballpark
i have 0.0 bcf/d for annual daily average for total system in 0 on tw
that's what i was asking jan previously
does the 0.0 bcf/d include any estimates or is that an actual number
gina
i am waiting for steve to respond to two e:mails i've sent him requesting comments on the slide
he is in dallas today
no problem
thank you
effective march 0
0
i will not be working the 0/0 schedule anymore
please let me know if you need anything else from me
thanks
lindy
yes
i'll be working a regular 0x0 schedule
what voicemail
are you thinking of someone else
sorry
here are the bullets
0,0 mile pipeline extending from west texas to the california border with 0.0 bcf/day of peak capacity
maximum rate environment due to increased california demand
bi-directional flow capabilities provides flexibility to rapidly adapt regional demand
over 0% of revenues from demand charges
western deliveries fully subscribed through dec 0
eastern deliveries fully subscribed through dec 0
well-positioned for recontracting
no new rate case until november 0
overbuilding into cal
can compromise resubscription of contracts
not unique to tw
the slide includes these bullets
a map of tw and a barchart with 0-0 throughput
i asked gina to change the 0% to 0% in 0th bullet
how do you feel about the
maximum rate environment
bullet
i am planning to take take vacation days on march 0
0 and on march 0
april 0
please let me know if there are any scheduling conflicts
thanks
lindy
hello
i was asleep at the wheel there
i'll have gina change that to 0% subscribed on average through 0
there is not time period referenced on the max rate statement
gina needed to finalize
so we deleted the
max rate environment
bullet
this is my understanding too
we can discount gri away and we only have to pay the gas research institute what we collect
we have to pay the aca
if we discount it away
one more check would be jeanette doll
jeanette
i tried to find the original spreadsheet that i'm sure you sent me where you calculated these quarterly rates
but i can't find it
do you recall these rates
my question is
i think we used just demand dollars
so i don't think commodity is in here
how is it that the san juan rates are above the maximum $.0
there really aren't any surcharges for san juan to thoreau transactions
can you try to look at this to see why the rate might be averaging greater than max
thanks
thank you
president's day holiday on 0/0 and my last friday off on 0/0
thanks audrey
how does this look
the first slide is the flyer to be distributed to the parents in the kids
bags
the second slide i'll print to put on a large manila envelope for the each classroom door
did i forget any info
does it sound voluntary enough
let me know your comments and i'll run it past someone in the office this evening or on monday and try to have the envelopes out on monday
i'll collect the checks each evening when i pick-up sam
thanks
lindy
okay
i've already drafted some marketing strategy stuff that steve's reviewing
let me know when you want to get together to discuss
here's a simple first draft
i didn't know how much detail we should get into
ramona
am i using the correct terminology
they are not going to confirm in cycle 0
they are just going to let us fill-in where el paso filled-up all the capacity downstream
let me know your comments
thanks
that's probably a good idea
i'll wait until i get our comments
i'm asking ramona a question
it would probably be good if i had her on the address list =
also
terry
shelley
any comments
we were discussing this in a meeting friday afternoon and after i incorporate all of our comments
we're going to run it past socal as well
this change is pursuant to a conversation steve had with ladd lorenz last week
can you help me with addressing some of these issues
let's talk after staff mtg
thanks
fyi
looks like we have a few adm things to get in place before we can implement
yes dad
you did it right
hope ya'll are okay
i'll call you tonight papaflo
love you
lindy
i'll have to research the contract
i'll try to get back with you today
i think we can get with ramona and mary draemer to discuss
they may just be able to work it through their contacts at socal
i do think we will want to run the posting past socal before we put it out there
i had been meaning to reply to your message you sent to tony
me a few weeks ago
after you showed us the houses on winter wheat
i saw this morning that 0 winter wheat had an option pending =
i love that house
but
we are not in a position yet to make a decision about moving
so i guess it wasn't meant to be
i just wanted to let you know that we appreciated you coming out to show us some homes the other weekend and following-up so promptly with your e:mail on other houses
if we do decide that we're coming to the woodlands
we will be calling you to look for a house
we really enjoyed meeting you and think that it would be great to work with you to look for a home
thank you
lindy
it is my understanding
from kevin hyatt
that its like arizona's puc
good luck
i wasn't at this meeting
i was out yesterday
lorraine
this is southern's gallup contract
i've looked at our yellow file we keep down here and the original agreement only allowed alt rp's
dp's within the path
in the direction of flow
at the discounted rate
then
i see an amendment to allow them alternate dp's at the ca border
i don't see anything else here
are you aware of any deals that allowed them to use alt rp's in east of thoreau
ramona
can you ask dennis to look in envision
or pull the official contract file for you and check to see if there are any other amendments
thanks
lindy
tuesday at 0:0 is good for me
just wanted to let you know i had a phone message from nancy mallard
sp
today
her daughter is a bunny
she had a suggestion for the basket
the james avery catalog has some sterling silver charms
for a bracelet or a necklace
that are bugs
a dragon fly
$0.0
a honey bee
$0.0
and a lady bug
$0
i left her a message and told her i thought it sounded like a great idea
i told her we would get back with her after next week
collecting donations
to see if she would like to purchase one to donate for the basket or if she could provide us with the catalog
because i don't receive that one
i've already looked on the internet to see if i could get a look
apparently
there's not a website
fyi
we'll touch-base later
lindy
i can be there
here is the projected subscribed capacity and revenue through 0
this was updated in february
0
please review it to determine all of this info is appropriate to be provided to the rating agencies
most
if not all
of tw's contracts have confidentiality provisions concerning the rates
i'm assuming we have confidentiality agreements with the rating agencies
0 sick day
march 0
looks good to me
should john duschinske and greg porter be listed on the officers for transwestern
i got your message
they just got my phone and computer hooked-up
i'm on 0 now
can you get together tomorrow
how about 0:0
let me know
thanks
lindy
well
i can't meet at 0:0
steve just asked me to attend a
stan restructuring
meeting for him at 0:0
steve's on vacation
i'd say let's reschedule for this afternoon
but i want to wait to see if there's anything we have to do asap from this meeting this afternoon
let me get back with you
we have collected $0 so far
yipee
i see at the bottom of the business plan where tracy has asked for written assumptions for the forecast from you
has this been completed
steve would like to see this by sometime tomorrow morning for his review before our 0:0 meeting
when will we have this
currently
transwestern is considering the transpecos project
a joint venture where transwestern would own a 0% undivided interest in a new pipeline with capacity of 0 mmcf/d accessing mexican markets near the el paso/juarez area
sounds like it's more than just us
shellley would like to meet at 0:0 on monday in her office to discuss transwestern customer accounts
please let me know if you have a conflict with this time
thanks
lindy
here's this message
attached is the list of items and prices
i'll put a check for $0 in amanda's bag today
if i'm there before you
or tomorrow
it might be today if i can arrange to meet rita to drop-off my items to her during lunch
maybe i'll get to see you there dropping-off stuff
i'd love to see everything picked-out
please let me know if you have any questions
thanks
lindy
this is the speadsheet we have been working off of for the 0 model that kevin howard is running
please let me know if you have questions or would like me to summarize this for you in a more useful format for your reference
lindy
