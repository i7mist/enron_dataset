sorry
i have not given you feedback earlier but i've been on vacation
randy continues to do an excellent job
he anticipates questions and usually has the answers
he is a very dedicated employee and continues to expand on his knowledge base
he has helped the traders trade the permian and waha points on a daily basis and such commercial experience has proven to be very valuable regarding looking for alternatives to move gas
the only area for improvement that i might suggest would be to challenge others or state his opinion if he has a different opinion from others rather than not say anything or go along with the status quo
he tends to want to be nonconfrontational which is not a bad thing but this is a tough environment and he could get run over if he does not state his opinion

if burlington and amoco have the right to turn back east end transport-ena would like to be included in that group regarding turning back our havasou transport
us girls have talked about visiting you but just couldn't agree on a date
joe and i just got back from a vacation in banff
canada with jackie and dannie
we had a wonderful time
we did some major hiking there
it was so relaxing
we had no t.v
or phone for a week
we're going to montana over labor day week-end for joe's niece's wedding
can't believe joe and i are taking 0 vacatins this year
regarding logistically getting to your ranch
is it possible to fly into colorado springs or do we need to fly into denver
we would love to come visit you if we can agree on a date because i love to hike
it's not looking good to come visit you this summer
deb is moving into her new house sometime during th end of july and then she promised to take her nieces and nephews on vacation sometime this summer
i think we are going to try for next spring or summer to come visit you if the offer is still open
sorry
i'm sure you are disappointed
however
if something changes
we will let you know
i don't think i do but thanks anyway
i just received the shirts this morning
they are perfect
it's a pleasure doing business with you
when are we going to lunch in your new car
since i do not track actual volume flows
you probably can contact morgan at ext 0
she handles border flows
why are you sending this to me
what am i suppose to do
i don't trade barrels of crude and is the dispute regarding the price of crude on certain days or what
i think this is an old del that fred lagrasta did
below is a summary of the discussions last week regarding the complaint against el paso for oversubscribing the socal topock point
the meeting started out by summarizing the dollar impact of the border cuts to amoco and burlington of $0 million dollars and the additional fuel costs of $0 million that they have incurred when the mainline fuel was reduced and the gathering fuel was increased
accordingly
producers are seeking a minimum of $0 million in compensation in some form or another
the biggest concern is that a total of 0.0 bcf/day is being nominated at the socal topock which can only deliver 0 mmbtu/day
socal gas stated that this problem should go away when there system becomes unbundled
referred to as gatekeeper
the proceeding is currently pending cpuc approval and could be implemented as early as october 0
0
when the gatekeeper is implemented
only 0 mmbtu/day will be accepted at the socal topock border and must match up with the intra-state transport
socal gas suggested taking the 0.0 bcf/day of nominations at the topock delivery point and divide it up based on the original intent of the capapcity
0 to mohave
0 to socal topock
and 0 to pge topock
they also stated they would accept less than 0 at topock but needed a minimum of 0 to meet core needs
however
they wanted some type of compensation if their volume was reduced
they also agreed to live with the status quo until the gatekeeper was implemented
this would result in firm rights being established at socal topock based on downstream rights
williams owns block 0 capacity and is willing to look at a cd reduction or a reduced take requirement or use of alternate points with a rate adjustment
after much discussion
el paso came back with the following counter proposal
recommended interim solution until socal gatekeeper implemented
does not relate to receipt point rights
0
block 0 capacity will always be alternate to socal topock
0
0
block ii capacity can not be sold at pge topock
0
0
amoco and oneok each have a contract 0/d which can go to topock or ehrenberg
it is recommended that they give up their ehrenberg right and keep topock right and socal will give up like amount at topock as well as shift an additional 0 mmbtu/day from topock to ehrenberg resulting in approx
0 being shifted to ehrenberg
0
rights fro expansion shippers would be carved up as follows
0
socal topock would now be divided as follows
expansion shippers 0 el paso merchant
0-wlliams
total 0 0 divided by 0 would result in 0 percent cuts or 0 percent thruput
the producers were not happy with having to live with 0 percent cuts and felt that any transport sold after their sept 0 complaint should be cut off the top which would be el paso merchant services blk 0
separate meetings were then held amongst the topock shippers to duscuss el paso's counter
proposal
producer group came back and told el paso that they want the 0 percent thruput increased
will accept cd reduction
rate design change or other forms of compensation
for the recommended volumes moved to mohave/pge topock
they would consider a 0 percent reduction in cd demand as well as converting that path to a 0 volumetric rate
in other words
if the producers used the delivery point
they would pay max rate
if they did not
they would not pay anything
block 0 shippers would agree to reduce deliveries to socal topock if their deals were converted to an agreed upon load factor-maybe 0 percent
for volumes shifted to non-socal points
they also want a 0 percent volumetric rate
bottom-line is how much dollars is el paso willing to pay to resolve this case
each party is requested to submit a proposal to el paso and they will study its entirety
no follow-up meeting was scheduled
another topic that was also being discussed at the meeting was the perceived gaming on the system by the full-requirements customers-ie nominating more gas than they need in anticipation of cuts
it is thought that if this could be controlled there may be more certainty in the san juan regarding flows
el paso recommended the following
limit noms on cycle 0 from san juan based on previous day's total nom from all basins
no limits on cycle 0-0
this caused some concerns because of week-end load swings andfluctuatingpower-plant loads
however
eoc's were willing to establish a technical committee to work on a formula if thesocal topock point gets resolved
regarding pooling
el paso is proposing to add 0 additional pools in the keystone and 0 additonal pools in the san juan and 0 additional pool in the bondad
this process is in its early stages of conflict
most people

if it is not too late i would like to put on hold my request to add barrett resources to the eol product for el paso blanco average
i made the request yesterday so hopefully i am not toolate
upon discussing the product with barrett

hope you have a great day and it was great seeing you
yes we are going
this afternoon-any time
how come it doesn't work on my eol machine
southwest gas currently views enron online but is afraid to transact physical volumes on it because they are afraid the payment terms on enron online are different than non-eol trades
they stated that they reveiwed the eol contract and that it does not address payment
i told them that the payment terms do not differ but they are asking for something in writing
can you send them something
the sound card does not work on my eol machine-it works on the keyboard supporting eol which is opposite of what i want
i want the screen to ding every time someone trades on eol
i don't want to listen to my self type in deals on the keyboard
my enron computer system works fine right now
if you could handle getting the eol problem fixed i would appreciate it
please add me to the critical notices for transwestern and el paso pipeline
s
as soon as possible
if you have any questions
please call me at 0
no-i wanted my machine to make a sound every time someone traded on eol but instead it's hooked up to my keyboard so that when i type the keyboard makes sounds instead
email address is jane.m.tholt@enron.com pager is 0 i trade the west desk
we are trying to think of something nice to send to patti to show her our appreciation for her hard work
i was thinking of a gift basket from specs with some nice wine
can you tell me what kind of wine she likes or suggest another alternative for a gift that she may enjoy
thanks
i do not track volumes but i will forward this to our scheduling group-patti sullivan
please give me any concerns you have with this by the end if the day-otherwise i am recommending adopting this proposal
please give us the names of the wines she likes when you have time
looks good to me
thanks
this is a joke
i am getting your critical notices but when i click on it
i can't get access to what it says
is this a problem on your side or on my side
you're not going to believe this
i talked to amoco and they confirmed that i did the deal with them but they said thawe should just pay agave energy because tit's a complicated internal deal
so we are both right
i only wished amoco would have told me ahead of time
bottom line
pay agave energy and not amoco
norm was somewhat prophetic when he kept talking about the
big hole in his pipe
that was going to occur if we went to rankings-little did he know-can't blame this one on rankings
this is o.k as long as we get a daily estimate of usage around 0:0 c.t
and access to actuals within two business days
do we need to carify the max daily quantity on which the demand charge is assessed reflects usage and not nominations
just don't want to be in a position where we must do make-up and have to nom more than 0
i will let joe know that you received his care package
he will be very happy
when i get my pictures developed
i'll send you any good ones that may have turned out
it's o.k
to give julie my e-mail address
i would love to communicate with her
take care
this was an eol deal and eol only trades in increments of 0 so zarin is not correct per our records
are you talking actual flows or what was nominated
need to narrow down timing of their notification-sounds like they can call us one day prior to noms due-that's too late to try to manage financially
that works

re
europe
there are several hotels in london which are listed as giving enron corporate rates
prices range from $0 to 0
the ritz is $0
i show no discounts for hotels in paris
what do you think about this strategy
maybe we should have deb call marion and review the list of hotels where enron has a corporate rate and ask her opinion regarding which ones she would recommend
maybe
at that point she would volunteer her flat
thanks for the information
joe got a chuckle last night when i told him that you tried his ketchup trick

friday was so perfect
it snowed huge snow flakes
accumulation was just about 0/0 inch
the temperature was about 0 degrees and it wasn't windy-so it was just a great day to walk the streets and take in all the snow
it just felt like christmas
we took a carriage ride around central park and they dropped us off at tavern on the green for lunch
met one of my contacts at prebon for lunch and he paid for it
good thing because we were drinking mimosas at $0.0 a pop
we saw two great plays-aida and the lion king
excellent
actually
aida may be the best broadway play i have ever seen
the music was awesome
lion king had great special effects with all of the costumes
the people were dressed like animals and it was really cool
prebon got us tickets for that too-first row-center section-mezz
level
in other words-perfect seats
on saturday
we mostly shopped during the day
deb bought herself a new david yurman diamond ring and red leathe coat

we went to fao schwartz early-0:0 a.m.-and at 0:0 the line was clear around the building to get in
the large department stores were like that too-hoards of people
you could hardly walk down 0th avenue
it was so crowded
i have never seen so many mink coats in my life
everyone had one on
the hotel we stayed at was excellent
it didn't have the view you did
nothing will ever match that
but all three of us stayed in one room and the room was huge and nicely decorated
all three of us were able to get ready in a span of one hour
we ate at some good restaurants too
the first night was this small italian restaurant
very authentic
they took good care of us
the second night was thai-food was excellent
the third day was french
yum yum
we got out of town just in time
we really lucked out
i would go back agai n if the right opportunity came up
pnm is incorrect
the price is $0.0
tell them that this deal is for west texas pool gas and that we never sell west texas pool gas based on a san juan gas daily
pnm is incorrect
the price is 0.0
tell them that the location of the gas is west texas pool and that we never sell gas in the west texas pool based on a san juan gas daily price
once you tell them that they will realize that they are wrong
whoever wrote this did an excellent job
i show the fixed price of $0.0.switched to gda on the 0th
it is 0.0
joe just told me the other day that he got the check
i never saw it
it came when i was out of town

thank you
congratulations
thank you
i am still waiting for this to be instaled
what's the hold-up
call me when you can make room for me in your schedule
no equipment was installed
it is under my desk waiting for arms to be installed above my other monitor
what is the status of getting these arms
price on the 0th was 0.0 i don't understand the trigger question
we need to get the back-up on the penalty
patti needs to give you info regarding a penalty we wanto tocharge them for february
please get with her ondetails
triggers are based upon scheduled volume-they are not going to agree-i know
i'm not sure what contract this falls under
our contract says that if buyer does not schedule then buyer will pay replacement price differential plus $.0
rpalcement price differnetial would be gas daily which was around 0.0 on that day
this was a regular 0 day deal
yes
if that's what the contract says
this is not going to get resolved
they disagree with our view and are not going to pay on scheduled volumes
however
we are not going back off our view and will continue to bill based on scheduled volumes
gas daily plus $.0-make sure legal approves
i got the pictures
he is precious
i can see why you are so happy and want to stay home with him
i want the penalty billed and let them challenge it
i wanted to share with you the growth in gas demand for electric generation over the past cuple of years in california
maybe i can make a believer out of you
res
elec
other total also just wanted to thank you for being so honest with me the other day
i know it was difficult and i am sorry that i never made it easy on you to express your true thoughts

can you send them a firm contract because we i don't think we are going to do business with them unless they sign it
do we have a gisb contract with them
whichever one is active-scana energy-too many choices to pick from-counterparty list needs to be cleaned up
go ahead and change it
need to know if what they say is true on there protest to invoice
do we only have an interruptible contract with them
are you set up on aol instant messenger
i got my new computer at home from enron and i use that to talk back and forth with some of my freinds

you and joe could talk on it all night long
cindy needed the money to pay for her new fully furnished house in the woodlands
not to mention the 0 acres she just bought across the road from her house in aspen
i only need enough to pay off my measley mortgage
i have cashed in on most of my options though
gics are negotiated
this is an old deal that was done in fred lagrosta'group-think it is a btu swap
misplaced the cover sheet but they basically said that the baseload deal fell under an interruptilbe contract and was not subject ot damanges
laurie ellis has a copy
both deals were done at gda
do not pay
i also want to bill them for penalties for non-performance at pge topock on february 0
i'm assuming you are referring to the penalty invoice at the california border
that was a 0 day firm deal
there is no gic associated with that deal
aol adress at home is jtholt0@aol.com
we are going to buy a camera-i'll let you know when we get it
joe is going to deliver some of grady's cars to his new house

don't we have a gisb sontract with them that this would fall under
thank you for the inof town guests in
vitation but i have out
thank you-that was sweet
i show 0.0
take that back price is 0.0
why can't we use their contract to bill penalties
do not pay penalty
i want to penalize them for the volumes they are not taking on the trigger deal
i know they are not going to pay but i still want to bill them anyway
so

been pretty busy these last couple of weeks
couple of weeks ago i had to go to los angeles on short notice
accordingly
paid full price and got in first class
it must have been a new plane because the first class section was huge
i sat in a chair that was like a lazy boy chair-it had a fott recline and everything
also had my own pop up tv and could watch my choice of 0 movies
it was truly awesome
can't believe what a small world it is
went to lobby to get somebreakfast and patrick brown was there-ended up having breakfast with him and some ohter sempra folks.then i had to go to vegas a couple of weeks ago
stayed at the new alladin hotel
they upgraded me to a suite
another great experience
bathroom was huge
big marble shower and a big tub that overlooked the skyline
bedroom area and sitting area were nice too
shame i was only there one night
last week was gas fair
lots of lunches and dinners
there are a lot of new restaurants downtown that we tried out
yum-yum
the weather was perfect
cheri and i went to the spa and had a relaxing afternoon on the last day
she looks great
she said you saw her picture of matthew
he's a cutie
parks was a t dinner one night-he hasn't changed-still nice as ever
had a lot of fun with frank fields too
he hasn't changed a bit
david livingston was there
he works for cinergy but is doing east coast stuff-thank god
our retail group just hired joe deschamps and chris shireman-remember them
i bet joe won't be there by the end of the year-i think he just wanted someone to pay for his way back to houston
just found out that bob shiring went to work for pan canadian doing east coast stuff
joe's brother was in town this week-end from montana
he picked him up in san antonio so we had them all week-end
went down to kemah to watch the boats
we went there with griff that one time
boy has it changed
tons more stuff to do
especially for the kids
i'm just sick over my tax bill this year
i exercised a ton of my options-and boy am i paying for it
i was planning on maybe paying $0 but i am having to pay $0
will probably be that way next year too
just sucks that the government takes so much
i know i'm probably not getting much sympathy from you but i can try
can't believe there was another shooting in your area last week
bet you are glad your kids are almost out of school
can't understand how these kids have access to all of these guns
it's scary
deb and i had lunch with julia
she's gone from enron now
she did not give us any more details about her marriage other than she got married out of town and in am place that made it difficult to track marriage l icense
her family still does not know she is married
she is being really strange about this whole thing
she qwon't acknowledge to anyone that she is married
i've given up on her
she is almost as strange as you at times
luckily i have not given up on you
going to grand cayman islands on thursday-plan on feeding the stingrays on friday-will tell you all about it
tell me why you are too busy to fill me in on what is happenign in your life
frott recline is really a foot recline and thanks for keeping me up to date with the happenings in your life

why can't you find them in sitara
what is the term of the deal and we need to address different weekend volumes
i don't need an entire table but will share

believe it or not
i have booked my trip to london and paris
i am coming out there around october 0 with my freind deb and her freind christie
we are staying at mark frevert's flat
hopefully
we can get together for lunch or dinner during that time
i'll get back to you in a couple of months wonce i know more about our plans
you may want to call keith holst to get an update for the winter prices-they have really fallen in the last couple of days
sounds good to me as long as i have my own bathroon at the hotel in paris
why does the description for the double include a shower
does that mean that single rooms only have a bath tub
can we imbalance trade this gas
what happens when the cogen burns the gas without telling us like they have been doing
which desk keeps the 0 demand charge
does the gas desk keep the demand charge
also
we need to discuss-if you forget tocall
if you forget to call
the price between the gas and power desk needs to be negotiated
probably not a big deal in the summer but is a huge del in the winter with daily balancing
also
the gas desk will not be responsible for any imbalance penalties if you forget tocall
if you forget tocall in the winter under daily balancing
your desk will be charged my cost
otherwise
i think it's a go
we had a great time
let me know when you are not too busy to have lunch with the little people
you are the one that always cancels-remember
i do not show a deal for this
does our scheduilng group show volume for it
the deal number is 0-why can't you see this
actually-upon second look the deal number is 0-why can't you see this
should be non bondad
actually
for volumes flowing out of bondad-which is deal number 0 price is bondad gda
for blanco-deal number 0-price is nonbondad gda
i talked with markat sw gas-just honro his numbers
i have not had the patience to get it working-i will callyou some evening and we can walk thru it
how was your trip to des moines
did dthat stuff form joe help your car
she is having physical therapy 0 times a week and she says it's getting better
i haven't seen her for acouple of weeks so i don't know for sure
hey-i will be calling you next week-the desk wants me to become more involved in regulatory updates so i will be calling you for your assistance
yes i am going
i will also need toknow if there are signigicant items going to be considered at the weekly ferc meeting and what items are being considered on consent agenda
we want to know ahead of item which itmes are being ruled on
at he el paso technical conference
one of the ferc staff guys said that full requirements is dead
there is an awfull lot of pressure being put on el paso at the meeting to path their system
the full requirements customers have to submit to el paso 0 different load profiles-becky has the details
it sounds
though
that full requirements may be addressed in the proceeding
however
that does not mean that any transport will open up to arizona
the conference call was a nonevent
i guess we are trying to find out how socal calculates its wacog
so we want to put pressure on them to get details
we want to put pressure on all of the state commisiions to allow ldc to hedge and not be punished for it
youare doing a good job keeping us up to date
thank you
mike grigsby agrees that we should join complaint
don't forget-they could ask for any cd turnback as well to minimize expansion requirements we will turn back blk 0 if given chance
becky
i don't thin we should rely on displacement to serve the needs of the full requirements because i t may cause me to flow gas that may be uneconomical
i made a minor correction
if there is anything you may need from the cash desk that could be of assistnace
please let me know and i will ty to help
looks like accounting is going to have to give you most of the info for compliance
attached are the non-binding receipt point allocations for the existing firm agreements for enron north america
please call me at0-0-0 if you have any questions
i show 0.0 but since this is a buy and would be in our favor-go ahead and honor thier price
customer is correct
i changed the deal in sitara
becky-we can just intervene as an interested party-no ax to grind
i have received a new book name and id so i am no longer using that book name or id
ok to book
thank you
we'll do anything to try to make a buck
can you provide the west desk with an update on the socal storage projects-socal montebello salvage project
alsio canyon and lo goleta cushion gas projects would like to have something by this afternoon if possible
thank you for the update

i hope that one or both of you can attend via conference call or in person
i will try to remember to call you on the day of the meeting to see if you want to attend or to advise you of any change in plans
thanks again
no
the more the merrier
just need to get her phonenumber so we can hook her up
by the way i talked on the qt to the socal gas trader and told him that i could not fathom that they would even consider 0 receipts points
he said rob davis is clueless and currently is on a power trip
they are going to meet with him next week to make sure that he understands that he works for them and not the other way around
that's up to you
stephanie and i are going
have not seen agenda
i am deferring t this to you but i don't see any reason we would have any problem with this either
thank you for handling this
ii think you should just call her and tell her that you are an interested party in the proceeding and would like to attend
shw willnot have aproblem
at our last meeting
you aid that you had informationregardin gsouthwest gas
load profile
could you send it to me
are you referring to los angeles water and power
no one in the houston gas side makes any sales-however you need to check with the portland office-try calling chris foster
call 0-0-0
as of 0:0 a.m
joe is in wichita
did you talk to him
i have to take care of my baby
looks good
aslo we ar still on for our meeting on thursday at 0:0
is leslie coming
that's right
feed him milk
not beer
where did you sleep l ast night
by theway
brad does not want the couch
phone number is 0-0-0
what number should i try to call you at if we have trouble connencting
can you give me an idea of the locations for the gas
i was only trading blanco at the time
the 0.0 price looks like it's at a different location
we aslo want to add the california delivery points as receipts points with a potential interruptible back-haul rate to the eoc delivery points
i was thinking that may be we should ask el paso to furnish aver
daily volumes that were scheduled as receipts into el paso
system from the proposed 0 pools from jan 0
aug 0 of this year to get an indication of whether there is any gas behind these pools
what do you think
let's ask for it by month
in talking to socal gas
they suggested that we ask the question and explain why we are asking so that the ferc staff understnads why
should we ask the question and then say that this information is needed to determine if actual supplies exist behind the proposed pools since the allocations are being made based on design capapcity and not actual gas
they should be able to track by each of the meter numbers of the individual points that make up the pools
i think they are going to make upsome excuse not top provide data because it's going t oshow that gas was not received into their system
why is it taking almost 0 years to verify this price
i do not have my records back that far
looks good-thank you
feel free to add any others you think might be helpful
should we ask
absent periods of maintenance,how many times contraints exsited within these pools upstream of cornudas and window rocks
iihave forwarded your request to kim ward 0-0-0
becky call me on this
i want them to know that we are willing to turn back the capapcity and put in the numbers and they can share the numbers
we just don't want them to name enron
she does origination on the desk
ok
good
thanks
when you have time
can you get me the phone number of mark frevert's flat in london and the name and phone number of the hotel in paris that we will be staying

a visit to santa fe when you come to houston
check out the website for the bishop's lodge in santa fe
www.bishopslodge.com
some friends of mine bought a weekend there at a silent auction at a charity event recently and their brochure looked great
the website has pictures
prices
activities at the resort
and a hyperlink to the website for the santa fe chamber of commerce which lists the activities going on in santa fe
i think you are going to be too late for their summer opera series
but i took a look and there appears to be other fun things going on
the website for the lodge shows a fabulous looking pool
horseback riding and shooting
take a look
that power shortage friday cut us off in the middle of our conversation about the appropriate tax language to use for a confirmation evidencing a trade between teeside power financing limited and rmt
i have attached the proposed form of confirmation
i have combined in it the usual tax language we have in rmt confirmations along with the language we use in a cross-border trade between a delaware corporation
usually ect
now rmt
and company
teeside power
located in a treaty country acting exclusively through non-u.s
branches
england
please let me know if the tax language meets with your approval
rod
nella sent me a compliance certificate and financial statements for the referenced counterparty
i am forwarding them down to you
i sent the ubs letter to the confirm desk like a week ago
i forget who to
maybe bernice
since i kinda consider it an audit letter
my note said the confirm desk can sign off on the letter since they were only asking us to confirm trade information
the teeside confirm
i spoke to our tax guys this morning and they said they were really busy yesterday and hadn't had a chance to look at it
i'll call them again
have you had a chance to look at that confirm language yet
the trade was done a few days ago
and the clock is ticking on how long we can get a confirm out before we get in trouble
what's the scoop
can't come up with ten top 0's
i never thought i'd see the day
linda and i had a good visit sunday for about six hours
we had a nice lunch at an outdoor cafe
went shopping in the village
and then went back to my house for a chat
linda had pictures of jenny
she is a beautiful 0 year old
blond like linda but with tim's dark eyes and full eyebrows
she was voted the #0 girl in an underground survey done by the boys in her class
and linda was a little concerned about that because jenny is a little developed for her age group and she's afraid the boys interest is a little prurient
her marriage is going well despite steve's current unemployed status
but she is doing well in her job
they moved into a bigger house and tim bought her old one
and all in all is at a very good place in her life
i'm getting ready to leave for new orleans tomorrow for our legal conference
we have dinner reservations at emeril's for 0:0 tomorrow night and we're all a bit excited about that
then thursday night is our big night out at a blues club
this email was a good idea
linda got my address and i hope to be chatting with her more than every two years
i'll be in touch when i get back
all my love
per my voicemail
the attached confirm is still a moving target with the tax lawyers
i'll be in touch once we resolve the tax language
i'll be leaving for new orleans in about 0 minutes for our legal conference
it was fun visiting with you too
i miss you terribly
jeff hodge is your man

debbie brackett says she knows what agreement you're talking about
i'll keep you posted
just to keep you in the loop on things
lee sent me the following email and i'm following up trying to figure this out
i spoke to debbie brackett in our credit dept
when i got back from london and she seemed to be aware of the contract lee has been talking about
i'm trying to get a copy of the agreement from debbie so i can figure this out
i'll keep you posted
how are things going there
same old grind
in don't know anything about this
do you
as some of you may be aware
there have been substantial revisions to the u.s
tax code which will require revising the tax language in our swap agreements
i will be providing steve douglas in the tax dept
copies of the current tax language in our swap agreements and will coordinate with him revisions to the forms
i'll keep you posted when the changes occur
mark taylor is going the be the host of the next ect legal conference to be held in the woodlands in october and he asked me to contact you to see if you know yet which of the brits are going to be attending because we need to start making reservations

thanks

he expects 0-0
i think we should order 0 mens shirts in large
so i don't think you need to email him or michael brown
thanks for your help
you are right
they need to get the date on their calendars
and pass it on to anyone they might think is coming
just wanted to let you know i faxed the omnet agreement over to susan gill today about 0:0 pm our time
i have the originals and asked her to tell me what address she wants me to send the originals to
i didn't date the front page of the agreement because i didn't know what date you wanted them to be effective so i'll leave that to y'all to work out
i'm working on getting the other documents signed and i guess i can get them all out in the same package
maybe tomorrow
i'll visit with you tomorrow about what to do
just wanted to check on how the financials are going
my goal is to get everything ready no later than the first week of june so i can problem solve before i have to file by june 0th
when the financials are ready i need to get them certified by the highest accounting officer
last year that was drew lynch who signed as vice president
business analysis and reporting
will he be signing again
one personal day this monday

i'm sure there would be no problem with you copying our master swap agreement database and using it for your contract applications
it is my hope to use it for all the ect trading groups
the power group has already copies it
i spoke to london about copying it for their other trading groups
and i have shown it to other groups
from global contracts to ees
all you would need to do is change the contract drop downs
contact mike neves
who is working on this database for us
and either he
or someone else can be assigned to developing a similar system for you
i am faxing you both the master firm purchase/sale agreement executed between enron gas marketing
merged now into ect
and aquila energy marketing corporation
merged now into utilicorp
with respect to utilicorp
signing
the agreement in lieu of giving a guaranty
actually what utilicorp
did in this agreement is sign as a co-obligor under the agreement
see section 0.0 of the agreement
they signed accepting joint and several liability with respect to the obligations
if we can get them to agree to the same language in your master agreement that would effectively be as good or better than getting a guaranty
anything less
like just sticking their
name
on the signature line
may not get us much or be worthless
all this
of course
is subject to any differences between us and uk law or issues under uk law which i will leave in edmund's capable hands
let me know if i can be of further service
per bill's email
i faxed a proposed form of enron corp
guaranty to the counterparty
please do not approve any trades with this counterparty until due diligence is done on italian law
which appears the be the place of incorporation of the counterparty
i will not assign the review of italian law to an attorney until we receive your credit worksheet
if you feel we need to proceed with this now let me know and i will get someone to start looking at it
scott
one of our crude oil traders passed on the attached resume of one of his friends and asked if we could take a look at it
i gave it to mark taylor and since the fellow lives in england he thought it would be better sent to you
that may not be so easy an answer
i think we would have to talk to utilicorp.'s lawyers
i wouldn't be surprised that they had some policy or laws that won't allow them to guaranty the obligations of other companies
utilities in the u.s
are odd birds
there are a lot of chinese walls in effect with them
i've dealt with similar issues on other utilities
if you need us to talk to them get me the name and phone number of a contact and we'll give them a call
thanks for taking a look
that's ok
our trading policy doesn't allow you to trade anything we trade
just an fyi about a year ago kellie metcalf had me send a sample isda master to the referenced counterparty
she has now left ect to go with azurix
i got a call from the counterparty wanting to get some bids on some options and kellie said to pass the trade down to john suarez
i called john and gave him the scoop and also told him we did not have a master in place and to treat this like any other counterparty
i.e
contact credit for approvals before trading
etc
i just wanted to give you a head's up
in case we get the trade
we're not surprised
i don't have anything specific to weather
i have material from recent general seminars i've worked on for mark t
and mark h
if you need it
i do have general articles on weather
i'm glad to see they have the
a team
as a speaker
you're marvelous

i am trying to track down the dealmaker on a deal in argentina with duke energy international
all i know is that duke is trying to get a waiver from us on the confidentiality provision in the master swap agreement so they can use it on the argentina deal
credit doesn't appear to know anything about the deal
i'm don't even know if it is an ei or an ect deal
it may be ei because he mentioned the financing of a generator
i don't want to waive anything until i track the business guy down
can you ask around and let me know
thanks
the icon worked and i've pulled it up and can use it
thanks for your help
how's things going there
are you getting excited about going back home
have they started to think about hiring anyone to replace you
everything cool on the roommate front
in response to your email
yes
our confidentiality language was so limited that it did not allow us to provide the agreement to affiliates of either party without consent
we revised the form about 0 months ago to broaden the langage to include affiliates
but duke is an old master so they need our consent so they can provide it to their affiliate
unless federico has any reason not to waive the language
i think we can go ahead
draft a waiver up here and send it to duke
can you talk to federico asap and run that by him and let me know so i can get this over to duke
thanks
pat
remember a few days ago i was trying to track down this argentina power deal with duke
you might want to get in touch with federico
mark
fyi
also
i don't know if there are any problems with power out of argentina
pat
this waiver has to deal with a provision in the ect master swap agreement that requires that the agreement and its contents be kept confidential
except to certain people like auditors
it did not allow the agreement to be provided to affiliates
duke wants to copy the terms of the master agreement in has in place with ect and use it for this duke energy international that is doing the deal down in argentina
duke energy cannot even provide duke energy international with a copy of this agreement unless it gets ect's permission to give them a copy of the agreement
that it what i am trying to resolve
whether there is any business reason why we would not want to give duke energy international the right to look at that agreement
your issue
obviously
is what business federico is doing
my issue is more of a documentation/legal issue
i did see the ipi presentation and was pretty impressed
the presentation was
obviously
more directed to the confirmation process
but i thought it could also help in the creation and management of master swap agreements and swap agreement form templates
i need to talk to our confirm desk people to see what issues of concern they had in the confirm process that they were hoping this system could address
they had one concept for form generation i think is central for the creation of confirmations and agreements
the concept was this
data dictionary
it made it all clear to me
i spoke to them about the different areas of concern in my database asked them to prepare another presentation more focused on those issues and come back to us before i leave for europe in june
it appears susan bailey still can not get in and edit the master swap agreement database
she now has the icon
but no edit priviliges
can you please get her access
much thanks
attached is annex b
just tell them they need to fill in blanks in guaranty
attached is a sample isda schedule
please remember to attach the preprinted form of isda agreement
let me know if you have any questions
thanks for the update
i still do not appear to be getting copies of all credit worksheets
please remember to keep me on this distribution
so you'll be doing name changes/mergers in the future
not susan
you are a star
just a reminder that i'm going to be in a little late tomorrow
i'm going over to the old tcb bank bldg
at 0:0am to sign my loan papers
ect has a policy that prohibits employees from trading in any commodities that ect trades
please make sure any future trading you may do complies with this policy
thank you
john
it's good to hear from you
a few things on your paralegal friend
first
we don't currently have any openings
though we have tended to hire paralegals with a lot of experience
most of the paralegals in our group have about 0-0 years experience
also
we recently hired someone
and i don't anticipate us hiring for awhile
most of enron's litigation work is done out of enron corp
they do have a big litigation group up there
and that would be the most obvious place to start
chuck cheek is the head lawyer for that group
you could forward her resume up there with a note
it might get it more personal attention
also
keep watching
or she can watch
it online
the job bank
they advertise paralegal jobs there from time to time with all the enron companies
another group that might be interested in hiring paralegals
and might hire paralegals with less experience
is the global contracts group headed up by mary solmonson
they're always looking for people
and it might be a good way for your friend to get her foot in the door at ect
also
if her undergraduate degree was in business
obviously
she might have some more options in other groups
as far as running goes
i'm trying to get back into shape
i'm just surviving 0 miles around the park
and this weekend i plan to double my mileage to 0
it sounds like we're both not in fighting form
but i do want to start training in july with houston fit for the houston marathon again
we have received the above executed isda master agreements
multicurrency-cross border
with the two referenced counterparties executed 0/0/0
effective as of 0/0/0
copies will be distributed
i have also received in the originally signed confirmations and will be sending them down to laurel adams
per our conversation
thanks for your help
i'm trying to track down that presentation for you
i need the directory information
as soon as i get it i'll have it emailed to you
hope you're staying out of trouble
i will pass on your
hello
to the rest of the group
of course we don't forget one of our favorite credit guys
thanks for your help
this is from mark taylor's presentation he gave for mark haedicke at the isda energy seminar in houston earlier this year
i know elizabeth sager did a presentation last month for mark h
he gave to some power group in d.c
also
mark t
is currently working on one for bandwith trading for tom gros
checking your mail
a confidentiality agreement came in from greg bruch
i gave him a call to see what his timing was
he said ite wasn't urgent
but if we could get an attorney looking at it
to get it final maybe next week
it is counterparty's form
they would be the disclosing party
for a potential fiber source deal
i am going to pass the agreement on to carol for review
and will leave you a copy
working late
huh
it appears that you are signed up for this class
and the confirmation and approval should go to you
scott
remember that you will be charged if you do not cancel if you are not going to go
and the charge for canceling is pretty high
about $0
there is no charge if you attend
also
let me know if you don't get the proper approval forms
gracie
thanks for your help
your message about the canadian forms inspired me to visit with mark
we were in the middle of updating the canadian forms
and mark just gave me a few final changes
and as soon as i make those i'll email them up to you
actually we have two canadian forms
the isda and the
industrial
you've received the whole thing
mark t
likes to ad lib a lot when he gives a presentation
thanks for your email
i don't want to state the obvious because you appear to already be in compliance
but just as a precaution
i want to make sure you are aware the ect has a policy which prohibits it employees/traders from trading in anything the company trades in
any trading you do for your own account must comply with this policy
fyi
however
we need 0 file drawer files
what do you think
as a follow-up to our conversation in london when you said i should bring to your attention any concerns i might have with financial trading issues
the following has recently come up as an issue here in houston
and does so from time to time
we will
in fact
be discussing it at our group meeting next week
i spoke to edmund about it when i was there in london
but in light of the recent canadian form problems and the resulting concerns of mark haedicke with the integrity of our forms
i thought i should bring this your attention
one of our continuing concerns on the financial trading side is that every financial trading lawyer/paralegal work from the centrally approved forms
the houston forms are currently located in a
read-only
directory
we need to be careful that users copy the forms out of the directory each time they use the form
copying the form into a personal directory for ease of use creates issues with people working from outdated base forms
or having forms evolve without approval
another way forms get changed without going through the approval process is when an attorney tells the paralegals to make a change in every swap agreement they approve
it counts as a form change
not a negotiation change
if you make it in every agreement
ultimately our goal is to centralize the forms in a database easily accessible to all of us on a global basis
this is a central and critical component of the fishkin project
thanks for your attention to this
you are the woman
i have received the executed first amendment to isda master agreement dated as of may 0
0
this amendment deletes the prior confidentiality provision in the isda master agreement and replaces it with our current confidentiality language
this change will allow either party to provide copies of the agreement to its affiliates
copies will be distributed
i spoke to mark taylor today and he said that he spoke this week with a lawyer from
i believe skadden
that had been hired by the omlx to talk to ed&f mann about the cftc issue
i think mark taylor is waiting to hear back from the skadden lawyer
the legal/credit meeting scheduled for today is canceled due to the absence of susan flynn
i'll pass on any other articles on the transportation industry that might be in our various derivatives magazines
glad you liked this one
we have received the executed isda master agreement
multicurrency-cross border
executed 0/0/0
effective as of 0/0/0
copies will be distributed
we also received the originally executed confirmation
deal # em0.0,0
0
i will sent it down to the confirmation desk
it appears this class is on a sunday
a monday
did i get this right
brenda whitehead prepared that presentation and should be sending it to you
gracie
my confirmation of the class showed the 0/0 and 0/0
you may want to go in and check your schedule
we have some files in an empty cubicle that kinda look like global contract files
they have global contract sheets and numbers attached to the front of the documents in the files
if they belong to anyone in your group they need to be claimed now
because we are doing a cubicle restructuring this weekend and those files will be moved and if unclaimed eventually gotten rid of
can you have someone come
why does it always have to be my deals
yeah
actually
bluebonnets bloom for a short time
maybe three week early in the houston spring
in march
after heavy spring rains have gone on for a bit
and when the temperature is in the 0's to 0's
they would get fried and fade in the heat of a houston summer
however
i don't know the temperatures and rain condition of your summers
and what time of your year would replicate those conditions
i'm working on the merrill/belco assignment of trades with
i guess
sara
mark taylor signed off yesterday on the assignment that appears to again have been executed by fred without legal's initials
it appears the date fred signed it is about the time mark taylor talked to him about not signing contractual documents without legal's initials
there appears to be two differences in the redone confirms merrill sent us
0
they added a fallback reference price
and
0
they have changed the settlement and/or payment dates in the confirms
bernice said sara signed off on a similar fallback reference price in some confirms she had previously done with merrill
so i briefly discussed this with sara before she had to leave for lunch
we'll look at it some more after lunch
on the change in the settlement/payment dates
i told bernice they were changing the deal and she needed the business guy on the transactions to sign off on that change
she was going to take the confirms to fred and get him to sign off that that is what he's agreed to
now
if sara doesn't know anything about the additional fallback reference price
we'll obviously have to take that back to the dealmaker to sign off on too
are you also working on this
so that's what's going on
now might be your time to plant
i'm already miserable with the houston summer heat
it's already in the high 0's with high 0 humidity
after 0-0 more months of this it's going to get pretty old
how's little sophie
any new cute things she's doing you need to tell me about
i have been given the name of your company by a consultant we have hired to advise us on sofware systems to manage our physical and financial confirmation process and isda master agreements
i have also seen information on your company in the january 0 issue of risk magazine
i am a senior legal specialist in the legal dept
and am looking at software systems that can help us manage our documentation needs
if you are unfamiliar with our company
enron is the largest integrated marketer of energy in the united states
we have a web page located at www.enron.com
enron capital
trade resources corp
is the marketing affiliate of our parent
enron corp
i would like to obtain marketing material about the services you provide
and after i have a chance to look at the information
would like to talk to you or a representative from you company in some depth
i am located in houston
texas and my phone number is
0
0-0
thank your for your attention herewith
thank you for your help
i look forward to hearing from your u.s
person
mark said you would know who it is in london that prepared a
script
for your traders on what to say on the phone when transacting a deal
liz sager is working on some training mid-next week for the power desk traders and needs to prepare a similar script for them
if you could let me know who to contact i'd appreciate it
thanks for your help
you be the man
can you email or fax the trader guidelines scott is talking about
much thanks
what ever happened to that cgas certificate we were trying to get in connection with my swap agreement
last note i had was that resolution we were trying to get requires approval of board for each trade and you were going to talk to mark about how to resolve this

oops

when i went to file away my file on the cftc form 0
i noticed i already had a file in the regulatory cabinet where where had filed the form in 0 and 0

i'd love to go to lunch
i'm going to put in on my calendar to call you when i get back so we don't forget until the next time we see each other
i printed out the referenced list that you sent me
but it has some information on it that i don't think we necessarily want to show the nymex
specifically
your last two columns that show
cmbtaxtype
and
tg/active
is there any way you can reprint the list only showing the name of the corporation and the place of incorporation
thanks
here's an updated confirm on saga
bernice is awaiting your approval
there was a big computer virus spreading a few hours ago and we all had to totally shut down our computers
supposedly this virus was all over the world
maybe we'll hear about it on the news
i have a meeting set up with ipi next week to demonstrate their system to our global contracts team leader
the confirm desk financial trading head
and also mark taylor
right now i'm working on a summary listing what i think our system issues are
i've traded phone calls with documentum
i'm actually trying to get this summary done
so i can send it to them to show them what areas we may be looking for help in so they can focus their presentation on our specific needs
i've looked at your material for micro modeling
i will be contacting them next
i've got our third paralegal trained
and she's getting up to speed
so i'm getting down to the last contracts i'm trying to resolve
i have another big project that ends this coming wednesday
thursday i leave for germany for vacation for two weeks
and i hope when i get back to devote my somewhat full time to this project finally
so that's my story
how are you
bob mcinosh from rock-tenn called yesterday
and they did a trade with us and owe us money and he doesn't know where to send it
his phone no
is
0
0-0
fax
0
0-0
if someone could contact him with our wire transfer instructions
it will probably be in the confirm you send him
are we having your group meeting today
inquiring minds want to know
i didn't havw any time off
melissa
i still need to return the prior pg&e guarantees referenced below to the counterparty
were you having them pulled
just wanted to drop you a note before i leave for germany tomorrow
i'm looking forward to the cooler weather
i got some good bargains on post winter sweaters this weekend because no one in houston is even thinking about buying a sweater
i spent more money on clothes than i ever have at one sitting
my backyard is really looking good
it's almost all planted
maybe 0% done
i've planted a few new trees
a japanese red maple
and a saucer magnolia
which has lovely little pink fragrant blossoms
it will be a while before they look like trees
though
right now they kinda look like tall bushes
i've planted a lot of tropical plants
i've got a ten ft
plumeria
which is what they make the hawaiian leis out of
which has little little yellow fragrant blossoms
and an australian fern tree
which is about 0 ft
tall and looks kinda like a palm
they're in pots
because i'll have to take them in during hard freezed
i've planted lots of climbing pink
yellow and white roses and one mauve hybrid
it will take a while before they fill out
also
two pink/purple crape myrtles
which should add a lot of color
those are those colorful small trees that bloom all over houston
i've planted a lot of stuff with scent
and stuff to attract birds and butterflies
i hope the next time you come it will have filled out a bit
right now we've been having so much rain that they're drowning a bit
i need a little sun to make them bloom
and then there's my st
francis fountain
he's just lovely
also
the central air is done
no more noise from window units
now he's painting my bedrooms
the front one a real pale blue
and the back one a real pale pink
i hope when i get back from europe it will all be over and i can start cleaning up all the dust
i'll have 0 days to recuperate because of the 0th of july holiday
you and sue were going to spruce up your garden a bit
have you been able to do anything
i'm so glad i got to see your house
now when you talk about things i can picture what you're talking about
also
when i get back from europe i'm going to get some cats again
i'm looking forward to that
i think i'm finally over mourning the demise of poor willow
mark said he didn't have a lot of time to visit with you when he was there because you were in teeside a lot of the time
i'm sorry he didn't get a chance to see your car
i was trying to describe it to him and i don't think i gave it justice
it was good talking to you the other day
i'll give you a call when i get back
i spoke to harry musikas in nymex compliance this afternoon and he gave me verbal approval of 0 contracts for cob spot month for the next year
pending final approval of bernie purta
big boss at nymex
we won't get the letter for about a week to 0 weeks
but i wanted to let you know
i spoke to mike swerzbin and told him the same thing
i'll pass on the approval letter and my revised list as soon as we get his approval letter
i have passed on the confirmation termination letter you sent me to melba lozano on the confirmation desk for handling
we have received the executed isda master agreement
multicurrency-cross border
effective as of 0/0/0
copies will be distributed
important
all confirmations for this counterparty must contain the following representation
each party represents that it is in compliance with the terms
conditions and limitations set forth in the board resolutions or other guidelines that are applicable to such party's execution and performance of this transaction
melissa
i still need to forward over the documents listed below
have you
or someone in your group
been able to track them down
i got it signed and fedexed it up to ed&f man for signature last night with instructions to send it back to me for transmittal to the omlx
thanks for your help
anthony
in reply to your voicemail that you can't find the guarantees
you've got to have them somewhere there
maybe they're with some old margie wright files
but neither legal nor credit would keep the original guarantees
so they've got to be somewhere there
it's about 0 0/0 hour drive outside of the city
i think if you wanted to ride you would only be able to do it weekends
are you still interested
i got back from vacation late friday
our whole group got bumped from the flight in paris so they paid us $0 each to take the next flight out
not a bad deal
but it was 0 hours travel time from start to finish and i was exhausted
luckily
it was a 0 day weekend here
so i had time to recover
and clean from my construction work
i had a really nice time
most of our time we spent in east germany
except for the flight out of munich
we went to berlin
leipzig
eisenach
wittenberg
erfurt
potsdam
and hiked in the harz mountains
my favorite time was the time spent in kitzbuhl
austria
it was wonderful
i hope to make an annual hiking trip there for a week every year
it is so hard to do anything like it in houston
i forget how nice the mountains can be
our hotel was great
smack in the middle of town and it only cost $0
breakfast and dinner included
such a deal
i got home and my house is almost done
there are only a few minor things left
the garden is at 0%
my landscaper had a big fight with my tenant while i was gone so she wouldn't come to my house until i got back
i've picked out my two new kitties
and i'll pick them up this weekend
i think
if the painter is done
they are calico cats
i haven't named them yet
what's going on with you
are they working you to death
any fun things going on
i have created a new subdirectory in the attorney forms bank and moved the approved swap forms there
the subdirectory is called
swaps
and there are two sub-subdirectories under there called
current forms
and
old forms
i hope this makes it easier to find the swap forms
also
by popular acclaim
we are doing away with the old numerical naming system for forms like 0a
0b
and giving them names like industrial-canadian
etc
i hope this also makes it easier to find forms
i am also moving forms we frequently use located mainly in my directory
but also in other people's directories
into the atty.fms bank
if there is a form you would like me to move in that i haven't
please let me know
this should make the forms available to users outside the houston office
to the u.k
and singapore
we are going through a form revision process here in houston and when we are done i will send you clean and blacklined copies of the changes to you for your review
michael is the person
keep me posted if you don't get access
how are you
how goes the weight training
don't be a stranger
per our discussion when i was in london
we ordered you a box of blue files and sent them to you
for your original deal files since you said you couldn't get those types of files in england
one of our assistants got a call from what i guess must be meagan and she
meagan
said she was sending the files back because it wasn't what she wanted
so if you do want the blue files you might want to intervene with meagan before the files cross the atlantic again
we would
of course
be able to use the files here
so no big deal
i sent you an earlier email about the blue files
now erica has received back the three hole punch i ordered for you
so you could insert paper into the notebooks i have prepared for you
as well as a request for redweld manila folders
instead of the blue file folders we ordered for you
can you work out what supplies you want from us
we are happy to order whatever you like
but the overseas mail charges are going to increase greatly what the supplies are worth
thanks
yeah
we also need to provide copies of the signed resolutions to ted murphy
so he knows what's approved
so he then knows who does a trade outside of the approval

congrats on the new baby
how's she doing
getting any sleep
how's your son taking it
who does she look like
you crack me up
your baby report made me laugh
keep me posted on how the kids are doing
i enjoy your stories
all my home improvements are about done
i've finally put in central air
repainted the interior
exterior
redone the hardwoods and landscaped
including a fountain in the backyard
it looks like a new house
the final job will be new carpets and window treatments when i can get around to it
i've been doing this for a year
and as you well know
it gets old living in a construction site
i don't know if this is the final battle with the squirrels
or if we'll be at it again for another winter
i thought i had most of their holes for getting in closed
but with all this new construction
the central air
heaters in my attics
with various lines coming out of the attic
i'll probably have to go through it again this winter
i vow to prevail
keep in touch
attached is a unilateral form of confidentiality agreement where counterparty is the protected party
this form needs a little tweaking since it is more directed for a financing transaction
peter can find it
as well as other forms
in the attorney forms bank
call me
or have peter call me
if i can be of further help
mark asked me to get your input regarding a canadian form question
we have the following language in the canadian isda agreements
limitation of rate
notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this agreement
in no event shall the default rate
non-default rate
or termination rate exceed the maximum non-usurious interest rate
if any
that at any time or from time to time may be contracted for
taken
reserved
charged
or received on the subject indebtedness under the law applicable to such party
for the purpose of disclosure pursuant to the interest act
canada
the yearly rate of interest to which any rate of interest payable under this agreement that is calculated on any basis other than a full calendar year is equivalent may be determined by multiplying such rate by a fraction the numerator of which is the actual number of days in the calendar year in which such yearly rate of interest is to be ascertained and the denominator of which is the number of days comprising such other basis
do we need to have the highlighted language exactly as it is
or can we have a general statement to the effect that the interest rate shall not exceed the maximun non-usurious rate and interest shall be paid on the actual number of days elapsed
based on a 0/0 day year
is there some special magic to the above highlighted language
thanks for your help
mark elliott will be in the office from august 0 through september 0
i believe
i walked past that office and it still looked a little messy
is someone from prjoect rock going to clean it out
in order to get you phone service here
the phone people want your passport number since you don't have a social security number
can you provide it to joyce dorsey
an assistant here in legal
she's working with sylvia to get your office set up
thanks
we have a list of the london attorneys and paralegals attached to our ect legal dept
list that we maintain
do you want me to send you a list
where would you like me to send it to
do you want me to write on it
generally
their areas of responsibility are
attached is the language for insertion in the confirmation
i spoke to tanya and she said they only do energy trading through j
aron
all the interest rate and currency trading is done through goldman
so we don't need language re
that business
also
i ran it by her
and she does want the language in the credit rating section of the mac about
not supported by third party credit enhancement
i spoke to peter keohane while you were gone about that canadian interest change question we asked him
you'll see
he sent us both a fax with proposed changes to that section
when you have a minute
let's chat about what peter told me
it wasn't a clear answer of what to do
so we need to decide which way we want to go on this
i'm still trying to get an appointment set up with the documentum people
one of the things i need to get from you is what is the current software you are using
so they know what software they've got to be compatible with
can you send me an email back
thanks
i still need to get the following prior guaranty returned to the counterparty
if you are not going to locate this
i need to know because i am going to have to problem solve this with the counterparty
0
guaranty dated as of february 0
0 by pg&e corporation in favor of enron power marketing
this would have covered physical power
not financial
i received the original pg&e energy trading corporation guaranty in favor of ect canada dated as of march 0
0 from the calgary office
so that one is taken care of
not much going on
i'm still trying to get documentum to do a demonstration for me
i keep getting general marketing people
even though i tell them i'm interested only in derivatives software
and to get a derivative person to call me
i haven't gotten anyone yet that speaks my language yet
then the fellow was a little condescending with me about price
like i can't afford their services
when i first spoke to them i told them to check the enron web page to get more information about our company but it doesn't appear that they've done their homework
they're about to lose my business
in the end i think mark is agreeing with me that we're going to design our own software
i still like ipi a lot
but they're only one component of the project
the confirm desk is still really interested in getting some software
and between the two groups it might make buying software for document creation more attractive
i got a call while you were away from a woman at an affiliate of national bank of canada
they want to see our standard form of repo agreement to put in place for one of their affiliates

try talking to nadeem tufail in london
i believe he is a paralegal that is responsible for their corporate filings
i forgot one thing
i have that rotted board on the garage wall near the garden
we talked about tearing that out and putting in another 0x0 or 0/0 or whatever it is
and then painting that
do you remember
by the way
i can't believe you're alive
by the way you've been quiet
i thought you were maybe in that plane too
that's the point
it wasn't on my list
i remembered when i was standing there looking at the garden and saw the rotted board
also
there is a skootch of repainting that needs to be done on the same garage wall
you didn't tell me the bathroom you were working on for your other
client
was michelle's
i know you are just a spy so she can keep track of the progress of my garden
why
just the other day i came home from work and caught her in my backyard
fix all
i need to tell peter and nancy when you'll be in their apartment
yes
you can fax me the invoice and statement

carol essig
about the information you are requesting
i told them you needed an immediate response
if you don't hear from them within the next 0/0 hour let me know
i'm going to try someone else
mark taylor asked me to respond to your request about the omlx software
i spoke to mark elliott in our london office who dealt directly with the omlx

her number in london is 0 0 0 0 0

keep me posted on what you find out from this corporate search company
i'd be interested to see what prices we can work out
i am also going to contact kate cole and see if she uses anyone special

we are looking for european and canadian corporate search companies
and it occurred to me that you may already have someone you use
do you have any recommendations
thanks for your help

attached is the proposed draft of the isda
i think two substantive issues we are going out with are adding arbitration and not deleting
affiliates
from the setoff section

let me know if the draft is ok to send out

the revised form of isda exhibit.doc
which contains the credit support annex and letter of credit forms

old forms
in the attorney forms bank as atty.fms/old forms/oldisdaexh.doc
again

the revised multicurrency schedule is already in attorney forms
you may want to circulate blacklined drafts
the index to the swap forms is now also located in the attorney forms bank for your reference for the most current forms
it is called
formlist.doc
london and singapore
fyi
in addition to making changes to the isda collateral annex
we made changes to the mac definitions
which we inserted into isdaexh.doc for ease of the paralegals
and made changes to the letter of credit terms
as well as the form of letter of credit
we also added in an alternative
credit support amount
provision on the front page of the isda credit support annex to deal with situations when we do not want to return the credit support amount during the term of the master agreement
we moved the guaranty forms
enron corp
and counterparty
as a separate document
s
in the attorney forms bank
atty.fms/current forms/guaranty.doc
the guaranty form was revised to
0
make it cover both confirms and masters so we don't need two separate forms on an ongoing basis
and
0
we changed the procedures for timing of demands made on enron
deleting the 0 day period
we are also discussing adding an assignment provision to the enron corp
guaranty with clement and will keep you posted
we are close to finalizing changes to the industrial master
as well as making changes to the omnibus form of confirmation

we revised the incumbency certificates for our u.s
master swap agreements to include the authority of the officer as well as the officer's incumbency

nella

mark taylor asked me to run something on online trading by you
we got a list of questions on various online trading issues from the products control group which appears to be the group the will be managing the online trading helpdesk
one of their questions related to the desire of helpdesk managers to periodically listen in on phone calls with the customer to ensure what they explained as a
quality control
over the responses given to customers on the helpdesk
they explained it as being like when your credit card company has an announcement that says the calls may be monitored from time to time
is this something we want to do
if we do
that brings up other issues
and we will have to run this by our outside counsel
sullivan
cromwell

on your counterparty list for the uk
have you identified which counterparties are utilities or governmentals
if you have that would help me alot
thanks
bob
per your request
attached are the online trading gtc's
it looks like mark has all of them
not just financial
i'm going to talk to stacy about this when she gets in
because i know she was talking about adding it in
i'll get back to you
here are the next four descriptions
per awais's message below
he is still trying to get these by today
i know it is a little late
let me know if this will be an issue
please give me your comments so i can coordinate responses
thanks
mark taylor has asked me to forward to the relevant attorneys the following market descriptions
obviously
for you
the weather one is yours
i sent the pulp
paper to sara
we need to review the market descriptions from a legal perspective only
awais is trying to get them back by today
let me know if that will present a problem
he still hasn't got the liquids ones written
he says we'll have those by monday
i am coordinating the responses
so please return any comments you might have to me for transmittal to awais
thanks for your help
the mac clauses are attached to the isda master agreement
i will have a sample copy walked down to you
i have no idea if it was or not
would you like to pass it on
or do you want me to
does he know what's going on
your email captured the concern of our lawyers concerning business review of these descriptions
they are being forwarded to our business people now for review
but i don't expect that we will have them ready until tuesday
monday being a federal holiday here
i don't know what problems this is going to cause
but our lawyers feel it is very important that we get this business input on these descriptions
jeff hodge left a voicemail with david forster to this effect
steve
i don't know if we are duplicating your effort
but our ect lawyers here were also concerned about business review of these product descriptions
so they have forwarded these descriptions on to their respective business groups for approval
if we are duplicating your work
or doing something contrary to what we should be doing
please call me or jeff and we will try to coordinate our responses
otherwise
we will continue the review we are doing
here's the final liquids descriptions
alan
is this what you are talking about
i forwarded your voicemail on to mark t
attached are the revised descriptions for so0 and nox
jeff hodge signed off on the canada description and said it looked fine in its current form
i will be faxing you this evening our comments to natural gas
you should have received weather by separate email from shari stack
coal should be coming shortly
paper is being looked at by the business people and we will have it to you on tuesday
the person responsible for power is out of the office
but will be back in town on tuesday
and we will get you her comments then
thank you for your kind patience
fyi
i will be attending the online presentation today at 0
here's coal
that just leaves power and any revisions to pulp
paper we may get from the business people
i will have the master walked down to you shortly
thursday's ok with me
i think the weather description you are referring to was sent by an attorney in our group
shari stack
if that is the one you are talking about
it should be okay
i don't know the regulatory guys
but i'll try calling steve kean and see if i get a response
shari
can you take a look at this revised market description and let me know if its ok
thanks
i spoke to steve kean's assistant
and told her your deadline to get all these descriptions done was the end of today
she said she would pass the word on and try and get you comments by the end of the day
let me know if that doesn't happen
either day is fine for me
de nada
i guess i still need your market descriptions for lpg
oil
oil products and plastics and petrochem
will i have them by the end of the day
thanks shari
i am getting ready to fax you steve kean's comments to the language
steve kean is marking this material as to regulatory information only
not as to legal
he told me he also passed these market descriptions to karen denney in public relations for her comments and she supposedly is going to send her comments to me for forwarding to you
i will let you know as soon as i receive your comments
were you serious about our conversation friday
or were you kidding me
if you were serious i'd like to talk to you about it
after our meeting last week i spoke to mary about getting a list of the products trading restrictions in our financial master and i haven't received it
with mary out i don't know who to contact to get it
can you help me with this
also
would it be possible to get a list of the global contract numbers for our financial masters
thanks
below is the memo from isda that needs to be read in conjunction with that master netting agreement
here are the descriptions again
taffy
you were going to check on how much vacation days i have left
i wanted to take a few days when my mom comes in for xmas
thanks
i checked around and that is the most recent copy we have
if i can be of any help whatsoever
let me know
how about thursday
next week
i got edward's markup of the description
and wanted to run it by you when you have a minute
let me know
thanks for your help
thanks bob
the couch is always open
tho
obviously
not always helpful
list looks good to me
i didn't know you sent the market description to awais
so i was following up
i'll mark it out
here are your three remaining descriptions
please note that harry has asked that mark taylor review the plastics description
mark is out of the office and will not return until monday
awais
i sent you all these
what happened to them
all the descriptions except weather have already been emailed to awais and i have asked him to provide them to you
i understand you have weather which was faxed
mike
you may recall that i have asked that brent hendry
an attorney in our buenos aires office
be given access to our lotus notes master swap agreement database and that appears not to have happened yet
can you please let me and brent know what needs to be done to grant hims access
brent will also need additional attorneys added to the database
brent
can you provide mike with a list of any other individuals
legal/credit/secretarial only
you would like granted access
mike
it also appears brent would like to copy our database to set up a document tracking database in b.a
who should he contact here to get a new database created similar to ours
thanks for your help
brent
i have asked several times to get you access to lotus notes
if we don't get you access in response to this latest email
we may need to kick it higher
hope you are doing well
we miss you
i just thought of one other thing we need to discuss with credit in our meeting
i've asked them to get back to me about this several times and haven't heard
in the collateral annexes
we have interest on collateral computed at 0 days
so we don't have problems with canadian counterparties
i would like to change that to 0/0 accross the board
i asked them if there was any specific reason why we've got interest on collateral at 0
like maybe it's the custom in the bank/dealer markets
anyway
i'd like to get that answered
i don't know if your directory is supposed to be the place where all the most current gtc's are kept
but there have been some changes while you've been gone
i think stacy has created new firm gtc's
and leslie hansen has revised the power to change the tax language and also change some of the reps
i told her to coordinate any changes she might have with david forster
janice has also been revising her forms to deal with some efp issues
we have added the new one way
cash and letter of credit collateral annex to the back of the industrial master
it is still located in my form directory
called industrial-u.s.#0.doc
i'll put together some sample stuff and send it to you today
we really do have a problem getting responses from our computer people
so i hope a relentless bird-dog effort may bring a response
it's not clear to me that our draft of the referenced agreement is the latest
mark thought london may have made some additional changes
can you email me the latest draft
thanks
blue range resources corporation is an executed isda master we have for ect canada that went into bankruptcy
it shows up on my list because i'm working off the original list
but it is not a good credit counterparty so it doesn't show up on credit's approved counterparty list
i just want to make sure that we don't send them any mailouts
just checking to get a status report on your offsite
i hope there was no frivolity or frolickling had by anyone
i've found a great website to check on utilities
trying to figure out if a counterparty is one
or whether its a governmental one
it's at www.utilityconnection.com
it even has non-u.s
utilities
when you have a minute
give it a look
taffy
can you check grant's list against our list of executed masters for ect canada
the canada office is missing some of the masters we have in place
and we have to provide them copies
see me and i'll show you how to do a sort on lotus notes to figure out what executed masters we show canada has in place
vs
the masters they think they have in place
thanks
here are the descriptions for power
sent again
sign off on canada
it turns out that jeff hodge made plane reservations for 0:0 pm on wednesday
can we move that meeting up to 0:0 am
we have dinner reservations for saturday at 0:0
reservation #0
i will be able to attend
access to the online trading system
if that's the questions
probably none of us
there will be a demonstration of the online trading application for trading lawyers and paralegals on wednesday at 0:0 am in eb0a
this project continues to be highly confidential
for online trading i am also going to have to sign off on whether we can trade with the uk based counterparty list
and i am probably going to need your help and your list to be able to do that
i am totally unfamiliar with the uk based counterparties and in most cases their names aren't even in english so i can't even guess whether it would be an appropriate counterparty or not
i am
obviously
most concerned about not approving trading with utilities and governmentals
i've been searching that utility website trying to figure out which are utilities from that
and guessing at the names if it sounds like a utility or governmental
is your list done
or when will it be done
do you spell out if the counterparty is governmental/utility
what help can you give me
per the notes below
jeff hodge signed off on the description awais sent us with no changes
nox and sox are attached also
i am also reforwarding the coal description
fyi
i noticed we have 0 entries for cpy in lotus notes
we need to delete one
mark
david portz
elizabeth sager and i were looking at this slide and we're not so sure it's correct
we think it should reflect two huge power price spikes
the recent ones of this year
and the big one of last year
we don't think the attached slide correctly reflects the two price spikes
can you take a look at it and get back to me
thanks for your help
per the meeting today
attached is the latest counterparty list in excel
just a note to make sure that i get any updates to the approved counterparty list
i will forward the list to the trading lawyers preparing their group's approved counterparty list here in houston
our review of the counterparty list is not considering
for the most part
state of incorporation
the biggest consideration with derivatives is the country of incorporation
and additionally
the country
ies
in which trading will take place
for the bulk of our swap counterparties
i.e
energy companies
state law currently isn't an in issue on approval of swap trading
it is more of an issues with governmentals
utilities
insurance companies
pension funds and the like
and we do not capture that information until we are in active neogtiation with a counterparty
with utilities
you cannot make a general assumption that any particular state law that applies to one utility will apply to another
each utility need to be looked at individually to see which state or federal law may apply to that counterparty
the bulk of you customer list is not financial counterparties we are in active negotiation with
so we are not capturing state of incorporation
i know the global contracts group has been trying to capture that information
you may want to talk to mary gosnell
i am going to meet with tom at 0:0
after our ice cream social at 0:0
to go over my latest list of questions to the 0nd credit list
so how's about discussing any other financial issues we might have then
i gave shari my whole file on canadian cash collateral issues to look at
you may want to get it from her
it has fred erickson's phone # in there also
unfortunately
providing matt with the isda master is a problem
it's got the old confidentiality language in it that doesn't allow provision of the agreement to affiliates
so we cannot not send this agreement without citibank's consent
matt
if you want it you'll have to get citibank to tell us
enron north america
that it's ok to provide the agreement to you
ect international
sorry
i'm a little confused
do i need to contact gary bode to
0
get brent and the buenos aires legal team access to the current lotus master swaps database
or
0
get the software developed for brent to copy the database to create a document tracking database for the argentina legal contracts
or
0
both
i have added shari's mac clause
when there is no collateral annex and mac is an additional event of default
as an alternative in the mac clauses for the isda master agreement contained in isdaexh.doc
yes
i put together a package of stuff and sent it to you
i don't know how long mail takes to get there
it will probably be there i hope in today's mail
i have been trying to get brent hendry and andrea calo
attorneys in our buenos aires office
access to the houston legal department's lotus notes master swap agreement database
i understand that you are the person that can get them access
this will continue to be an issue as we expand our trading offices around the world
can you let me
mark taylor
the assistant general counsel for trading
and brent know what we need to do to get brent and andrea access
also
brent wants to copy our master swap agreement database to create a database for the buenos aires legal contracts
how does brent go about getting this new database created
thanks for your help
carol made some proposed changes to the mac language and asked me to send it to you to get your input
mary
although this presentation is for the legal dept
i thought maybe if you have a representative from your group there it might be helpful
do you have someone
like mary gosnell
that you would like to attend
let me know
and i'll get their name added to the list
have you sent these to steve kean
the legal/credit meeting scheduled for tomorrow has been postponed 0/0 hour until 0:0 pm
if you find a product that does
keep me in the loop
we're always looking for better ways to do things up here and unless lexis/nexis improves
i am currently not impressed with their product
compared to the old information america
which was great before they bought it out and ruined it
how are you doing
you must be a little stressed with this online project
as well as others
we do not have a copy of the executed agreement for our files
can you have one of your assistant's copy it for me as well as any relevant guarantees
credit support documents
etc
much thanks
well
it turns out that mark elliott needs a revised draft of the uk isda incorporating our form changes since he needs to send it to gibraltar counsel for the legal review he's working on for gibraltar law
so
i'll work with mark to come up with the form and then pass it on to you and the london legal team for approval
thanks for the material
i've been really busy at work
at some point when i have more of a break i'll call you
mark elliott just introduced me to another charming aspect of english culture
the morris men
i've got their website bookmarked
y'all are a goofy bunch
dancing around in strange costumes
beating each other with switches
it's funny
each one of you imparts different aspects of english culture to me
i am constantly amused
if y'all would only cheer at marathons
shouldn't we be setting a time for a form meeting so we can review those documents
deemed isda
legal opinions
etc
i distributed a while back
here's that email
i'm working with mark on approval of our counterparty lists for online trading
mark asked me to contact you about the approach we should take with respect to financial trading with singapore counterparties
should singapore be approved for all types of trading with all types of counterparties
are there are special counterparties we shouldn't approve for trading outside the governmentals
such as the utilites
are there any products that might not be approved for trading out of singapore
such as weather
or any others
are there any special types of reps we might need to include in our agreements
any guidance you could give us with this would be most appreciated
how are you and the baby doing
we hope to see pictures on your next trip over
thank you for the lunch invite
i put on the calendar
lunch w/sweet yao
can't wait
non-smoking room please
preferably a suite with a wet bar
sunken tub
view over the pool
and complimentary room service
not to mention my own private valet
well
mr
elliott
i do believe i am quite shocked at your allegations of me being the troublemaker
my review hasn't gone in yet and i guess i am going to have to mention
that you are the troublemaker
wonderful job
per mark's conversation
you were going to get back to us on the scoop on france and utility counterparties
any update
what do you want to do with masters where we have a note that we got the master in
but we have a bad certificate
and no trading should be done until we get a new certificate
how was your trip back
i hear from taffy you cut quite the figure in your cowboy duds
right down to having the right style of wrangler jeans
the grapevine says you also did some mighty fine two steppin
the bright lights of london must look dim after the shining lights of houston
your visit seemed all too short
we probably won't see you for a few years
but i really enjoyed our dinners and chats
stay out of trouble and make us proud
the meeting is to discuss confidentiality agreements
the mad cow disease must have extended to england's venerable sheep
thus causing a lack of worsted wool
hence
no new trousers which
i'm sure
is the only reason we haven't gotten a fashion bulletin from you in quite some time
the men's fashion news here in the united states says that the current fashion in ladies pedal pushers
or knee length trousers
has now extended to the gents and is becoming quite the rage
fashion trends are quite slow in reaching the outbacks here in texas
but i can see fashionable young swains in london and new york showing off their knees and ankles
has this trend crossed the atlantic
has justin bought a pair in red
we miss our tim from texas
stay in touch
taffy
can you work with nicola to get this conf
call set up with london
in suzanne's absence
thanks
i spoke to mary solmonson about the chain of command in it
obviously
everyone reports to phillipe bibi in the end
she looked up gary bode
who michael neves
our lotus notes contact
reports to
and gary is a manager
but she didn't see his direct boss on the chart
she suggested for the fishkin project that we try and use inja chun
a woman she says is very good
or chris behney
she said we could have her
but she would be very expensive
just kidding
i'm going to give danny clark a call to see who at ees is using documentum to manage their documents
perhaps we should set up a meeting to talk to phillipe bibi about the fishkin project
so we make sure we get a good person assigned to us
what do you think
you forgot to have me off the week of thanksgiving too
i know i mentioned that to you
no word
i have noticed that humility is one of your most pronounced character traits
am glad you responded and look forward to seeing you
per our conversation
the additional
to do
list is
0
plumber still needs to do his stuff 0
put up new light fixture in back bedroom 0
fix broken window in peter
nancy's front bedroom
you'll need to call them to let them know the day you're doing it
i'm out tues
and weds
at an in house seminar
how does today or thursday sound
when you get back
i got a call from koch about the morgan
assignment
as you recall
we are acting as agent on behalf of morgan in connection with their commodity business
koch called me and they want to get a copy of the
assignment
since it wasn't an assignment
what should i provide them
i don't know that i can provide them a copy of our servicing agreement
what should i do
per david forster
they should be doing the online trading simulation tomorrow
per mark's approval
when we entered into the master with cgas
we found out they never entered into a resolution approving the swap agreement or trades thereunder
so each and everytime we do a trade with them we are going to have to get a resolution authorizing entering into the trade
so for the executed master swap agreement list we need to put
need board resolution prior to trading
to the trading lawyers working on counterparty lists
per the email below from louise
the current target date for completion of counterparty lists appears to be tuesday
october 0
as noted below
an additional list of approved counterparties should be provided to us tomorrow
fyi
per my conversations w/frank davis
the first simulation occurred this week
and an additional simulation is scheduled for next week
i just got an update from the omlx of their rules
do you need me to make you a copy or are you also getting updates
also
i get faxes of all their notices
so far nothing i've received has been interesting
do you get copies of their notices
do you need me to send you anything i feel is worth noting
they've also promoted me to compliance director
so i'm going to go in and ask mark for a raise to match my title
i thought of you this weekend
it was the fall antique festival in round top and i went
but it wasn't quite as nice as the pleasant day i had with you and your family
that was such a perfect day all around and i will treasure it
i hope all is going well
so i don't forget for monday
shari just send around the canadian
eligible swap participant
language to be inserted in all canadian confirms
don't we also need to add that to the canadian online gtc's
yes
the list is the final approved counterparty list before the roll out of the system
all counterparty lists are due by the close of business tomorrow
if you are not sure of what the current approved counterparty lists are let me know
do not worry about that new product type
it doesn't pertain to you
if you see none that looks like power you might want to pay attention
i know jeff has been getting similar emails
the document wasn't in the blue file either
i called tanya and asked her if she could fax us up a copy of it
also
i asked her to let you know what her thoughts were on the proposed amendment
do you want me to call rick at bmo and let him know you're working on it
just a confirmation
we have the following lawyers scheduled to attend the upcoming conference
you
justin
paul and jon
is that correct
see lotus notes
lovely note
crummy master
it makes belco look good
i know olin corporation only because they had a plant near the summer camp i went to in north carolina and there were days when the stench from the plant pervaded the beautiful blue ridge mountains where the camp was located
that plant manufactured the plastic wrap that went around all those cigarettes they were making in north carolina
i kinda remember them being a plastics company back then
attached is the latest draft of the referenced gtc
font of useless knowledge
would you like to respond
per mark's earlier emails and conversations
we have 0 govt's/utilities with masters in place that are approved to trade
with about another 0 currently being negotiated
the other 0 or so will only be approved to trade when we get signed masters in place and any other relevant documents related thereto
like legal opinions
we are getting calls from our brokers and the nymex telling us the brokers still have not received notification of our name change
this is causing problems with the brokers clearing the trades on the nymex
per my voicemail several weeks ago
since you/your desk are our communications guy with the brokers
they need to receive the notice as soon as possible
when will you be able to get this notice our of our name change
i have already notified all the exchanges we deal with of the name change
but the nymex says the brokers have to file some form with the cftc
and they can't file that form until they receive the notice from us
how can you be on vacation this week if you are responding to this email
we have tried to get the computer people to respond to your request for lotus notes access
but they don't respond
mark
what do you think the next step is
mark
open up felix the cat
he is adorable
as far as your email questions
my responses are following
0
the list i have provided you is the only list that exists on financial counterparties
there is no excel spreadsheet to follow
0
duke energy corporation
at mark's direction
i am sending his note below regarding utilities
again
until we do the due diligence on a utility counterparty we have no way of knowing what kind of local
state or federal regulation or approvals they may be subject to
we currently have masters in place with only about 0 utilities/govt's
we are in the process of negotiating another 0
until those masters are executed and we have the relevant resolutions
authority documents and/or legal opinions
i cannot approve them for online trading
i have made every effort to search company websites and elicit from credit whether a counterparty is a regulated utility or not
if i cannot tell by the information available to me
additional due diligence will be needed to see if they are subject to local
state
or federal regulation
mark can override any decision i have made
i can only make decisions within the guidelines the attorneys have set for me
0
montana power trading and marketing company is a subsidiary of a regulated utility
i am unable to determine from credit or their website what type of regulation they might be subject to
the note is true that credit says they are getting out of the business anyway
0
petrotemex
per my conversations with mark and our advice from counsel
unlike u.s
and u.k
counterparties
mexican counterparties are not able to enter into derivative transactions unless their articles and bylaws specifically provide for these types of transactions
we will not know this until the due diligence is completed
so i am supposed to say
no
for mexican counterparties we do not have a master swap agreement in place with
0
pseg
it is an energy services company
however
it is also not an eligible swap participant
or
esp
cftc regulation limits the derivatives trading we may do to certain types of counterparties that meet certain financial requirements
large
institutional type investors
companies
banks
etc
corporations and partnerships have to meet certain net worth and asset levels or we cannot trade financially with them
whenever i say
not esp
or
not eligible swap participant
it means they have not met the financial net worth test
0
the american coal company
see prior note
attached are the revised online gtc's
the weather gtc's won't change except for the credit support language
so i thought that you could make that same change when you made it to the rest of the gtc's
did we order that special uk sized paper
i still have to copy that omlx stuff for mark elliott's binder there in london
louis fernandez was wonderful to work with
his work was top notch
his subcontractors did a great job
for instance
i put in central air and one of the old window units we took out was in the brick in front of my house
i thought when the brick got repaired i would have this mismatched brick box they would look ugly from the front
louis's brick guy was so good that you cannot even tell the brick was repaired
also
his sheetrock guy did a wonderful job
you cannot tell where he repaired sheetrock holes
louis is also a good businessman
he gives you a weekly bill spelling out the exact number of hours he or his subcontractors worked and also listing any supplies he was billing you for
a lot of contractors are not good businessmen
i think louis is honest about the time it will take to do a job
he communicates when he has a problem and how that might effect the cost
and i also think a lot of homeowners when they do construction have a lot of add ons they ask of the contractor
that they don't figure in his additional time or money on
to sum it up
i think with louis you will get a good job for the money you pay
the 0st list attached here is the one i used for the 0st list you have
per my voicemail
below are the revised online gtc's
sorry for an inconvenience this might have caused you
i spoke to the fellow at legalanywhere.com today
he will only be in the office mon
and tues
of next week
so if possible
he would like to set up a demonstration with us together at your desk on the computer so he can work us through the software
let me know when a convenient time would be for you
maybe tuesday sometime
a reminder for when you get back on monday
i spoke to mark taylor
how does tuesday at 0:0 am sound
0:0 am central standard time
0 hour earlier than new york
what's the scoop on the txu negotiation
brant says we're in a strong negotiation position with them right now
because they've acquired howard's book and need our consent
and also have to post an expensive lc with us to take in those howard trades
he wants to know if he should use our leverage here to get that isda master in place
just a note
if you've got some recent pictures of your daughter to bring them
attached are the revised drafts of the weather gtc's
anita sent me the message below re
board resolutions to trade out of singapore
can singapore trade out of the board resolution that was approved for ect interntional
or are we going to have to get another board resolution signed allowing financial trading out of the singapore office
per our discussion
i had a conversation with mark taylor this morning about your board resolution
he looked at the resolution we drafted for ect international
and he said it would also cover the singapore trading
so i have drafted a secretary's certificate and incumbency certificate for you to use
with none of the secretary's being located in singapore
do you need my assistance in getting it signed here
who will you have sign the agreement
what do you usually do
edmund
can you help us figure out who in london can help anita execute her first isda
which also will include the usual secretary's certificates
i don't know if you know
but singapore doesn't need eeft to sign as the arranger
ectric can sign directly
per the resolution
it needs to be a vp
president
managing director or chairman
it looks like the london based officers who could sign would be john sherriff
danny mccarty or john lush
unless you are familiar with someone else who can sign for ectric
it looks like for the secretary's certificates
all the secretaries are located here in houston
so we should probably prepare them for the usual kate cole's signature
anita
you will need to have two signed copies
and initial both copies for signature
as also will your london credit person
congrat anita
this is very exciting
no
i haven't met matt
in fact
i don't know much about him
is he here now
for how long
thru the legal conference
i would be happy to help in whatever way i can
as you know
we've recently revised our forms
so this would be a good time to get him indoctrinated
i will
of course
be sad to have you leave us
you have been wonderful to work with from both a personal and professional standpoin
your baby's gain in your time is a loss to enron
because are a most valued asset to our company
i hope our lives will cross again some time
best wishes for your future
you deserve the best
mark
should we forward carol's email to bill
so he knows what the issues are
regulatory made some changes to the power description and awais wanted legal's sign off again and needs a response by tomorrow
will that be a problem
with respect to online trading
mark wanted me to follow up with you re
insurance/reinsurance company issues
per our earlier conversations
i am saying
no
to online trading for all insurance/reinsurance companies we do not have a master with
the online people have come back and said
hey wait a minute
you are already trading with insurance companies without a master
i.e
swiss re
they are wanting to open up swiss re for online trading and any other insurance/reins
we are currently trading with without a master in place
do you have a list of those companies
what are your feelings about that
can we trade online with swiss re
how about any other insurance companies you are currently trading with without a master in place
or do you want me continue to say no
thanks for your help
i looked at gillian's website and she is adorable
what a cutie
i've bookmarked it and i'll keep looking for updates
i'd like to attend
mark asked me to contact you to get a copy of one of the letters we sent to outside counsel requesting updates on their legal advice to deal with the online trading issues
we have to get similar letters out to some of the south american countries and carribean tax shelter islands
much thanks
by the way
weren't you out for vacation
did you have a good time
leslie hansen was out today so elizabeth forwarded your language to one of our power attorneys in the portland office for review
i have some minor clean up changes from elizabeth
but except any material changes to come from christian yoder in our portland office
as soon as i receive christian's comments i will add forward them on to you
it just occurred to me after discussing online trading this morning with mark for other countries
that i am approving online trading for mexican counterparties we have a master in place with
however
in my later thinking
did our advice from mexican counsel address the issue of enforceability of online transactions
i have forwarded on your email and fax to marie heard
she was already working on that issue
what a happy coincedence
when are you coming in
when shall we have dinner
we need to update the advice we received from mexican counsel to address the online trading issue
i spoke to nony and while we're at it i'm also going to ask whether there are any other updates since they rendered their original advice
are there are other issue you would like to add to our request for advice
bob shults called this meeting to see what the status was for the different product groups
confirmation and gtc forms
the two issues out of the meeting i was asked to bring to your attention were
0
attaching the online gtc's to the outgoing confirmations
per our discussion
it was my understanding that the gtc's would be attached to all outgoing confirmations
that does not seem to be the general consensus
there seems to be feedback from london that is not the case
and janice moore was also saying she didn't know if that's what the liquids people were going to do
bob shults asked for your direction with these holdouts
0
the issue of the credit in the masters being overriden
first
after our discussions yesterday
we couldn't figure out a way they could change the approval status within credit from approved with a master to a
b
approved gtc with credit
second
bob shults thought that had been agreed to have the credit overridefor all the product areas and i told him that financial was still discussing this issue with credit
so we would have to get back to him
i guess the physical people are ok with that
i don't know what discussions you have had with jeff and alan
but bob shults appears to want to have this confirmed for him
also
along with the credit override of the master
there is supposed to be some letter that will be sent out to the counterparties
who will be drafting that letter and will it be the same for all product groups
per the email below
do you have any other legal advice with respect to trading issues we should address with mexican counsel when we send out the updates below
please let me know asap
we hope to get our letter out monday
shari
per the emails below
have you received or do you have any other advice we need to add
thanks for the smiles
i am busy this weekend
but if you're in town
how about doing the nickel tour and village shopping the next weekend
if not
maybe another time when you are available
let me know
fyi
we are also going to send out a memo to columbian counsel requesting advice on online trading and asking them for any other general update to their earlier advice
below is a confirm issue for handling
chris
in the future
please direct your confirmation requests to susan bailey
who is the current paralegal on the confirm rotation
or if the request is for an annex b
to each of susan bailey
susan flynn and marie heard
thanks
per shari this a.m
we had already requested an update on ritch
heather's legal advice from another law firm in mexico
lopez vallardi
you have already authorized payment of the bill
the fax requesting an update from ritch
heather went out yesterday
what would you like to do
shari said our new counsel was supposedly better counsel and that's why we asked for the update from them
liz and christian yoder reviewed the description since you were out
last week i left taped to your chair the referenced form of confirm that bob bowen needed you to sign off on
he says he never hear back
can you call him and give him the sign off
thanks
can you do me a favor and look to see if we are doing any financial trading with the following counterparties
florida power
light peoples gas light
coke company dakota gasification company enmax corp

there are a few others i am still re-reviewing
i will get back to you as soon as i resolve/answer my questions
how did we ever resolve the two signed masters situation for elf trading s.a
another counterparty change
for midland cogeneration venture limited partnership
we will switch that to a
yes
but only if they accept online gtc w/o change
this is the one where they wanted an exculpation clause for the partners
and that is totally unacceptable
i discovered it was a non-isda master
so i had to delete the weather
i just spoke to sara shackleton and she approved opening fpl for all financial trading
she has also been discussing the utilities with outside counsel and we may be able to open more up for trading
she is going to bring a copy of my list to the legal conference and review it
so hopefully we'll have some more changes for you next week
to remind me to discuss this with you when you get in
we received via our fax notices from the omlx a request to provide them with information about our y0k readiness
when you have a minute let's look at the form together
probably alan will have the answers
i stopped by to see you because mark got in the mail a blacklined draft of the prospectus from bowne on the weather offering and i wanted to see if you got your own copy or do you need me to have one made for you
now that the cat is out of the bag i can tell you about the other big project i have been working on
the press releases went out last week
mark taylor was also the host of this year's ect legal conference
which takes alot of work to put together
which we just had on thursday and friday
you may have read in the papers about our new enron online
our new web based commodity trading system
you can view it at www.enrononline.com
mark has been the lead attorney on that project which has been an enormous amount of work for him
besides being mark's aide-de-camp on eol generally
i have been working on the counterparty approval lists for the financial contracts
which has meant going through every counterparty we have to determine whether we should approve them for online trading
as you can imagine
that has meant looking at thousands of counterparties
contracts and legal issues and trading restrictions
as far as my
fishkin
project
as mark and i call it
i recently went to an internal class on project management and am redefining my project goals
objectives
etc
we've found a few new software programs we've been looking at
some we found out enron already has
mark and i are discussing what we've seen
defining and redefining what we want
and hope to finalize our thoughts soon
mark and i are currently designing the swap jurisdictional database in a lotus notes format
and hope this week to get the computer people to design the software
this would be my database of foreign derivative laws
isda opinions and the like
we need that up and going desperately
we
have been having to look alot at foreign laws for the online trading project as well as general trading questions lately
and it should be a slam dunk to put this database together and start loading the information
so that's been what i've been up to
let me know your thoughts about eol
p.s
thanks for the article
just a note
you know
we more or less made the same changes to the industrial master that we made to the isda
if you are using that form at all you should update it to include our changes
i think paul mentioned in his presentation at the seminar that you were using the industrial as the basis form for norway
anyway
if that is the case
we may need to look at that form
see
you're always in my thoughts
missed you at the seminar
i hope we'll see you at one of these soon
i hear you had dinner with our friend molly saturday night
what happened to the relatives
when you have a minute
peco called with an authorized trader list problem and liz asked me to bring it to you for handling
angeline will you be sending the isda agreement for signature directly to mark frevert
i'm asking because he will have to sign the incumbency certificate before kate cole
obviously
certifies to his signature
how do you plan on doing this
perhaps we should have edmund cooper in london coordinate the signing
what are your thoughts
i will send a copy to you
we miss you
i called edmund cooper and he is out on vacation til monday
do you think i should email him the certificate
have him print it out there in london
i guess anita has to initial the two isda master agreements for signature
then edmund could get them initialled by credit in london
and then bring the certificates and agreements up to mark frevert for signature
what do you think
if you've got the copies
why don't you save them as a form into your system and use them to draft the caltex certificates
send them over to edmund with the isda master agreements
leave him a message asking him if he could help you get the agreements and the incumbency certificates signed
then have him send the certificates to me for kate's signature
i think that should do it
thanks for your email
it is important on a going forward basis that if we veer from any restriction that legal has placed on a counterparty
e.g
if credit says it is ok to trade weather under a gtc instead of a master
that legal hear before we trade so we all make sure we are on the same understanding as to whether any restriction should be waived
in response to your email i have the following comments
0
the new york times company
cannot trade derivatives online at all
their board resolution and master agreement require that two specific officers must enter into the trade together on a telephone call
they cannot trade any other way without revising their board resolution and agreement
all their trades must be done by telephone
0
san diego gas
electric company
the california puc said that utilities such as san diego cannot enter into derivatives transactions at all
0
aspect resources
can enter into derivative transactions
we want the transactions to roll up under the existing isda master agreement between ect and aspect
0
brant-allen industries
is shut down
more or less
for all financial trading
they cannot enter into another derivative transactions with us
either on the phone or online
until
prior to entering into the trade
they provide us with a board resolution approving the trade or derivative trading in general
the board resolution they provided with the signed master agreement only approved the one trade we entered into at that time
0
cox
perkins
we had a master with this counterparty and they have informed us i writing that they didn't want to trade with us anymore
in reality
if they did another trade
legal will need to be contacted and we probably would try and reactive the master and roll the trade up under the master if possible
credit
keep us informed if they do trade
0
sonoco products
we should not be trading with them at all until we resolve this payment dispute
sara shackleton was working on that
we do have a master with them
and if we resolve the payment dispute and begin trading with them
the trade should roll up under the existing master
below are my comments to the legal/financial transactions only on the latest counterparty list

outside counsel and the regulatory people
i don't know when i will get you a revised list
but i hope to open a bunch of the investor owned utilities for general trading
per my conversations with credit
the referenced counterparty is the new jersey incorporated sub of a german company
a liquids based counterparty
and they are an eligible swap participant
we do not have a master agreement in place with them
i am approving them for all financial trading
per peter's request
i have received the unanimous written consent of the board of directors of enron north america corp
dated 0/0/0 appointing dale neuner and robert shults as agents and attorneys-in-fact to execute password applications on behalf of the company for online trading
the original consent will be sent to kate cole for inclusion in the corporate minute book and copies will be sent to dale and bob
when signing the password applications
dale and bob should sign them as
agent and attorney-in-fact
in the absence of dale or bob
any v.p
or above can sign password applications
with initials from legal
if you have any questions
please do not hesitate to call me
per the request of lorna
attached is a blackline of that legal opinion
can you forward to karen a copy of the lastest electronic trading agreement
i'm not comfortable that what i have is the latest
much thanks
in order to deal with the online trading program as well as other issues that repeatedly arise
we need to make some modifications to our master swap agreement database
foremost
we would like to open the master swap agreement database to any ect
ect canada or ect international employee that would like access to the information
this would include employees in the london
oslo
singapore
portland and buenos aires offices
the only information we need to continue to restrict is the legal and credit comment section
attorney-client privilege issues
access to this information would continue to be limited to legal and credit in addition
it also very critical that only legal and credit have access to the portland general masters
second
we will need to add some drop downs to deal with online trading issues
online trading will commence by the end of the month and we need to have this information and access available by that time
in addition
we have remaining
kinks
in the database we need to resolve
can you let me know when you would be available to meet to discuss the changes
thanks for your help
how about wednesday at 0:0 am
please find attached annex b.doc
barry tycholiz has asked me to confirm for you that we do have a master in place with husky
we do
indeed
and i will shoot a copy down to you
i faxed over some changes thursday
i deleted all references to ect and ect legal advisors being a party to the opinion
haedicke is an officer of ect international
he is general counsel and managing director
and so he can sign as such
no need to pull ect into the opinion when unnecessary
mark wanted me to let you know he is reviewing your legal opinion and will call you with his comments
what is this email about
do i need to do anything
also
your attachment is unreadable because the columns are overlapping
i was told this was supposed to be an omnibus
not a deemed isda
i checked our records and we do not have any master swap agreement with either k&n marketing or kinder morgan
perhaps credit knows something about this
in addition
we cannot approve any merger documents until we get copies of the merger documents filed with the relevant secretary of state
marilyn colbert usually provides them to us
pam
per the email below
we will be terminating the transactions referenced below today
can you fax me the confirmations referenced in #0 below so i can make sure i have referenced them correctly
much thanks
attached is the proposed form of termination agreement
i have requested copies of the relevant confirmations from the confirm desk to confirm that the transactions are referenced correctly
please let me know if you have any comments
mark taylor asked if we could make one additional change to the database
he wants to move the
restrictions
right after the counterparty name so it's the first thing the dealmakers see when the open an entry
thanks
we really appreciate your help
please find attached form of deemed isda
when you fax it to the counterparty can you please attach to the back of the fax irs forms 0 and w-0
much thanks
mark asked if you could add something else
could you add an additonal drop down that follows
legal contacts that says
historical contacts
we wouldn't want anyone else to see that but legal and credit
thanks
peter
mark took a look at your termination and he thought it looked fine
actually
he liked your termination and release better than the language we have in our form
so we're changing our form
you are the man
i checked the new york law when i drafted the termination so you're ok there
i'll be out all next week
my mom's coming into town for the thanksgiving holidays
if you need to get hold of me my assistant will have my cell phone number
since it's nymex bid week and both mark and i will be out
i have to be reachable
mark will have an international cell phone with him
he's sailing in the caribbean
so if you need to get hold of him for any reason
taffy will have the number
let me know if i can be of further help today
if you need to get hold of us next week
mark and my cell phone numbers are as follows
mark

can you please give sara the nymex numbers to review while mark and i are out
thanks
peter
is there anything i need to do on this project
i am in room eb0
eb0 was my old office
thanks for the article
i will distribute it to our group and credit
with online trading quieting down a bit
mark and i are finally focusing on
project fishkin
as we call it
i am already getting a new database developed
the jurisdictional database
to keep track of swap laws around the world
we hope to finalize our recommendations soon
and get the project up to haedicke for his approval
of course
online trading goes live today to our customers
so there's not telling what problems may crop up
i'm crossing my fingers for a quiet day
hope your holidays went well
my mom came down from new york
and it was colder in houston than it was at home
if you have a complete list regarding the enserch entities we wish to trade with
i can run it by enserch and check on the legal names
i think it would be helpful for our full distribution
legal
confirm and others
settlements
global contracts
misc
if you would distribute a full list of the enserch entities we wish to continue trading with and what business out of each entity
i think this will stop people coming back and asking again and again
frank
mark asked me to handle this
can you forward to me the name and phone number of the person that signed the password application
thanks
peter
i looked at the banque paribas agreement
it is an isda master agreement
multicurrency-cross border
dated as of june 0
0
the agreement was executed between ect and banque paribas
banque paribas changed its name to
paribas
on may 0
0
so i think you need to change the agreement and signature line to read
paribas
formerly known as banque paribas
or something to that effect
the agreement is governed by new york law
pam
peter keohane
our calgary attorney
is working on a termination of some trades between ect and paribas and needs you to fax or send him the following confirmations asap
deal nos
ea0.0 and eb0.0
thanks yet again
from what we have been able to determine
it appears that the city of riverside is not authorized to invest in any types of financial derivatives
joe
i just found out pam is out today and peter needs these confirms asap
can you get them to him
thanks
thanks for your prompt help with this
i know peter appreciates it
i asked richard ramirez if there was a business contact and he said he didn't know
but he was going to get back to me
i think in his job in fuel and energy risk management
he is probably the business contact
he probably makes the decisions about fuel purchases and derivatives hedging
he also wanted to get a power enabling agreement in place
i spoke to liz sager and she said we already had a power trade on the books and except for authority issues
there was no reason not to do financial energy
as far as sending my lotus notes comment
i just did that manually
i spoke to the lotus notes people before i went on vacation
and among other changes
they are going to try and fix it so we can just click on the email address and it will notify people to see lotus notes
of course
the only groups that will have access to the comment sections of lotus notes
for confidentiality purposes
will continue to be legal and credit
but we are going to open everything but the comments and
priority
screens to any interested business people
i'm going to move the
restrictions
bar right after the name so when the business people look the first thing they will see will be any restrictions
then
i'm going to add a drop down for online trading
approved or not
and then a comment screen
that only legal and credit can see
so we will have some notes about why we approved them or not
some of us are getting old and can't remember things
i got a call from the lower colorado river authority today asking us if we would like to put a power enabling and isda master agreement in place with them
i spoke to liz sager and it appears we have already done a physical power trade with them
of course
we can still not do financial trading until we run through all the hoops with them
i don't know who you directed your marketing package to
but he wanted some information on online trading and i said we would send him a packet

we have resolved the authority issue with referenced counterparty
and have approved all financial trading
including online financial trading
under the executed isda master agreement between ect and this counterparty dated june
in response to your email re
richardson products ii
this counterparty was approved for trading
without a master then in place
under my initial list of approved counterparties
per the email below
we then received in the signed master and the distribution was notified
yes
i had already approved them for trading without any restrictions
when i got the signed master in
it just meant that the confirmations now took a different path
something that yall will find helpful
i've been working with the lotus notes people in upgrading our current master swap agreement database
and once its finalized we will be opening view access to anyone who wants it
i am adding drop downs for
approved for online trading
so you will be able to confirm our approval
als
contract information which is currently provided on a monthly basis will now be available at all times
i think other groups that rely on our contract information
credit
settlements
global contracts
eol
dealmakers
or anyone else
at ect or ect canada for confidentiality purposes
will now be able to be seeing what we're seeing in terms of the financial contacts
i was told my prototype would be done by the end of the week
and then we'll have to test it
but hopefully this information will be available soon
i hope this is helpful
in response to your email
an amendment to the referenced executed isda master was sent by susan bailey to the counterparty on 0/0/0
with respect to the credit
this amendment provides for an increase in the counterparty exposure threshold from u.s
$0,0,0 to u.s
$0,0,0
and amends one of the mac provisions for counterparty by increasing counterparty's net worth from cad$0,0,0 to cad$0,0,0
certain other changes are being made to agreement including amending certain of the the lc provisions
as well other changes to legal terms that will incorporate our recent form changes
this amendment has not been executed
other credit in the agreement not being amended includes 0rd party debt default for counterparty of cad$0,0,0 and u.s
$0,0,0 with respect to enron corp
an exposure threshold for ect canada of $0,0,0
and a mac for ect canada tied to a drop in enron corp.'s credit rating below
bbb
from s&p
the other mac for counterparty that is not being changed is if counterparty's ratio of its funded debt to net worth is more than 0 to 0
i hope that helps
let me know if you need more info or if you need me to fax these documents to you

molly
why were the counterparties on your latest list under the legal tab different from those under the credit tab
the counterparties below for review are under the credit approval tab
please let me know asap if they are approved to trade
attached is another list for approval
under the comments section
if it says
declined
you do not need to review it because credit has not approved the counterparty to trade
if it says
division
it means that it is a division
and credit has already approved it to trade under the counterparty name to the right
if it doesn't say anything
it means it has been approved to trade and those are the counterparties you should be reviewing
if you open in
view
you will be able to see it
thanks for your prompt response
you get a gold star for the week

i will assume the counterparty is approved to trade all the products that credit has approved for that counterparty
we rarely expect counterparty issues from the physical trading groups
most of the counterparty issues will be with the financial trading counterparties
i only need to hear from you if you have a problem with a counterparty
most of the physical trading group's issues will revolve around which contract to use
and that should be resolved directly with global contracts
in the same way you resolve such issues on an
off-line
basis
credit is redoing the 0/0 and 0/0 lists they sent to me earlier
and i will forward them to you as soon as i receive them
what is was is that the document was in word 0 and we work in word 0
so i just had to go in and open word 0
i think what you are doing is what they are trying to get up and going here in houston
but they're not ready yet
mine and mark's questions to you is who goes down the legal list and says yes or no to trading
attached are the final lists for this week for your approval
again
if i do not hear from the respective physical trading groups in 0 day i will assume that all counterparties are approved
another list
are you approving this for financial trading
per our conversations last week
i thought it would not meet the eligible swap participant criteria
let me know
any word back of city of riverside
unless otherwise noted on a going forward basis
unless i specifically mention a physical product
all physical counterparties will be approved for all the products that credit has approved them for
if i have an exception
it will be noted
otherwise consider that the rule
most of the comments i will have relate to financial counterparties
for financial i am not responding to credits
declined
counterparties

ashland speciality chemicals company
a division of ashland inc

thanks for your prompt reply
what a happy coincidence about the book
we'll have to share thoughts when we're done reading it
the new york times gave it a rave review
which made it so popular it was sold out for quite some time
i've had to scold our buddy up there in the frozen north
he's having to work on a master physical/financial netting agreement for a canadian counterparty and has been calling me to ask basic isda questions that were covered in my class
i told him if you two were paying more attention instead of clowning around so much
oh well
good thing i can't get him with a ruler up in canada
take care
and i'll look forward to chatting with you
i just got off the phone with aquila's kansas city attorney about online trading issues and he said he would like to get an isda master in place with us
he said the contact to negotiate is their calgary attorney
carissa browning at
0
0-0
i told him i would pass on the request to our credit team
much thanks
mr
harrell
thanks for the lovely note about the execution rate
when we had a big group meeting a few months ago we
legal
were actually surprised by our success level at that time
but these numbers exceed our expectations
since you congratulated credit
i took it upon myself to also email the message to credit
too
fyi
i just got a call from stuart rosman
who is meeting with the referenced counterparty right now
ncpa would like to get a password in place today to start trading
and there seems to be some confusion as to what types of transactions they can do online
per my earlier approval
this counterparty can trade any physical products under the credit terms established by credit
they
however
cannot trade financial until we get an isda master in place
and have told stuart they are currently not interested in trading financial
stuart said he would be calling carrie in about 0/0 to make sure this message is conveyed to her
if anyone is aware of any problems here
please convey them to carrie asap
karen
i don't know that i need to get these lists from you that reference the contract numbers
i really don't know anything relative to contracts numbers
what was helpful was your memo earlier that listed the rejected masters
i took at look at it and then distributed it to the legal eol team
thanks
can you take a look at this and let me know what you think
per my conversation with frank
we are opening up the referenced counterparty to trade financial under the division name indicated above
here is a rough first draft of our jurisdictional database
summary of swap laws
besides the obvious typos
how does this work for you
thank you for such a prompt turnaround
i have forward your email to our swap lawyers for their input and hope to get back to you shortly

with respect to the attached list

i don't know how you want to handle that
i have not
xed
out european physical power from the attached list
what should we do on a going forward basis
russell
on public service company of colorado

i don't have any changes to what i've previously said about the counterparty unless i add

which i didn't have any on these lists
so just keep the legal approvals the same

read only
counterparty
so i didn't bother responding to that list
for physical power
again
even
tho i'm not saying it
no
for european based physical power products
well
i got your new website added as a shortcut in my mail directory
so now i can bother you at will

we had a rather uninspiring flight back from new york
craig watched
inspector gadget
on the inflight movie
he said it was really bad
and danelia read the bible the whole way
the only good news is we arrive 0/0 hour early
the weather was so warm in houston that we had to turn the air on in the car
it cooled off a bit today and we need sweaters
when i got home i spent the rest of yesterday moving my plants back out of the garage where i moved them for the freeze that never arrived
that's one thing i hate about houston winters
you can never count on it staying cold so i have to keep moving the plants in and out
after that
i aired out my house and vacuumed from the stinky kitty litter box
then i ordered in chinese and read three days of newspapers
very relaxing
don't i have an exciting life
keep in touch
i tried ridggway@concentric.net and it didn't work
is there some type there
we have received the signed faxed copy of the letter agreement dated 0/0/0 amending the eta for the referenced counterparty
copies will be distributed

what's the scoop

attached is the referenced counterparty approval list
per earlier emails
no u.s
counterparty should be approved for european power until we hear otherwise
also
per my email yesterday
cms marketing

i'd be glad to go
julie gomez
that's who it was
lunch sounds good
we have received the executed amendment to the eta for the referenced counterparty dated 0/0/0

ok with me
we are closing to finalizing a lotus notes database for us to keep track of approvals for online trading counterparties and any amendments to online trading documents
once the database is done
i
and you
i guess
will have to input the data for the houston and london based credit counterparties
i am forward to you this early draft of the database for you to see what it looks like
you will have to go into
create new counterparty
to see the format once you opened the database up
we're still revising it to add a drop down for amendments to online trading documents
and then we're going to have a sort similar to the pending swap update sort on lotus notes
that will show the counterparty name
approved for online trading
yes or no
and then follow with any amendments to the online agreements
this will
obviously
help us keep track of if and why we've approved a counterparty
and also help us generate reports to the online trading team
access will currently be granted to the same people who have access to the master swap agreement database
if you have any additional credit online people to add let me know
we hope to have it ready within the week so we can start populating it with the information
can you add the regularly scheduled legal/credit meetings
and the swap group meeting for my calendar for the year
thanks
how goes figuring out why our positions were so far off
with respect to your email below
i am already working with bob bowen on assigning the various aquila trades
on amoco
i will need to get a list similar to the one bob prepared for me for aquila
showing the exact trades being assigned
deal no
whether they are physical or financial
trade date
start date
end date
etc
if you get with bob he can show you what he prepared for me for aquila
once i get that i can prepare the assignment
i will also need the name and phone number for the amoco person i should be sending this assignment to
i don't know who will have that
the confirm desk
settlements
or eol
once i get all this i can prepare that assignment
i don't know what you mean about the positions being
defunct
we have no idea
we rely on you to tell us what the positions are
without calling each of the respective traders
we do not know any of the positions

we are going to open aquila risk management corporation to trade weather under the eol gtc's
as a further to my previous email
the eol group will code the weather transactions to fall under the financial master
and the confirmation desk should confirm the weather trades under the current form of confirmation
attached is referenced list
continuing being boring
no european power until further notice
our only concerns are that we have the appropriate tax forms signed and in-house before they start trading
if they trade u.s
products from the uk we will have to get the appropriate u.s
tax forms in
and edmund can address any uk tax forms they might need on uk products traded from the uk
please change your records to relect that legal has agreed to open the referenced counterparty to trade any financial products
for a netherlands incorporated counterparty wanting to do a weather option transaction
on the list you sent me earlier for the approved products for european countries
you had no options or swaptions for commodity derivatives
but nothing on weather
what's the scoop on weather options
williams energy marketing
trading company shouldn't be a problem for weather transactions
the master agreement we have in place with them is an isda local currency
the only thing we need to cover is in the confirmation adding the trade option rep for weather
since weather wasn't covered way back then
otherwise
they are already approved for all products for online trading
since the master is a local currency form
we might run into some problems if they wanted to trade non-u.s based products
or use any other currency other than u.s
$$
if either of those issues come up
let me know
attached are the referenced list

no european physical power for u.s

at the request of sara shackleton
i am attaching my list of north america
utility
counterparties
my given task when i compiled this list was to identify
utilities
and determine if there was a reason we should not approve online trading for the counterparty
we originally denied approval for all utilities unless we had a master agreement in place or an overriding commercial reason to transact
we are now taking the position that investor owned utilities
ious
and related corporate entities should be approved for trading
however
we will not approve online trading for governmentals or cooperatives when we do not have a master in place
so those counterparties identified as such do not need to be included in your review
obviously
if you are aware of a municipal or cooperative i failed to detect
please let us know
in addition
your review does not need to extend to the canadian counterparties
we will run those by canadian counsel
please review the list to help us identify the ious
you may ignore the
approved for trading
column
for your information
the list was compiled from information provided from our credit department
from the company's financial statements which i obtained from edgar
from the company's web site
from www.utilityconnection.com
or from web searches of the company when i could not locate information from any of the other sources
please give us a call tomorrow to discuss briefly
we received a notice from the nymex today that they have set march 0 as the date for power to go ex-pit
i will send each of you a copy of the memo
copies are also being immediately hand delivered to jim fallon and tim

0

the body corporate
needs to always be on the confirm
physical
my reports from the other legal trading groups are that they have no contracts in place
although it is somewhat unclear on the physical gas side as to whether global contracts as to whether we have any physical gas master in place
mark just had to run down quick to a meeting

counterparties until further notice
i just got some late changes in from leslie
so please hold list i just send you until she resolves these issues
thanks
here is my revised list incorporating leslie hansen's power comments
attached please find referenced list
the only amended counterparty with a change was murphy exploration which was shut down for power
i wonder
when we are working with amended counterparties
if there is some way that my prior approval could be on the recent spread sheet
right now i have to go find the old spread sheet to find out what i approved it for last time to see if i have any problem with the change
so usually
unless i have
change next to amended
it means i had no change to what i said before
does that make sens
i am actually working on the pieces of the project
but the overall
system
still needs to be designed
i've been working with our computer people to upgrade our master swap agreement database
we will be capturing some additional information that we hope will somehow later on feed into the autoconfirm process
then
once we work out confidentiality issues relating to our comments section and different companies
we will be opening the database to all interested ena employees
i've developed two new databases
we're currently working the kinks out of
first is our
jurisdictional database
which will summarize the swap laws as they relate to each country
our international business is growing and its becoming imperative that we get this up and going
i've actually got the database designed
we're working some kinks out and i hope lawyers can start briefing the country information soon
of course
the compelling project for us over the last 0-0 months has been online trading
i was made the primary legal contact to deal with all the business units for online trading counterparty approvals and contract information
with thousands of counterparties being approved initially and on a ongoing basis we needed a database to keep track of which counterparties we have approved or disapproved
and tie each product to a contract
we have that system ready now and i am finishing having the data inputted
the other part of the system will be our library of research memoranda
legal advice
etc
this will be a cross product library
financial
physical
power
etc
i think i am going to dupe a database the european office has in place to create ours
the major complaint i have heard from some of them is that the index is not user friendly and they cannot find things when they want them
so i've got to create a lawyer user friendly index
among other documents
this is i think where our forms might reside
in addition
all the research and advice on various legal issues we've received from outside counsel
as well as isda netting opinions and the like
i think this library will be maintained on the same worldwide web our contracts are being scanned into and kept
i think we can buy a scanner that will scan the documents in
then the web is already set up so we can have our documents available around the world
so the setup for this might go quickly
although compiling all of our legal advice from the various offices and lawyers might be more of a problem
the last part we've got to develop is the then overall place or site for all these various databases
so i think necessity has made me develop the pieces before the overall system
maybe when you have time we can have a chat about all this
it's a date
would you like me to make reservations at someplace nice
or just go casual
fyi
today is the date for renewal of the consent of service of process in connection with the isda master agreement in place with the referenced counterparty
i have faxed mr
blaquier a request to provide me with evidence of such renewal
i will keep you apprised

can one of you provide me with a new fax
phone numbe ror contact mr

el paso energy marketing canada inc
i am having a messenger walk a copy down to each of you and need your direction as to whether we should consent to this assignment
i have had to revise the list i provided to you earlier
the change was shutting kimball down for financial as well
shari
how do you want to handle this
i spoke to howard volz at ct corporation today
and he said he sent the renewal to dapsa in november
their renewal date is feb
0 of each year
and hasn't heard from them
i asked him to refax the renewal notice to them
he said ct will not revoke the consent for about 0-0 more weeks
so we've got some time to resolve this
i'll keep you posted
i do not appear to be having a winning record for getting my approval list right the first time today
attached is also a revised list for 0/0/0

about the canadian master netting agreements
attached please find referenced list
again
no european power for u.s
counterparties until further notice
on sithe power where we only changed the counterparty id #
there is no change from my previous approval
i understand there is a little confusion regarding what products we can trade under the
master master
for the referenced counterparty
it's not surprising
it's a confusing master
this is currently the only agreement we have in place that contains terms for trading both physical and financial transactions in one agreement
there is a master trading agreement dated february 0
0 in place between ect and aig trading corporation
now known as sempra energy trading corp
global contract reference no
0
this agreement provides for financial swap
option and swaption transactions
excluding weather
and further provides for physical natural gas transactions only
it does not provide for any other physical products
call me if you have any questions
just a reminder to talk to me monday about the utilities
i was not aware we were not currently trading financial power
which they are getting ready to open up
i figure the utilities will start squealing loudly when they cannot trade
so
i've go to start opening up my utilities
marie was just telling me about your rough tour of duty in the french alps next week

marie and i had a giggle over your email
who's dana
mark and i were discussing my potential purchase of a car
and were looking at some web sites
and thought we would pass on the following car buying web sites
www.edmunds.com
tells you what prices to pay for cars
safety records
www.consumer.org
consumer reports magazine web site
more to car safety
repair records
www.carclub.com
if you go to
research advice
then click on
crash test results
they have some info on suv crash tests
since y'all don't have as many suv's on the road in england you may not know that some of them have failed the crash tests big time
and that also because their point of gravity is up higher they tend to rollover
or
tump
as we say here in texas
when you make a sharp turn
like to avoid an accident
anyway
we were a little concerned about your safety
you narratives aren't too long
i'm just giving you some grief
i have created a database for the legal dept
somewhat similar to how the master swap agreement database works
for us to keep track of our approvals for eol trading
as well as any executed amendments to the eol password application
eta
gtc
or any other eol documents
i have been inputting the data for the houston based credit counterparties
and was wondering whether you want me to input the london based credit counterparties or not
i have no idea whether you've approved them or not
you'll have to input that data
or you could send it to me and i can input it for you
also
i don't know what counterparties you've had since the initial three big counterparty lists
but i know you are busy and it might be hard for you to find the time to input the initial counterparty data
unless you have an assistant do that
anyway
we
me
since i'm the one approving all new counterparties for every legal group in houston
have been using it and are finding it very helpful
it is also helpful for when i'm out so mark taylor can look to see whether i've approved a counterparty or not and what rationale i had for the approval
usually i only put in info when i don't approve a counterparty
anyway
the link to the database is attached
so why don't you take a look at it just to see what i'm doing
we're still working on some of the sorts and inputting the data
so it's not fully operational yet
anyway
give me your thoughts
don't make any changes
it'll screw things up
attached please find the referenced list
as usual
no european power for u.s
counterparties until further ntocie
your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated
would you like to set up a time to chat
my calendar is pretty clear this week
except for tomorrow at 0:0 pm
we wish you the best for your vacation
i hope the rest of the credit group maintains the high standard of diligence and promptness that you have established
i haven't heard back from you about my eol database
i will hope that your lack of response means that you are busy
not in disapproval of my lovely database
attached please find the referenced lists
we have no changes to the amended counterparties

can your business contact there give them a call
thanks
per my conversations with john suttle in credit
i am opening up the referenced counterparty to trade all financial products
just a reminder
to talk to tim belden
why do we have two active masters
because it appears that synder/santa fe merged and susan b
did not handle to multiple master issue
in looking through lotus notes for eol
it appears we have two active masters for santa fe snyder corporation
does anyone know which one is the active master
the master agreement for this counterparty appears to not cover the trade option exemption
are we adding that into confirms
when would you like to discuss utilities
i went through our lotus notes master swap agreement database and determined that the following masters do not permit power
the bakersfield californian newprint only cgas

credit did not have ionic energy down as an amended counterparty

below is the new drop down i need added
trade option representation

standard weather included enron must be offeree none other mike
the above should have a box to check
and the box should always check
standard

and got no response from them
we will need to update the isda we sent them in july since our form has changed since then
once we get the go ahead from john suttle in credit as to whether we need to update the credit
we will prepare the isda master agreement you have requested
my pleasure
there are no changes from my previous approvals for the two counterparties on this list
no
they never gave me an updated copy
per my conversation with credit
it appears there are two northern states power companies
we have already reviewed northern states power company
a minnesota corporation
cpy id #0
the counterparty that showed up on yesterday's list is northern states power company
a wisconsin corporation
cpy id #0
the wisconsin corporation is a sub of the minnesota corporation
i don't know if this makes any difference in your approvals
robin newman matthew bender
co
with the execution of the wisconsin gas company master
this brings the total executed financial masters to 0
the countdown to 0 executed financial masters is now starting
congratulations to the legal and credit teams for getting us to this point and for a job well done
leslie
why am i getting this information below
these counterparties are not on my approval lists for the last few days
did frank ask you questions re
the counterparties below
and you just want me to put this info in the eol legal database
with regard to our annual review of this list of laws we need to comply with
do we not want to add the canadian provinces new
eligible swap participant
equivalant rules
rick tucker at pan canadian
he used to be at pg&e
called and has been speaking to willie harrell on the confirm desk
and i believe willie spoke to mark about this issue yesterday
but it appears to be unresolved and i think mark was going to talk to you about it
pan canadian is doing eol trades
and wants to know why he keeps getting the online confirms w/the gtc's attached since the way the system is set up he technically is already agreeing to the gtc's online
he feels he is having to look at a lot of unnecessary paper
rick will be out of the office friday and monday
but was hoping you could give him a call tuesday to discuss this issue
his phone # is 0/0-0
fyi
we do not have a master in place with pan canadian energy services
attached please find the referenced lists
please note
tampa electric company can do power sells only
even though peoples gas is a division of tampa electric
it cannot trade power because its power marketing license was not granted in that name
further
i earlier shut down tampa electric company for financial trading
and i am now opening them up for financial trading
either as tampa electric or peoples gas
i am confirming my conversation with you yesterday and my conversation a minute ago with lori volpi at dynegy canada
as we discussed
dynegy canada is trading with both ecc and ena
with the bulk of its trading being done with ecc
instead of getting two isda master agreements in place
we will enter into an isda master agreement between ecc and dynegy canada
and then just back-to-back any ena trades down to houston by virtue of the services agreement for financial agreements we have in place between ecc and ena
per my conversation with lori
this will also work with the eol trades since the electronic trading agreement provides that any financial trades done for either ecc or ena will be transacted under the respective master agreement in place with either ecc or ena
works for me
i would be more than happy to update the database with any comments you may want me to add
don't ever feel bad
when i don't expect something i just need to know what it's about
i hope we can open the eol legal database soon so you can update any comments or notes directly into it
in response to your email

the nymex did not have dana davis down as a user because he just completed and signed his application wednesday evening and the nymex received the application by fedex thursday
it will take several days for them to process his application
further
he still needs to attend their training session in ny
i hope this coming wednesday
before he will be able to trade online
0
as far as the problem with only one user being able to get in nymex access at a time
i have a call into the nymex about this
we get a terminal per seat
so since we have two seats
we get two terminals at no cost
the 0 additional terminals have to be leased from other nymex members and the nymex is arranging the initial lease for us and will pay the lease
cost free for the first 0 months
after 0 months any cost associated with the 0 additonal terminals will have to be borne by ena
i have a call into the nymex to find out what the status of our 0 leases is
0
bruce
per your voicemail about you or a member of your group having the ability to change operator access to these terminals
changes in the terminal operator approvals can only be done by the two seatholders
who are currently mark haedicke and kevin hannon
any changes with respect to operators will have to be done by full application to the nymex
therefore
such process should continue to be done through the legal department
below are the account numbers at salomon smith barney that you will need to trade nymex access power
for those of you who haven't done business with salomon smith barney before
our trader contact there is john galperin at

per the request of mark taylor
i am forwarding the attached
attached is the list of the counterparties that eol wants to approve for emissions auction trading
please let me know asap if there are any counterparties on this list that should not be allowed to trade emissions auctions
per the note below from brent
i am going to inactivate this master
also
per his note
it appears you should make a note to review the credit prior to approving any future trades
i had calpine power services company shut down for financial
and we got the master in signed
so i am going to open them up
can you add them to tomorrow's list
thanks
i don't know what list you are working from for your approval of credit derivatives
but attached is the list eol sent me
many of the counterparties on the list are london based credit counterparties
and i will not be reviewing those
but i thought you might want to take a look at this to see if it's jiving with what you're looking at
when i'm done
probably some time at end of the day since i just got the list yesterday and it's due today
i will be emailing my approvals to mark dilworth in london
just a reminder to send me a memo asking me to delete bob shultz as and eol signatory and add sheri thomas in his place
much thanks
to confirm our conversation
can you add
credit derivatives
as a new products to my database
we will need the same drop downs as the other produsts
gas trading
financial trading
etc
thanks
i am aware that you need a list from me
i am working on it right now
i just got the list from eol yesterday and i'm reviewing it as fast as i can
my goal is to get it done by the end of my workday
so you should have it when you arrive in the morning
there should be no question of duplication of isda master agreement or any other master swap agreements between houston and london
because houston's contracting party is usually enron north america corp
and london's contracting party is usually enron capital
trade resources international corp
we cannot do business under each others
financial master agreements for legal and tax reasons
ena and enron canada corp
can do business under each other's masters because the tax reasons that used to require us to separate out the business went away
further
houston and canada subsequently entered into a services agreement which sets forth the conditions upon which they can act on each other's behalf
necessary for tax and legal reasons
below is the list of the final work we need you to bid on for the downstairs apartment

so i am going to open them up for weather
attached is the referenced list
i am responsible for those counterparties originating from houston credit
edmund cooper is responsible for the uk credit based counterparties
i am still resolving issues on about 0-0 counterparties
if something doesn't make sense

you are the best
we've received a personal invitation to a nymex crawfish boil on april 0 at 0:0 at garden in the heights at 0 feagan
the cause of this celebration is the 0th anniversary of the nat gas futures contract
it would be nice if shankman and john arnold could attend
perhaps you can give them a personal invitation
we have received the amendment to the bc gas isda master executed by bc gas
which adds the canadian securities representation
so we don't have to add the rep into every confirm
bc gas won't sign the confirms with the rep in
and this has caused much difficulties
i am going to count it as signed
since bc gas has signed
but we still need it to be signed by ecc
can you get it signed asap and back to me
much thanks
we have received the executed amendment to the subscription agreement with weathertrade
inc

0
this amendment amends the transaction fee referenced in subparagraph

updating another blue file because susan b
this time
has not updated it to reference mergers
name changes
it appears you missed some cpys on the referenced list because tom had the freeze panel button on
and you probably didn't see them at first
i didn't either until i clicked on the down button and they popped up
when you have a minute
i'll give me a call and i'll come around and show you how to unfreeze the panel
i spoke to edmund to get the scoop on what we are going to be doing on the confirms for credit derivatives
and he said that his current understanding is that all of the confirms will be done out of london
i communicated that to bob bowen
he also said that london was going to be hiring 0 people to deal with the credit derivatives business
wow
carol
will you handle this or mark
we have received the executed first amendment to isda master agreement dated as of december 0
0
this amendment adds the british columbia securities act representation to the master
copies will be distributed
confirmation desk
you can stop adding the rep to the confirms now
here's the list with the missing counterparties
probably
i just got a call from dave and frank and they tell me i have a whole week this time to approve the whole counterparty list to trade australian financial power
i'll need to talk to you about his monday
hey guys
take monday off
isda has published the referenced supplement
among other changes
the supplement adds hundreds of new gas
liquids and power price sources
copies will be distributed to you
attached is the referenced list
some comments
we got a master financial agreement in place with calpine power services company so it has been opened up to trade all financial
also
we replaced the old style
erms master
with an isda
so i am opening txu energy trading company for all financial products as well
for trammo gas
we got a letter from them a while back
reflecting under what names they can do financial trading under
i sent you all an email about this about a month to two months ago
that letter had the counterparty styled
transammonia
inc
acting through its trammo gas division
i believe i already siad they could trade financial under that name
let's just be consistent about how we deal with these divisions
david
i know we've met before on your visits to houston
i am a paralegal in the ena legal department
in the swap group under mark taylor
i am the lead contact in ena legal for counterparty approvals and day to day trading issues for enrononline
i coordinate responses for the whole legal trading group
financial
physical
power and emerging markets
with the enrononline and credit teams
i understand from my enrononline team that i am going to need to approve financial trading for all my houston based counterparties a week from friday
right now that list stands at about 0 counterparties
already trading
i was hoping you could direct me as to what restrictions
if any
we might have for financial trading in australia
are there any restricted counterparties
such as governmentals
utilities
banks
dealers
etc
or any restrictions on the products traded
initially i know we are only trading financial power
although i'm sure the list will expand over time
have your gtc's been drafted with cross-border trading in mind
similarly
i assume there will be australian counterparties signing up to trade
and the commercial team will want them approved to trade the whole range of enrononline products
are there any provisions we must add to the form of north american product gtcs if our counterparties trade a north american product from australia
do we have any tax issues or language we need to cover
our standard form of gtc includes new york law and arbitration
will that be enforceable in australia
are there any issues we need to address if we require collateral
a guaranty or letter of credit
with respect to a trade
thanks for your help
i am still the person who does the nymex filings
they are due the end of july
so we should probably target them to be done a little earlier
since we always seem to need more time
sheri
i need the trade date so i know what to date the termination
i sent the documents to paul davis on march 0
per my conversation a minute ago with the koch lawyer in kansas
tye darland
koch hydrocarbons
inc
is a bad name
the correct legal name for this counterparty should be the same as it is set up in our master swap agreement database
koch industries
inc
acting through its koch hydrocarbon company division
i have called the koch trader
james
doug
peters
0/0-0
ext
0
and asked him to resubmit the password application with the name corrected
please show this correction in your records as well
please take me off your distribution
i already bought my new car
thank
i understand from mark that in order to open up the utilities to trade financial
we will need to amend the gtc's to add some additional reps and provisions
do you have a timetable for when we will be able to do that
did you forget something in your email
several things are not very clear to me and i need to run them by you
0
from your email it appears to me that there would be no legal reason prohibiting your australian based counterparties from trading all of the products we offer
however
except for financial australian power
the contracting enron entity will have to be the party referenced on the particular product
it appears that the only product credit has currently opened the australian based counterparties to trade anyway is australian financial power
0
will you be approving the australian based counterparties for trading
dave forster appears to want me to approve australian based counterparties too
which doesn't make sense to me and mark taylor
what are your thoughts on this
i guess enrononline just does not want a third legal contract they are going to have to deal with on an ongoing basis
fyi
i currently do not approve the london based counterparties
0
the australian company number
does that have to go on every confirmation done with an australian counterparty
if it does we will need to make sure that it gets put on every confirmation
it is my understanding that the confirmations for online trading will be generated from houston so we will have to provide every company number to the houston confirmation desk
fyi
tomorrow at the end of the day is my drop dead time to get all the counterparies approved
because the information will have to be loaded in by london when they arrive for work friday morning
as you may or may not be aware of
tomorrow is the drop dead date for approval of the referenced new product for our existing approved counterparty list
thinking through this product today and reading through my various emails from david minns
i have come to the conclusion that there are no particular issues specifically relating to australian financial power
and my thinking is to just mirror the approval for some other previously approved financial power product
i can't
obviously
speak for you
but it seems to me that that should work for your counterparty lists too
what do you think
the list i am working off of is the list generated for credit derivative approvals
which is the most somewhat current list of counterparties who have been issued passwords
mark taylor
who is in amsterdam this week
just left me a voicemail reflecting a conversation he just had with dave forster
and asked me to relay the following information to you
don't kill me
i'm just the messenger
with respect to your form of online gtc
it need to be revised
per dave forster by monday
to be expanded to include the provisions necessary that will enable a non-australian based counterparty
a counterparty could be u.s
canadian
european or other country based
who may or may not have an isda master agreement in place
and may or may not have credit in place
to do a financial power transaction with enron australia
in that regard i am attaching as a template
our form of online
deemed isda
gtc
for a weather transaction
the only type of financial transaction where we adopt the isda documentation instead of using our own form of confirmation
as you can see when you look at our
deemed isda
form of confirmation
there are a number of provisions that our deemed isda form of confirmation includes
such as authority and tax representations
arm's length transaction
reps
acting as a principal rep
the deletion of section 0
c
ii
of the isda schedule
netting
in respect of the same transaction
no language that each party has a copy of the isda form and has read it and understands it
your deletion of language re
written confirmations
definition of
transaction
meaning the gtc+isda form+website terms
website
uppercased
is a defined term under the password application
we usually say
loss
instead of
market quotation
also
market quotation and second method will apply for the purposes of section 0
e
a question
do we need the word
integrated
with respect to the rerenced that the documents contain a
single agreement
to fall under the u.s
bankruptcy swap protection
no ducment conflict provisions
missing our
severability
and
setoff
language
no adoption of the 0 or 0 commodity definitions
business day defined as sydney only
etc
of course
you do not have these in your form of gtc
because they are or will be covered in your executed isda master agreement
but it is likely counterparties outside of australia may not have a master swap agreement in place
i spoke to steve douglas in tax
who is out of town today and was going to talk to susan musch about the tax issues and i hope to hear from him tomorrow
after all the above
i just have to say
we really do appreciate your help resolving all these issues
debbie
thanks for the heads up on this
i've been trying to get david minns for several days about various issues
keep me posted
per an earlier conveersation with dave
ee weren't quite sure if you have seen a listing yet of all of the products we offer online
so i am sending you one of our excel spreadsheets which has at the top of it all of the products we offer
as well as the enron entity that a counterparty would enter into the trade with
attached is the list reflecting the approval of the initial australian counterparties to trade australian financial power only
david minns will have to get back to us about all the other products
for the current u.s
list of counterparties
just mirror the approvals for
us power financial swaps
i will review the list debbie is sending me tomorrow to see if any of her approvals conflicts with my earlier approvals
but i think we should be fine
thanks for returning my message
i had an australian issue come up and anyone who was familiar with australian law was unreachable and i was in an absolute panic
but as things usually do
this problem worked itself out too
as usual
i am always humbly in your debt
i have developed a database in which i keep track of the counterparties legal has approved
any supporting rationale for approval of each counterparty
i
m giving away my secret that i just don't approve them on on pure whim
and the products such counterparties are approved to trade
additionally
at the bottom of each entry there is a listing of any amendment to the password application
eta
gtc
or any other online documentation
the information for the financial products is pretty accurate
i may have missed an entry here or there in trying to enter 0 months of memos and excel spreadsheets
if i have missed a counterparty let me know
the information for power has been updated only since this database was in production
about 0-0 weeks ago
i am going to have to go back and input the power data from the original approval lists
as for gas trading and emerging products
we have never yet had a counterparty that we have had an issue with
so no information has been entered for those products
you should count them as being approved for everything
eventually
if we continue not to use those dropdowns
i will delete them
i don't know if you will find this information helpful or not
take a look and i will be glad to hear any input
obviously
we are all working out the kinks and finding out what is useful and what is not useful as we go along
so this database may evolve over time
the only people who should have change access are the legal team
mike neves
mark taylor
carol st clair
leslie hansen
marie heard and myself
let me know if you have change access by mistake
on a closing note
please try to keep the information in the database confidential to the group we have granted view access to
do not forward this email on to anyone as it will grant access without my approval
much thanks
i would like to take responsibility for the technical side of this
but in all honesty i must admit i'm just the idea guy
i'm know i'm breaking all your illusions about me today
i'll have no more secrets
0
per my discussion last week with david minns
i sent him a spreadsheet so he could scroll across the product list and see the full range of products enrononline offers so he could determine whether an australian based counterparty will have any legal problems entering into any of the enrononline products
it was my understanding that he had not seen a comprehensive list off all the products we offer
0
however
on a going forward basis
david minns or someone in legal will need to see the daily spreadsheets reflecting any new australian based counterparties because every new counterparty requesting a password needs a credit and a legal signoff for trading every products we offer
whether physical
financial
power
gas
liquids
weather
p&p
us
european or other country based product
etc
houston legal does it every day for every new houston credit based counterparty
london legal does it every day for every new london credit based counterparty and australian legal will need to do the same
if some other system will be in place in australia
david minns will need to discuss that with mark taylor and david forster
please find attached referenced lists
it is not clear to me yet how we are going to deal with australian approvals
so i think at this point you need to look to australia for approval of their counterparties
also
there were no counterparties to approve on 0/0/0 so that list is not attached
i haven't said it in a while
but no european power for us counterparties
mark
i discussed this issue friday with paul
however
since it is an issue i am not entirely knowledgeable about
i think paul should run this by you
lou
i left mark tawney a voicemail to call me re
the isda sample form
i'll need to know a little bit more about the company so i send them the right form
the nymex has approved all of your applications and you should all have access to the system and be able to trade
everyone except dana davis
who still needs to complete his training
please let me know if you cannot log in
i spoke to the nymex a minute ago and there is no reason from their perspective why you should not be able to log in
i have tried to call him directly but he was not available
yes
i left him a voicemail telling him i needed to know a little more about the counterparty so i could make sure i send them the right form
are they us or non-us counterparty
insurance company
energy company
etc
also
the name and address of his contact and i will send it directly if he would prefer that
we have received an executed amendment to electronic trading agreement with the referenced counterparty dated march 0
0
copies will be distributed
i will be out friday afternoon and monday afternoon for my termite and house inspections for my new house
we discussed your training in our group meeting yesterday
and mark gave me the go ahead to do a training
preferably a lunch training
sometime in april
if you could get together with the members of our team and send me an email of any items in particular you would like addressed
we will try to address them in our training
also
if you could get some dates for me we'll check them against our schedule
would your group organize this lunch or ours
how many people are we talking about
only global contract or global counterparty too
let me know the details so we can start planning
per my discussions with leslie hansen and dave forster
please restrict australian based counterparties from trading us physical power on a going forward basis
to the best of our knowledge
no australian based counterparty has been granted a ferc license to trade physical us power
this situation
of course
can change if a counterparty were to provide us evidence of their ferc licensing
on the list for 0/0/0
the only counterparty i am responding for is carthage energy
eventually i will be making the australian responses
but we are not there yet
on the 0/0/0 list
national energy was amended
and i had no changes to my previous approvals
western resources is an amended counterparty and i am opening them up for all financial and power
i spoke to harry collins
one of our emissions lawyers
and he said there should be no problem trading emissions with a governmental entity on the emissions auction website
as long as they can trade emissions generally
if you have any specific questions
call harry collins at x0
we have received the following executed master agreement
note
this master appears to have been signed in 0 and didn't make its way down to houston until now
type of contract
master agreement
ect canada form
effective date
0/0/0 executed date
0/0/0 enron entity
enron capital and trade resources canada corp
now known as enron canada corp
counterparty
originally
novagas clearinghouse limited partnership
now through name changes and merger
dynegy canada inc
transactions covered
energy price swaps or option transactions only
no pulp
paper
weather
interest rate
currency or fx
global contracts
we need to get this master inputted immediately into the enrononline system so all of the confirmations for ena and ecc will immediately roll up under this master
confirm desk
please immediately start rolling up all the ena and ecc trades under this master
whether online
offline
or brokered trades
novagas has a long and tortured history
when you've got a few hours and want to be incredibly bored i'll share it with you
let's just say that canada has been the only one aware of this signed master
you can quote my somewhat eloquent words
if it ain't in legal it ain't
you have been getting the excel spreadsheets on new counterparties now for several days
and at an agreed time i would like to include your approvals in with the rest of legal's
right now i am still telling the enrononline people that they have to look to australia for approvals
once we are in agreement about the parameters of my responses
and who your backup is
we can agree on a date when i will start responding for australia too
the theory will be that once i send you the email you will have 0 hours to respond or i will consider all the online products approved for ausralian counterparties
because of the time change issue
i think we need to make the time my approval will go out 0:0 p.m
the next day
which will be your morning
from the transmittal of the list
in connection with an internal audit regarding the safekeeping of margin funds and securities
enron corp
has asked us to provide them with a list of all the exchanges we trade on
what rules govern those exchanges and the products we trade on them
in particular the clearing arrangements
and any rules that govern brokers we may maintain funds or cash with
this should include all the products we may trade/hedge over an exchange including energy commodities
interest rates
currencies
equities
etc
can you please provide this information no later than friday of next week
much thanks
per my conversation with kathy bolan at pg&e energy trading
canada corporation
and my confirmation thereof with messrs
suttle and bowen
all cross-border trades between pg&e canada and ena should go under the master between pg&e canada and ecc
we have received the fully executed first amendment to isda master agreement dated as of december 0
0 between ecc and the referenced counterparty
this first amendment adds the british columbia securities representation to the isda master agreement
confirm desk
you no longer have to add this representation to every confirmation
i have not started responding for australia yet
can you add paul radous in credit with full edit capability to this database
much thanks
entergy power marketing corp
has applied for a password and has asked us to give them a
comfort letter
stating that the current trading with them will go under the respective master for the product and not the online gtc
i have spoken to credit and we are trading financial gas
physical gas
and physical power
through epmi
can you please let me know first
if you have a master agreement agreement in place with this counterparty would it govern the product or would we need to use an override letter and if the master agreement will govern the trades
please provide me the exact name
parties and date of the contract
obviously
as usual with online matters
this is a rush
as usual
you are the best
can you add the referenced counterparty to the next list
we just got a master in signed with them and they cannot trade weather
pulp
paper
fx
much thanks
per my conversation with kathy moore this morning
please open the referenced counterparty to trade all financial products
thanks for your help in getting this done
you're a star
can you add the referenced counterparty to the next list
we got a signed master agreement in place with them and i need to change the approvals
thanks
can you please add the new credit person below for full edit priviliges to the financial trading agreement database
much thanks

i am flying

if you are on my flight i would be happy to have you drive to the airport with me
if you need to know my reservations
i can email them to you
is everything ok
i'm glad to hear that everything is good
i'm so excited for you
you'll be a wonderful mother
attached is the proposed form of confidentiality agreement with platt's
some notes on the attached lists
0/0/0 list
the first two counterparties have no legal changes per my earlier approvals
0/0/0 list-we just got the financial master in signed and they cannot do pulp
paper and weather under it
ambac assurance corp
and salomon smith barney aaa energy fund
i have a temporary
no
for them for financial products until i get more information on them to determine what they are and what they can do
per credit
ambac only wants to trade credit derivatives
and salomon smith barney is currently not an eligible swap participant and cannot trade any financial
if we get a parent guaranty in that can change their eligible swap participant status
in the meantime i am trying to get more information on the fund to determine what if anything they can do
0/0/0 list-i previously had them shut down for all financial but am opening them up
i sent an email about that earlier this week
on this statoil trade
i guess this is a physical trade done with ena
can you do one of those handy dandy little sheets you do for me so i can attach them to my assignment
i am forever in your debt
marie and i were just looking at the activities list for the legal conference and noticed you were signed up to
relax at the resort
not to get you worked up or anything
but there is a huge outlet mall just outside san antonio
and there would be no shortage of cheap britches to be found
after all
it has been a few years since you cornered the market when you were here
and you probably need to keep up with the latest fashions
not to belabor a dead horse
but again style watchers are telling us that the fashion for spring and summer for men will be knee length
pedal pushers
we look forward to seeing our favorite englishman
delete this message after viewing
we don't want the other lads to get jealous
attached is a proposed form of confidentiality agreement for the referenced party
obviously frank
you are trying to kill me
david has sent us a memo re
procedures for approval to trade in australia that i think you will find helpful
i continue to say
no
for financial because they are not an eligible swap participant
for a counterparty to become an eligible swap participant if they are not one in their own right
they would have to post an up front letter of credit fully covering their trading prior to doing any trades
so this ball is in credit's court
per your request
sounds good to me
saturday
0:0 am at buffalo grille it is
attached is the referenced confidentiality agreement
i hope to have the fieldston one to you shortly
attached please find the referenced agreement
per the request of sara
attached is the form of us online gtc
w/collateral
we have received notice that the referenced counterparty is updating its phone system and is changing all of its phone numbers
i am sending a copy of the notice to the usual distribution
the list of new phone numbers will be sent to my usual distribution for documentation
which includes connie sutton from global contracts
as to what numbers they are replacing
they are replacing all the phone numbers we might have had across the board with this counterparty
if you would like to see the numbers
obtain a copy of the notice from connie sutton
as i just mailed it
it should get there in a few days
per my voicemail
attached is my list of agreements
per my conversations with tom and frank
unless credit specifically tells us that a counterparty is a credit derivatives counterparty
the online team should consider that all u.s
based counterparties are not approved to trade credit derivatives
credit will
in the same box where they put
declined
amended
or
division
put a note that says
credit derivatives
and in those circumstances only you should consider that i will be indicating whether or not the counterparty is approved to trade credit derivatives
otherwise
i will not be putting an
x
in the box for each and every counterparty to say they can't trade credit derivatives
i hope this makes sense to you
call me if it doesn't
there is no change from my previous approvals for the only counterparty on the 0/0/0 list
so i am not sending that list
on the list for 0/0/0
first
david minns is in the houston office today
so i gave the response today for the one australian counterparty on this list
we are meeting with mark on wednesday to try and figure out the approval process for australia
so maybe after wednesday i'll start responding for them
second
on this list please note that there are no counterparties that have been indicated as credit derivative counterparties
so none of the counterparties on this list should be approved to trade credit derivatives
even though i haven't
x'ed
them out
we have received the executed letter agreement with the referenced counterparty dated april 0
0 amending the enrononline electronic trading agreement
copies will be distributed

ability to trade
thanks
troy black called me about that c.a
i passed on to you
he said he needed it to go out today and also passed on words from the counterparty to the effect that the c.a
was
non-negotiable and that if we had any comments they need to be minor
or forget about it
there you have it
we have executed a letter agreement dated april 0
0 amending the electronic trading agreement with the referenced counterparty
copies will be distributed
she seemed very nice
like she would make a good employee

and liz said to was extremely well liked
and very energetic
i have a letter on its way to mike moscoso right now
interoffice mail
we requested 0 for nat gas any one month
but were only approved for an additional 0
so we went from 0,0 to 0,0
welcome back
attached is an updated list of the confidentiality agreements
attached please find the referenced lists
i am not sending the list for 0/0/0 because all of the counterparties on that list were credit declines
i have responded for australia legal on the 0/0/0 list
remember
no credit derivatives approved unless specifically indicated
which none are
we do have it signed
however
the company's name was not correct in the agreement so i spoke to wayne greenberg and it said it was okay to go ahead and change the name on the c.a
he signed
and i just wanted to get a copy back from him initialled by the name change so we have a record of his agreement
bob

what rules
besides the rules of those two exchanges
might apply to any on or off exchange trades you might enter into
for instance
here in the u.s
energy commodity trades might be governed by the cftc
where out equity options might be governed by the sec
besides the exchanges your email reflected
what other governmental rules or regulations would govern trades you might enter into
i have not been getting a response from my outside the u.s
attorneys
so i just emailed them a reminder again
and tried to make them feel really guilty
i hope that works
actually

it appears the online people have revised the initial counterparty list
fyi per sheila's inquiry and at sara's direction
i called ken raisler at cadwalader to determine if using the word
exchange
in a corporation's name would create any regulatory problems with the cftc
per ken
there has been some historical sensitivity about the use of the word
exchange
as we may have noticed though
a lot more companies are doing so without concern
he said there was no regulatory problem with the cftc in using
exchange
in your corporate name
however
putting
exchange
in a company's name may put you on the cftc's radar and get you more scrutiny
he also said that there may be regulatory conerns in singapore and hong kong
so if we ever anticipate doing business there
it might not be a good idea
i guess you mean wendi
no molly
i forget when you are coming
if you're in houston on may 0
jim easter in the asia/pacific group will be having his xviii annual la dolce vita party which is always a great blast
and i'll secure you an invite too
let me know
this time i just pulled out the notebook with the drafts of confidentiality agreements you left one of them to do
and they didn't bother to file them in the binder
they just stuck them in so when i pulled the file out
the documents fell out
the way this came about
sheila has a customer that was creating a new internal and
initially she contacted sara and it was sara's understanding that they were in the tranportation business
not trading
and wanted to use the word
exchange
in their company name
and did we
as the cftc experts
know any reason why they shouldn't
i also understand it was julia that mentioned to sheila she might have an issue there
after my email went out
sheila came around with the press release they were drafting
and it sure sounded in the press release that this company's business was more toward the exchange and less toward the tranportation
they used words like
online clearinghouse
and the like
so i told sheila maybe she'd better contact ken raisler directly since it seemed like she had a real problem there
i haven't spoken to her to find out what came out of it

was on the original approval list
but i had them as a u.s
counterparty instead of canadian
credit now tells me they are canadian
so i am a little concerned that i might have opened them for credit derivatives
so if they are
shut them down since canadian cpys can't do credit derivatives
of course
all counterparties should be shut down for credit derivatives now unless credit tells us they are a credit derivatives cpy
and then i'll make a determination
but you know that
i am preparing an assignment of two physical gas trades that were incorrectly done online with canadian imperial bank of commerce and ena and assigning them to cibc world markets plc and ecc
ecc has a physical master with this counterparty
ena doesn't
i am adding a statement to the effect that these transactions shall constitute
transactions
under the ecc master agreement and want to confirm that
transactions
is defined as such under your master agreement
can you confirm that for me
much thanks
too bad you won't be here for the party
it's always a good one

sunday is astroworld day for enron employees

all's i have to say is i was here this morning before 0:0 am

if you catch my drift
why is an attorney doing secretarial work
much less paralegal work
also
she is primarily a litigator
and we have found that litigators don't know anything about contracts
securing collateral
corporate law
etc
if we want a litigator
i understand that one of the old time 0 year liddell
sapp litigation paralegals has finally gotten to a place where she's ready to leave
yes to both questions
i hope we are confirming trades under the new txu isda master
i have forwarded the statoil/j.aron trades down to bob klein and jeff sorenson to sign off on the actual deals listed
i'll keep you posted
would you like to sign off on this form of assignment since i am going to have to send it up to canada for signature
much thanks

let's chat about attached
i spoke to the guy reviewing the deals this morning
he has come up with more deals than were on the list provided by statoil/j
aron
and now bob bowen is checking out the list
they hope to have it to me by the end of the day
it seems to me the way we need to proceed is to contact the j
aron person and get the name of their person who can sign off on the trades
and have bob bowen and this person come to a consensus about the correct trades
once we've got that nailed
then we amend their form of assignment to add the language that the trades need to go under the j
aron master
are you with me on this
it wasn't at the bottom of my list
but it appears it was at the bottom of london's list
per your request a few weeks ago
global contracts prepared a list of executed financial masters for bob bowen which he forwarded up to me
let me know what you think
attached is the form of confidentiality agreement
please call me at
0
0-0 if i can be of further service
as you both may recall
we left unresolved whether our intention was to have the credit derivatives tied to the applicable isda master agreement
if there was any
mark's first thought was that they would always go under a gtc
but after reflection
perhaps we might want them to go under the master
we need to get this resolved because there is no global contract assigned to any of the credit derivatives online
which is causing much trouble between global contract and the online crew
can you direct me as to what our approach will be
thanks

i spoke to marie and she said that at year end the tax language out of

andrea
the firm commitments i have so far are for the potatoes and pork chops
that red pepper dip looks really good
i may make that
do you want to choose another one
we're still waiting to hear back from some people
so i may have to adjust the amount depending on how things go
let me know your choice
black bean dip.doc
cheesy herb and garlic bread.doc
great choice
i got several responses last night and that was not one of them
all the recipes look really good
as usual

i've got the dinner schedules for 0:0 pm
your choice was perfect
there was no overlap in choices on what people wanted to cook
i couldn't have planned it better
attached are the recipes
i sent you them all because they all looked so good
will you be talking to steve
i left him a voicemail about the dinner
i have scheduled him for the garlic bread
i guess i will just mail him the recipe
black bean dip.doc
cheesy herb and garlic bread.doc
i left a message for judy wells and will keep you posted
hopefully by the end of the weekend i should have an exact head count so i can tell people how much to make
so far we've got 0
the only recipe so far that is unclaimed is the roasted red pepper dip
you could either do that
or based on the number of people
you may do another of the meat recipe
since probably that will be the most expensive
why don't we chat
via email
monday and figure out the best way to go
i've got a call into peter shaddock to see if i can borrow his barbecue grill and if he can get it to my house
another thing too
does the church have folding tables and chairs to borrow
my table will only sit 0 at the best
i can go either way on this
i have a nice backyard but no barbecue and not enough tables
but it sounded like you might prefer not to host
and i don't mind
i just am not setup to do a big group
i used to have a nice folding table but it was stolen out of my garage
if you host it i would be happy to help out
bring nice flowers
do the dishes
make the pepper dip
at the request of sara shackleton
i am transmitting a proposed form of annex a for the referenced counterparty
please call me at x0 or sara at x0 if we can be of further assistance
do you have a fax no
i could fax them to you
anthony
unless your questions relate to an online problem
can you address your master questions to either of the two susans
thanks
are we in agreement that you will be hosting the dinner
if so
i will need to call everyone and let them know the change of plans
in furtherance of that
i will need direction to your house to provide them

i'll wait to hear from you tommorow
at the request of anita herrera
i am enclosing a copy of a list that shows the discrepancies that our records show from the list we were sent of trades to be assigned to j
aron
please resolve the trades issues directly with bob bowen
his # is 0/0-0
at the request of anita herrera
i am sending you a list of discrepancies with the j
aron trades
i tried to send this earlier and attached the wrong documents
please disregard that email and delete it
thanks
can you take care of sending him the executed documents
can you help me figure out the portland thing so we can get this database
attached is our bilateral form of confidentiality agreement when both parties are providing confidential information
i don't think you can bird dog her too much
she receives in the emails and forwards them on to the relevant job group
the person with the job then decides who they do or do not want to interview
i don't think gretchen will have much to do with that
if we are replacing an existing master agreement with an isda master agreement
please change the status in the master swap agreement database from
executed
to
executed-under amendment
once a master is executed
executed
or
executed-under amendment
should be the only two options you should ever choose
if you change it to
draft sent
under negotiation
etc
it wipes that counterparty's master from the list of executed masters
how many times do we have to say this
well
actually tanya
your statement below isn't a truly correct statement
we have not consented to the statoil/j
aron assignment
in principal yet
in actuality
no
we are off about 0 trades and have sent the statoil people a list of the disputed trades to resolve
once we are in agreement about the trades
i will add a paragraph to their form of assignment to the effect that the assigned trades
be they physical or financial
will go under the respective j
aron master we have in place for that product
only then can we move the trades
the date our annual exemption expires in approval letter the nymex sends us when they approve our exemptions
because we have so many commodities we are applying for now
and the form is quite lengthy
it took the nymex quite a while last year to approve our requests
which moved the date back to july 0
last year our renewals were due the 0st week of july
so we've got a lttle more time to work on it
i will probably start notifying the various group's that provide information for the exemptions request sometime around the middle or toward the end of may

i need to respond to enrononline friday with my approvals to this list
the list is broken up into 0 groups
group 0 being counterparties already opened up for online trading
so you don't need to re-review
group 0 being counterparties that we have correct names and credit on
you need to review this list which has about 0 counterparties
and group 0 being counterparties that we have bad names or no approved credit yet
so you don't need to approve this list
you may ask
what products will these counterparties trade
they can potentially trade all the products we offer online so you need to look at them like any new counterparty
saying that
what we really expect them to trade is the singapore based group of products

which is currently the only segment we have online
and
0
for right now
we have 0 netherlands and 0 german counterparties on the list

larry gagliardi has been talking to valero marketing and supply company about doing some gas crack business
and it appears valero will not trade with us under the current form of master swap agreement we have in place with them
they will only trade under their form of isda master
a copy of which is attached below
i spoke to their lawyer
kim bowers
who is very nice
and she asked us to make our comments to their form by email
after talking to tanya while you were out
it appears that we need to revisit their credit situation since the credit under our existing master swap is quite old
we will try to work on reviewing the legal terms while we wait to get the credit
i spoke to kate cole and she said enron networks
i'm not sure of the correct spelling yet
was incorporated as a delaware corporation on 0/0/0
she has made me a copy of their articles of incorporation and llc agreement and i am sending a messenger to pick them up
as well as a copy of the officers and directors
which appears to have been approved
the banking resolution went to julia today for signature

approval of agreements
etc
how about adoption of the trading policy
attached please find the referenced lists
i spoke to greg johnston
one of the canadian lawyers who is currently seconded here
and have determined the following
imperial oil resources is an alberta limited partnership
all canadian transactions are entered into with this counterparty
imperial oil resources limited is the general partner of imperial oil resources
we do not transact business with this entity
thanks for the t-shirt and the magic wand
people have already been at my desk trying to steal my magic wand
it's definitely a crowd pleaser
that was sweet of you to think of me
done
the ballots are due in new york on june 0
and there are no provisions made for faxing the ballots
so we need to mail them in time to be received by the due date
per conv
w/anthony
we should expect 0 people
we do not need to teleconference anyone in
anthony wanted the london global contracts people on the line
but i discussed it with mark
and their forms and legal issues are so different from ours that i told anthony that they need to contact london legal if they would like a presentation
sorry for my hold up on this list
i had an issue with the division/dba approvals that i needed to resolve with dave forster and mark taylor
we will be issuing a policy
as soon as i draft it
about how to deal with divisions/dba's in the future
for this koch counterparty
per my conversation with stephanie
i am provisionally approving this counterparty only with understanding that the online trading account name gets amended to read as follows
koch industries
inc
acting through its koch hydrocarbon company division
if the counterparty will not agree to this name change on its account let me know
i will talk to the koch lawyer
fyi
this is the way we styled the isda master agreement
at the direction of the koch lawyer
we have received the executed confidentiality agreement with the referenced counterparty dated may 0

i spoke to sara and marie didn't want them to attend and that is fine with sara
with respect to el paso merchant energy
l.p
this counterparty was on yesterday's list as an amended counterparty
but it is actually a new counterparty
it should be approved for all products but power
thanks bob
per my conversation a minute ago with leslie hansen
el paso merchant energy is ok to trade power
so i have amended the spreadsheet to reflect that change
i understand that you are the keyspan man
we are being asked to look at combined physical/financial guaranty for keyspan with the guarantor being keyspan corporation d/b/a keyspan energy and the guaranteed parties being keyspan ravenswood inc
and keyspan ravenswood services
i have never seen this counterparty as a financial entity before
we've got keyspan energy management
inc
as a counterparty we sent a draft master to about a year ago
will these ravenswood entities trade financial with us
do we need to add keyspan energy management to the guaranty if that is indeed the keyspan entity we are trading with
by the way
what kind of boondoggle trip is this you are on
you credit guys live high on the hog

i was just speaking to edmund cooper about various swap matters
and he wanted me to ask the group to not make changes to his entries
for ect international
in the master swap agreement database
someone went into one of his and added a note that the trade option exemption was deleted when it wasn't
if you think something is in error or needs to be added
please consult with him
thanks
edmund
below is the standard information we always have in every email when we get a master swap agreement executed
with this email global counterparty can open the counterparty
we then immediately send the master swap agreement and other documentation down in the attached memo
if we get the master in signed but we're waiting on critical additional documentation
like the guaranty or perhaps a legal opinion on a governmental
we hold off on sending the email
sometimes the file may not be complete because we are waiting on incumbency certificates
which we do not consider critical in most circumstances
so we may send the email
send down whatever executed documentation we have
while we wait on the certificates
we used to wait to send the executed documents down until we had the whole package completed
but they can't approve the counterparty without getting the master
does this make sense
i am now going to look for one with special instructions
below is my standard memo to global contract with any kind of executed documents i send down to them
also
a new procedral thing that is evolving here in houston
we used to send global contracts the originally executed guarantees
but credit is not the gatekeeper and recordkeeper of all guarantees so we will be sending the originals to them in the future
with a copy in the global contract file

to people outside legal and credit
can you provide me a list of the people in your group that would like access so i can email them the agent to open the database
much thanks
this is a consent to the physical business
not financial
stacy dickson will sign off on this as soon as she gets credit approval
which it appears she has not yet
you scared me
i went in to make sure i sent the list to everybody
how about adding the drop down for bandwidth trading
i asked credit to put the referenced counterparty on the re-approval list for financial because momentarily we hope to get the signed isda master agreement in from the counterparty and if certain things don't happen when i open them up they will have a cow
0
when i approve them to trade financial online we need to make sure they are coded for having the master swap agreement in place
they are insistent that they do not see the gtc and that the confirms and procedures agreed to in the master apply
0
all us and canadian financial transactions
whether online or offline
should roll up under the master
as soon as we get the executed isda master agreement in i will send an email
i thank you and i know sara shackleton thanks you

i hope to have it to you shortly

i am going to have to leave the group meeting a little early tomorrow
the online team has scheduled a new employee training for tomorrow and at 0:0 am tom moran and i are going to give a presentation on online approval procedures
please note the following on the 0/0/0 list
we are shutting down aquila risk management corporation for all financial trading effective today
all financial trading should be done out of utilicorp united inc
this counterparty was on the original approval list
and i previously had them shut down for financial trading
credit will put them on tonight's list
meanwhile
we need to open them up to trade all financial immediately
i know you are busy
but you need to send out your email about the signed master as soon as possible
so we can open up utilicorp to trade financial
brant can only open them up from credit's perspective
i have to open them up from legal
but they will still not be able to trade only until global contract ties the counterparty to the master
and they cannot do that until they get your email
thanks
samantha

attached is your agreement
i have jury duty scheduled for june 0 at 0:0 am

it is always a pleasure working with the online team
you all keep me busy but you are always kind and thankful
and believe me
those thanks are always appreciated
correct
i reviewed the counterparties in our financial trading database and located 0 who cannot enter into financial power transactions and cross-checked that list against my online trading counterparty list and located the 0 counterparties below have been opened to trade online and who cannot trade financial power and/or who have some type of restriction in place on the type of financial power transactions they can enter into
0
the bakersfield californian
can only do newsprint swaps and options 0

services and trading
can enter into financial power transactions only if those transactions are fixed price swaps

swing swaps and options 0
phibro
inc
can only do natural gas
crude oil or oil product energy prices swap
put
call options
per my discussions with tom
this counterparty is coming through on tonight's list as an amended counterparty because they want to do financial power
they have a really old form of agreement in place from 0 and it does not allow power financial transactions
i spoke to mark taylor about this and he said if they want to do financial power they are going to have to replace this agreement with an isda
i am going to talk to credit about this
they will definitely not be able to trade financial power by monday
0
pxre corporation
weather only 0
swiss re financial products corporation

on the list for 0/0/0
nrg energy inc
was previously not approved for physical power trading and we are not opening them up at this time
per my discussions with credit
they are coming thru as an amendment to open them up for us power and emissions
this counterparty is not showing up on the ferc approved marketers list
and leslie hansen is contacting the counterparty to determine what records they have
if any
that show they have been approved by the ferc to trade power
until we are provided that info
we cannot open them up for power
us emissions has been opened
p.s
if utilicorp
need to be approved when i am out monday and tuesday
talk to carol st

or susan bailey
the paralegal working on the contract
attached is the referenced annex b
call me if i can be of further help

favored credit person
status
dan
i just wanted to let you know how to proceed on getting the agreement signed
since i will be out monday and tuesday
samantha boyd is a new paralegal in our group and she will coordinate getting it signed
her phone no
is 0-0
i understand you need it signed by monday since you are meeting with continental tuesday
as we discussed
we are incorporating enrononline llc today
as soon as we hear from deb korkmas
a paralegal that handles our corporate matters
that the company has been incorporated you can tell continental that they can sign the agreement and return it to us via fax
have them fax it to samantha's attention at fax
0
0-0
upon receipt of the fax samantha will get it initialled by mark taylor and have it walked to either louise kitchen or andy zipper for signature
depending on who is in
either of them can sign for all 0 companies
louise as managing director
andy as vice president
after the agreement is fully executed samantha will fax it to rick wagner at continental
unless you give her instructions to the contrary
if the counterparty wants to negotiate the agreement
they will have to talk to mark directly
his phone no
is 0-0
you'll have to take that personally with ms
heard
for you
it would have much more personal impact than
most favored nation
status
i would certainly want to stay on marie good side
though i know it is tough to compete with sweet russell
i will be out of the office on monday and tuesday of next week
in my absence
samantha boyd
a new paralegal in our group
will forward the counterparty approval lists to you once she receives them from credit
please return any responses you might have to me

thanks
matthew get your private
free e-mail from msn hotmail at
are you going to be sending me some credit
i'm so depressed
i wanted to work on this for you
i don't know what a terminations number is
thanks for the nice note
i am the person that has the really neat yard that was featured in the chronicle
at least until this weekend when i bought and moved into my new house
i have a lot of work ahead of me yard wise
this yard has
great bones
but has been neglected for a long time
hopefully
some day it will look as nice as the yard at my old house
here's the excuse we need to get me up there for the stampede
isn't it coming up soon
yes
we do have a standard enron guaranty form
it is located in atty.fms/swaps/current forms/guaranty.doc
both the enron
counterparty guarantees are in there
we have not yet received the executed documents
you can go back sending the counterparty lists only to me and mark taylor
thanks
just a reminder that i will be taking friday afternoon off to meet the cable tv guy
then
my closing on my old house is set for monday at 0:0 pm
how can a non-bank be a multibranch entity
if i remember
we spent a hour with london over the phone discussing just this issue
i had a conversation with ed staub over at duke today
and he now wants to get an agreement in place between duke and ena
i mentioned to him our agreement between ena and ecc that would allow us to trade both entities under the same master
and he was not interested in trading in that manner
he wants separate agreements in place with both companies
obviously
mirroring the terms of the master we are putting in place with ecc
just changing it for any cross-border issues
i told him i would run it by our credit dept
we got a call from the nymex today
and they received another access terminal that appears to be slated for enron
my understanding is that we have the five terminals that i ordered
you do have your two in portland
don't you
please confirm that for me
thanks
we have received the executed second amendment to guaranty agreement dated as of june 0

this amendment changed the guaranty of formosa plastics corporation

inc
and financial transactions with neumin production co
to an unlimited guaranty
the original guaranty amendment will be sent to credit
per my conv
a minute ago with maryann friel
they will be fedexing the documents out to us tonight
you need to contact whoever it is you are speaking to at ppl and tell them we have never received a request to assign the financial deals
and if they would like to send us one we will take a look at it

to prepare an nda for you i will need the following information
0
the correct legal name of the counterparty 0
whether the agreement is bilateral
both parties providing confidential information
or one-way
where only enron is providing confidential information
our preference is to use the enron protected party form since it is written more in our favor
0
the nature and/or use of the information being provided
0
the address of the counterparty 0
the phone and fax number of the counterparty once i have all this i can prepare your nda in short order
you're the best
the power desk directed me to give john galperin

lovely credit worksheet
at the request of carol st
clair
i am attaching our form of enrononline password application
electronic trading agreement
and a sample of each of a financial and physical online gtc
i will be able to attend
i need to send out the attached memo asap to all employees of enron north america and its trading affiliate offices
this includes houston
calgary
london
denver
new york
oslo
singapore
portland
australia
buenos aires
and any other offices where we might have trading affiliates
can someone with your team get back to me asap so we can be clear about who we send this to
thanks
if we are going to vote on the nymex demutualization plan the ballots are due tomorrow
so today is your last possible day to get them out
since it only provides for mail in ballots
no faxes this time
i check and both mark and kevin are in
for right now
i do not have an individual list
it will have to got to all the employees in the cities
and or countries where we have trading offices
which is pretty much the list i had below
i just got off the phone with someone at pp&l and i am trying to coordinate our response to assigning our physical gas
physical power
financial and online transactions
per my discussion with pp&l
shari is working on the physical power assignments
stacy has received the gas assignments
which in it includes an assignment of the online account
and the woman at pp&l is faxing me an assignment of their financial positions with us
pp&l tells me that we have recevied credit approval of these assignments
although i have not received such approval
with respect to assigning their online account
i don't know if frank has any particular issues
my only issue is that we don't only assign an account
in doing so we assign all trades under that account
and if the only trades done with pp&l are physical gas
power
financial
then we should be alright
if frank is ok
in consenting to the assignment of the online account
it seems to be a problem with her in opening a new account
saying
all that
i guess i need to know if
0
credit has approved all these consents
0
when power
gas have consented
and
0
if frank is ok with assigning the online account over
wouldn't you like to know which of the two susan's gave her notice today
i called haedicke to check on the status of his rappaport conversation
and he told me he hadn't had a chance to talk to him yet but to go ahead and fax in the ballots
which i have done
i got kevin's too
i had to order a set of the isda japanese documents for john viverito
who will be leaving for japan soon
so if anyone needs a copy i have them
also
london sent me a copy of the amsterdam power exchange rules
which i don't think anyone will need
but if you do
i have those too
do you only want the form of credit support annex and paragraph 0 thereto
or do you also want a pro forma canadian isda schedule
also
i would expect that since you are dealing with canadian municipalities you would want a form that include the special municipal provisions
which are somewhat lengthy
attached are the referenced lists
on the 0/0/0 list for sithe power marketing
lp
they were on the original approval list
and since they are coming through again for so0
and since i'm not sure if we had so0 on the original list
i open them up for it just in case
also
i opened them up for financial
since it appears they have now met the eligible swap participant requirements
even tho
credit is still not opening them up for financial
please direct this email to all employees at the offices indicated below
i think sydney is our australia office
i have revised the letter a little and am reattaching it
thanks
mike
i thought you were taking care of this for me
what happened
p.s
does samantha boyd has full access to the database also
i would like to send the email out announcing this master and have a few questions
first
about the approved products
as best as i can determine
we don't have the pulp
paper language in
and don't have the weather rep in
seeing as tho
they probably won't trade pulp
paper
i won't worry about that
however
with respect to weather
since the weather rep is always added into the confirm
i don't think not having it in the master would necessarily mean they can't trade weather
unless you know of a reason to the contrary
i would think we want to open them for weather
second
looking at the agreement to see if there is anything else we want to mention to the general distribution group
i don't see anything in particular out of the ordinary with respect to trading issues
except in the netting of payments section which appears to allow payment netting amongst pg&e and it core procurement department and california gas transmission department
will they be financially trading separately under those departments
and if so should we instruct the settlements group to net the payments
anything else special you think i need to mention
we have received the executed confidentiality agreement between continental airlines
inc
and enron north america corp
enron net works llc and enrononline llc dated june 0
0
a copy will be distributed to daniel diamond and dave samuels
just a followup note
we are still unclear as to whether we should continue to send original incoming and outgoing guarantees to global contracts
which is what we have been doing for about 0 years
since the corp
secretary kicked us out of using their vault on 0 for originals because we had too many documents
i think it would be good practice if legal and credit sent the originals to the same place
so we will be able to find them when we want them
so my question to y'all is
do you think we should send them to global contracts
to you
or directly the the 0th floor vault
if they let us
fyi
i spoke to my contact in the nymex marketing group and she told me that the nymex demutualization vote passed 0-0
the draft of the email you sent mark looks ok in terms of its content
is there any way i will be able to get some form of a confirmation reflecting that it was sent to all the offices in my prior emails
per the email below
please note that if you haven't been sending your original guarantees to credit
it appears this should be done so in the future
please forward this email on to other members of your group that might be responsible for filing original guarantees
your list looks good
thanks
that was indeed what i was asking
i have to move some final things out of my old house
i hope i close tomorrow
if you would like to meet me at my new house
and then we could run over quick and grab the final things i could go after
i'm still getting the silent treatment
she's not too far away from snapping
i'm afraid to say anything
yes it does
it includes any original guarantees we may be giving or receiving
just a reminder that i hope to be out this afternoon
as of this morning my old house closing is set for 0:0 pm
keep your fingers crossed it goes through this time
also
i have morning jury duty tomorrow
you are abviously a man of clear and discerning vision
i have prepared a form of transmittal memo for sending the original guarantees down to credit
i though you might want to use it as a template
the memo applies to ena and its other trading affiliates
enron canada corpand enron capital
trade resources international corp
if you work forany of these trading affiliates
this memo would apply to you
because ofthe constraints of our company wide broadcast system
they could not limitthe email in some offices to only those companies
so we had to send it outto the whole office
if you do not work for those companies
this does notapply to you

since this is a bermuda corporation
they are only allowed to trade the us segment of bandwidth
since this is the only segment we are trading online yet
this isn't an issue
but as we move forward and add more segments we are going to have to keep in mind that although a counterparty may have been open for us
we need to consider if they can trade other country based segments as we add them in the future

i am a senior legal specialist in the ena legal department
financial trading group
i wasn't put on as a reviewer for mike neves
but i wanted to tell you what a good job he has been doing for our group
i am responsible for the databases in our group
during the past year we have had two major projects going on with respect to the databases our group uses
first
we have had a major upgrade to an existing database
the master swap agreement database
now called the financial trading agreements database
this upgrade including adding a number of new items within the database
as well as creating security on some of the confidential legal data maintained in the database
so the database could be opened company wide
while maintaining the secure legal information
second
in response to the online trading system
we needed to immediately create a database to keep track of the legal department's approvals of the online counterparties
this need for this database came on quickly
as has everything associated with online trading
and having that data available enabled us to quickly respond to our client
the online trading group
mike has done a wonderful job both upgrading our existing database and helping create the new online database
his quick turnaround
understanding of our needs
attention to detail
while at the same time remaining cheerful while we
as i'm sure other groups pressed him with deadlines
has helped us meet the needs of our clients
mike continues to give us prompt attention when needed
and he is certainly a valuable asset to your team
in case you were wondering
i just wanted to give you an update on the nda for the referenced counterparty
i faxed your signed draft to andrew hausman this morning

0

per my conv
w/carol st
clair
crestar commented on the eta
but never requested that their comments be formalized as an amendment
per our understanding
they have not requested a signed amendment and opened the counterparty w/o any changes
so we have not pursued them
just as we got the assignment of the natgas trades in
i got a call from anita herrera
the attorney for statoil
saying she is sending me an assignment of the crude trades tomorrow
it won't be as painful a process
since she told me we they only have one or two crude trades left on the books
anyway
i wanted to give you a head's up
and maybe to keep any collateral you might have to cover the crude trades
boy
was she quick
we appear to have only one trade to assign
so credit
i guess you are ok with this
and bob
you don't show any other crude trades do you
do we have a list and copies of any financial master agreements mg has in place
when can we receive copies
per lotus notes
it looks like susan flynn sent them a draft on 0/0 and hasn't heard from them

no divisions should be opened up without the legal name as part of the title of the account
or the confirms will not go out right
you have two on the 0/0/0 list
txu gas distribution
a division of txu gas company
and western area power administration-upper great plain
a division of the united states department of energy
can you please change the name on the accounts
i thought we came to agreement that this is what we would do for divisions
and legal would be contacted if they wouldn't add the legal name on to the account
the people who approve password applications should be sorting this out
can you please let me know how these two get resolved
thanks
fyi
please note that we are in a dispute with enage energy us
lp with respect to power trading
and they are shut down for power trading only until such dispute is resolved
i have already confirmed this with stephanie
thanks mike

questionnaire-umbrella re internet
below is a rush list that we need to approve by the end of the day
from the us
the only response i expect will be from leslie
with all declines for power
i need to hear from australia today on their counterparties
gosh
i'm getting so good at this i might not need you anymore
did i not see that one coming or what
jeff
would you handle this or would alan
or both of you
below is john's contact as boeing
he would like to get some credit so we can get this counterparty an isda
i understand that you are under the gun today
if you could just let us know when we might be able to get some credit
much thanks
mark
i am sorry
but there seems to be a little confusion in our shop about who your attorney should be on this deal
i was given andrew o'connor's name
and left him a message to which he finally responded
he is now expecting to see this ca
i have now been given wesley fredericks name as your attorney
i don't want to cause any conflict between attorneys
and wanted to get your direction as to how i should handle this
i am tana jones
and i am a paralegal in the legal department and my phone number is 0/0-0
i have attached the referenced spreadsheet
changing my product approvals to add the new product list that stephanie sent me
instead of th eold list credit sent me
one of the new products appears to be austrian physical power
like the other european based physical power products
it should not be opened for the us based credit counterparties to trade
so i will not be marking it out on a going forward basis
i will just expect it to be shut down for the us based counerparties
unless i tell you otherwise on a particular one
is that ok with you
also
for sempra
they will be coming by again on the 0/0 list
credit opened them up for all financial power
i had already opened them up for all financial products except weather
so it shouldn't affect my approval
attached is the referenced list
there are only 0 counterparties for approval on this list
and i have problems with each of them
virginia electric and power company is coming through as an amendment to add financial power
i still cannot open them up until we resolve directly with the company what issue
if any
there appears to be doing financial products with utilities under virginia law
notes in our database reflect that this was an issue and they were creating a marketing sub to do the business
i have a call into credit to find out who their contact is
we will have to resolve this directly with them
again
txu lone star pipeline is coming through as a division of txu gas company
and that needs to be made part of the name
alan
harry since your group is the only other group besides the financial group that has a product on the pulp
paper website
it is my intention to only send the two of you their spreadsheets
however
it appears the physical side of the business
except for power
never says no
so if you prefer
i won't send you the list
it's up to you
let me know
per my conversation with frank
utilicorp
was originally shut down for financial because it was on the original
utility
list
when we shut down all the utilities for financial until we did the due diligence
since then
we are opening the utilities up
so long as they are not governmental utilities
second
we have since got an isda master in place with utilicorp
and moved the aquila trades under it
based on the above
i am opening up utilcorp
for all financial products
the referenced counterparty has already been approved to trade all physical and financial products offered online
i am not sure if we need to see this counterparty come through again as a click paper counterparty or not
i'll let tom decide
for me
i'm ok
david
a clarification
on ergon
macxquarie generation
snowy and citipower
you say that they should only trade australian power and weather
how about all the other products
us
uk
canadian physical and financial
i am taking it literally and not opening them up for any of the other products but those
is that a correct interpretation
it is ok to sign the copy i emailed to you
just return the signed copy to me via fax 0/0-0 and i will get is signed by an authorized officer here and return it to you
in your fax please tell me who you would like me to send the return fax to
thanks for your prompt attention with this
i have already responded to the counterparty
done at last
whew
i'm whooped
now it's your turn to have fun
unfortunatel
i have a call into david minns about one issue
and i hope when he responds it doesn't change my approvals
per our conversation last night
can you take a look at my list of country product approvals and let me know if there are any updates to the information
thanks
leslie
on the attached list they have ppl electric utilties corporation
ppl energy plus as amended and new
but you didn't respond to them
i have no record on ppl electric utilities
so can you treat that as a new counterparty even though it says amended
thanks
attached is the referenced list
i am still waiting on 0 response for the list from the 0th
we have received the executed confidentiality agreement with the referenced counterparty dated 0/0/0
copies will be sent to andy zipper and a copy to dave samuels for the files
mark said you were going to provide me with the info to do a confidentiality agreement for the houston chronicle
what's the scoop there
attached is the referenced list
the bakersfield california is approved to only do newsprint commodity swaps and options
therefore
i have turned them down to trade the current products we have available online
as our product base expands
we can send them through again as an amended counterparty if we offer newprint commodity swaps and options online
the resolution the bakersfield californian provided to us when we signed the isda agreement with them limited the types transactions they were approved to do with us to
newsprint commodity price swap and option transactions
in order for us to expand the type of business they can do under the isda agreement we would need a new resolution from the company expanding the types of products they are approved to do with us
anthony
i have no idea what that questions means
attached please find deemed isda
holly
attached is a sample incumbency certificate
at the request of sara shackleton
attached is our form of letter of credit
holly
having both of them included in the certificate will be fine
frequently

can you substitute these pages out later
or hand write the changes
alcoa inc
has contacted us and would like to trade aluminum online
it appears frank was on this initial email
i don't know what progress
if any
has been made in getting the counterparty signed up online
the person that contacted us is on the bottom of this email
i will wait to see this counterparty come through on the credit list
p.s
we do have a financial master in place with them in and there is nothing in it that should restrict metals trading
mr
faragalla
i am checking on your review of the confdientiality agreement referenced in our earlier email below
when might we expect to hear some comments from you
please let me know
mr
finzi
we have heard back from you regarding the confidentiality agreement referenced below
can you please let me know when we might expect your comments
thank you
as a follow-up to my memo re
tax treaty countries
i called jeff blumenthal about estonia
latvia
lithuania
venezuela
since they were not on the list and in a separate memo
and he said that they adopted tax treaties after the tax code binder was published
i take it by pg&e core
you mean pg&e's core procurement department
yes
it should go out under the master
i need to hear back from anyone whose group may be trading with this counterparty
here's my issue
we have been negotiating an amendment to the password application with this counterparty
the absolutely refuse to see a gtc
i don't know if any of you are trading gas
crude or power with them
but if you are
do you have a master
or would the counterparty see a gtc
i'm trying to figure out what we have before we talk to them
thanks
we have this down for signature right now
we hope to get it out today
yeah
it won't go away
we have received comments from the referenced counterparty with respect to comments to an annex a to a confirmation
mary cook
a new attorney in our group
will be working on this
remember
on the divisions
to make the incorporated entity name part of the counterparty's name
no
getting back to the original questions
do you trade with this counterparty and do you trade pursuant to a master or a gtc
have you heard from the houston chronicle
do you want me to follow up with them
is there someone in our group that is working on this
i looked in lotus notes and didn't find any entry for this
is someone from our group working on this
john
mark left a message for you yesterday
he needs to discuss this comment with you
can you please call him
thanks
dave
leslie hansen is going to review your nda

carol
engage faxed us their form of coastal corporation guaranty
it is not clear to me looking in the file what i should compare it to to make sure it is ok
it looks like our form of guaranty
but it is not the one i sent them
what do i need to do here
also
in terms of the approved amendment
i see one in the file with some hand marked changes
are those changes agreed to and is that what we should sign
hope all is going well
with respect to your inquiry as to whether there was any assignment executed with respect to the assignment of the howard trades to txu
i looked in the file and it appears that susan bailey in our group prepared an assignment and termination agreement which she passed on the brant reves in credit on 0/0/0 for handling
there is no record of this assignment ever being executed in our records
brenda
i am forwarding this email to you
because attached to the bottom is a presentation that mark wants to copy to put slides in his presentation
do you have a master agreement in place with pacific gas
electric if you trade with them
or do you trade under gtc's
who at the west desk should i speak to
we don't usually talk with the physical traders
stephanie

i am not opening up equitable gas company

i thought that was our deal
0/0/0 list
i cannot review nstar companies yet
there is some question as to whether that is a correct legal entity
anyone know anything about this
all's i need now is your email w/instructions

i will redo the 0/0/0 list with the equitable approval
credit wants to open up the referenced counterparty immediately
they are approved to trade all physical products
except physical power
and can trade all financial
i will follow up with this counterparty profile on today's approvals
attached is a copy of the amended eta that carol sent you in early july

everything going well
bob
john viverito
an attorney from houston who is temporarily in japan setting up our japanese trading office
is looking for the templates for confirmations for us weather and pulp and paper confirmations
can you send the confirmations to him
thanks
legal has signed off on the counterparty
so i expect it is being held up with the online team for some reason
just an heads up
they are open to trade physical power
which i expect is what they want to trade
but not financial
yes
the only weather representations we need are now always covered in the confirmation
as far as thru what entity they trade
i support whatever lotus notes says
dave
this should do it
because they are a governmental entity
in order to do financial our lawyers would need to talk to them about their authorizing statutes
legislative authority and possible legal opinions before they can trade financial
so if they want to trade financial
get me a name and phone number
probably of one of their lawyers and we'll have to talk to them
we have a new paralegal starting in our group today
stephanie panus
can you get her full access to the financial trading agreement database
thanks
tanya forwarded the attached confirm on to me
are we supposed to have that weather rep also in confirmations when we trade under a master
below are the international lawyers who need to be notified of form changes
notify them only when forms are completed
not as they might be evolving

a copy will be sent to dave samuels for the files
can you handle this
and here i thought you were inviting me to a barbecue
thanks edmund
you're the best
attached is the referenced list
please note the following
james hardie n.v
is a netherlands counterparty
they can enter into swap transactions only
no options
as we expand the product list
we will have to note this
societe industrielle de transports automobile
i have them shut down for now until i speak to the london office tomorrow about bankruptcy/setoff issues in france
what do you mean
happy hour
how can we be happy when we're losing our erica
i looked in the lotus notes database
and i didn't see anything about this
unless susan is working on this
i know nothing
the assignment and amendment to the assignment was faxed to vangie mcgilloway and the orginals are being fedexed to her tonight
a copy is being sent to tracy
we have received the executed second amendment to the isda master agreement dated as of july 0
0
this amendment changes the counterparty's exposure threshold and exempts certain transactions when calculating
exposure
under paragraph 0 of the isda credit support annex
copies will be distributed
what is this attached list
have i seen it before
attached is my list where i approved this initial counterparties
whew
as you can see
i opened national gypsum w/o restrictions
i have a database where i keep track of my approvals
unfortunately
the computer people are really busy and can't add my drop downs for pulp and paper approvals until late this week/early next week
after reviewing thousands of online counterparties
i can't keep track of what i'm telling people without my systems in place
with respect to he bakersfield californian on the list below
i am amending my original approval for this counterparty to approve them to enter into newsprint swaps and options only
at this time our list does not reflect the individual products you are trading
i understand from mark taylor that he spoke to jeff harbert last night about amending your excel spreadsheet to add the individual pulp and paper financial products
since restrictions such as this one will occur from time to time
at mark taylor's direction
i have revised the bilateral confidentiality agreement form to add a new paragraph 0 with respect to keeping the discussions confidential
a copy is attached for your files
attached are the referenced lists
a few things to note
on the 0/0/0 list
papier masson
ltee can transact all pulp and papers swaps
but not options
when we have them
on the 0/0/0 list
globe building materials
inc
has been shut down from trading financial since they are currently not an eligible swap participant
esp
in their own right
however
getting a letter of credit in place would make them an esp
and credit has requested a letter of credit from them
as soon as they receive the lc
credit will pass the counterparty through again for
on the referenced list
credit shows river trading company as an amended counterparty
but i didn't have them at all so i treated them like a new counterparty
on the 0/0/0 list
braintree is a division
and i would like it to read
city of braintree
massachusetts electric light department
the name on spinnaker is wrong
credit will be correcting it to read spinnaker exploration company l.l.c
i just wanted to confirm that your records show the referenced counterparty closed for power
with the forms relocation
forms list.doc needs to be revised to reflect their new location
i have gotten a phone call from hydro-quebec checking on the status of this
can we expect a credit worksheet for an isda comparison
in the future
if we have a city or a county come through
we need to identify the state they are located in as part of the counterparty name
the city of huntsville is an example where i took it to be the the city of huntsville
tx
and
per my conversation with tom today
it appears they are the city of huntsville
al
this isn't going to be a problem with my financial approval
since i shut down all cities for financial unless we have a master in place
but it might be a problem for power
the same would apply to counties
so
if we get cities and counties in
let's try and make the state part of the counterparty name
leslie
do you have any problem w/huntsville
let me know
attached is the referenced list
please see the change for power on turlock
i will be out of the office friday and monday
just a followup
stephanie needs full access asap
can you let her know when her access is granted
thanks
we have received the executed letter agreement dated july 0
0 amending the electronic trading agreement with the referenced counterparty
copies will be distributed
i have redone the attached list to open up equitable for everything but physical power
no
the city of huntsville is not approved for financial trading or physical power
fyi< with the us based customer list
online and offline
we will never approve a governmental entity for financial trading unless we have a master in place
or time to do some due diligence on their authority to enter into financial transactions
i do believe if i got just one more vote for the chairman's award this year
i just might double my tally of last year
one vote
with such an increase in my voter approval rating i just make have a landslide victory this year
the white house may become an option
i just got in from aspen
this sunday looks good for me for carol's birthday
is holly going
she might like to
in terms of a townhome
i think that would be nice
also garden oaks
it seems like you are kinda all over the place
though
and you might want to be careful making
emotional
home buying decisions
as far as not hearing back from enron
i wouldn't think anything of it
they told me they absolutely wanted me and then i didn't hear back from them for two months
big companies have lots of layers to get anything done
just keep plugging on
i should have realized anthony was bucking for the chairman's award
if i had known that
heard anything on that amendment to the isda
thanks
holly would be a good one to invite
she and carol are real good friends
lucinda really doesn't know carol all that well
so i think i'd skip her

when i talk about this i am never including credit derivatives unless credit specifically tells us in their spreadsheet that this is a credit derivatives counterparty
when you say they are approved
do you mean they are approved for all products
or just australian products

it had been returned to me and was buried under stacks of papers on my desk

you're not waiting on anything from me to resolve the
bakersfield californian issue
are you
with respect to the attached list
a few things
0
with respect to dynegy power marketing
my records reflect that they are approved for all products
including financial
power
can you let me know if your approvals reflect otherwise
0
with respect to nicor gas company and northern illinois gas company
northern illinois gas company should be restyled to be
northern illinois gas company d/b/a nicor gas company
we have just received the executed isda master with this entity and that is how the counterparty directed us to set the master up
nicor gas company appears to be their physical gas trading arm
so that entity name should be left alone
i haven't forgotten the 0/0/0 list
i am waiting to hear back from australia about a question
do you want to be on the distribution to see the daily excel spreadsheets when they have japanese counterparties for approval
for online
what i daily do is send my new counterparty lists to each of the relevant trading legal groups
each of the legal trading groups has one day to respond or i will consider their products approved for the counterparties on that day's list
i have been giving the approvals for japanese counterparties
currently
i am approving them for all products
with the only restriction being on bandwidth
where they can only trade the us segment
which happens to be the only bandwidth products we have opened online so far
i understand that when we offer japanese based products the approval process may get more complex
saying all that
do you want to be on the list for the daily approvals
or do you want me to continue to respond for japan w/o running it by you
can you put this on my calendar
thanks
each legal trading group here in houston checks on a relevant counterparty's ability to trade its products
so far the only physical trading area where a governmental counterparty appears to have problems is the power trading group where there are licensing requirements that may or may not have been obtained to trade power
for financial trading we do have to inquire into the relevant governmental entities
authority to enter into derivative transactions
in order to do that we look at statutory authority
any relevant local regulations
investment policities
etc
in addition to obtaining legal opinions on the subject
and with some counterparties hiring outside counsel to advise us
for most governmental entities if we do not have an isda master in place and have already done such due diligence
i will not be approving them to trade financial products
as far as the financial test
for the us based counterparty list
i check with credit on every counterparty to determine whether they meet the us eligible swap participant standards
as i'm sure you know
for most plain vanilla corporates and partnerships this means having total assets of $0mm or a net worth of $0mm
pretty much
if i am turning down a counterparty to trade financial it will be because they do not meet the esp test or they are a governmental or quasi-governmental entity
if what you are telling me is that the australian counterparties have to meet a $0mm asset test to trade any products
then i will add this to my daily inquiry to credit and turn down australian counterparties if they do not meet this test
at your direction i will handle this in this manner
how would you like me to proceed
justin
i approved powercor to trade before i left last night
by copy of this email to our online team here
i will be notifying them of your concern that this counterparty is opened to trade when you arrive at work today in australia
john
here is the list from yesterday
on a going forward basis i will just add you to my distribution
and there will usually be no message from me unless we have a rush approval or some other info i need to communicate
the online team called and they would like a rush approval for duke energy merchants llc
in particular
this counterparty would like to trade european physical coal
please let me know as soon as possible whether you have any problems with this counterparty
no problema
david
mark taylor asked me to talk to you about getting your isda masters inputted into our financial trading database
this databse is the central master database where we keep records of the financial agreements in either draft form or that have been executed
london currently updates this database to manage its
and singapore's
financial contracts and i would like to get the australian agreements plugged into the system
this database serves a number of purposes
first
it is our core memory of contract negotiations
anyone in legal and credit around the world can take a look at this database and determine who we have entered into contract with and what negotiation issues may be at issue
it is critical as we become a global trading company that we are consistent in the legal positions we take on these financial contracts
for instance
it would be quite problematic if someone in houston was negotiating a contract with an isda counterparty and asserted that a certain position was critical
if we find out a lawyer in another office was negotiating with the same counterparty and gave on the same position the day before
we need to make a somewhat coordinated effort on the counterparty front
in addition
with so many masters and so many counterparties there is just no way to keep track of what we have said or done unless we have a database
further
we use the information in the database to respond to inside auditing
reporting and insurance inquiries
for online trading
i check the database to see if we have a financial master agreement and what trading restrictions we may or may not have in place
global contracts uses this database to confirm their financial contract records and approval for online trading
for both houston and london we use the database to communicate with our clients
whether traders or back office support people
employees outside legal have limited view access only to see all the information except the confidential legal and credit comments
they have no edit capabilities
the database also has some reporting functions that we and london legal have found helpful
you should have gotten my email to mike neves
out database coordinator requesting full edit access for you
it usually takes a few days
once you get access maybe you could find some time to surf the database
and we can figure out how to get your isda data inputted
are you coming to the ena legal conference in october
that would be a good time for me to do a full review of this database with you
i heard back from the coal lawyers
duke is approved to trade all coal
mark taylor just heard that edmund is very sick and has been out for quite awhile
what's the scoop
is he in the hospital
will he continue to be out
is there someplace we can send flowers
can you let me know what's going on
thanks
per my conversation with frank
this counterparty wants to trade weather online
however
they have the old style erms master in place which only covers energy commodities
i spoke to scott tackett on the confirm desk
and he is going to add language to the confirm that puts the trades under the master agreement
i also spoke to tanya rohauer in credit and she is going to move this counterparty up on the list for an isda replacement master
so
they are ok to open for weather
can you please have the password application amended to set up the counterparty as i have indicated
then tell global contracts it is done
per leslie hansen
the name above is the way the town of braintree
massachusetts is setting up their power contract
so this is the way we should open them up for eol
i have already responded in my initial email
for whatever reason
the counterparty trades physical gas as
nicor gas company
they trade financial as indicated below
it is now up to eol to get back with the counterparty and get them to amend the password applcation
we have received the first amendment to isda master agreement dated as of july 0
0
amendment
this amendment
0
amends counterparty's threshold under the credit suport annex
0
exempts certain transactions when determining
exposure
under the isda master agreement
and
0
changes the fixed price with respect to the
exempt transactions
reflected in the amendment
copies will be distributed
there appears to be confusion over who and what products we should be trading with these entities
we have an isda master agreement in place with northern illinois gas company d/b/a nicor gas company
this is a new master
if the counterparty is not set up this way it need to be
physical gas has a master in place with northern illinois gas company
there is no master agreement in place with nicor gas company and the only trading being done with this entity is online gas trading
the issue that needs to be resolved is whether we want to trade gas under both northern illinois gas company and nicor gas company
frank davis will resolve this issue with tom moran in credit and stacy dickson with physical gas legal
and they will let us know who we should be trading with
when we hear back from them we can finally resolve what counterparty names we want to set up and get back to the counterparty if we have not received the correct password application to match out intended trading partners
sorry for all the confusion this is causing
i am confused too
i approved this counterparty with us eol this morning to trade all coal including european coal
edmund
i heard yesterday you have been out for quite a while sick
i had no idea
what's the scoop
should i be worried
per the email below
it appears to me physical gas should be traded only under nicor gas company and financial through the dba
do you agree
i had a hernia two years ago
it's not fun
mine didn't sound as bad as your does
though
you haven't been having a good year
i hope things improve
it is not clear to me what braintree's should remain open
will we shut down this town of braintree and only keep open braintree electric light department
is this ok with you for yur financial agreement
doug
i'm passing this on to mark taylor for review
in addition to granting full edit access to david minns in our australia office
he has also required that alison keogh and rob mcgrory in his office be granted access
can you let them know when they have full edit capability
thanks
i think if once you get full access you could have your assistant plug in the required data for on each isda master in place or draft you have out to counterparties
when you come here i would like to spend just a little time going over some of the data and the reporting funtions
i am going to open an enron counterparty called short name
enron australia
and that should be the code name you should use
please do not change the entries on any of the houston or london based counterparties
all my students are doing so well
i'm just so proud
sniff
sniff
cc
subject
organisational announcement interesting
he's a bum
per our conversation
i am attaching a proposed form of unanimous consent of the board of directors of brant-allen industries
inc
company
that would expand the consent of directors given to us when we executed the isda master agreement in 0 to do more than just the single trade referenced in that resolution
if the enclosed meets with your approval
please have it executed by the directors of the company and return a copy to me for our files
if you have any questions
please do not hesitate to call me at
0
in addition
can you confirm one thing for me
there is a note in our file that says documents for the company require two signatures
i looked at the articles of incorporation and bylaws you provided us and find no such signatory requirement
is this note an error
fyi
i left a message for both molly and brad diebner and neither has returned my calls
per your request
i am taking wedneday p.m
off to deal with furniture deliveries
do you know what to do here
per

if you would like me to go over the information in the database with you give me a call at x0
call me at 0-0 if you have any questions
is this forever
or just for the week
should i take david off
we have received the executed letter agreement dated july 0
0 amending the electronic trading agreement with the referenced counterparty
copies will be distributed
at sara's request
attached is a draft of the blackline of the referenced master
susan bailey
the paralegal working on this master
spoke to the company after receiving these emails
they faxed to her a copy of the assumed name certificate wherein northern illinois gas company transacts business under the name nicor gas company
per her conversations they have not changed their name
they are only operating under the assumed name nicor gas company
being so
the online account would have to be renamed as northern illinois gas company dba nicor gas company
per my conversation with stacy dickson
a physical gas lawyer
they still transact physical gas under their master with northern illinois gas company
i will have a copy of the assumed name certificate walked down to adnan
if we are all in agreement after this
it seems like we need two counterparty names
northern illinois gas company
and
northern illinois gas company dba nicor gas company
upon receipt of the assumed name certificate
please confirm your agreement and i will contact credit and the online team
attached is a picture of baby davies
what a cutie
he is absolutely adorable
what a sweet smile
leslie
theresa mandola with eol called and the referenced counterparty called her and is already trading gas with us and would like to start trading power online
i looked in my database and we have them shut down for power
is this a counterparty we could open up for power or not
at the request of sara shackleton
i am attaching a clean and blacklined draft of the schedule and credit support annex to the referenced isda master agreement
can you please provide or confirm the following information
0
since the counterparty is australian
i have added the counterparty's acn number to the document
can you please provide that number to us
0
can you take a look at the definition of
obligors
in the credit support annex and let us know if it references the correct obligors under the loan agreement
since i will not be in the office this afternoon
can you please call sara at
0
0-0 or stephanie panus at
0
0-0 with your comments
thanks for your attention herewith
per my conversation with leslie
it is ok to open this counterparty for all us physical power
you both may already by aware of this
but the online team has contacted me and it is their desire to have the japanese
australian products also offered out of the u.s
by enron north america
they would continue to be offered by their current companies
enron australia
and
enronjapan
but they want the products sold
0 hours a day
and i guess to do this they would be offered also by enron north america
do you see any legal issues from your side with a your japanese or australia products being offered by enron north america too
i can't say it enough
you are the best
here is that
umbrella
guaranty we were talking about
why don't you print it out and then let's go over the changes that need to be made
did you get the email of the documents i sent you
soon after we spoke
shari
to save you some time in the future
if a counterparty says
declined
on the worksheet
you don't even have to look at it at all
because it means credit has decided not to trade with them
i am forwarding a copy of leslie's email
as a sample for you
i input leslie's responses in my eol legal database
so i can keep track
product by product
of what we said for a counterparty
and then our rationale behind it
in case we need to reconstruct why we said
no trading
at a later date
if it's an
amended
counterparty
she will tell be whether or not she is changing an earlier approval
further
i put leslie's notes about any particular contract issue in the database
like
override letter
online gtc
or whatever
again
it's our memory of what we approval
and i hope with thousands of approvals out there
i know i can't remember everthing
i need a quick reply on a clickpaper counterparty below
if i do not hear from you i will take it that it is ok
this counterparty looks ok to trade all products right now
we have the isda master out for signature
in connection with the confirm i sent you earlier
i am also attaching a form of fax letter for transmittal of the confirm to the counterparty
attached please find deemed isda confirmation and form of transmittal fax to counterparty
it's time for our regular friday evening email chat
hope your doing well
what's the scoop on your surgery
i've got a few new products showing up on my list
originating from your neck of the woods
specifically
we've got mg metals out of rotterday and japan
are there any legal issues for my houston based customer list
or are they ok for everybody
there is no list for 0/0/0
since the only counterparty was a decline
i've got two metals products shut down on the above lists until i hear back from london
i just got a phone call from mike garred
a commodity trader for new power company
he said they were some enron 0/0 jv
whatever he needs to trade with us
lc or whatever
he's rearing to go asap
he is wondering where his application is in the online process
he is very eager to trade power
gas
his phone no
is 0-0
he said his email says he's not in
but leave him a message he's checking them regularly
his credit person is steve nolan
located in connecticut at 0/0-0
per our discussion
i am attaching a sample form of isda schedule and paragraph 0
they
of course
should be sent to the counterparty with the isda master agreement and credit support annex attached
that job i passed on your resume to in our group
i checked
and they still haven't started interviewing people yet
since barbara is on vacation dropping her daughter off at college
the wine tasting sounds great
i haven't been to one in awhile
it's always good to see hollis too
keep me posted
there's a reason why you earned the title of
favorite credit person
after bill
don't you remember at sara's party
we were talking to bill
and telling him how you were our favorite credit person
and he said
but i thought i was your favorite credit person
and since he is your boss
it seems quite political
for both you and me
that he is always #0
anyway
a girl's always got to hedge her bets
it was really good talking to you the other day
you've been on my mind for a while
i hope you can come visit
i can't believe a girl wouldn't call you back after a date
you crack me up
even though it is pretty frequent that this does happen
0 out of 0 masters
i think it would be fine to add this into library.doc
i am working on a revised draft that i hope to distribute to the group
so if you have anything else you want entered
forward it on to me
i do not appear to have it
oh guru of all things canadian
i'm working on comments to an isda that hydro-quebec sent us for an affiliate
hq energy services
u.s
inc
which is a delaware corporation
is there anything special about hydro-quebec being the guarantor
or just the usual considerations having a governmental entity as the guarantor
by the way
i hope you're coming up for the legal conference
there are many problems at enron that need our help in getting sorted out
those kinds of problems that lots of margaritas seem to bring out
i'm counting on you
i'll go for that picking up the cigarettes off the floor thing
it seemed somewhat unsanitary anyway
but if you get so wimpy that you can't survive a drink or two with your buddy down south of the border
female at that
well
we need to toughen you up man
repeat after me
party
party
party
john
no we do not have an isda in place with wah chang
do you want me to pass your request on to credit
my assignment related only to financial transactions
so it would not be power deals
the list of trades was attached to the assignment
jeff sorenson should have a copy down there
can you provide melissa with a copy of the recent assignment we entered into
i think it should already be in the blue file
thanks
we can use the deemed isda format i already sent you
and the guarantees
when we get them
should work for allfinancial transactions
melissa
we've got a counterparty with a draft of a master where the counterparty has the rounding conventing for kilowatts at 0 decimal points
is that our standard convention
thanks for your help
p.s
i have passed your request for a copy of that assignment to my assistant taffy milligan
she can get you copies of any documents in the future
we've got a draft master with the following rounding conventions
short tons
zero decimals temperatures
zero decimals us dollar amounts
to the nearest cent do you know whether those are our standard rounding conventions
p.s
do you get a invite to our favorite email person's political
i've been trying to get clickpaper to expand their product approval list to match the products they offer
maybe your request will help
thanks for your help anyway
i'll just cross out kilowatts
they already had megawatts in there
i live to corrupt young
unsuspecting lawyers
i have two australian counterparties on the referenced list
state electricity commission of victoria and straits resources limited
and i haven't heard from you
and i need to get that list out
when you send your approval
can you be specific as to whether they are approval for australian products only
or all products
thanks
are they approval for all products
or only australian products
i just had this conv
w/mark and marcus nettleton today about parties acting as agent
or in some fiduciary capacity online
what i am being told is that the system is set up for parties to only act as principals for online trading
it does not deal with agent
fiduciary or similar relationships
the only exception to this rule so far has been gpu where they had an agency relationship with 0 utilities
on the power side
where leslie had some specific documentation that she got signed
but i am told should not be entering into transactions with counterparties as anything other than principals
except under extraordinary circumstances
it looks like you will need to get whatever documentation leslie had sign for those in place with these
i know she has this problem with the service companies to the utilities
attached is a revision to the list i just sent you
revised to reflect that the last two australian counterparties can only trade the australian products credit listed
can you fix this on my calendar
thanks
just a heads up
i am sending up an isda master tonight between ecc and duke energy marketing limited partnership for signature of a canadian officer
yours ever
i have an eye dr
appt
tomorrow at 0:0
i'll have to leave a little early
attached please find the referenced annex b and copy of transmittal fax
at mark taylor's request
i am attaching leslie hansen's form of override letter when a gtc will
override
the master agreement for online transactions
how are you doing justy
raquel guzman
the lawyer for the referenced counterparty called again
and she is going on vacation next week and wants to get that eta finalized so they can start trading when she's out
she seems to feel the way the eta is written that they are responsible for all unauthorized use of the password
including hackers into the system
and wants the language limited to use caused by their fault or negligence
can you call her at 0/0-0
thanks
camille gerard
per the emails below
it appears you are looking for the legal and privacy statement
mark t
said leslie just revised it for the online team
leslie is on vacation until the 0th

thanks
with respect to the referenced list
0
ameren services company-ok to shut down powe
so0
as per credit's direction 0
oglethorpe power corporation-they are specifically being opened to trade power
however
our records do not show them as having a ferc license
if they really want to trade power we are going to need a name and phone # to contact them
get evidence of their ferc license
0
ameren energy
inc.-we cannot currently open them up until we investigate more this agency thing
it doesn't mean we're shutting them down forever
we just need more info
i must have missed your promotion
congratulations
atttached is the certificate so you do not have to retype it
where are y'll moving to
i originally had the referenced counterparty opened for power
are we sure it is not a ferc approved marketer
on the attached list
alliant energy corporation is coming back thru to be opened for east power
and the power lawyers are telling me they don't have a ferc license
if they really want to trade power i will need a name and phone number so our power lawyers can talk to them
then
i'll stick with what i told the eol team
if they really want to trade power they will have to get us a contact and we'll talk to them to see why they think they can trade power
otherwise
it stays as a
no
just a head's up
dave finally got the amendment to the eta signed
so i am fedexing it out to the counterparty today
per my conv
w/sandy steffen w/the referenced counterparty
ph
power
it appears they would like to trade many of the east coast power contracts
she isn't sure whether the purchase and sale agreement they have in place with us would cover east coast power
and whether it would cover firm and non-firm power
also
she was wondering whether we trade power transmission
i had no idea
silly me
further
even if we have a master in place with them
i don't know whether we would want to transact under it or under a gtc
my records show they have come thru before through eol and legal shut down for power
credit has them open
emissions
they would also like to transact so0
and want to get a master in place with us
i told her i would have one of the emissions lawyers talk to her
they are already open w/legal
credit to trade emissions
master user change
she already has a password set up with us and would like to change the master user
when you're done with that agreement can you pass it back to me for the file
thanks
i keep trying to email them
but it won't go thru
maybe this time
we have received the executed letter agreement dated 0/0/0 amending the electronic trading agreement with the referenced counterparty
copies will be distributed
with respect to ameren services company
my notes say i originally had them for power buys only
so i just want to make sure that my
amended-no change
still reads power the same way
bill bradford called this morning and wants to put duetsche bank on the front burner
he has been speaking to them and wants to set up a conference call later this week to resolve the remaining issues
it appears that carol was working on this master
bill wants to know what lawyer will be picking this up
hopefully sometime this morning
so he can set up the conference call
if you let me know who can work on it i'll track down the file for you
the icon below should get you in to the database
thanks scott
we have received the executed letter agreement dated august 0
0 amending the electronic trading agreement with the referenced counterparty
copies will be distributed
shari
i've got them shut down for power
they were one of the counterparty's on the initial approval lists
the online team tells me we are trading power with them off line
so what's the scoop
can they trade power
travis
the lastest trading/online memo is in my subdirectory
are you shutting down their trading today
i am going to have to leave a skooch early on friday
at 0 pm
i looked in our financial agreement database and ectric does not have a master in place with either of those entities
london legal sent a draft to credit lyonnais in march of 0
but there appears to be no activity under that master
credit lyonnais has a master styled
credit lyonnais new york branch
aaa program
with enron north america
under which we trade interest rate
currencies
equities
and toronto dominion has master in place with enron north america and one with enron gas and petrochemicals trading limited
an english corp
and a subsidiary of ectric
however
i do not have a copy and do not know if this is a limited purpose master or not
but nothing for either of these entities under ectric
i hope this is helpful
let me know if i can be of further service
i knew it was canadian and started with a
t
am i good or what
when you get to be my age you'll have no memory left
sure wish you were down here enjoying these 0+ degree days with us
it'll make you appreciate calgary in winter
i just wanted to let you know i haven't forgotten you
my usual source for getting the eta's is out
and i'm trying to track down someone else who can send them to me
any updates on louisville gas
electric and lcra
can i attend
have you heard anything back from gas natural with respect to getting their signed guarantees on the comercializadora metrogas and gas natural mexico trades
i've been holding my enron guarantees as leverage in getting theirs
we are at the period in the confirms where we need to exchange guarantees
when you get back in we need to talk about this cpy
my records had them shut down for power
they called about contract issue and wanting to trade in all products areas
and speaking to shari and checking your notes
you had them as open
since they haven't traded power yet
i had frank shut them down until i confirm with you they're ok and under what contracts
talk to you when you get back
tana jones
xl
fyi
john
sorry about taking so long to get back to you on this
re
sample master agreements
we recently had a group meeting where we were discouraged to send out sample masters
what appears to be happening is that a customer gets a sample master w/no credit
and then when we finally send them a real master w/credit
they are somewhat hacked off because the end up being incredibly longer once credit is added
if possible
can we not talk to credit about sending them a real master
let me know your thinking
i just got another call from sandy steffen
and she would like
if possible
to resolve any contract issues with have with each of the product groups
so they can be set up to trade by tomorrow
she also expressed an interest espectially today in natural gas
after talking to her can you let me know under what contract and/or limitations they can trade
thanks it appears she has only heard back from the online team
taffy
i just spoke to marie and she needs a set
also
take susan flynn and jason peters off your distribution
per my conversations with mark taylor
we should continue to put any weather trades done online under any relevant master agreement with the counterparty
further
there is no prohibition against doing a trade online with a counterparty when we do not have a master in place
any non-master trades would go under the respective gtc
it appears to be only a coincidence that we are trading online only with counterparties we have masters in place with
where did souad go
the 0 month restriction isn't coming from legal
it's coming from credit
you need to contact tom moran
i checked the corporate database and it's not listed at all
maybe brad knows
per credit
charlie hoang on the confirm desk needs an enron corp
guaranty of the attached physical pulp
paper deal
i told credit that your group handles physical p&p
can you please send a copy of the executed master and any amendments thereto to david dupre on the confirm desk
thanks
watch out
there are 0 david dupres
yes
to north america
australia and japan
with respect to the referenced list
my instructions from power was to shut down louisville gas and electric company and lower colorado river authority from both execute and view status for power
with respect to lower colorado river authority and bandwidth
i spoke to the broadband team
and they haven't considered the governmental angle with respect to bandwidth
so they are running it by outside counsel
who happens to be in singapore this week
and will get back to me
so until i hear otherwise
i am shutting them down for bandwidth
yes
i've prepared the assignment
i am just waiting for the lawyer to sign off on it
andrea hauser w/enrononline called and said that marathon has a problem with the terms of the online gtc's
default language
for lpg
petrochems
and refined products and would like to talk to one of our lawyers
marathon's lawyer is rhonda stinemyer and her # is 0/0-0
can you let andrea know who will be handling this
thanks
sure
please note new products
let me know if you have any issues or concerns with any of these
i'm getting ready right now to fax it over to meg
at the request of sara
i am attaching the eta
i am also sending the pa
just in case
i just got a call from kevin meredith on the confirm desk and it appears that the referenced internal entities have done a trade yesterday and have done other trades in the past and we need to get a master in place
can you send us up some credit
much thanks
per emails below
mike robison
attorney
x0
and nony flores
paralegal
x0

thanks for your help
mary lynne
these notices will be coming by email on a going forward basis
will alan handle this
it's back dated to the oldest outstanding trade with the counterparty
point well taken
why
i do believe the three tudor deals gets us to 0
mea culpa
mea culpa
mea maxima culpa
we were in the process of revising our form
so i just have to draft up an canadian version of the sample isda master and get yoou a draft
i'll try and get to it the next day or two
i could not believe my ears when i heard from ms
heard that you are working covertly behind the scenes to ensure a broadband win to the signed master competition
i would think that credit would have no biased interest in the outcome of this race
could such slanderous allegations be true
upon further reflection of the undue influence you have attempted in the past and are currently attempting
need we forget you trying to get bob crane not to sign my agreements
it seems like you have a lack of confidence in your abilities and are therefore unable to run a clean race
per our conversation yesterday
we would like to open the
other agreements
information in the financial trading agreement database to members of the interest rate and currency desk
if possible
we would also like them to see the comments screen
the people who will need access are laurel adams
george garcia
sheila glover
kelly templeton
teresa brogan
as usual
we would like to get them access asap
can you keep me posted on their access
thanks
here is a picture of alicia's baby

joe
i got a call from the coral people that a corrected confirm had already been sent to them prior to us getting them to sign the consent to assignment of the trade
i'm sure whoever prepared it on the confirm desk didn't know i was working on this
but i told the coral people i still needed the assignment back signed to keep our paperwork straight
even tho i hate to have to do the additional work
with these eol trades
there is no
oops
trade
once we enter into the trade with 0 entity of a counterparty
we cannot just
move
the trade
we need the consent of the assignor and assignee so there is not question later on down the line that the trade was not legally moved
if eveyone on your team is not aware of this
can you mention it at your next group meeting
thanks
i'm working on my backlog of lists
i thought i'd send thru a few so you could get started
hs energy services is relying on a parent guaranty to be able to meet the esp criteria
it does not meet the financial test on its own
however
we have approved them to trade financial and have an isda master in place
should i shut them down for the australia products
on the 0/0/0 list
credit wants to open ontario power to trade financial power
but i cannot until we speak to canadian outside counsel
they are part of the split up of ontario hydro
which was the province of ontario
and obviously
a governmental
before the split up
they are still a wholly owned sub of a governmental and we cannot open them up until we talk to outside counsel about the governmental issues
i have a call into canadian counsel right now
also
on the 0/0/0 list
sempra energy solution called me to find out when they could trade
so if you could open them up pronto
joe

clem called wanting to speak to someone about the guaranty issue
who should i direct him to
per our conversation
attached is the form of confirmation we use when we adopt by reference the preprinted form of isda agreement into a form of confirmation
fred wanted to get this draft out today
so i had to get it back from mary and get robert bruce to review it

any payments to the counterparty would be offset against any amounts owing to us
mike
jason peters
who was a lawyer seconded with us from andrews
kurth
has now gone back to a&k
but is still doing some work for us
is there some way for us to get him access to the financial trading agreement database
he is a lawyer
and is bound by client confidentiality with respect to all the information in the database
so i don't think we need to worry about granting him security access
can we get him access
i should be available anytime this week
with the caveat
we have a big deal we're trying to close by friday
and it could heat up at any moment
how about tomorrow at 0:0 pm
i have a meeting at 0:0pm

mike
how can these people access the database
i need the following 0 files 0st thing
wabash valley power association
inc
ontario power generation royal bank of canada/enron canada corp
thanks
online would like to open this counterparty immediately for trading
can you let me know asap whether you have any legal issues with them
thanks
per our conv
earlier
attached is our standard form of enron corp
guaranty
the above counterparty is approved to trade all products
attached are the two isda's
we have been pressured by the online team to open up all counterparties to trade financial unless we have a legal reason not to trade with them
with both those counterparties
you are correct
it is the companies
intention and direction that we trade financial with those entities
but still for online i have to say
yes
unless i have a
legal
reason to say
no
all of the counterparties on today's list are esp's
so i will approve them for all financial products
if the aren't esp's i would not approve them for financial products including australian financial products
further
if they cannot meet the esp test on their own
i.e
they are relying on a parent guaranty or a letter of credit to make them an esp
i would approve them for all financial products
except australian power
but they could trade weather per our earlier emails
i was just about to call you when i got your email
holly called and she has a table to fill at an awards banquet
some women's professional group or something
and wants to know if you want to join us
a bunch of her girlfriends are going
me
lucinda
i think carol
anyway
it's saturday night at 0:0 pm
she said it should be really boring
so i put it on my calendar as
boring awards banquet
but with all the girls at one table we'll misbehave and have fun
i hope you can join us
let me know and i'll reserve you a spot w/holly
the thing on your house and townhome sounds exciting
when can i see it
i'm having a little online brain drain today
am i correct in my thinking that all these
spreads
are financial
can you provide stephanie sever with the online team view access to the referenced database
can you let us know when the access has been granted
thanks
this list is all amended counterparties
most of them being opened up for financial power
my records reflect that all of them were already open for financial products
except the three i have marked
if you run across any others that you show as not being open for financial
let me know
because all of the counterparties on this list are ok for financial
also
on this list
my records reflect that superior natural gas corporation was shut down for physical power
if you records do not reflect the same
can you shut them down
thanks
i don't know about you
but i love lists with only one counterparty to approve
how about you
i have a database where i maintain my online approval
and my the basis for my approvals/declines
if you want to review counterparties we have previously approved/disapproved and why
or want to go in and to see what i approved on a specific counterparty
this would be the place to go
would you like me to get you access
well
i do believe this makes 0
a nice round number if i do say so myself
at a ratio of 0:0
you should have your 0th one signed and have the fifth one on the way
it seems like it should be more
but i have review over 0 counterparties for online trading
straight and to the point
we have received a proposed assignment from ppl corporation to ppl energy plus
llc wherein they would like to assign their financial transactions
two
any guaranty relating thereto

i am having a copy of the assignment walked down to you
if someone else is going to approve this
let me know
i left bill ernstaft a message
hopefully i'll hear back from him after lunch
as usual

a copy will be sent to jeff sorenson
that job is with bob williams
the litigation attorney for our international company
bob is a great guy

comments to the swap docuemnts
paul
i just spoke to brent hendry who worked on the bermuda law advice
and he said he sent you the name of counsel
i will also sent to you tonight a copy of the advice we just got with respect to derivative transactions and online transactions

i would love to have the plants as long as they can take direct sun
can they
did you see on the news last night that they arrested 0 people for participating in that pyramid scheme you were telling me about
there's an article about it in the khou tv website
at the request of sara shackleton
i am attaching our current from of isda schedule for governmental entities and our sample form of legal opinion for such entities
with respect to nypa
we do have a copy of an authorization to hedge approved by the board of trustees of nypa that they faxed us a year ago and i will fax a copy of it over to you shortly
we have received the executed letter agreement dated 0/0/0 amending the electronic trading agreement with the referenced counterparty
copies will be distributed
funb sits stalled on my desk waiting for me to have time to work on it
we are in the miiddle of a rush with financial power counterparties in need immediate assistance
many of them govt'ls which are demanding my attention
and structured financing w/swaps in the middle and i'm just putting out fires
that master is really not a priority at all for ena
and it is only enron.credit.com wanting to mirror it that is giving it any priority
what is your proposed timing for a deal on that one
it isn't clear to me whether you are on for this banquet tomorrow so i can rsvp to holly
per my conversation this morning with the lawyer at nypa
they would like to transact business on a going forward basis under the attached form of what we consider an
isda confirmation
it seemed to me their lawyer thought this document was a sufficient isda master
sara has a call into him to get his thoughts about this document per my conversations w/sara
we would like to get our standard governmental form of isda master in place
we wonder what your thoughts are on his document
further
he seemed quite firm that they would not be issuing a legal opinion
but would give us a certified copy of the resolution i am about to fax to you
we look forward to getting your comments
i was a little dismayed after our lunch when you disclosed the number of broadband masters potentially close to signature
however
i was a little cheered up when i got back and checked with the swap group and found out we have 0 masters out for signatures right now
it still may be hard to beat you at your going rate
but
all i have to say is we're still in the game
go team
fyi
i will be preparing this assignment for signature
on the list for 0/0/0
0
on the counterparty styled
united states department of interior
only
leslie is not permitting them to trade power
however
she will give them read access
0
public service electric
gas co
my notes show i already opened them for financial power on the list for 0/0/0
i am ok for shutting aquila energy marketing corporation down for financial
since they are now trading financial out of utilicorp
however
i didn't want to put
x's
in all those darn boxes
so i hope by my note only it will do the job
i am also preparing an assignment of the online trades that i will send to the confirm desk when it is executed
i have forwarded your email on to mary cook
she is actually the attorney working on the transaction
i am a paralegal
her direct number is
you're welcome
at the request of sara shackleton
i am enclosing clean and blacklined drafts of each of the bow river trust and royal bank of canada isda schedules
leslie hansen asked me to forward to you our draft list of legal contacts for online trading issues
and see if there is anyone you deal with on a regular basis that i may not know of that we need to add to the list
i hope you're ok
you probably don't remember
especially after getting hit by that polo ball
but barclays is one you negotiated on your secondment here oh so many years ago
it's always good to hear from you
obviously
you haven't lost your touch
just a note to let you know that per my conversation with tanya
after review by brent
today i will be sending out am amendment to bmo allowing for the provision of cash as eligible collateral under the isda
when we get this in signed i will send my usual email out to the world explaining this amendment
but you may want to think about what procedures you will need to put in place to make sure this happens every time we take collateral in
not to mention
we will also have to pay canadian counsel to file releases as well
and this will cost us money too
we don't want to have to do this too often
anything you want to tell me before i send this out today
yes
except for weather
the financial gtc's are designed to cover all energy commodities
per a conv
i just had with john arnold
shankman is not trading natural gas at all
his back trade is mike maggi
we have received the executed letter agreement dated august 0
0 amending the electronic trading agreement with the referenced counterparty
copies will be distributed to frank davis and to peter keohane for the enron canada talisman file
per our conversation
attached is the proposed form of amendment to the isda master to provide for cash collateral under the credit support annex
please call me at 0/0-0 or tanya rohauer in our credit department at 0/0-0 if you have any comments or questions
per our conversation
the above counterparty is approved by legal to trade online physical pulp
paper only
we cannot trade financial until credit receives financial statements and can determine whether they are an eligible swap participant or not
chris
per our conversation
i am attaching a sample form of isda for both a canadian corporate and a canadian governmental
with the governmental
the proposed form of legal opinion attached to the isda schedule would have to be modified depending on your particular situtation
see footnotes in opinion
as i also mentioned
we are making some revisions to the guaranty we are getting from hydro-quebec in response to comments from counsel
and we may want to make some of the same changes to guarantees we receive from any governmental guarantor
if you end up having a governmental guarantor
let me know and i'll send you down the revisions
by copy of this email to joe hunter on the confirmation desk
i am asking him to email you copies of the form of omnibus confirmation and annex a thereto for an ecc/canadian counterparty deal
i have to say that if you end up transacting with a governmental entity
our form of confirmation will not include the reps and warranties required to transact with such counterparties
since we never trade financial with governmentals prior to execution of a master
if you go down that road we may have to come up with some kind of form
but the best route is to get the isda in place first
the bottom of this email will explain my email to gaffer
thanks joe
you're the best
i'm sad
sniff
sniff
sniff
russell
i spoke to the cpy about this
and what it turned out he wanted was the local currency isda form
i gave that redraft to mary to sign off on the same day i wrote that note

i'll check with her tomorrow and she what she did with it
i would like to take the week of thanksgiving off
my mom is coming from ny to visit with my 0 year old niece
it appears that we have now opened up our first japan based financial product on enrononline
and i need to get some direction from you as to what restrictions
if any
we have on
0
counterparties located/incorporated in japan trading japan based financial products
and
0
counterparties not located in japan trading japan based financial products
previously
the only japanese financial product we had was weather
but it wasn't being sold by a japan based enron company
so my understanding was that i didn't have any particular restrictions under japanese law for counterparties located in or outside japan in trading this product
now that the product is being sold by a japan based company i am wondering was restrictions i might have to keep in mind when doing my daily online approvals
the only are japan based direction i am getting is from the broadband legal team
robbi rossi
which have told me japanese counterparties can only trade us bandwidth segments
p.s
we do have a japanese counterparty on the 0/0/0 list
thanks
i appreciate it
what should i do with the japanese counterparty on the 0/0/0 list
shut them down for all trading on japan based products until i hear from you
will you be coming to the legal conference here in houston next week
maybe we could chat then
fyi
i have a database where i keep track of my online approvals/declines and reasons why
if there are any
i don't know to what extent frank ever looked at it
but you might find it helpful
it is called
ena legal online trading agreements
database
if you're interested
i'll ask mike neves to get you access
as a reminder
we need to talk about some documentation marcus nettleton passed on to me for handling
it's about the disclosure of the mg acquisition
some subordination loans
guarantees w/the nymex
i asked al pennisi if it could wait until you got back and he said yes

brian hull wanted to transact out of their toronto branch
so i used their toronto address in the agreement
we do not have
transactions numbers
on our isda's
i would take it if things proceed today
that we will date the agreement as of today
so the date of the agreement will be the only identifying information
toronto-dominion will need to look at the notice information i put in the agreement and confirm that it is acceptable
i pulled it from a recent agreeement they sent us

nypa called today wanting to know the status of our review
can we pow wow about this 0st thing monday
i do not know the answer to your question
i suggest you talk to credit
financial does indeed have a master with weyerhaueser company limited
i have no idea what we trade physical under or what other weyerhaueser companies we may have business with
i am just confirming with each of you that i will be opening up the toa reinsurance company limited
a japanese counterparty on the 0/0/0 list to trade all physical and financial products
including australian and japanese weather
which seems to be the products they are truly interested in trading
let me know if you have any problems with that immediately
i sent down the list for 0/0/0 on friday
on the 0/0/0 list
for edison mission marketing
trade
i am showing them as
amended-no change
becuase i already had them open for emissions
same on fpl energy power marketing
i am showing them as
amended-no change
because i already had them opened for physical gas
i confirmed w/brad that they are still an esp
so it's ok to open them up for all financial
what's the scoop on this
will do
i'll send you a copy too
i'm just waiting to get sara's direction on one comment to the legal opinion
then i'll be ready to send it out
as you all are probably aware
we trade physical and financial products with northern illinois gas company under each of the following names
0 northern illinois gas company
the legal incorporated entity
0
nicor gas company
an assumed name for northern illinois gas company as reflected in the assumed name certificate dated 0/0/0 filed with the secretary of state of illinois
the name needs to match the assumed name certificate
no
co
0
northern illinois gas company d/b/a nicor gas company the enrononline counterparty has been set up as
nicor gas company
pursuant to bob bruce's conversation with our illinois outside counsel
we are comfortable transacting business in the state of illinois under the assumed name
nicor gas company
in connection therewith
it is ok to set up the online entity as
nicor gas company
and attach the relevant physical or financial products to the relevant master under each of the above counterparty names
further
it will be ok if the confirmations go out as
nicor gas company
even though the masters may be under one of the above names
please note
however
this should be considered an exception to the rule
we do not want counterparties to be set up under assumed names
d/b/a's or divisions for enrononline
as previously agreed with the online team
every attempt should be made to incorporate the legal name as part of the counterparty name
such as
northern illinois gas company d/b/a nicor gas company
or
koch industries
inc
acting through its koch hydrocarbon company division
any exceptions to this should be run by legal for approval
did you make a note under h.q
energy services in lotus notes
no can do
just made appt

we look forward to getting your comments
we have received a revised unanimous consent of directors dated 0/0/0
board resolution
from the referenced counterparty which expands the approval given in their initial board resolution
provided when we executed the isda master agreement
to allow them to enter into
pulp
lumber and paper commodity price swap and options
and other commodity price swap and option transactions
with ena
for clickpaper
this should allow them to trade all the financial products we trade
for enrononline
this should allow them to trade all commodity swaps and options
if credit will add this to the next spreadsheets for both clickpaper and enrononline
i will amend my approval
i will circulate a copy of the revised board resolution to global contracts and camille gerard
pretty funny
i went over to harass him
but he must be on vacation
the mounties have arrived
when you have a minute can we talk about this
thanks
attached is revised list opening edison mission marketing
trade for emissions
for xeron
inc.-amended no change means
they were initially open for financial
shut down for power
open for all other physical products
no change from that approval
my assistant
taffy milligan will be sending it to you
there seems to be some question whether utilicorp
can trade financial
i opened them to trade all financial
including power
on 0/0/0
i think the customer is calling kathy for access
there should be no change in their physical power profile
can you fax her the fron of the isda schedule for utilicorp
she must be in the oslo office
matt
can you provide me with the name and address of who we should send this amendment to for signature
i still have to run it by an attorney
though
attached is the referenced list
i am saying
amended-no change
because for calpine
i originally had them open for power
financial
and i am not changing that approval
and for nicor
i originally had them open for financial and shut down for power and i am not changing that approval
i'm preparing for a presentation i have to give tomorrow
once i'm done with this i'll give you a call
enron canada has a master agreement
ect form
non isda
in place with energy west incorporated
which ena could trade under per the services agreement with ecc covering financial trades only
per my conversation a second ago with credit
energy west incorporated and energy west resources are not showing up in their records as being one and the same corporation
sounds to me you need to call credit for approval
if we do not have a master
they would have to get credit approval to do a trade w/o a master in place
see email below to john
sounds good to me
take today off
from eol at least
we just received what we hope is a final draft of the documents from deutsche bank
and i hope to respond back to you shortly
once i have had a chance to confirm they made all the changes

plus this annex a make up the
omnibus
confirm
it was cute
can you forward alison the template for an omnibus swap
the attached appears to be an eol template
can you pass this on to the next person
thanks
it's really all genia's fault
she goes to lunch too darn early

on the 0/0/0 list
tembec
inc.'s bylaws require that agreements signed by the company must be signed by any two of the following officers
the president or a vice president together with any director
secretary or assistant secretary
if you are going to trade with them online you must ensure that the password application gets signed by those officers
or if not by those officers
they must provide a resolution if any officer except those above signs the documentation
because of this signatory restriction enrononline was hesitant to open them for financial trading
it's up to your group
but you must comply with these special signatory requirements
if you would like legal to pass on the documentation if you are unsure
forward it up to me
it's no surprise to me to find reggie's been stirring it up
we have been doing this here in houston via a unanimous consent of the directors of the company appointing the individual
s
as agents and attorneys-in-fact
do you sugguest i proceed this way or via the power of attorney below
fyi-waiting for direction
that change will have to be approved by mark taylor
who is out of town until next week
these could take a few days
or more
they have to be circulated to the directors of the company for signature and timing will depend on their availability for signature
if amita wants to start signing today
she can go ahead and start signing now and i'll make her appointment effective as of today
john arnold wants this counterparty opened asap for financial
we didn't have any financial statements from them when they originally came thru
so we couldn't determine their esp status
but we're ok now
so if you could open them for financial asap
thanks
i just got off the phone w/derek
i'll make sure someone handles it
karen
upon re-review w/credit

and spoke to jeff blumenthal earlier this week about tax issues arising out of amita executing documents on behalf of eol and ena
frank just informed me that the japan office has also been provided with stamp of sheri thomas's signature so they can execute pa's out of japan
frank and i were thinking we might want to get together sometime next week to discuss this
in order to improve communication between the legal department and our online team
mark haedicke has asked us to prepare a list of legal contacts which we will be providing to the online team
before we send this out
i have been asked to send the list to each of you for your input
please let me or leslie hansen know of any additional contacts or changes that you feel we need to make to the list
i do not believe that statement is correct
the limitation was required in the corporate documents of the company
so it should apply to all agreements
can you send me up a copy of the password application and i will give steve norris a call
thanks
great
look forward to hearing from you
if you have any questions give me a call

per the attached
i think we will need to amend our board resolution
s
to add cassandra as a signatory
the ena resolution appeared to have ted specifically
we have a 0:0 meeting tomorrow w/lisa lees and phone in to jeff blumenthal in tax to discuss metals and japan issues re
signing pa's and any other documentation
in your office
my assistant taffy milligan is tracking these down for you
her direct no is
mike haney with ebs
i checked w/the corp
secretary's office
and they were unaware that rex and dave were appointed as md's
so the corporate paralegal is getting the board resolution passed adding them on
as well as adding mark palmer as a vp
neither enron london nor enron london/singapore has an isda master in place with union oil company of california
ena does
but that won't help you
mark
mieco is the cpy where we had the misposted/bad online trade
we held up their master
can we send it out
remember as those ameren energy inc
as agent
etc
for various companies we got eta amendments in for
they are coming thru tonight as as online counterparty but want to start trading today
any problems
are you working on an eta amendment for them
justin i've been running around trying to determine whether we have a tax problems with amita doing what she's doing for the above companies
and i'm hearing that you've already cleared that with tax
can you please confirm this for me
first
this counterparty is ok to trade physical power
i just spoke to leslie
and she said it was ok to set up
ameren energy
inc
as agent
under one cpy id # for the three utilities and that's how they would trade
we spoke to melissa murphy on the power confirm desk and she is going to set up a special confirmation template that will add the three utilities names to the confirmations before they go out
i think this is how global counterparty already set them up
if this doesn't compute
let me know
the confirmations would then go out as ameren energy
inc
as authorized agent for and on behalf of ameren energy marketing company
ameren energy gathering company
and union electric company
d/b/a ameren ue
are you holding up this cpy for any reason
we have received the executed confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement with the referenced counterparty dated 0/0/0
i will deliver a copy to dovie keprta
until i receive any further direction as to who you would like to be the central file keeper for emarket services documents
thanks for the note
just pass on my concern for clarissa and hope for her improvement
i'm ok all day long
so just email me when you want to chat
our time
and i'll make sure i'm at my desk
just a note to remind you to add the
esp
and
country
information to clickpaper spreadsheets too so i can get those out while you're gone
at the request of david minns their short name in lotus notes will be eaf
for enron australia finance
david gave me a list of their masters
so i am going to enter just the names and agreement
david and alison will flesh out the rest of the data when he gets back
leslie hansen just called me and it appears the power traders have asked her to review the eta for trading on the dynegy website
i told her we were meeting to develop a policy about the opening of such websites
that we had no board resolutions passed allowing the opening of them
nor do we have control procedures in place about where statements go
etc
so we can control and prevent
rogue
trading
she said before she sent this out she would contact you
the australia office gave me a list of their masters and i have entered them into the database
we still don't have copies
further
i don't know more than if it's executed and the date
they need to flesh out the additional information that is required
anp marketing company has faxed in their pa and eta amendment and we should get the originals in by fedex today
they are hot to trade ercot online
and i don't know if they can trade it or not
but if we could move them up to the top of the credit review list they would be most happy
the critical documents are usually the masters and any guarantees issued
thanks for your help
thanks for the heads up
as usual
you're the best
attached is a clean and blacklined draft of the changes to the isda schedule
we have also attached the proposed form of enron corp
guaranty and the legal opinions of enron north america and enron corp
the opinions of cadwalader with respect to the isda and the guaranty will be sent shortly under separate cover from susan lobel at cadwalader
it appears the only remaining issue on the isda is the
conditions precedent
provision which nypa is still considering
please let me know if these changes meet with your approval
i bet you thought i forgot about you
the lawyer up at enron corp
just called me and said he just got off the phone w/deutsche bank and they have come to an agreement as to the proposed form of guaranty
we have one more credit issue on the master that credit would like us to revisit with them
but otherwise i think we close to being done
if you would like me to coordinate the execution of the guarantees you need with enron corp
i will be happy to assist you
we have received the executed agreement for exchange of confidential information with the referenced counterparty dated effective 0/0/0
copies will be distributed
harry
i believe this is yours
we have received the originally executed letter agreement amending the referenced electronic trading agreement
copies will be distributed
we also received the originally executed password application and customer registration form
i will send those down to eol and no copies will be kept in legal
thanks for your help here
can you do me one more favor
can you check and make sure i am the only person that has access to change keywords
thanks
attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database
you should have edit access
non-legal or credit employees can get view access only
they should not see our comments
that information is confidential and subject to attorney/client privilege
let me know if you do not have edit access
please do not edit entries for companies or agreements outside your area of responsibility
a few notes
there is some great reporting functionality in this database
check out some of the sorts on the left
there is a drop down called
pending swap update
that sort will create a list of all executed and draft financial agreements
there are ways you can sort the pending swap update to generate reports for you compan the
restrictions
column should be limited to only those issues that are critical to trading/confirmations/settlement
kinda
before you do/authorize a trade read this
not for general legal notes
once an agreement's status is coded
executed
it should never be coded elsewise
it will mess up reporting
if you are amending an agreement or superseding and replacing one
code the status
executed-under amendment
i should be the only one coded to change the
keywords
in the drop downs
if you need keywords added
send me an email and i will add them for you
please note
that we have just upgraded the database to add the isda definitions
branch offices approved for trading
and market disruption provisions
this information should be inputted for the new master swap agreements on a going forward basis
but we still need to go back and repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements
also
fyi
the
see
drop down is our nickname for the name changes and mergers reference
if an item is filled in for that entity it should show you any prior or new names for the counterparty
we hope you find the information provided in this database helpful

to a master style of confirm

there are a number of argentina counterparties on this list that i will need your sign off on
brent said he things they will probably be ok to trade argentina gas
but to run it by you
can you let me know if you have any issues
i am going to have to add you to the distribution for my daily lists too
initially
we should have a rush of argentina counterparties
but after awhile
it should dwindle
the rule is
you have one day to respond or i will consider you have no legal problems with a counterparty on the list
we do not have an isda master in place with this cpy
however
susan bailey and sara shackleton did send them a draft in august
i would think unless ectric is going to be a direct cpy to a master
craig young should contact susan and sara directly
can you sent out that original participation agreement for signature to the cpy
i am attaching my form of letter so you can copy it
thanks
can you please send this cpy a copy of their isda master

it seems to me erica's advice needs to apply not only to this nda
but probably all of the nda's that are going to originate from the houston based enroncredit.com business team
further
it should apply not only to nda's
but their whole business they are originating from houston
yes

i just had a conversation with mark about that one
it sounds awfully like a law firm to us
unless a member of the legal dept
requests a guest id for a law firm doing legal research for us
we should never grant guest id's to a law firm
it can only hurt us
it's possible it could be an accounting firm
per mark
we wouldn't want to grant accounting firms access either
pc
for professional corporation
is a good giveaway that we might have one or the other

aep

thank you
ok for me
ok for me
ok for me
sounds to me like you don't need to worry about opening them up for power
call leslie hansen at x0
she is a lawyer and will be able to help you
i am a paralegal that assists her
i haven't heard anything back from you re
this approval
the eol people need a sign off asap
i heard back from the power lawyer and they do not appear to have a ferc license
he is going to have to talk to her and clear this up
i'm talking to their lawyer right now
he's checking with his power team to find out what name their ferc license is in
however
we still do not have a credit sign off on power yet
so i am also working with
nagging
the power credit person to get me some headroom
let's just say anp is
evolving
as we speak
us legal would have no problem doing business with a connecticut limited liability company
subject
of course
to credit approval
there are some legal considerations with respect to certain products
in order to trade any financial products the counterparty would have to meet the u.s
eligible swap participant
standards
which sets certain asset and net worth levels
and to trade u.s
power they would need to have a ferc license
otherwise
we have no problem with limited liability companies
thanks for the good word
can we open up anp for gas asap
they have been dying to trade
they want to trade power but so far credit has not given them any headroom for power and they do not appear to have a ferc license in this name
we are working with them trying to figure out how they can trade power
coral energy holdings is where we have the financial master
are you ok with this assignment
can you please respond to diane
thanks
we do have an isda agreement in place between koch energy trading and ena
but anthony is correct on a number of accounts
first
we could not put oslo trades under this master
it is a local currency form and could not be used for any non us transaction
second
it is quite old and our forms have evolved since then and we would not want to replicate this form
lastly
it has the old
erms
style collateral annex
and we would want to use an isda credit support annex on a going forward basis
i would suggest contacting matt dawson in london legal and rod nelson in london credit and getting a new master based off our current form
tana jones
houston legal
a fellow from western publishing company called anthony camppos in global contracts and said something to the effect that that wanted to terminate the master with us and trade
s
thereunder
he referenced deal no

robert jones appears to be a vp of enron net works
but not enrononline
by copy of this email to deb korkmas
i would like to confirm that the above is correct
and if it is
can we please get robert jones added as a vp of thanks
i'm interested
would it be ok to invite one of my new business people from london
she doesn't know anyone in houston yet
we have a really old agreement with the referenced counterparty and i don't think we use it to trade under anymore
i spoke to the confirm desk and it appears all of our trading is under dynegy marketing and trade
if you concur
i would like to inactive that master
since i'm afraid it might get attached for online trading
per my conv
w/tanya
the above master should be inactived
which i have already done in lotus notes
and taken off the executed master list
all the dynegy trading is done out of dynegy marketing and trade
thanks
peter
i hate to say
but i had the same thought earlier this morning
is there not one thing we can do in this country without having a lawyer in the middle of it
we've all lost our common sense and direction
it sure makes for good tv
though
i sat all last night flipping from news station to news station getting their spin on what's going on
i can't say i've ever paid this much attention to a presidential election before
i've been telling everybody your spin on the electoral college and the 0 party system
that was a good thought
it's just you and me tomorrow
soma is having furniture delivered from star and they said they could only come between 0-0
so shall we drive together
do you want to come to my house
at what time
per our conv
above counterparty is ok to trade all products
except the usual credit deriv
argentina gas
the scary thing about those old goats being too blind to vote is that they're still driving
sounds good to me
i'll see you tomorrow am
rick borden at macleod dixon sent us a fax requesing copies of the documents on the prepay
can you send him a copy
also
when they're all together
can you send a copy to me for our files
thanks
michael
thought you might enjoy this
here's another spin on the election ballot
just a note that the new bandwidth is still in ebs legal being run thru the legal and regulatory hoops
as soon as i hear from robbi or marie that it's approved
i'll pass on the word
nymex is trying to get more competitive
sara shackleton
an attorney in our group
is drafting some language that we will be proposing to deutsche bank in response to their request that we add the enron companies they do financial business with to the definition of
specified entity
we have some concern that by adding certain enron entities to specified entity
a default in a swap transaction could possibly default certain structured loan transactions with a swap component
and we are trying to carve those transactions out
sara is also working on the funb agreement
i checked with her and the funb agreement we had been working from was so old that we agreed to start from the latest form of our agreement
so sara sent dee travella at funb a revised draft on 0/0/0
sara's direct phone no
is 0/0-0
i forwarded your agreement to leslie hansen
an attorney in our group
and she would prefer to work from our form if possible
let me know if this is a problem

please respond to jnugent
jennifer mcquade with eol called checking on the status of your conv

which is in two weeks
i hope that isn't going to cause any problems

here's that email of

i just can't help myself
i believe that this was authored by james carville
new york
ap
the new york mets announced today that they are going to court to get an additional inning added to the end of game 0 of the world series
the batting
pitching
and bench coaches for the mets held a press conference earlier today
they were joined by members of the major league players union
we meant to hit those pitches from the yankee pitchers
said the mets batting coach
we were confused by the irregularities of the pitches we received and believe we have been denied our right to hit
one claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the mets batters had intended to swing at fast balls
but actually swung at curve balls
it was clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls
though a much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches
reporters at the press conference pointed out that the mets had extensively reviewed film of the yankees pitchers prior to the world series and had in fact faced the yankees in inter-league play earlier in the year
the fact remains that some of the pitches confused us and denied us of our right to hit
said the mets batting coach
the world series is not over yet and the yankees are celebrating prematurely
major league baseball has reviewed the telecast of all the world series games and recounted the balls and strikes called by the umpires of each game
while some of the strikes called against the mets were
in fact
balls
there were not enough of them to change the outcome of the world series
the commissioner said
another portion of the mets legal claim stated that
based on on-base percentage
the mets had actually won the world series
regardless of the final scores of the games
it's clear that we were slightly on-base more often than the yankees
said a mets spokesman
the world series crown is rightly ours
the manager of the mets has remained in relative seclusion
engaging in some light jogging for exercise
he has stated that he believes
we need to let the process run its course without a rush to judgment
attached is the revised list giving calpine energy services the same approval as calpine power services
except no argentina gas
bandwidth now ok per marie
she should have gtc to you no later than noon tomorrow
no
we don't currently have alberta prepay docs
greg has finally gotten them all and is preparing sets
per mark's request
can we rename the headings on two charts with our gross numbers to match my list
net long or short position in all months combined
should be the net of our aggregate position
and
gross long or short position
should be our gross position on either side of the market
with the positions not netted out
at the request of mark taylor
can you get sara shackleton and brent hendry passwords too so they can review the dynegydirect gtc's
p.s
do we have any particular deadline for getting them approved
thanks
you guys crack me up
heck
we all know sending an agreement out for signature doesn't mean getting them back signed
if we had every agreement signed we sent out
we'd be at
jay
this one is from one of our london lawyers to me and a canadian lawyer
these last two were especially good
i guess the best thing about this mess is that it has provoked such good humor
you guys are cracking me up
i had tears streaming down my face this morning
hey
but i thought y'all played
american football
too
maybe i'm confused
at the request of leslie hansen
i am enclosing a clean and redlined draft of the revised nda
we have received the fully executed confidential nondisclosure agreement dated 0/0/0 between sapient corporation and enron net works llc and enrononline
llc
a copy will be sent to dave samuels
can you please direct one of the paralegals to assist angeline with getting this documentation in place
i thought susan would be appropriate because she handles internal masters
but i understand she is only responsible for rmt masters
i told the online people i had to shut them down for power because we didn't have them on any ferc lists
below is their ph
#
when you get a minute
i have passed your request to mark taylor to assign to another paralegal
i no longer handle the day to day swap work
i am working on online predominately now
by copy of this email
i will ask mark to let you know what paralegal he has assigned this to
rush below
this counterparty is approved for all products except power and argentina gas
no credit deriv too
g
additional event of default
the following will constitute an additional event of default for purposes of section 0
a
ix
i
in the case of party a
if enron corp
ceases to own
directly or indirectly
one hundred percent
0%
of the outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of party a having ordinary voting power
or
ii
in the case of party b
if enron corp
ceases to own directly or indirectly
one hundred percent
0%
or more of the outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of party b having ordinary voting power
we only send this to the legal team that follows
not the distribution that brad sends it to
what do you think
on first energy
we originally had them open for financial and shut down for power
no change to that earlier approval
i thought this might be helpful
thanks justy
you're the best
all the counterparties below can trade physical
and only the two i've marked below in red can trade financial
just a reminder
starting today until i get back after the holidays
send the counterparty approval lists to my assistant taffy milligan
and she will forward them to the legal team
so they can be working on their approvals while i'm gone
we have received the executed non-disclosure agreement dated 0/0/0 between the referencec counterparty and enron net works llc and enrononline
llc
a copy will be sent to dave samuels
fyi
with respect to deutsche bank
db
we have one credit issue remaining
db would like us to add all the enron trading entities db trades with as specified entities under the isda master agreement and we are somewhat hesitant to do so
as this could potentially roll up swaps under structured loan transactions into a default under the isda agreement
sara and bill bradford in credit are supposed to talk to the db credit people about this remaining issue
with respect to first union national bank
the draft we were working from was so old that they agreed to look at our current form of agreement which was sent to them on 0/0/0 for review
sara is working on that with susan bailey
another paralegal in our group
can you please give greg johnston
peter keohane and mark powell
lawyers in our calgary office
as well as their assistants linda sietzema and sharon crawford
full edit access to the financial trading agreements database
can you please let me know when their access has been granted
thanks
help me
i don't understand this lme contract
mark says that even though we trade it on eol and the trade is still done directly with us
it is still considered an lme contract
and not a lookalike
i think i might need to talk to you about this tomorrow
because i'm confused
also
i am getting a lot of calls from the mg people in new york about pursuing metals counterparties
and i think we need to figure out whether they should be talking to houston or london legal
i'm not sure who their lawyers should be
also
the online team here in houston is pursuing their business
and it's not clear to me if i should also be having them call you about potential metals customers
anyway
when i get in can i give you a call
also
i left a voicemail for your assistant
i'm trying to track down edmund's address so i can send him a gift
but no response
do you know when he'll be back
or how i can get in touch with him
as usual
you're the best
on a going forward basis
can we add the type of corporation or entity the counterparty is into the
corporate history
drop down in lotus notes
like delaware corporation
north dakota non-profit electric cooperative corporation
texas state agency
or whatever
it helps me and some of the non-us lawyers with their approvals for eol
thanks
on basin electric power cooperative
credit wants to open them up for power
but leslie's records are showing they are not a ferc approved marketer
if we want to open them for power
we're going to need the name and phone number of someone at the counterparty so we can talk to them about their ferc status
for hs energy services
no change to my prior approval
which would have them open for all financial except australian power
also
shutting down argentina gas
this link should be ok
thanks lisa
fyi
not wanting to duplicate any efforts
i think laurie meyer
a paralegal in alan aronowitz's group
is going to send me copies of the australian isda's when they come in
thanks for the offer
i don't know who is going to work on this one
but i just wanted to remind you that we had that big file with lots of due diligence on the tva
i was just speaking to ed sacks
and he asked if we could add a new credit person to our distribution lists
wendy conwell
who will be working with ed on the power counterparties
her ext
is 0
i checked with sara
and thursday at 0:0 pm is ok with us
just let us know if the time changes
should we come to bill's office
matt
can you let me know if the following products are approved for trading for singapore counterparties
and what restrictions
if any
they might have
like the eligible swap participant rules in the u.s
commodity derivatives
energy commodity
metals
weather derivatives credit derivatives further
would there be any limitation for a singapore counterparty to trade any of the products we offer
physical or financial online
i am going to attach to this one of our recent excel spreadsheets showing all the products we trade
are there any counterparties that are problematic for derivatives in singapore
for instance
here in the u.s
we flag governmental entities for no trading until we have a master in place
or upfront due diligence required before we can approve mutual funds or hedge funds
etc
thanks
thanks for the heads up
let me know when you need help
my copy had redlines
i passed the comments on to leslie hansen
an attorney in our group for review
sara
is there a reason i'm being sent this
will do
thanks for the heads up
matt
as you may or may not know
i am the liason in houston between the online team and legal
coordinating all responses for counterparty approvals for all products
i am asking because until recently i have not been approving singapore counterparties to trade any financial products
it has been my understanding that there are not problems for any counterparties trading physical products
i can continue my practice of not opening singapore incorporated counterparties to trade financial products online until i get a real push from a counterparty that wants to trade financial
should that be my continuing practice
i've made my flight reservations home for xmas
and they should only have me out friday
dec
0
my flight returns very early on the morning of wednesday
dec
0
so if there are no delays i should be in the office late sometime that morning
will do
can you please add my assistant
taffy milligan
on for full edit access to the referenced database
can you also delete shari stack from edit capability
as she is no longer in our group
also
can you provide me a list of the individuals with full edit access
i need to check to see if there are other people that have left our group or legal and credit that should be taken off
thanks
hey
mr
computer
you can't log an email in to your sister
we have received the executed non-disclosure agreement dated 0/0/0 with the referenced counterparty
a copy will be provided to dovie
i just spoke to tanya and she was going for either
0
bloomberg published a report that said energy supply was going to be low for the next couple of years
or
0
the california thing
she hadn't heard the energizer bunny story
just an update
susan bailey
a paralegal in our group
will be working on the confirmation
her direct no
is x0
and stephanie panus
another paralegal in our group
will be working on the isda master
her no is x0
when you have that address and contact information ready for the counterparty
why don't you email it directly to stephanie
if i can be of further help
just let me know
no problem
always happy to help
please note
we are intermediary on a deal we are structuring between interliant and purchasepooling
so we have added them as a party to receive the confidential information
if you work off this form you would
of course
want to strike the reference to purchasepooling in paragraph 0
it was good to hear from you
we had a nice thanksgiving here too
it's funny
because usually it's just me
mom
craig and danelia
and danelia doesn't really like roasted turkey or roast beef
not that she would say it to me
so there is not just the same joy in cooking it would be elsewise
it was good having the girls down
we played a new version of uno called
african uno
that was complex
fast and at times
physically challenging
it's not for the meek
it was incredible what a good player alena was
she had her cards memorized as well as everyone elses
when you play you'll see why you can know everyone elses hands
i expect craig didn't want mom to see his place because it was messy
i think compared to my house
he's embarrased about his apartment
then
also
he's got so much stuff in there right now
that i don't know how he's going to fit baby stuff
they would only give him a 0 month lease when he renewed his lease last month because they don't want 0 people in that small apartment
so he's going to have to start looking for another place
and his apartment is so run down down i'm afraid roaches might be crawling over the baby
i guess mom is going to come back down sometime in march or april to see the new baby
you'll have to come visit to check out my new house
the upstairs
guest suite
is pretty neat
it's got its own bathroom and tv
and is pretty cozy
as far as the call with uncle ben goes
if he was thrilled to hear from me i couldn't tell by his voice
it was a pretty stilted conversation for both of us
but
i guess
it's a start
i've already made my xmas plans
i leave the evening of the 0st
my flight comes in about 0 pm
and leave the morning of the 0th at 0 am
it's good chatting with you
keep in touch
you can take my assistant taffy milligan off these emails again
thanks
attached is the referenced agreement
let me know if the notice information is ok with you
if so
i'll get it signed by craig breslau today
then bring it to you for countersignature
thinking about that
what's your title
i'm not sure you have the authority to sign documents w/o special authority
no
it does not mean that
adding all the enron
specified entities
would only make a default under a financial transaction with those other enron entities a default under this agreement
our concern is that we don't want any trading related defaults to ever trigger a default under a loan transaction which has a swap as a component
i spoke to mark taylor about your signing authority
and he agrees that you do not have the authority to execute documents on your own
but as long as you are only co-signing documents signed by an authorized officer as a control measure we're ok
the referenced counterparty has applied in london for a password application
can you let me know if this presents any problems for each of your trading groups products
thanks
fyi
i understand from our natural gas people that they do not like the energygateway form of gtc and want to transact on their platform with only counterparties where we have a master agreement in place
i've got some changes to make to that assignment and then i'm ready to send it to them
do you have a contact for me to send it to
will the lme transactions go under a relevant financial master
if any
or will they always be standalone under the gtc
anthony
we have confidentiality provisions in many of our swap agreements that prohibit us from providing copies of our master swap agreements to other parties
including
other enron affiliates
all requests by non-enron north america employees for copies of swap master agreements should be forwarded to the paralegals in the swap group to determine if the agreement will allow us to provide copies to such affiliate
or whether we would need counterparty approval to do so
with respect to the agreements listed below
i will take a look at those and let you know whether they present any problem
thanks
i'll fax it over to her today
does dr
batsell's company have a name
fyi
bill bradford in credit had a conference call today with the deutsche bank credit person and i think we have come to agreement on not adding any specified entities to the isda master agreement
he also discussed proposed credit limits for the three other deutsche bank masters we want to get in place
including enroncredit.com
i think we are done now and hope to get execution documents from them
since the documents are on their system
our intention is to then get deutsche bank to turn around 0 like masters
making any changes necessitated by change of law
and otherwise turn around the remaining masters quickly
i'll keep you posted
we're going to have a legal happy hour tomorrow at the blue agave
and it would be no party without you there
hope you can make it
and ask any of your buddies in legal you want to ask
please forward this to 0 of your closest friends
we do have a credit support annex in place
once we sign the ena agreement
we will make your requests to db
another good one
per email from leslie hansen
one of our power attorneys
counterparty cannot transact us physical power
on the financial side
we just got an isda master agreement in place with this counterparty
so they should be ok for all financial
except credit derivatives
bankruptcy swaps
we will only consider those on a case by case basis
per sara shackleton
an attorney in the swap group
there is nothing about this counterparty that would require any special reps and counterparty should not in any way be considered a
governmental
no argentina gas for any non-argentina counterparties
all other us products appear to be ok
it was making me sleepy just looking at it
see if this works
we have received the following fully executed documents back from 0
provider agreement dated 0/0/0
this agreement provides that the monthly membership fee of $0,0 shall be waived for the first six months of the contract
starting november 0
0 thru may 0
0
0
natural gas marketplace general terms and conditions dated 0/0/0
a copy will be sent to sheri thomas and craig breslau
a woman named janette bertel at mclaren energy just left a message for genia who had just sent them a power master
that they also want to get an isda master in place with us
the woman's phone no is 0/0-0
if you could send up some credit for this
we'd appreciate it
the wheels of deutschebank turn very slowly
it appears their credit guy didn't communicate our agreement regarding specified entities to his legal team
so sara shackleton said they are confirming that information before they send a revised draft
further
he said all changes have to be sent to germany first for approval
so now we need to wait on germany
for those of you keeping track
carrizo makes 0 master swap agreements
conferring with team swap
we have at least 0 masters out or going out for sigature this week
including the 0 merit energy partner masters
unlike the media in the presidential election
i hesitate to call this one an early win
especially after seeing the board in marie's office
but i must say
team swap is looking strong
my strategy on hand recounts
is that if if the opposition wants one
they'll have to do it themselves

matt
beth cowan is a member here of the enrononline marketing team
her counterparty
anadarko petroleum corporation
would like to get an isda master agreement in place with ectric

that would not be an appropriate form for london to use
it is also on our form of schedule from 0
which we wouldn't want to work off of either
in addition
i've checked the confidentiality provisions
and they do not have affiliate language in that would allow me to provide a copy of the agreement to you w/o counterparty's consent

this is a mark taylor question
we have received an executed copy of the non-disclosure agreement between analytica
inc
and enron net works
llc and enrononline
llc
a copy will be sent to dave samuels and kal shah
we have lots of isda's in place with
southerns
southern
who
we have an isda master agreement
local currency-single jurisdiction
in place with between ena and southern company energy marketing l.p
i am a little concerned if canada wants to trade under this pursuant to the services agreement
being a local currency-single jurisdiction form
it does not have tax and currency provisions that would enable us to do a cross border trade
if you would like to do trades under this
we might want to consider amending it to add the necessary provisions
adding the provisions into the confirmation
or replacing it with a multicurrency agreement
any thoughts on how you would like to approach this
i would like to amend my earlier approval with respect to the isda master agreement we recently executed with this counterparty to limit their financial trading to energy commodity trading only
this counterparty is not approved to trade any other products including
but not limited to
weather
pulp
paper
plastics
steel
metals
interest rate
currency
fx
or credit derivatives
i'm just sitting here worrying about one of my side deals with frank
so just to reiterate a global shut down
like-no one does credit derivatives unless we really mean it
no non-european based counterparty
in all probability
no counterparty originating from u.s
credit
should be approved to trade european physical power products
they have licensing requirements similar to our ferc licensing
thanks
so far
i can probably leave on time today
which would be about 0:0 pm
let's just check again as the end of the day gets closer
i think it would be a good idea to meet there
since we're coming from opposite directions
dinner sounds good to me
oops
already had to make change
can she get it wrong twice within 0 minute
the answer is yes
for the two amended counterparties listed
i have amended-no change
because neither was approved for physical power or financial trading
and i do not want that to change
i don't care about credit opening them up or shutting them down for physical gas
are you there
i tried calling and no one picked up
i'm ready to go
ena does not have an isda master in place with pg&e energy trading power l.p
enron canada does have an isda master in place with pg&e energy trading
canada corporation
could the trades be done under that master
also
below is an agent that should connect you to the financial trading agreement database
where you can look up what master agreements we have in place
i haven't done anything
i was waiting for you to get back in to discuss this
my new address is
0 banks st
houston 0
i would love to come to your dinner party
yep

i tried calling you about 0:0 yesterday

attached is the uk form of isda schedule which should have the uk choice of law and arbitration language in it
i send it with a caveat that this draft is 0 years old
the london lawyers were gone by the time i got your call
so i couldn't check to see if they have revised this
so by copy of this to matt dawson
i am asking him to confirm that there is no substantive change in the choice of law or arbitration language
derek
i think we just need to revise the header on the chilean annex to say
annex a-chile
when it was renamed
it wasn't renamed in the front of the confirmation
so we just need to fix that glitch
susan bailey in our group sends out this list
your should direct your request to her

llc dated 0/0/0

my understanding of this nda is that london gave it directly to craig chaney to get executed by the counterparty
so
david
i think you need to get a copy from craig
and then forward a copy on to me
how did it get to be that these people are drafting their own nda's
i thought our agreement when we met with dovie keptra was that i would draft them
i would prefer every time not to have to figure out what they've changed
i ran this by leslie
and she has no problem
so go ahead and send it out to your customer
if you could please keep us in the loop on the status of any negotiations or execution

dave
per your conversation with mark last week
it appears the confirmation desk people are still waiting for the
oops trade
language
why do i keep getting these new products for approval
someone must be cleaning out their office
because a notice of a restructuring from black stone holdings parnership mysteriously showed up on my desk
with no note
i have no idea if credit knows about this because it is so old
the notice dated 0/0/0
says effective 0/0/0
black stone holdings partnership transferred all of its assets and liabilities to black stone minerals company l.p
a delaware limited partnership
let me know whether or not credit knew about this already
if not
i'll send a copy down to you
it was my understanding from way back when that they were no longer trading under the blackstone financial master
so this may be moot
if we are trading with them again
we never did get the corporate documents on the partnership from them and we may want to use this as an excuse to get them
as you requested
i just got a call from deutsche bank a minute ago
and they got approval from frankfurt and are overnighting the agreement to me for signature
i'll keep you posted
we have two new lawyers that have joined our group today
francisco pinto-leite and frank sayre
they will need access to the financial trading agreement database
in addition
i am still waiting to hear that cheryl nelson has been granted access to the financial trading database
can you let me know what the scoop is
also
i left you a message this morning about my new database for online documents
when can we expect a roll out of that
people keep sending me documents and i have no place to record them
thanks
as usual for your help
per tanya's comments at our legal/credit meeting yesterday
i would like to have the referenced counterparty come thru again to shut them down for financial trading
per tanya
all financial trading for the calpine family should be done out of calpine energy services
l.p
attached is the form of nda for distribution to your customer
carol
susan is out today

i have a bunch of trainees coming thru so taffy just made up a bunch of new sets of isda documents and is 0 hole punching them and putting them in the binders
do you want them messengered out to your home
or just available for you when you get back to the office
i knew that
i must've had a brain drain
as you requested
i am attaching our form of bilateral nda for the enron networks group
please remember that all counterparty specific drafts must be prepared by legal
bad news
we got the deutsche bank documents in and they weren't signed by them yet
and none of the supporting documentation was provided
so
i think we are going to be on the longer side of the execution timetable vs
the shorter side
you're relentless
you are too good to me
the person we are dealing with is very nice
stephen kessler
their lawyer out of new york
he has been very helpful
we just don't know how long it will take it to get processed once it leaves our shop
our intention is to fedex the isda out to steve tonight
the enron guaranty will take a little more time
so at his suggestion we will follow up with that later
so we can keep the isda moving

again
my time frame is short here
so if i can get your response promptly i would be most appreciative
done
i was looking this up for clickpaper and notice bob was working on this master
wanted to pass on this email from tanya
do i owe you any other lists
so what should i do with this
credit has them as being an
esp
which means they are an eligible swap participant under the rules of the cftc
the cftc sets financial criteria
such as certain net worth and assets tests for companies to trade financial products
sometimes counterparties can still meet the legal criteria
but credit may not want to do that type of business with them

we have done some preliminary due diligence regarding the ability of the public service company of new mexico to enter into financial transactions
based on our conversations with them and review of their board resolution
it appears
0
they are an investor owned utility
not a governmental entity 0
their board resolution only approves electricity futures
options or swaps
and gas or oil futures
options or swaps
0
they cannot enter into financial transactions over 0 months
it is imperative that anyone trading with this counterparty be made aware of this restriction please call me if you have any questions

the nymex will hold the following classes in houston in june
those of you so inclined might want to reserve a seat now
as they go fast
all the february classes are already booked
you can call the nymex at 0/0-0 if you would like to attend

introduction to nymex products-held june 0 0
intermediate hedging-june 0

per my conversation with peter earlier today
below is a list of classes that mark may want to coordinate his houston secondment with so he can attend some
internal classes
basics of risk management
0/0
0/0 filling up-act quickly 0/0
0/0
lots of room still here the internal classes book up quickly
everything between now and april is already full with large waiting lists
if he is really interested he should try and sign up for classes immediately
he can do that by going to the
development center
icon
aka
ernie
then he can sign up on the computer
external nymex class
i checked with the local nymex office
and their next classes are as follows
june 0
introduction to nymex products june 0
intermediate hedging
intro class a prerequisite
june 0
intermediate options
intro class a prerequisite
like the internal classes
the nymex classes also fill quickly
their february classes are already full
as i also mentioned
the first weekend in april is when the roundtop antiques festival is
it is a great way to see the countryside outside of houston
all the local towns around roundtop also have antique festivals at that time
the wildflowers should be in bloom
and that is alway impressive
with the cold weather and rain
we might have a really good year for wildflowers this year
anyway
the above may help mark get the most out of his time in houston
don't think so
but i'll check w/the nymex and let you know
i just spoke to dave fuller in the portland office about a potential 0 year deal he wants to do as soon as possible with the referenced entity
as we all know
because of the legal issues that arose out of the
orange county
litigation
no financial trades should be entered into with any governmental entity before legal due diligence of the counterparty has been completed and an isda master is in place
also
besides the usual issues surround the governmental's authority to enter into derivative transactions
we also need to determine whether this entity can enter into transactions as long as 0 year w/o prior voter approval
credit
if you will send the credit worksheet directly to me i will prepare a draft asap and sara will review it
dave should be calling you with the information
christian
if you have done any due diligence already on this counterparty we would appreciate any assistance/documents you can provide
thank you all for your assistance with this
it is because we are required to due certain corporate due diligence prior to trading
which we don't do unless they really want to trade financial
most of these counterparties are really interested in trading physical products
so we don't bother to do the necessary due diligence
if they really want to trade financial
we could transact w/o a master
we'd just have to check their corporate documents
file consents to service of process
etc
if we're doing all that we tend to say let's just get the master in place while we're at it
i asked tanya to confirm for me who in credit whould be getting the emails about signed masters
and below is here response
thanks tanya
you're the best
francisco
you should have gotten my email back to justin
we have two sets of online customers coming thru
one set that originates from houston credit and one set originates from london credit
we are responsible for responding for houston credit based customers
and london legal for london based customers
a side issue to all of this is how we gather legal advice on trading around the world
we don't want to duplicate efforts and costs by having both houston and london legal departments requesting separate advice
our office is responsible for legal advice in the americas and southeast asia
while london leads the efforts in europe
after we each receive advice we provide copies and communicate to each other the advice received
even though we both receive the same legal advice
sometimes we don't always agree on the approach in a particular country
and at the end of the day
each legal dept
is responsible for their own clients
as far as the advice on mexico
chile and argentina
as i told justin
the advice i have received from the houston lawyers is that although we can transact financial products in these countries
we have certain legal risks in doing so
and we need to do corporate due diligence to check their appropriate corporate documents to see if they are allowed to do these
and further
most of these counterparties have not filed consents to service of process here in the u.s
which we require in order to trade with us
since what these counterparties usually want to trade are physical products
we don't waste our time doing the due diligence at this point
if a counterparty really wanted to trade financial we would spend the time resolving those issues
as you become the responsible lawyer
first in mexico
and maybe in the rest of south america
you may have a different opinion on these issues and we can certainly change our policies at any time
all of the above is just what my current direction is from our lawyers
mark haedicke just got back today
i'm sure he's been putting out fires this morning and janette will get back to me as soon as she has a change to chat
thanks you for your response
i will make the change in the company name and circulate the copies for signature
i hope to get them out to you in the next day or so
looks perfect
per a conversation i just had with saul laureles
an attorney with chamberlain
hrdlicka
who has been hired to assist apache/shell with the assignment of the fletcher challenge business
he said
fletcher challenge would like to assign their petro business to shell holdings for a short time
like one day or so
shell would then immediately transfer the agreement/transactions to apache
he proposes we get a new master in place with apache
since apache is a better credit than fletcher challenge
he said he will send me some letter showing how he would like to do this
along with a draft apache isda
without collateral
of course
since apache is such a good credit
i told him that i can't speak for credit
but we probably are going to have a big problem on that last point
we never enter into masters without a collateral annex attached
i'll keep you posted when i hear from him
don't know about the shell intermediary part
i hope that will be spelled out in his email
also
we have about a 0 year old local currency isda in place with them
so we could put the trades under that master
i don't know if we want to upgrade the master at this time
or just stay where we are
he said we didn't have a master w/apache
but when entered my notes into lotus notes i noticed we did
i called him back
he didn't know erms was the same as ena
on your excel spreadsheet for clickpaper
can you add the physical products to the legal tab so i don't have to copy those over each time
thanks
this counterparty is on the 0/0/0 list
can you open them up asap as follows
no physical power
for financial-u.s
financial nat gas products only
all other physcial products ok
i do not need to see london's lists
please take me off this distribution
i do not need to see london's lists

the steel products below need to be approved
and i don't know what lawyer in your group approves steel now that marcus is in the power group
so
per your email
i have approved them to trade all financial products
correct

mark taylor mark greenberg stacy dickson-nat gas shari stack-power wayne gresham-coal brent hendry-weather john viverito-emissions
we previously had this counterparty open to trade financial because they were esp
and now your 0/0/0 list says they are not esp
which is it
please shut down the above counterparty from trading all financial products
they are no longer an esp
my email was more directed to the lawyers
kinda telling them what their job was once they get access
whatever we need to do the load the systems
or whatever training
it's ok by me
thanks
attached is the nda you requested
are these in the swap forms bank so we can't alter them by mistake
the finance group is trying to locate some really old
master agreements
done in 0
we looked around and we didn't have any masters in place for the counterparties
but i was thinking maybe they really weren't
master agreements
but our old style confirmations
the two counterparties were state street bank
as trustee for cash i
and citibank as agent
for cash i
the agreements were listed in the closing documents as
interest rate agreement
and
commodity swap agreement
can you look around and see if you have some really old active trades out there for either of those counterparties
so not to confuse you
about 0 or so years ago
we did some deals for state street for the cash vi project
the master for cash vi is actually is listed in the financial trading database
thanks for your help

since physical steel is a new online product
i need to know from you whether you are aware of any reason why any existing counterparty should not be ablto trade physical steel
from your perspective
i would consider whetherthere is any legal reason barring a counterparty incorporated out of the usfrom buying physical steel
or whether you are aware of any current litigation
payment disputes or other similar legal reasons which would prevent an existing counterparty from trading physical steel
also
on a going forward basis
is there any legal impediments for any newcounterparties trading physical steel
lisa
i have a call into the physical steel lawyer
we will not be able to copy an existing profile for physical steel
physical steel is a totally new onlinproduct for us
we
obviously
cannot copy financial steel
because counterparties may be prohibited from trading it if they are not esp's
iftheir master doesn't let them trade steel
etc
the usual swap issues
what i think my answer is going to be is that there is no legal reason why anycounterparty cannot trade physical steel
so i would open all counterpartieup to trade it
i'm checking with the physical steel lawyers to confirm this
just a note
global contracts should also not be able to copy a profile
because they should have a totally new gtc dealing with physical steel issues specifically
i'm sure karen will probably copy me in on her email
just in case
i want to confirm what global contracts is saying for this one
i'll get back to you to confirm the above for legal

a little boy
she lives around the block from me on vassar
so a few of us went over to visit her
we had to cancel lucinda's baby shower the night before it because the baby was early
i'm a little afraid to go see hannibal
maybe something a little cheerier

thanks
i looked at the website and it looked great
alena's photo of chris is really good

the photos of daniel were really good

he really is a handsome baby
i am going to have to get one of those cameras so i can send chris photos to post of the website
maybe we can start the jones family monthly magazine and publish stories
articles
etc
one a month
i can be the editor
chris can be the layout guy
what do you think of that
we could require every family member to send something in once a month
per our conversation

what are your thoughts on the below
below is enron's password that will give you access to the isda netting opinions online
i just got off the phone with margaret lester
a contract administrator at dynegy
and harlan murphy
an attorney she works with
there was some misinformation communicated to them about eol
and i told them the only way we would trade online with them was under the existing master
not under the online gtcs
we wanted the bankruptcy protection the master affords
they want to replace the old erms master with an isda and i told them we would be happy to generate the master
can i get some credit from you so i can turn around a master quickly
or we will have to work off their form
which will then become an isda comparison which will be a lot more work in the long run
much thanks as usual for your prompt help

i send the originals to dave samuels

please forward this link to any members of your team that might find it helpful
if you like
i can get you database access that will allow you to review the comments between legal

this level of access will also give you edit capability
so you need to be careful not to change things by mistake

bud ricketts called up and just wanted to get an email of the physical power agreement
i think because he wanted to make comments on the form on the computer so he could prepare a blackline draft
as a follow-up to my email regarding the execution of the 0/0/0 isda master agreement between deutsche bank ag and enron north america corp
please be further advised
effective 0/0/0
bankers trust company was acquired by deutsche bank ag
all financial trading should now be transacted under the above deutsche bank isda master agreement
no further financial trading should be done in the name of bankers trust company
and the 0/0/0 isda interest rate and currency exchange agreement with bankers trust company should be inactivated
all outstanding bankers trust company financial trades were assigned to deutsche bank ag in the isda master agreement
and all the bankers trust company trades should be moved to deutsche bank
as a followup
this guys name is mykhaylo koshel and he is an outside consultant with the new concept group

and he said he
jeff blumenthal and morris clark can certainly help us with trading related tax issues
however
he is grooming susan musch to become the lead trading tax person
so we might want to start calling her
her ph no
is
do you want me to call steve kessler re
enron corp
yes
you do not have access to lotus notes
because i have been hung out to dry
they don't have time to keep up with our demands for access
so they want me to do this
and they have sent me instructions and are working on getting me the level of access to change approvals
but i'm not there yet
all things will come
it make take a bit longer
the computer people will no longer do this for us
i am going to have to do this myself
and i don't know how
i've got to figure this out
jay
to reconfirm my conversation yesterday with reid grossman
a consultant hired by the referenced counterparty to negotiate their trading documents with us
0
pud #0 would also like to get gas and power trading agreements in place with us
per my conversation with dave fuller yesterday
the physical trading agreements are of a higher priority than the financial trading agreement
0
they would like to get a draft of a collateral annex from us
their suggested trading threshold for themselves was in the $0.0-0mm range
0
they would already be in default of the mac's you sent me in the credit worksheet dated 0/0/0
we need to revisit the macs
0
they think a 0rd party debt threshold of $0mm is too low for them
they suggested a threshold of $0mm
0
the agreement provides for annual and quarterly financial statements
i don't think they have quarterly
you need talk to them about what they can/will provide
if you would like to talk to reid directly
his ph no
is 0/0-0
by the way
reid is an old buddy of bill bradford from reid's avista/pg&e days
and reid sends his regards to bill
if you see bill pass this message on
it is not clear to me how we should handle this
what do you sugguest
as a note
i will be out of the office on friday
my boss mark taylor was handling this with phillip allen
i don't know what they ever resolved
i forwarded your email on to mark and i left a voicemail for him to please respond
taffy
was this taken care of
we have received the fully executed non-disclosure agreement with the referenced counterparty
copies will be distributed
things may come in a little differently because of profile manager
my direct input into the eol system
i will now only see amendments to counterparties that have already been approved
thru profile manager
they will not be coming in thru the spreadsheets any more
so
on amendments that affect power
i am going to have to send you an email about the change
for the above counterparty
we originally had them open for power sales only
now
credit is coming back thru wanting to open them up for the bid and the offer
do you want to change the earlier approval from power sales only
or open them up all the way
attached is an email i got from the lawyer for fletcher challenge
obviously
he is on a short time frame
so we need to respond rather quickly
russell
we need some direction from credit on how we want to proceed on this assignment
do you want to meet to go over this
and maybe give bert a call
or what
please let us know
at the request of rahil jafry
i am attaching a copy of our proposed first amendent to license agreement
which extends the term from february 0
0 to april 0
0
if the amendment meets with your approval
please execute it and return it to me via fax no
0
0-0
if you have any questions or comments please call me at
0
0-0 or rahil at
0
0-0
we look forward to hearing from you
no change yet
we are short w/space
computers
and my assistant is working with our computer floor tech to find a computer and some space so our lawyers can log into the system
two our our lawyers are now out for the week
our gas
power lawyers
keegan
please include me
as well as all members of the team
on any distributions when members of the swap group are going to be out of the office
this would include mark taylor
sara shackleton
carol st
clair
mary cook
francisco pinto leite
cheryl nelson
bob bruce
frank sayre
susan bailey
samantha boyd
stephanie panus
thanks
for consolidated edison energy
inc
coming thru by credit to open them for us east power
you already had them open to trade all power under the gtc
so i am going to keep them at that
i'm not so sure i agree with your name change for us department of the interior
i think as part of the name we've got to have that it's a govt agency
anything else would be misleading to what it actually is
i think more appropriate would be united states department of the interior
minerals management service
what is the nature of the confidential information being discussed
will our standard language
furnished in connection with a possible transaction or other business relationship
suffice
or do you want to be more specific
also
do you want the bilateral form
ok by me
have fun
per the directions of sam schott
i am forwarding this email on to you
i discussed the counterparty name
minerals management service
with my boss
mark taylor
general counsel of ena
and he agreed that agencies and departments of the us government should have the correct governmental agency/department as part of the counterparty name
you could say
minerals management service
is a dba for the us department of the interior
we generally do not like to contract with dbas
we want the legal entity as part of the name
a more appropriate name for this counterparty is
us department of the interior minerals management service
the way the exposure rolls up under the gcp system is an exposure issue
not a contract issue
if you disagree with this assessment
please call mark taylor at x0
don't we need to chat about this
looks good to me
i'm putting it on my calendar
i just tried to call you
i couldn't get through
what are you discussing with carr
is this just for them to enter into an beta
or something else
also
do you want a bilateral agreement
who will be providing the confidential information
it shouldn't take me too long to draft you and nda once i get this info
i'll email it to the counterparty and copy you in on the email
of course
we have to get it signed here in houston
so time is of the essence
per wayne gresham
a lawyer in the coal group
we are having a substantial payment dispute with the referenced counterparty
and george mcclellan
the business person
and a managing director
would like to shut them down immediately for all trading
which appears to be coal and emissions
offline and online
until this payment dispute is resolved
paul
attached are the 0 ndas you requested
please let me know if they meet with your approval
and i will email them to your customers
i've got confirmation of the following non-refundable plane fare

returning sunday march 0 at 0:0 am
staying at the sheraton suite at 0 barclay parade sw
is that a good hotel
if you do not have access yet to the financial trading agreement database
this link should get you access
hopefully when you open up your computer tomorrow you will now have an icon to get in
credit people
if you do not have edit capability let me know and i will get you access
link
>
i'll work on getting it for you
with respect to western area power administration
crsp
can't
ditto
credit on that one
credit gives no direction as to what they want to trade
the database reflects that leslie approved them to trade power already in july of last year
so my intention is to keep them open
i don't know what
crsp
means at the end of their name
do you
never mind
sorry about the missing information
i just spoke to credit about one counterparty on the list
you've got utah municipal power agency shut down to trade since they're not ferc authorized
they specifically came through online wanting to trade power
and credit wants to know if you can give them a call and determine if you can get whatever evidence you need to get them open for power
the name of the guy that sent the application in is richard judd and his ph no
is
0
0-0
thanks
that was cute
does matt lee
our lawyer in the singapore office
know he needs to file ndas with you
link
>
it sounds like he knows you should be included in the loop
i should get a copy
i hope
so we'll see if that's true
great
it really is a good database and i hope people use it as a resource more
it's the first thing we here in legal look at when someone asks us a question about a master
attached is the current list of the confidentiality agreements i have prepared for the enron net works and enrononline teams
please review this list and let me know if you have any comments or questions with respect to this list
attached is our proposed form of non-disclosure agreement
please let me know if i didn't get the company name correct
thanks for your help with this
when tom is right
he's right
ditto for me
offer still good
how goes things with the new beau
also
thanks for the cooked meats
they were delicious
no
i havent heard anything back
do you want to call them
as a general matter
you need to use the forms of confidentiality agreements contained in the atty.fms bank
not the swap group's forms
we have developed a few of our own forms for special purposes
one
which is in the swap forms database/current forms
protects the counterparty only
and is used when credit wants to get copies of financal statements from a counterparty and protects the financial information being provided by the counterparty
i have developed forms for use by the enrononline team
but those should not be used for any enron company except enrononline and enron net works
for any other types of matters/projects
we would also use the forms contained in the atty.fms bank
they are still trying to get people onto the system
what is going on with getting that terminal set up so i lawyers can review the products
your fax of the signed nda did not come through all the way
i only got part of the first page
could you please refax back the whole document so i can get it signed by enron
thanks
yes
i'll have mark initial it and send it down for signature tomorrow
tom is the man
ditto for me
deutsche bank has gotten back to me and is vacillating on what they want to do with the bankers trust trades
in particular
they haven't thought through what they want to do with the online trades
don't like on online documentation
and now they think they may want to do a full novation of the trades once they decide how to resolve this
so
until we hear back from them
they said in about a week
just let the bankers trust financial trades and master sit
yes
please send this up to me
thanks
the 0 series
frequently i use 0-0
the bilateral form
will these instructions allow me to change the credit people too
i will be having about 0-0 other people that i will need added to this database
should i send these requests back directly to you
or do them through the system as well
also
there are two ways of getting edit access through this database
one is for employees of legal
who can then enter legal comments
and the other is for employees of credit
who can then enter credit comments
do you see that choice
is there some way for me to verify which employees of legal and which employees of credit have what access
i know that some employees of credit have legal access by mistake
can i get lists of the legal and credit breakdowns
i took friday
feb 0 off
i'll be trying to do that big request
and will let you know if it doesn't go right
sounds like your world is a little up in the air right now
best wishes for success in whatever you decide to do
it has been a pleasure working with you over these years
you should have edit access now
why don't you go try and see if it works
how do i do more than one request at a time
can you call me a x0
they must not let her take time off anymore
it is quite disruptive to all our business to have her our of the office
don't you think
per our meeting
attached are the current forms of mac clauses
i have added at the end of the list
the event of default for change in ownership because i know that one comes up frequently
also
i don't know if you want to also suggest that the other trading groups work from our guaranty forms as well as our lc form
the legal heads of each of the trading groups are
mark taylor
financial trading jeff hodge
physical gas trading elizabeth sager
physical power trading alan aronowitz
physical global markets
liquids
plastics
coal
emissions

julie murray

pulp
paper
steel
mark greenberg asked me to send you the password application to be used for the brokers
actually
there will not be a password application
what they will be signing instead is the attached fee agreement
any questions
call me
mark taylor or mark greenberg
i ran it by mark and he has no strong feeling one way or another about the comma thing
so whatever you prefer
a novation is just the european based format for doing an assignment
i tried to get you access yesterday
there are three angela davis's in the system
what's your email address
i just sent the request
i put a rush on it
so hopefully it should get approved today
i think my bicycle is 0 centimeters
i hope you have a tire pump
because i don't and i haven't ridden the bike in about a year and i know the tires are totally flat
i left you a voicemail yesterday about getting a master in place with anadarko located here in houston so they can trade brent crude and ipe lookalikes on enrononline under a master instead of a gtc
we have an isda in place with anadarko
but since ectric is the counterparty online for those products
the trades wouldn't go under the ena master
the trader is pestering me about this
what i would like to do is handle getting this isda in place with ectric here in houston
if that's ok with you
just mirroring the us master
except getting a multicurrency in place since we have a local currency in place with ena
is that ok with you
is ian a lawyer
paralegal or credit person
also
mark mentioned the london legal has been restructured somehow
and he asked me to ask you if could you fax us an org chart that shows the structure
i hear you got a fancy new car
you are absolutely by far
no comparisons
the best
from my mouth to his ear
ok with me
i don't think i need new tires
unless i'm surprised
you might want to buy an extra tire in case you get a flat
i think i loaned harry my old spare tire
anytime saturday is fine
i know i'm a pest
but we've got another gov't agency that doesn't have its legal entity as part of the name
this one is on the list of 0/0/0
and it is the western area power administration
a division of the department of energy
acting through it
crsp
area
i'm not sure what that stands for
it's the central something something area
id#0
this particular counterparty has come up before on eol
acting through another area
the upper great plains area
id#0
the way i had this counterparty approved for eol
i thought
was
western area power administration-upper great plains
a division of the united states department of energy
i don't know if we can go back and get this one fixed too
but it would sure make legal happy if we did
some financials from james hardie have been floating around the company for about a week and they just made their way up to me
i'm going to have them forwarded down to you
yes
i fedexed tradespark out to them
if you remember
i brought the file copy around to you for the file
nope
we still don't have a terminal we can use
the fellow from alliant keeps calling me to check on the status of his access to enrononline
we received the executed eta amendment about 0 weeks ago and he is really hot to trade
can you give me some estimate of when we can expect to get him out of credit
or call him if there are some credit issues
his name is steve castleberg and his ph
is 0/0-0
thanks
attached is the link that will give you view access to the financial trading agreement database

i forgot
did either of you send this agreement to anthony
i saw this list in the computer and you're on it
when you get back give a call and i'll come around and take a look
we now have a computer set up so you can view the tradespark website
it is located in a cubicle across from the c-0 conference room
on the side opposite of me
at eb0d
since it has taken us so long to get access into this website
it is critical that each of you review your products descriptions of the website as soon as possible
can you each please confirm to me that you have completed your review and if you have any issues with the product descriptions please pass them on to sheri thomas with enrononline
if for any reason you continue to have computer problems
please call jason

asap
thanks for your prompt attention to this
below is the link to our financial trading agreements database
this database reflects all the master swap agreements we have executed or out in draft form
i just updated the chase bank to reflect the amendment for your re-hypothecation of securities
stephanie panus
the paralegal that worked on this amendment
is having a copy walked down to you
i thought you might find this database helpful to look up the status of documents in the future
if you think other people in your group might find this database helpful

not me
did you want this cpy on the list for legal/credit meeting
erms hasn't been expanded as an enron company to be added to list for discussion at meeting
and we have some old erms era masters people are working on that aren't getting discussed
and some erms era masters that should be unchecked so we do not discuss them at meeting
please remember that when adding a new counterparty whose name start with the word
the
the
the
should go out the end of the name in brackets
an example is
times mirror company
the
this will help our searching capability
thanks
you might want to talk to your credit team about the top ten list for the legal/credit meeting
i think we're only at 0 top ten
we just opened the above counterparty to trade uk financial crude products online
since the enron counterparty for these products is ectric we will need to get a master in place between ectric and counterparty
justin boyd in london has graciously agreed to let us handle drafting and negotiation of the master
could you please provide us with credit for this master
i don't know if we can just mirror the credit terms in the old master or not
since the old master is a local currency master
we cannot do a simple dupe and change it for uk issues
i would suggest unless we really have problems with issues
we more or less try to sign the same paper whenever possible
of course
send the credit worksheet for the new master to the paralegals for the rotation
attached for transmittal to your customer is the prebon beta and fee agreement amended to reflect the changes from the loi
i am also attaching a blackline so you can see the changes from the first draft
you should now have edit capability in the financial trading agreements database
i got a clickpaper list today from carol north
is she a new member of credit
are we sure that the above counterparty is us and not canadian
is this the final form
does carol north work in credit
so
i should expect to get my future clickpaper approvals from her
i just don't want to look at any lists but what credit sends to me
do you have a contact at the counterparty
it is not where they are headquartered that necessarily matters
but where they are incorporated
attached is a clean and a blacklined draft of the beta
this draft was created using the new beta form
and the blackline compares this draft against the form
i have also attached a blackline from the intial draft we sent counterparty to the draft we are sending counterparty now
in case you want to show them all the changes from that draft
that blackline is called prebon.red below
we have received the executed amendment to electronic trading agreement with the referenced counterparty dated 0/0/0
copies will be distributed
tana jones will be attending
at the request of bob shults
i am enclosing revised drafts of the referenced documents
0
clean copy of beta incorporating all changes 0
blacklined draft of beta reflecting changes made to the form of beta since we sent you the original draft on 0/0/0 0
blacklined draft of beta reflecting changes made to the beta form to make it deal specific for prebon 0
clean copy of fee agreement incorporating changes since 0/0/0 0
blacklined draft of fee agreement reflecting changes made to 0/0/0 draft
just a check
my notes in the database say we had this counterparty open for power
but when i check on profile manager
they have a read only status
do we want them open for power or not
sorry about that edmund
the forms have been moved out of the atty.fms bank into their own subdirectory called
swap forms
look it up just like a person's named directory
let me know whether you can access that database from london
we had london set up to review the atty.fms bank only
i don't know if you can access other subdirectories
we have made some substantive revisions to the isda schedule and credit support annex
so you might want to take a look
if you can't do a comparewrite from london
let me know and i'll email you the blacklined forms
we've also made changes to the forms of guarantees
they are now located in a document called guaranty.doc in the swap forms/current forms directory
also
the isda definitions have been changed since you've been gone
you may already know that
but just in case
i thought i'd bring it up
my database is not showing that i've looked at this counterparty before
so i need to know if they are an esp
or not
we have a master swap agreement in place with energy west incorporated
a canada corporation
your list shows
inc
instead of
incorporated
and that it is a us corporation
is this the same counterparty
edmund cooper just called and wanted to know what form changes we have made as a result of the new cftc rules
i told him we just met on that yesterday
and as soon as we revised the form
we would send it to london
also
if there will be any changes in our advice to the traders resulting from this
please let him and he will disseminate the information to london legal
do you know who in london is actually updating legal's comments to profile manager
i can't believe justin does this everyday
i'm with you on montana
i checked the files in the big file room
and it is a montana corporation
can you please change the name of the corporation from
inc
to
incorporated
thanks
good
i thought i just had a checkup with bikesport shortly before i stopped riding
i was just a little afraid i might need grease
keep me posted
have fun
this counterparty came thru on 0/0/0 list
i checked my database and we had them open for power sales only on the pre-approval list
when i checked profile manager
it had them open for east
west power
transact on both the bid and offer
do you still want them to do power sales only
both east
west
thanks
i know i've been a pest to you today
is there any reason why this counterparty has transact on nl power
i cannot believe they have a power marketing license there
profile manager also has this counterparty on transact for other european financial products
are we really trading those products
because i don't think we should be
taffy
can you help angela with this
thanks
this link should get you access to our financial trading
or
master swap agreement
database
this database lists all the master swap agreements we have in place or have drafted in the us
london
singapore
japan
south america
etc
it is a very good resource to use when preparing confirmations
this database is available to all enron employees
so feel free to send this link to any london employees you think might find it helpful
there are certain comments concerning the status of masters under negotiation that are only available to legal and credit employees because of legal-client confidentiality concerns
any member of your legal team should be able to look at those comments to determine if there is active/close negotiation on a master
or if a master is being amended
what the amendments might address
sometimes helpful when houston isn't at work yet
frequently there may be more than one master in place for an enron company
so look at each entry to determine whether the master is limited to a specific finance project or product
unusual
but sometimes
also
as i mentioned
not all the us based masters are isda multi-currency masters
so look to confirm what type of master we entered into
if they are not isda multi-currency masters
it may not be possible to put a cross-border trade under the master without some modification to the master or confirmation
please note
there is a listing for
restrictions
which will reflect any trading limitations such as
crude oil trades only
no trades over 0 years
contain special confirmation issues or list other types of trading limitations
restrictions should always be looked at because they contain critical trading guidance
another note to watch out for is that many us based master may have texas law instead of ny
certainly not uk law
we hope to have that information available in the database in the future
if for some reason you can't access this database
let me know and we'll get our respective computer people to figure out why
as i mentioned
i am a paralegal in the houston swap group and am happy to answer any questions about particular masters
so please do not hesitate to call me at x0

nope
not yet
i'm absolutely swamped
i haven't forgotten about it tho
my short agenda is day 0
go over basics of financial documentation w/confirm desk team
your assistants
maybe 0-0 hours depending on level of detail we go into
spend rest of day approving online counterparties
day 0
go over specifics of confirmations with your assistants so they can prepare the special legal/credit annex for a confirm and review how to read a credit worksheet and what the credit issues mean
spend rest of day approving online counterparties
day 0
spend time with you
peter going over what i went over with assistants
confirm people
then maybe spend time letting any of your dealmakers quiz me as they desire about swap issues
spend free time approving online counterparties
don't add a lot of people on
i get really nervous speaking in front of large groups
i am a shy girl
you know
my thoughts are
kim
this link is available to all enron employees
if you think anyone needs it just forward it on
yes
the agreement was dated 0/0/0 and had a two year term
same type of discussions as those other two we sent out for auditors
it sound good to me
shall we meet at your house or mine and at what time
good joke
keep me on list
if i get anthing good in i'll pass it on to you
it was good seeing you both the other week
hugs
kisses
is credit aware of this
i spoke to the woman at sask and she's ok on everything
sounds like a good plan
i'm at 0 banks street
the last street off shepherd before you hit the swest fwy
so
when you leave church
go downshepherd
then make a right on the last street before the fwy
go past the0st stop sign and then i'll be about the 0rd or 0th house on the left
a taupe colored cottage with a pointy roof and vines growing halfway up theside of the house
my home # is 0-0

i haven't seen your new digs
where exactly are they
alicia
for you
anything
our project is a little different
so i think i am ok
thanks
as usual for your help
the referenced counterparty is on the 0/0/0 list
you've got them shut down for power
but credit's notes are specifically opening them for power
should i open or shut down
i feel the power
i just spoke to mike garred and john raineri w/the new power company
per this conv
it appears that ena has master agreements in place to trade financial and physical gas
i directed him to shari stack
a lawyer in the power group
to discuss getting a master agreement in place with epmi to trade physical power
they are aware that credit is working on getting them some headroom
and as soon as they counterparty comes out of credit
we'll get them approved to trade
pending resolution of physical power approval from shari
if credit could verbally let me know when they are approved i'd appreciate it
so i'll know to look for them
i will be traveling to calgary tuesday
so i may be incommunicado while the plane's in flight
so that could possibly hold things up
do you have copies of the alberta and british columbia acts
i know they are less stringent than the us rules
but i don't know the exact levels
that signed eta amendment came in about a week ago
and the copy has already been sent to lisa lees
and the file is closed as far as i'm concerned
below are forms you will need to prepare confirmations which we will discuss later this week
i would password protect them so no one change change them by mistake
mercy
since there are so many new credit people that we
legal
do not know
it would be very helpful if you could provide me with a new list of the credit team and their phone numbers
the last list we have is dated 0/0/0
thanks
thanks mercy
can you please send me only 0 list of clickpaper counterparties per day
it gets very confusing for me sometimes to figure out what lists i should be responding to when i get multiple lists
mark taylor has asked me to prepare an nda for the referenced counterparty
please let me know if we have any existing nda's in place
thanks
at the request of kay
i have started sending my requests re
confidentiality agreements to her via email so she can print out a record for her files

i believe this is yours
mary
all those traps with security were worked out 0 years ago
london can get into the o
drive from there
the only directory they have access to in the o
drive is the atty.fms bank
if we put the swap forms back there
they can get at them
i know
because i've pulled them up myself from london
hey mark
i think these are yours
the above counterparty has been created in the financial trading agreements database and is listed as a master swap agreement
and it's not
it is an electronic trading agreement and needs to be moved down to
other agreements
please let me know when that is done and i will delete the entry in the master swap agreement database
thanks
attached please find the referenced lists
on the list of 0/0/0a
i have not yet seen the list from gobal contracts with the corrected names
but i cannot believe lyke corporation
also called ripon community printers
is a valid legal name
we might want to get that sorted out before we start trading with them
attached is the proposed form of loi
please let me know if it meets with your approval
and i will email it to the customer
i kept the language in the term sheet in the back pretty broad as it references
energy commodities
your language re
us crude and products
wasn't clear to me
perhaps you meant us crude and crude derivative/refined products
will energy commodities work
or do want to limit it to crude products and charge more for other products
it has been my understanding that the first section is supposed to be for master swap agreements only
having other documents listed in that section may be misleading to some parties who may misconstrue their use for general trading purposes
such as global contracts
that is why we created the
other agreements
section
to house these other agreements
my understanding isthat the only reason other agreements has been listed in the master swap agreements section is that they have been done so erroneously
the drop down were not created too artfully created
allowing wrong agreements to be put in master swap agreements
which has been proliferating
if my understanding is not correct
than when did the intentional use of that first section change
i think putting all agreement is a very bad idea
i revised the language in the
description of transaction
section and where the fee is and just wanted to make sure you were ok before i sent it to your customer
i've already drafted my email
i just need your ok
you need to talk to stephanie sever at x0
attached is my proposed form of nda
i set up the choice in products similar to they way we did it in prebon
take a look and let me know if it meets with your approval
mike
i know i'm not supposed to continue imposing on you
but if these entries are showing up in both places this is going to creating large problems for us
as well as giving persons who should not have access to brokerage/other agreements access to that information
our brokers are quite confidential
the only information we want to make available to all enron employees is the master swap agreements
can you please
please take a look at this for me
it is very critical that this drop down works correctly
greg and i tried to call you but you weren't there
we'll call you tomorrow
sorry about not getting back to you sooner
i am in calgary this week
stephanie and i met with mark taylor about this on monday
and he said to go ahead and confirm this under the houston master with hess energy trading company llc
that was pretty good
he can call any one of the attorneys in the swap group
mary cook does canada
but she'll be out next week so it would have to be quick

if you're still there give me a call in calgary about this
i'm at
at the request of liz sager
i am attaching our language with respect our transfer
do you want a bilateral or one-way
and what is the nature of your discussions
the above counterparty on the 0/0/0 list is id#0
we had a counterparty on the pre-approval list that was called international paper company and was id#0
was that one in error
are they the same
different
what's the scoop
thanks for your help
sam
i think counterparty id# 0 is bonneville power administration
not bonneville power association
taking a look at bpa from the 0/0/0 list
i noticed that we've got them opened up for west coast power only on the offer and not the bid
i have no notes that they are restricted in that manner
what's the scoop
marcus
do you see any reason they should be restricted to the offer side
oops
i forgot to add your name
even tho i meant to
can you look around for the fax of this nda signed by the counterparty
mark greenberg will need to initial it and then send it down to daniel diamond and he will get an enrononline and enron net works officer to sign it
once it is signed we will need to fax it to the counterparty
i will forward dan's email with the fax and phone number of the counterparty to you
thanks
yeah
see if mark t
will initial it
tell him it's for a broker relationship and there we no changes to the form
thanks for the info
i appreciate it
justin
what's your deadline for getting these approved
mark taylor is out all weekend
and if it can't wait i'll get another lawyer to look at it
just a note in case some of the product abbreviations on the nymex calendar don't make sense
they have what the abbreviations mean at the back of the calendar
i just did a request to get angela davis in the houston office and linda sietzema and sharon crawford in the calgary offices edit access to the financial trading agreement database
i also requested that marcus nettelton get edit access to the ena legal online trading database
i'm not sure if i did the
erequest
all ok
can you check to make sure your got all four
thanks
if you have time to attend
please join us
mike
i attempted to give edmund manager access by doing one of those security requests today
i don't know if you need to do anything or not here
i'll come pick you up
is there an icon i can send to marcus to get into the ena legal online database
can someone call me at x0
i'm in the middle of doing these again and it won't let me submit the form
good memo peter
is it ok if i forward this to the credit team so they also know how this process will work
in order to complete your access request
i need your company number and your 0 digit sap cost center code
are these physical transactions
ok by me
the swap forms have been moved back into the atty.fms bank
so you should be able to access them again
at the request of bob shults
i am attaching the revised beta and fee agreement for your review
bob will call you tomorrow to discuss them
your access to the financial trading agreement has been completed
why don't you take a look and make sure you now have edit capability
you now should have access to the datasbase
give it a try and see if it works
link

i don't know what this is about
is this for the home computers we are supposed to get
if it is i actually haven't done anything about it
that i am aware of
if it is for the home computer thing
i probably will want to upgrade
let me know
do we have an outside counsel memorandum
or will we have an internal one soon
that we can send to martin
as well as the other non-us swap lawyers
your access to the financial trading agreement database is approved
the icon is attached below
why don't you take a look and see if you've got edit capability to the database

we have received executed copies of the broker electronic transaction agreement dated 0/0/0 and the fee agreement dated 0/0/0 with respect to the referenced counterparty
copies will be sent to lisa lees
i just received a phone call from paul varana
outside counsel to the referenced counterparty
his phone number is 0/0-0
he said that vepco wasn't happy with the form of gtc attached to the physical online power confirms and was going to be sending me a letter requesting certain revisions
he said the letter would come from francine matthews at vepco
i looked this counterparty up in my database
and it appears that we approved them to trade physical power with an override letter
usually
we don't allow any changes to the online gtc
but with physical power
the override letters
i know there is some wiggle room
i don't know how you want to handle this
if you want to wait for the letter from vepco to come in and then deal with the issues
or head him off at the pass
just let me know
i am going to run w/holly at 0:0 on saturday and then meet her for breakfast at 0 at the ihop
lucinda is going to join us for breakfast
i thought maybe if it met w/your running schedule you might want to join us
holly
i are going running saturday at 0
then meeting lucinda for breakfast at the ihop at 0
do you want to join us
done
i got your company number on my own
so now we just have to wait to have the erequest approved
i hope it will be today
mark taylor
the lawyer who would review all new product descriptions for financial products is on vacation and will not be back until tuesday
i hope this can wait until then
i live to swap
i hope carol will come
holly was going to call her
i wanted to let you know that the form of enron corp
guaranty has been agreed to with bnp paribas and has been sent up to enron corp
for signature today
i will send you a copy of the guaranty once it is fully executed
i hope we can do more than meet
if possible
let me buy you dinner
at the request of kay young
i am faxing you the four confirmations for the referenced deal
please look for them
i've gotten some calls from the business people who want to trade with two counterparties right away
one is michigan consolidated gas company
which is on the list for the 0th
and the other is mobil oil corporation supply
distribution which is on the list of the 0th
can you please make sure the individuals in global contracts responsible for these counterparties update them today
our business people would be most appreciative
thanks for the assist
as an introduction
the referenced counterparty is trying to straighten out the online products it wants to trade with us
it's open for some
but not all of the products it wants to trade
when i looked at profile manager to see what they had already been approved to trade
i noticed that this counterparty was opened to trade many of the european products
including specifically european physical power products
which is unusual for a us based counterparty to trade
before i go in and change the profile for this counterparty
i wanted to check with you and see if london had specifically opened them to trade the products they were opened to trade
especially physical power
what i usually do when i am approving us based counterparties
is that with respect to non us
canadian products
as long as they are an eligible swap participant i open them up for all products except european physical power
which i never open them for
also
credit derivatives
i never open anyone up for unless we really mean it
so
my question to you is did london actively approve the non us
canadian based products
especially physical power
if you didn't
then i am going to take this as an oversight of the pre-approval process and shut them down for european physical power
it's only a reflection of our high regard for you that we pass on this matter for your adept handling
you're a machine
sam
stephanie
re
cargill ferrous international it was my understanding with the eol team that all divisions would have the legal incorporated entity as part of the name
stephanie
i my preference is to kick their password application back and get them to change it to read something like
cargill ferrous international
a division of cargill
inc
or
cargill
inc
acting through its cargill ferrous international division
re
glencore commodities limited
cpy 0
the counterparty is my work queue is glencore ltd
cpy0
not the above
is this a mistake
do you know the progress of getting a physical power master in place with this counterparty
can you keep me apprised
they are obviously a quasi-affiliate and we have internal people contacting me checking on their progress
thanks
why do you say ok for weather
what restrictions do you have for counterparties trading weather
attached is my list that i use as a reference
please let me know if you disagree with any of the european advice
you
as counsel
can agree to any form of nda you think is acceptable
i will print it out and bring it around for signature
your manager access appears to be completed
sharon
per the email below
i looked in the financial trading agreement database and saw that stephanie panus
a paralegal in our group prepared an annex b for this counterparty in january of this year
i would just confirm that the credit is the same and then use the same annex b as before
i am going to fax the credit worksheet that credit send stephanie in january so you can check the credit
below is the annex b stephanie prepared
sharon
there are some hanky things going on in these confirms i don't like
i've just spoken to russell and i'm going to talk to a swap attorney and then get back to you
i spoke to stephanie and anytime between 0-0 am or after 0:0 pm would be fine for us
just let us know
i don't know if mark greenberg ran this one by you or not
we are already preparing it for signature
but can you check on this counterparty for ndas
much thanks
i don't know what you're talking about
so i must not be the right person
we are trying to track down the signed documents for this counterparty
our notes reflect that samantha boyd sent them up to peter for execution on 0/0/0 with instructions to send them back to samantha boyd when executed
my understanding is that they were signed in canada and returned to samantha
but they have not yet shown up here
if you sent them fedex and can track them via a tracking number can you see if you can find them
they appear to have done some unauthorized trades w/o having the master signed and this has now become a really high priority
thanks
things are looking better
we tracked down the documents and it appears that samantha sent them to counterparty's outside counsel on 0/0/0
i just spoke to maureen donley-hoopes at outside counsel and asked her to fax me the signature pages of the isda and counterparty's guaranty to me asap
once we get those russell will be a happy man and we can send a confirm out under the isda
i'll let you know as soon as we get the fax in
brant
please do not put me on emails for day to day business
drafts of masters and confirms
thanks

tfs was sent out but has not came back in signed
i was out yesterday
so spectron has not gone out
i have that on my list to do today
what do you think about russell's request for a confirm here
i think this is really confusing for our canadian team
there must be requirements for the lc if it's an upfront lc
we would need a zero threshold
i just don't think this is very straight forward for these poor candadian girls to figure out
what do you think

my primary job responsibility is to online trading
and right now enrononline is quite a beast of a customer
because of that i please ask that you direct any future questions you may have with respect to confirmations to our two paralegals who handle the day to day trading

with respect to the two current canadian confirmations

0 and 0
copies will be distributed
i am ok with what credit say
which is if the counterparties are already approved for trading those pulp
lumber products theyan trade the new products
except for the following counterparties which we need to be careful about becuase they could only tansact newsprint
the bakersfield californian
can transact only newsprint e.w
scripps company
the
can only transact 0.0 gram newsprint swaps
ok for me
i can't tell by lotus notes
is anyone aware of a
credit sleeve
with tmg
i take it all the other counterparties on this list cannot transact power since they are restricted by credit
we haven't heard anything on this nda
have you
are these additional counterparties
i only look at lists i receive from credit
let me know if i am missing any lists
i'm not showing i looked at this list at all
isn't that right
any updates on adding the correct legal name to this counterparty name
reggie just brought around a whole stack of confirms of pulp
paper deals that came into the fax area
is anyone looking for this stack of confirms
if not
i'll have reggie walk them down to joe hunter
i tracked down the culprit who worked on this master and it was mark taylor
i know he called jon mckay and had a conversation with him about it and is looking at the master for particular issues in response to his conversation with jon
another division mark
global counterparty wants me to approve this eol counterparty which is a division
my deal with the eol team was that they would kick these counterparties back and try to get the legal incorporated entity as part of the name
global counterparty is satisfied opening counterparties up as divisions and i am getting frustrated constantly fighting this battle
do you wish to intercede
or shall i give up and let counterparties be opened as divisions
do you want to call a meeting with sam's boss to discuss divisions
what to do
per conv
a minute ago with marcus
christi nicolay in the regulatory group just checked and ontario power generation does not have a ferc marketing license
that leaves them to buying us power only

please make this change immediately
thanks
i want a parking space in the new garage
please let me know what i need to do to get it

i guess we could

do you want me to change it

stephanie
since you've already changed it will it be already changed tomorrow so we don't need to do anything
i'm so confused
i'm working on samantha's imc canada
it was signed by faxed signatures yesterday and i am expecting the originally signed documents to come in by federal express today
will
i usually send these directly to the customer unless you prefer otherwise
so i will also need an email address or telephone and fax number
i also need to know whether you want a bilateral form of non-disclosure agreement or a one way form that protects enron only
in circumstances where we are certain enron will be the only party providing confidential information we prefer to use that form
also
i need to know the nature of the confidential information you are discussing so we can protect the information being discussed

i think it may be possible that we have existing ndas in place with the referenced counterparty
the nature of our discussions that i am currently preparing an nda for is the possible access to and use of a web-based transactions-support system for online and offline commodity trade
including derivative products
you're wearing me down
you're relentless
how about this one

i seem to be keeping you busy today
it makes me feel so wanted
not
i have complete faith in you
by the way
the guy from star already called with corrections to their company name
it's starsupply petroleum inc
he said he passed the agreement on to his legal and he would be getting us comments back on monday
be careful using imc canada to prepare your draft from
even though we have chosen ny law
we had two canadian companies entering into the imc canada agreement so there is language in the agreement that is canadian specific
and it might be missing some required us language
i have also attached a redlined draft reflecting the negotiated changes to the form since the form we first sent the form to the counterparty
i have attached our current form of isda schedule as a reference
the canadian changes will be color coded
so you can see them easily

there have been recent amendments to the cftc rules that have required certain changes to the swap reps
in particular there are no longer
eligible swap participants
the current terminology is

of the schedule in particular
i'm not showing i got your response for this day
those are negotiated changes
the only was to tell what is a

thing is by looking at the form
it is color coded with different colors for different countries or other special legal issues
i believe canada is a purplely pink color in the form

because before edmund got sick
we were pretty much in agreement on how he was supposed to respond about americas countries and how i should respond about european countries
strictly informational
i need to know everytime we have a governmental entity
so since there was no note in the side that this was connected a governmental i had to research that
i was sharing the information i gathered with you so as to save you some time in case you didn't already know this
obviously
you did
re

each request for an nda for enronoffline should be clearly indicated as a project offline nda
since i prepare many other ndas for enron net works
at the request of the dealmaker

please note that copies of all network agreements should also be filed with lisa lees
the original should always be filed with her

the referenced counterparty is on the list below for online approval to trade us gas financial products
this counterparty came through before on the 0/0/0 list and we did not approve them for financial trading because of a
payment dispute
is anyone out there aware of the payment dispute with this counterparty
and has it been resolved
can we open this counterparty up to trade financial
they are an esp
as as follow-up to my earlier email
it is now ok to immediately open the referenced counterparty back up to transact both sides of usphysical power as we have received the necessary documentation evidencing their authority to trade power
bill
i think you are about to become my new best friend
we have another long standing counterparty we cannot get approved on enrononline because we cannot get the counterparty set up in gcp
the counterparty sent in a password application styled
koch industries
inc
acting through its koch hydrocarbon company division
which also happens to be the same styling on the master swap agreement we have in place with this counterparty
they way i understand it
gcp has the two following counterparties already set up
0
koch industries
inc
and
0
koch hydrocarbon company division
the enrononline team has been trained to never set up a company as a division
to always send the password application back to the counterparty and try to get the counerparty to resubmit the application with the legal incorporated name as part of the counterparty name
which they sucessfully did in this instance
but now we cannot get the counterparty set up in gcp
can you help us
can you help me with this
any conflicts
what is the nature of your discussions
do you have an address for them
that tom is a smart man
i'm just going to have to mirror him
should this basket of weather swaps be treated special in any way

attached is the resume of my dear friend
carolyn varela
carolyn started working at liddell
sapp
zivley
hill
laboon a few months before i did in 0
while i left after 0 years for the greener pastures of enron
before coming to liddell
sapp
carolyn was a corporate paralegal at texas commerce bank
one of the principal clients of liddell
sapp
and was a key contact for handling the tcb relationship over the years along with the primary lawyer she worked for
mr
laboon
who maintained the tcb relationship for the law firm
carolyn is a kind
cheerful person
a hard worker and a pleasure to be around
i was in the municipal bond group and she was in the corporate group
but we frequently backed each other up
as well as the real estate and lending teams
on closings
proofreading documents
large filings
etc
i think she would be a great asset to your team and enron
at the request of mark greenberg
i am forwarding to you the proposed non-disclosure agreement between pricewaterhouse
for creditdimensions
and enron credit limited
mark greenberg has spoken to the counterparty and made a few changes to pricewaterhouse's form
if you have any questions about the transaction
the business person on the deal is kim detiveaux here in houston
otherwise
we would appreciate your assistance in getting richard sage in london to execute this agreement
for compaq
you say approved for financial trading
but then you've got an
x
in the box
i think you need to open them up
ditto credit
please talk to mark greenberg

at

0-0
i am a paralegal
sorry about that
with respect to the amendment to the list for 0/0/0
the approval i sent down earlier should still be good since i'm the one that figure out she said approve for financial and then had them shut down for financial
we've got an australian counterparty on the list for the 0th
legal is ok to open the above counterparty immediately for us east physical and financial power products
please let me know if you have any comments to the attached list
you've got to get this straight with global counterparty or you're going to have a bust on your trades
i have revised the list to add a few more ndas that have come to my attention
and then am also sending the regular net works nda list as well
i hope these are helpful
you are the best
we're on
0:0 pm
would you like to set up this meeting or would you like me to
i would like to get this koch thing resolved asap
so i think the sooner
the better
from legal's side
both mary cook and i need to be included
i spoke to credit and both walter guidroz and tom moran would like to be included
probably joe hunter from the confirm desk as well
and anyone else you're aware of
let me know how you think we should proceed
with respect to this new counterparty for enrononline
correct name to follow
sam schott advises us that we are limited to 0 characters for a counterparty name in gcp
the correct legal name for this counterparty is longer than 0 characters
i discussed this with marcus nettelton
our power lawyer
and if the following scenario meets with the approval of the financial and physical power confirmation desks we think the best way to treat this matter is to set the counterparty up in gcp as follows and then add this counterparty to the special handling list so all confirmations
physical and financial
offline and online
go out with the legal name
not with the gcp name
legal name of counterparty
alliant energy corporate services
inc
as authorized agent for and on behalf of ies utilities inc
interstate power company
and wisconsin power and light company suggested name for gcp
alliant energy corporate services
inc
as agent for three listed utilities joe and kim
is this workable for the confirm desks
if you can let me and sam know then sam can get them set us
thanks for your help
i'm just going to have to call you quick draw mcgraw

i just had a superseded and replaced enron corp
guaranty that the counterparty returned to me

attached is a list of four deals for some online
oops
trades
can you send me the deal particulars so i can prepare terminations of the trades
rob cass sent me the deal nos
and i have made a request to the confirm desk to get the trade terms
thanks for your help
i really don't know
maybe the icon
which is just a shortcut to the database
won't work because of outlook
i haven't had this problem with any other people on outlook before
you might want to talk to your computer person
he can probably find the database the long way
it is just a misc
lotus notes application
whatever happened to the nda we sent over to london for signature for enron
you are bad to the bones
yes
i never got the signed nda faxed to me
yes
i never heard back whether you were ok with the
for 0 listed utilities
being dropped off the
as agent
thing
should we reject this from this onset or do you think it is ok
marcus is ok with the name change without the
for 0 listed utilities
so let it fly
thank you kay
i really appreciate all your help
as an fyi
from time to time i will be preparing ndas for the networks team headed by mark s
palmer working with travis on
project offline
project offline has evolved a form of nda and added a non-solicitation clause and a residuals clause
i wanted you to be familiar with the form in case travis is not here
you,as are my backup lawyer for the networks team
the form
like all my networks forms is kept in my
confidentiality agreements
subdirectory under
forms
in case you ever need it and i'm not around
do we have any ndas in place with the referenced counterparty
attached for your review is a list of the ndas we either have executed or have sent drafts to the customer
please take time to review this list to make sure that the status of any nda you are interested in is correctly reflected
call me at x0 with any comments or questions
do you have the address for the counterparty
attached is the nda you requested
sounds like an indian chief
of course
the name on this loi i just got is finn swarting
which isn't much better
quick draw
can i send my old parking card back thru interoffice mail
i'll be there
i didn't sign up for the organized activities
i'll just be hanging out
the swap group is having dinner wednesday night
if you haven't already made plans do you want to join us
we're about 0 in number right now
it's a date
we've picked up two more diners for la fogata in san antonio
andrea calo and yao apasu
can you call back the restaurant and switch our reservation to two tables of 0 people
instead of one table of 0
i think a table of 0 will be more manageable than a table of 0
thanks
as we discussed
attached is my
cheat sheet
which i use to guide me when approving non-us counterparties that come in through enrononline via houston credit
london legal and i try to coordinate our responses but i cannot speak for them and the standards they may apply to approving counterparties to trade online
they also frequently deal with different countries than us
you may want to speak to justin boyd
generally
with respect to most physical trading
except power trading
there are no legal restrictions to trading
most of the restrictions in this list are with respect to financial products
physical bandwidth has generally not done much legal due diligence outside of the us and the uk and bandwidth is therefore not open to non us and uk counterparties
with physical power
generally
in most countries they require some sort of power marketing license so i look to the power lawyers to guide me
as i also mentioned
for japan or australian based counterparties i wait for david minns or jane mcbride to advise me
yes
mark greenberg will pick this up
link
> the link is above
i have to do your request for edit capability
you will not be able to see comments or make credit comments until your request is completed
i will let you know when that is done
she seemed to have more initiative than the average temp
was nice
i would be fine with having her work for me again
re
element re i just checked with brent hendry
the attorney on this one
and it should read
as agent for xl trading partners ltd
not
of
the swap group has already made plans for a dinner on wednesday or i would love to join you
thanks for inviting me
thanks
you're the best
per my discussion with mark taylor and our conversation today
attached is the form of termination agreement that should be used when terminating enrononline mistake or
oops
trades
the trades should continue to be initially run past the legal department to determine whether there are any unusual circumstances surrounding the trades
but absent unusual circumstances
legal will then pass the trades on to the confirmation desk for preparation of the termination letter and further handling
these same procedure should apply to physical as well as financial transactions
since this is a contract
the agreement will require the initials of a lawyer and signature of a vp or above for the relevant company
the termination letter should be brought to the appropriate legal group for signature
the current policy with respect to mistake trades is that the trade should be terminated
reverse trades should not be entered into
if you have any questions
please call
any problems with this counterparty
any problems with this counterparty
danm that doesn't sound like a full legal name
thanks for your help
below are the four
oops
trades the prompted my changing of the procedure
i left a voicemail for the trader to provide me with the phone number and name of the person who he spoke to but he never returned my calls
i guess
if someone from joe's group could please prepare the two termination letters and get them signed
thanks

her direct dial number is

just a note to always remember to check
erms
we are frequently amending or updating and replacing old erms masters with isdas and erms should always be added as a company when you prepare the legal credit list
thanks
it won't let me open the document
can you ressend it
ok to copy
we will need to catch a cab to get to la fogata which is located at 0 vance jackson road in san antonio
our dinner reservations are for 0:0 pm
so i suggest we all meet in the hotel lobby at 0:0 and catch group cabs together
dress is casual
the phone number for the restaurant is 0-0-0
in case you get lost in a wild cab ride or something similar
this will have special meaning to certain swap group members
if you haven't rsvp'd back to me
please do so

see you in san antonio

mary cook also asked me to forward the below email re
nymex collateral toyou
i would love to pick up you and henry
any conflicts
sheri
i need to know the nature of the discussions we will be having with this company so i know how to word the decription in the agreement
also
usually i email the agreements directly to the counterparty
so unless he will be delivering this in another manner
i will need an email address
we do not have a master swap agreement in place with cms field services
inc
so there is no need to send us a copy of the notice
marilyn
do we have some documentation from the city that shows the city of long beach with a
inc
at the end of their name
i have never seen a city with an inc
at the end of their name before
that is a corporate thing
not a municipal thing
ok for me
pursuant to the documentation the counterparty provided when they entered into the power eei
and at the direction of marcus nettelton
a lawyer in the power group
the counterparty name for the port of oakland should set up in gcp as follows
the city of oakland
a municipal corporation acting by and through its board of port commissioners gcp
if you could please redo the counterparty name
and stephanie
if you could please resubmit the pa to match the counterparty name
then we can get this one done
thanks for the info
i'll direct it to her the next time
we have another problem with that 0 character thing
at the request of travis mccullough
i am attaching a copy of the non-disclosure agreement
revised to delete the non-solicitation clause
joe
i need the deal specifics so i can prepare an exhibit
per my voicemail
attached is the assignment of the fpl trade
if you could please attach as exhibit a
the specifics of the trade and then fax the assignment to the counterparty
when the counterparty faxes the signed assignment back we will have to have it initialled by a lawyer since it is a contract
and send it up to me and i will get someone to sign it

the only people that can have full view and edit capability are legal and credit
for legal/client confidentiality purposes
attached is the icon
which is just a shortcut link to the database and you can send that link to any enron employee and they will have view access to all the information in the database except the legal and credit comments
i will make a request to add the legal and credit people to get edit capability
i think denis o'connell already had edit access
send him the link and let me know if he has edit access
you can just copy this link and add it to emails to people
however
i'm a little afraid it might not work from london
because it is just a shortcut
if it doesn't
you might need your computer people to create a shortcut link for y'all

rod nelson from credit already has edit access from his days in london
you can send all those other people the link

and they should be able to get in
if they are in credit we will want them to have edit access because they can read the comments so they can see more detail about the negotiation
and hopefully
input their comments about their negotiation to keep legal apprised
we can always hope
no time out for tana

jane
we have a japanese counterparty on this list that wants to trade physical
financial pulp
paper
any problems
l:ovely choice
thanks for the info
the confidentiality provisions contained in this agreement do not allow us to provide the agreement to affiliates
i will need some direction from the counterparty either via email or phone before i can send you a copy of the agreement
sorry
i had a rush approval on this list
so while you were out having a baby
well
actually louise was doing all the hard work
i called leslie at home at elizabeth's direction because i had to get sierra pacific holding company approved
we are currently purchasing power from them and ed sacks said we just gotten an eei in place with them so leslie approved them for both the bid and offer on west power
even tho credit is going to open them up for purchases only
no one has approved any other lists while you were out
so i have been patiently been waiting your return
sniff
sniff
can you please put this counterparty in profile manager for me
we had a really old erms master that restricted the types of financial products they could trade under it
and i want to take a look and see what we've got them approved for
they should be able to trade any financial products now
thanks
on the isda replacement front
just a reminder that we want to put morgan stanley capital group at the forefront
we have an old energy price swap agreement in place with them
and then there's always our favorite
the old aig
master master
now with sempra
that raises a whole host of other issues
you were going to talk to bill about that one
do you want me to put them on the list for the legal/credit meeting as a reminder
as of this week enrononline has just started offering us/canadian dollar swaps online
as part of my review in determining whether a counterparty can transact these products online i look at the financial trading agreement database to see if there are any restrictions indicated
check the master swap agreement
and i am also looking at any board resolutions we might have received when we got the master agreement executed
what i am finding is that in the old days when we asked for resolutions evidencing the authority to enter into the master agreement/derivative transactions frequently the resolutions do not allow the counterparies to enter into currency transactions
since transacting these currency transactions with our energy customers is a new area of business for us i just wanted us all to be mindful to check these old resolutions and not to rely solely on the
restrictions
contained in lotus notes
you are absolutely the best
i think we should stick with the standard so people can cook it at home if they like it
i will not be able get your legal group access until i get their sap cost center and company numbers
their profiles in the system are not complete
any conflicts
jake
if you would like me to email this to your customer i will need their email address
below is the isda in electronic format as you requested
this draft is several years old and if you are putting a new one in place i would suggest you start from the newest version of the form and just use this to use as a blackline version
is the counterparty known by the above id lyke corporation or ripon community printers
i'm confused
attached is the nda for cargill you requested
at the direction of mark greenberg
i have added a non-solicitation clause
how has the gcp been set up
i forwarded a guy down to credit on 0/0/0 from the referenced counterparty who wanted to get an isda in place with us
i told him he would have to speak to our credit dept
first
and from the tone of his voicemail it doesn't sound like he's heard from anyone
can you make sure that someone calls him so he doesn't call me again
his name is greg bass and his no
is 0/0-0
thanks
is this an individual
is there an inc
or co
or something like that in the name
thanks for following up on that
i got the counterparty to refax the document to us and lorraine just got andy to re-execute it
on this request
i meant

can you track that down for me
thanks
what did you revise
anna's information is not completed and i bet her cost center is different from yours
company the same
i've got everyone's access submitted except martin rosell and anna reich and oliver harrison whose company codes and cost centers i will need
justin
mark illiott
robert quick and paul simons already had edit access into the database and does your assistant nicola beales who should be checking that when she approves counterparties for enrononline
although i don't think the uk agreement are currently up-to-date
although they need to be for enrononline
it will save her a lot of time
i'm a little worried about your credit people making changes
when you approve credit people
warn them that they are should not make any changes except to credit comments
edmund will need to go in and add your legal and credit people to the database keywords as only he should have access to add keywords
you might want to get him started on that because you have a lot of people to add
it's taken me quite a bit of time get all these approvals done
on or about 0/0/0we opened the above counterparty to transact canadian/us currency swaps on enrononline
which they cannot transact under the old master energy price swap agreement
they would have to transact udner the gtc
after discussing this counterparty w/sara shackleton
an attorney in the swap group
it appears that sara has been talking to morgan stanley and morgan stanley does all its interest rate
currency business out of morgan stanley capital services
inc
we can keep morgan stanley capital group open for currency swaps
but if they don't trade currency swaps out of that company we'll know why
sara is already working on an isda master for capital services for gary hickerson's group
your request for our isda password has been forwarded on to me
below is the password
would it be possible to ask some key people from our credit dept
to attend this semiar
perfect
i heard about this kitty on the news but the didn't have any pictures
thanks for forwarding it on
i have given the form to an attorney to review
as soon as he returns to his office i'll try and get a timetable for when we can expect an answer on whether their form is acceptable or not
mark
when you send out documents can you put the counterparty's name in the subject line so when i'm looking for the documents i can find them easier
much thanks
i will attend
new nda for the online team
this time relating to ecommerce and business to business strategies
any conflicts
mark
your header is wrong on the 0th page
the other pages say
david berberian
and the 0th page has some other guys name
so i don't forget when you get back
i just spoke to john allario
and we either need to amend or draft a new nda for general motors to deal with some new business approaches net works is making with them
we'll need to possible add in 0 other enron companies
so when you get back give me a call and i'll bring my notes around and we can discuss this
it depends on the sophistication of the counterparty
i think tembec is fairly sophisticated based on the resolutions from them i have already seen
for a counterparty that isn't
we have sample board resolutions we can send them
or we even prepare them for some counterparties because sometimes they can't even figure out how to fill in the blanks
andrea
i had mark greenberg
an attorney that works on eol matters
review green mountain's form of ca and he much prefers ours
what he suggested is that you send the counteparty back our form and say something to the effect that enrononline has a standard form of confidentiality agreement we prefer to execute our form
if the form meets with their approval we're golden
if they don't like it have them call me
and i'll just refer them to mark
attached is our preferred form
an nda for eol
this time it would protect the counterparty so we can receive copies of their financial statements
i wanted to forward you directions to my house for dinner this saturday
alicia left me a voicemail and also suggested you bring your friend kimberly
please feel free to do so
the more
the merrier
i hope you will be able to make it
everyone has responded yes
except john hagood
they should be approved today
they were on last night's list
good letter
we'll have to wait til mark greenberg gets in tomorrow
as long as we're all talking about vacations
i'm going to get mine on the board early
i would like to take the week of july 0-july 0 off
breakfast at 0:0 sounds great
wherever you want to go
also
i need to get my bike back from you
i might be doing some biking
i've been thinking about you
hope all is going well
please call carol
how about the buffalo grille
or is that too busy
do i need to do anything
per the attached memo from mary cook
an attorney in the swap group
and our meeting with members of global counterparty where we discussed problems with utilities of cities not being clearly identified
may i suggest the we rename gpp 0
norwich public utilities
something like
the city of norwich
connecticut
which state
by and through its public utilities department
the city utilities are at the bottom of the list
stephanie
we will also need them to resubmit their pa

another request for the enrononline team
any conflicts
attached is
annex b.doc
which we use to prepare annex b which contains the credit provisions we attach to a confirmation when such is requested for omnibus financial confirmations
about mid-way through the us annex b is about 0 selections of collateral annexes depending on whether the credit is one-way or two-way and whether the collateral requested is letters of credit only or letters of credit and cash
following that is form of letter of credit
we have an annex b form for us counterparties and canadian counterparties
i have attached both
the law in canada currently does not favor taking cash in canada and we do not take cash
this obviously is quite problematic for us
our current advice from canadian counsel is that cash must be perfected in a way similar to filing a ucc
the canadian and us lawyers are re-reviewing this situation and i will let you know when/if this advice changes
no problema
will attend
either day ok with me
yes
i fedexed it out for signature on friday
i cannot approve any more old counterparties until frank gets me that list show show what the counterparties said they wanted to trade when they sent in their password application
is there supposed to be something attached
federal expressed
can you handle this
i have no ideal what they're talking about
if you are looking for a copy of an isda master agreement with exxon
there is none
if you are looking for a physical power master you need to contact rhonda denton
i have access to financial trading agreements only
shouldn't these forms be placed in the atty.fms bank so all members of the swap team can get access to them
engage energy canada is an alberta corporation
i was a little concerned when i got this email and i discussed it with marktaylor and i just want to confirm with you
that you are responsible for anchanges to resolutions for uk online corporations and we are responsible fous online corporations
no changes should be made to the enrononline
llc or enron net works board resolutions without going through me or mark
i checked the enrononline minute books in the vault and unless i am plainmissing it i have not prepared and see no resolutions appointing lara mckinney or arfan as agents and attorneys-in-fact to execute password applications
which is the only authority we would give them
not generalsigning authority for any other documents
i need to confirm whether youhave prepared any resolutions granting lara
arfan signing authority and iyou have i need to get copies faxed to me
of course
i only care about enron online
the other two companies fall under your jurisdiction
my pleasure
cheryl
do you have their titles
only a vp or above can sign documents
i need to approve
i'll approve today
re
pacific forest resources unless this is another company or they have changed their name subsequent to the execution of the isda master in 0
we have an isda master in place with this counterparty and have a copy of their articles of incorporation in the file
and there is no

at the end of this company's name
if you would like me to send you a company of the company's articles of incorporation i will be happy to do so
sure
just use me as as reference for getting a job
let me know when you come into town
it's on its way
can i expect any kind of payback from my contractor for giving him such a high rating

i went to fill in all that stuff
but they want to much personal information
like my address and phone number which i don't like to give out
and they won't accept the referral without it
no
i have not received the fully executed document yet from steve
sara
there is no paralegal yet working this deal

responds to this counterparty
joe
can you take a look at their eol trades and see if there is any particular reason why their trades might be taking more than 0 hours to get a confirmation out
thanks
justin
per the email below
before we respond to glencore we just wanted to make sure that you haven't made any agreements with glencore with respect to choice of law for the online trades that would subject them to uk law
i don't want to talk to them without checking with you first since this is one of the true counterparties that we are trading with on both sides of the atlantic
by the way
i heard you had some really good news
i'm so happy for you
thanks for the email
looks like we're not bad in getting their confirms out
after i hear from justin i'll give them a call
hopefully tomorrow
this counterparty is a public corporation and a political subdivision of the state of nebraska
a governmental entity
sorry it took so long
i had to search the web and i just now had time
just something i noted as i got in to approve edison mission
west power was also in the queue for approval
we had previously had them approved for all power
and credit had shut them down for power because credit has been worried about their financial condition ala pg&e
but now is willing to open them up for all power
i thought it was ok to open them up for all power since we had them open for all power before
but i just wanted to run it by you just in case
thanks justy
maybe you can just fax me a copy of your pa or eta
so i can have a copy of the document when i speak to them
my fax no
is 0/0-0
thanks
no isda for mitsui corp
below is the link which should enable you view access to the financial trading agreement database
you can forward this email with the link to any member of your team and they will then have the link which will get them access to the database

nothing for me
you are the best
no problem
i told paul radous
the credit guy that you had already said that these guys could not trade physical power because they do not have a power marketing license
it perhaps might be possible for them to purchase us power only
if they want to enter into power transactions he is going to need to get you a name and phone number of someone at engage that you can talk to to get evidence of their power marketing license
sorry
it was on the slow boat
in interroffice mail back from steve
i just got it
i'll fax a copy back to the company today and follow with an original by fedex this everning
do we have an nda for the chase manhattan bank
i kinda bet we do
but i kinda but we don't with respect to enrononline business
as you requested
attached please find a copy of the referenced nda
per our conversation
it appears that the two companies are going to merge in october
looking at lotus notes
i don't think we could pick two bigger dogs of masters to have in place
i don't think we want either master to be the survivor master
with chase we have an old 0 interest rate and currency exchange agreement and with morgan we have a master energy price swap agreement
yuk
yuk
if i had my druthers i say
let's start over
i know it's far reaching
but maybe we could make it our goal to have this master replaced by october
do you think that's do-able
do we have a contact at chase/morgan we can start dealing with
i'm going to add chase to the legal/credit list just as a tickler for us to get this thing rolling
why did we change the name for the board of municipal utilities of sikeston
mo
that is the way the counterparty's financial statement reads as well as how the name is set up on their website
i also spoke to their lawyer and he said that is how they transact
steve
i am mark's paralegal

i am going to need his address since the front of the isda is a pre-printed form and i can't email it
debbie brackett and i met this week and reviewed the various koch hydrocarbon company divisions and have developed the following game plan to resolve the division issue with respect to this counterparty
the following entities exist in gcp
0
koch hydrocarbon co
gcp #0
we would like this entity to remain open and to be renamed
koch industries
inc
acting through its koch hydrocarbon company division
0
koch hydrocarbon company
gcp #0
we would like all future trading with this entity suspended
there appears to be one trade under this entity and this trade should me moved to gcp 0
0
koch hydrocarbons inc
gcp #0
we would like all future trading with this entity suspended
there appear to be no trades under this entity
with respect to the current financial trading being done by koch industries
inc
gcp #0
not under a master agreement
i spoke to the legal department at koch and we will be entering into a side letter agreement with koch that will put all financial trades done by koch industries
inc
under the existing isda master agreement we have with koch industries
inc
acting through its koch hydrocarbon company division
i will let you all know when such side letter agreement has been executed
as soon as gcp #0 has been renamed we can re-submit them to enrononline and open them up for trading
i have submitted the security requests to get the three of you access to the
other agreements
subdirectory of the financial agreement database
that approval usually takes about a day
as soon as it comes through i'll let you know

still need to solve how to get into the directory with mike neves

gosh
the suspense nearly killed me
company policy
and corporate organizational documents
dictates that allcontracts may only be executed by an officer at the vice president level orabove
i checked the corporate secretary's records and they indicate thatneither beth perlman nor richard burchfield meet such requirements for enronet works
mark greenberg directed me to get the agreement executed by phillippe bibi
other officers we frequently get networks agreements executed by are david berberian
managing director
greg piper
managing director and chief operating officer
rex shelby

i think the easies way to get me the approval is for your contact to go talk to the contact at merita we negotiated the isda with and have them send me an email or fax telling me it is ok to release the isda to you
the woman at merita we negotiated with was paivi saarnilahti and her phone number is 0 0 0 0
just a note
i have not gotten that isda master out yet because there are some things in the credit worksheet that don't jive with the credit terms in the current master as well as credit terms generally consistent on this side of the atlantic
i have asked jay williams in our credit dept
here to get with the credit person there in london who worked up the credit worksheet to clear up the credit terms
i have drafted the isda with everything except making the credit choices so it sits there waiting for credit
just wanted to keep you updated
ok for me
tom

do you want us to send it directly to deloitte

i got a call today from sterling cook at trans alta in calgary telling me that they merged with mega
i'm passing this on to you for handling
sterling's ph
is 0/0-0
i also asked him to give us the phone number of their credit person so our credit person could talk to their credit person
he mentioned sending us an amendment changing guaranties and thresholds
and i told him we would have to get that approved by credit
here is the guaranty from trans alta
thanks for the email
i just got out of an all morning meeting
i had already drafted the agreement for apb europe
i'll redraft it as directed
it sounds like we may not need to follow up with this counterparty
any dealmaker interested in business with them
if not
i think we should just inactivate them
ok for me
i spoke to mark taylor and we would like dave removed from this corporation as well
we can date this revocation effective as of 0/0/0 as well
we really appreciate your help with these resolutions
i am circulating the epmi resolution and will forward it to you as soon as it is fully executed
jay
i had a conversation with belco prior to the receipt of the documents stephanie forwarded on down to you
i think before we make any response in the nature of what you are discussing below i think we might want to have a meeting or get fred involved because that is not what belco has in mind at all
although i understand from enron credit's point of view belco is not longer in the drivers seat with respect to the belco/westport relationship
i think we still need to tread gingerly with how we deal with belco or ken lay might be getting a phone call from mr
belfer
and i don't want my name to be brought up in that conversation
when you get back in the office let's pow-wow about how to approach this
we are waiting for mark greenberg to finalize the negotiations on the amendment to the online eta for db
we would like to shut down bt from all financial trading
however
what we found was that db will not execute the online eta without some revisions
mark is negotiating an amendment to the eta with db
meanwhile
bt had already been trading online
since that cat was already out of the bag so to speak
db didn't want to shut them down from trading without having another avenue to trade
so we are continuing to trade as bt
we do not want to do this forever
however
so we do need to get bt shut down
how goes it mark
tom
all of this relates to a broker bob shults wants to open up to trade on eol
when you have a minute can you give me or mark a call so we can sort out who we want to trade with
thanks
another nda
this one is for the new york mercantile exchange
attached please find the nda for transmittal to bo collins
we will also be getting these mid-market eim group customer lists on a going forward basis
i spoke to credit and for right now we will only be approving these counterparties to trade physical steel
as with the regular online trading lists
if i do not hear from you within one day
i will take it that you do not have any legal issues with the counterparties below trading
know anything about these deals
any conflicts
ok for you
how can we find out who has a clue
nothing to report
not unless it's critical
all the attorneys are out at an offsite today
can this wait til monday or is this critical
i will get them done today
i will get them done today
can you change on my calendar
thanks
this counterparty has transact ability on european and asian metals
they have hardly transacted at all
only power
much less any metals
we figure they are using the website for price discovery
if i do not hear back from you within 0 hours whether london legal has done any due diligence on this counterparty's authority to transact metals
it is my intention to shut them down for all metals products
per stephanie's request
attached is an updated list
i have reviewed the binder of confirms and have prepared a list of the missing or unexecuted confirms
kim
if you could please review this short list and provide me copies of the missing confirms and/or if we have received copies of any of the unexecuted confirms since you provided these confirms to me i would be most appreciative
this counterparty has been updated
pretty funny
if we could only do it for real
i got a call from my buddy mike mulligan with paribas in ny last night asking me to see if i can't check with you on the status of the guaranty he is trying to get in place with enron metals limited

is there some particular problem holding up this guaranty
is there anthing i can do to faciliate getting this guaranty to paribas

i also owe you more comments
i haven't forgotten
does anyone in credit know the answer to this question

there has been a little confusion about how this counterparty wishes to be set up on enrononline
and after talking to the counterparty
darren vanek in credit
and mary cook we have come to the following agreement
the counterparty will be

set up in the gcp system as vector pipeline

vector pipeline
lp
by its managing general partner

llc by

sheri
this project is very important to me
however
i am pulled on a very important project for the next several weeks and won't be able to look at this at all
i expect i am really the only one who will be giving you sustantive input
as well
i have other design modifications we will need to incorporate
i just wanted to give you a head's up because you are going to get ahead of me here for awhile
can you take a look at all the canadian agreements listed on this list provided to us by bp and verify whether these agreements exist in canada
you
as usual
are the best
mary cook wanted me to send you an email to make sure if you are sending the master netting agreement out to counterparties that you delete the last page of the agreement
which contains the user notes
teresa
by copy of this email
i am asking stephanie panus
another paralegal in our group
to handle this for you as i am on working on a special project this week
stephanie

cinergy is very interested in getting a financial master in place to trade with us asap

teresa

thanks sam
you're the best
bob shults is asking about that amendment to the amerex fee agreement
can you help him
i would like to attend
god knows if harry can/will come
we'll see
i did 0
slow

running 0 miles was no problem
harry
i had a little
tiff
i hope only
this weekend
and as usual
he's out of town
so we haven't been able to talk
so who knows
i think yes
anne also requested this
kay young prepared and is emailing a copy to anne
steve asked me to send an email asking if you haven't already begun drafting your agreements yet
when you name you agreement
please indentify them by the counterparty and the products such as
koch energy-gas
or
aquila marketing-financing
thanks
yes they are to prepare all the ucc filings
my pleasure
reading all that should keep you busy for awhile
i don't know the answer to this
do you
i am still using the list
i have to circulate the list to the team from time to time
any idea who knows the answer to this question
can you please handle
thanks
i wanted to let you know this was coming in as soon as mark approves the changes
dealing with japan is somewhat time challenging
name of company
ermt llc
a delaware limited liability company address
0 smith street
houston
texas 0
branches
only relates to those branches of a multibranch party
which under isda can only be a bank
restrictions
things put in the restrictions column should be those things so critical to trading
payment/settlement or contract formation that you should not enter into a trade unless you read it
it is not a place to dump general legal negotiation stuff
examples would be
masters limited to natural gas or crude oil trading only
no payment netting between energy commodity and interest rate and currency transactions
no oral trades allowed
only the treasurer can enter to trades for the company
all agreements for this counterparty require two signatures
you can do a sort on the pending swap update
executed
which will then show you all the restrictions
then scroll down and look at the type of restrictions entered into for the different companies to get a flavor for these types of restrictions
but we don't want to junk it up with general legal negotiation stuff
just critical
don't trade unless you look at this stuff
has this ever come in
can someone please respond to jennifer
thanks
can you please handle this for chris
thanks
sam
thanks for taking care of this
so far i'm on if i don't have to work
harry and i broke up on monday
i need to know what group nekesha is in
you do not have to grant nakesha access
she already has view only access as does any enron employee
if you show her how to set up an icon to get into the database
she should be able to get view access to the database
all enron employees have view access
only employees of legal and credit can have edit access access
does that help
we are trying to get a master netting agreement in place tomorrow with various aep companies
ectric has several trading agreements in place with aep entities
we need someone in london to verify that we are referencing the ectric agreements correctly in the master netting agreement
i am faxing the first two pages of the master netting agreement to edmund's attention at fax number 0-0 0-0-0
can one of you please take a look at this in the morning and verify that the information referenced in the agreement is correct since we do not have a copy of your agreements
much thanks
edmund cooper is the only person that has keyword access to add legal people
credit people
companies
or change other drop downs in the database
i have key word access on this side of the atlantic and edmund has it there
if you need london credit people added that aren't listed already you need to have edmund go add them
or the company as a new key word
i am not aware of any changes
are you
do i need to help you getting this out
who was this passed on to for handling
i don't have any record or receiving any such assignment and i checked with the other paralegals and they don't have a record of receiving it
can you have mirant resend it to samantha boyd
as she is the paralegal handling the paralegal assignment rotation right now
sorry about that
i'll give him a call
nothing to report
nothing from legal
i faxed you the alcoa isda immediately after we spoke
it should be in ny right now
mark and i were just discussing the project yesterday
i am out for thanksgiving vacation all next week
but when i get back the week after that we definitely want to get it back on track
sure thing
do you have a full legal name for equiva trading
any conflicts
attached please find the nda you requested
attached please find a current list of the networks
enrononline and commoditylogic executed and draft confidentiality agreements for your review
attached please find the referenced lists for your review
sheri

i will give a copy to you

no executed contract
russell
i want you to be my friend forever
after all
you are my favorite
ex-credit person
i just spoke to stacey richardson
and
with georgi landau gone
she said we should contact her
or bridgette anderson
with any global contracts questions for the time being
can you please provide me with the clean copies of the licenses angela is referring to
if i need to come pick them up to copy them
give me a call and i will do so
thanks
is there a canadian power gtc
let me know if i can be of further help
attached is a list of the termination letters i have been able to locate so far
tanya suggested that bear stearns termination is just a close-out of a nymex margin position and i have a call into greg whiting to see if that is the case
i spoke to craig breslau about the pemex termination and he knows nothing about that
he said if it happened it would have gone thru his desk
what are your thoughts on that
there appear to be two international paper deals
craig breslau got me a signed copy of the one terminating the deal for $0,0,0
there was another international paper deal the confirmation desk prepared a termination for in the amount of $0,0,0
craig
any knowledge of this other one
no copy either of the executed terminations of the proctor
gamble deals the confirmation desk prepared for
i
deal no
y 0.0 for $0,0
and
ii
deal no
0.0 for $0,0

and he is working on getting us phones
a fax machine
a non-network printer
and at least one laptop computer portal in each team area

it seems to have the right computer/phone jacks
which he will try to get completed by the end of today
second
we will target the 0nd floor
we have a fourth area available after this for team d
a suite of smaller offices/conference rooms also located on 0

a smaller office has a workable phone there
lance
we would need other phones installed there as well other the other equipment

lance
can you have your install people mark with a yellow sticky or something where the analog lines for the pcs are located
much thanks
you are the best
travis
i looked in mark greenberg's office
and i did not find the agreements you were looking for
but i did find mark's true quote file there and in it are two executed amendments to the price posting agreement
we only have a draft of the original price posting agreement in his file
no signed copy
lance
i just spoke to mary cook and she would like all four areas done by the end of today
is that doable
mary cook wants me to put together a list of people's home ph
cell no's/pagers
in case we need to call in help during the holidays
can you provide me with your info in case we get surprised and have to set up additonal data rooms
much thanks
thanks lance
i can't tell the fax numbers on some of the faxes and where the analog lines are
can you meet with me
it appears that the fax you moved in on the 0rd floor was actively being used by scott tholan and his assistant on that floor
x0
can your people please move it back asap and find us another one
thanks
any update on these faxes
i have to get my list to louise kitchen today
lance
did we replace the fax machine we erroneously took on the 0rd floor

thanks so much
i still cannot see the blanco physical index restricted products on the web
my id is adm0
can you please get me access as soon as possible
thanks
sorry
i was out when i normally do this and i forgot about it
hey melba
we would like to create a new product with the following product name
epng socal ehr
this product name should be used under the product type us gas phy
the description should contain the same language as the epng socal topk product except the word
ehrenberg
should be substituted every time the word
topock
appears
we would also like to create physical index products for this trading point
but we need to change the short description of the current ngi socal index product to allow for the addition of the specific point name
and we would also have to change the description of the original index product as well
i left you a message to call me if you can today
thanks
looks good but we need to talk about the index product because the decsription is too long as it stands now and we need to rename the current product and create a new one also
i am not in risk
can you get with anne bike and explain what you need her to do
thanks
we all have the same address but different work station locations
let me get them for you
our street address is 0 smith here are the work locations
tori eb0c randy eb0d patti eb0e kelli eb0b hope that helps
hello
my name is tori kuykendall
one pass bj0
my husband
patrick
one pass vf0
and i have been one pass members for a few years now as well as elite members on several occasions
we also use chase continental visa exclusively
and my husband is a president's club member
i have made continental my airline of choice for as long as i can remember booking my own travel arrangements and have been a very satisfied customer in the past
this morning
however
i had a very bad experience
i booked tickets for a vacation back on september 0th for a trip from houston to new york on december 0
since i booked the ticket
i became pregnant and found out from my doctor last week that i will still be unable to travel on december 0st due to complications with my pregnancy
my doctor indicated to me that i may not be able to fly at all during my pregnancy
which is due to end in june
i spoke to leroy peterson this morning to explain the situation
and he indicated that all he could do was give me credit that would expire on september 0th
0 and that a $0 service would be charged to me next time i book a ticket for me or my husband
i understand that this is the same policy that you would have given me if i had just decided that i didn't feel like taking a vacation this weekend
in my opinion
this is an unacceptable policy in the event of medical complications
as you can see with my situation
it is unlikely that my husband and i will be able to plan a vacation by september of 0 considering we will hopefully have a 0 month old child
i repeatedly asked leroy if there was anyone else who could help me or anyone i could talk to in order to get some kind of exception to your policy
i indicated that i could provide a doctor's note if necessary
he was very rude to me
stating
you don't have to ask me 0 different times for the same thing
i already told you no
i had to cancel a flight for work about a month ago on southwest airlines for the same reason
but i was hoping that i would be able to fly again by now
for your information
your competitor was very helpful
they accepted my doctor's note
gave me a credit good for one year
and will allow me to change the ticket to another person's name if i am still unable to use it
that ticket was also booked as a non-refundable fare
although i have always used continental for my personal travel
the treatment i have had in this difficult time has definitely made me second-guess my future choices
if there is anything you can do to help
i would greatly appreciate it
here is the information that you needed
my tickets were electronic and the confirmation number was ngp0mp
thank you
hey renata
how's everything going with you guys
i know i never respond to any emails
i usually just get too busy
sorry about that
anyway
i wanted to catch up and to let you know that pat and i are going to be parents
i still cant believe it
i'm due in june
anyway
we moved into a new house in katy
close to my parents
had to be prepared
hope everything's going great with y'all
give me an update
take care
hey martin
i know i havent paid for the fantasy league at all
but i am trying to figure out how much i owe
i think 0 of my transactions shouldve been free because 0 was to change kickers on the same team and 0 were to change my defense on the bye week
so
without any winnings
i think i owe $0
can you verify
thanks
also
can you tell me if i won anything for making the semi-finals
october preliminary invoice
i have been wondering for the last couple of months if this is the heather evans that i was friends with for so long
so
i am finally writing you an email
i know you don't recognize the last name
but
it's me
tori
hatter
i'd love to know what is going on in your life
i was hoping you'd make it to the reunion last year
anyway
if you get a chance
drop me an email
let's catch up
i'm so glad you wrote me back
sounds like you're a very busy person
but it looks like you're getting to do what you wanted to do
as for me
i got married to a great guy named patrick that i met during our last semester at ut
we actually got set up on a blind date by rachel hanson
anyway
we'll be married 0 years in june and we're expecting our first child in june
i spent a few years after college as a clothing buyer for foley's
but i now am doing something completely different that i absolutely love
i work for enron
big energy trading company
wasnt sure if you knew who we were
i'm trading natural gas
and it's a really fun job that's fast-paced and challenging
my hubby is an account manager for an internet company that has not yet gone public but their prospects are looking pretty good
we bought a house in sugarland about 0.0 years ago
but we sold it in august and moved into a new house that we built in katy
we wanted to be close to my parents and also closer to san antonio
where pat is from
his parents still live there
anyway
i guess that's it in a nutshell
oh yeah
and my address is
i hope we can keep in touch
i'm not travelling right now
but if you ever make it to houston
i'd love to see you
give me some more details in the next email
take care and happy holidays
love
tori
the current bid for jan-june for the west texas pool gas would be hsc-.0
this bid should be right on the market according to what i have found
please feel free to check around if you'd like
but i will need an answer today if you want be to start pulling gas on the 0th
thanks
here you go
happy new year
the price on the deal was 0.0
thanks for having the league
i'd definitely do it again next year
here's
we would like to begin trading a new product on eol
the location
pg&e topock
has already been set up
but we would like to make a small change to the long description
the line which reads
the transaction is for delivery at pg&e
el paso
should be changed to
the transaction is for delivery at pg&e topock
please let me know when we can review the change
as mike grigsby would like to begin trading this product as soon as possible
thanks
thanks for your help
and
i hate to revisit this again
but can you send me a current list of the counterparties that have access to the blanco restricted product
i am still getting complaints from people who should have access
but they are telling me that they do not
thank you
these charges are not valid
we will not pay penalties on a swing deal at a constrained point
several people on the desk discussed this potential problem
and the trader at agave has already been notified that will do not intend on paying any penalty charges
this deal was done on a gtc
spot contract
not on their firm agreement
i have an open order that was placed on 0/0/0
and the availablity on the item said that it would ship in 0 hours
i chose regular shipping
which should mean that it should be on its way
however
the order status still says that it hasn't shipped
how can i find out what it causing the delay
just got your email address from rachel
congrats on your promotion
i'm sure it's going to be alot different for you but it sounds like a great deal
my hubby and i moved out to katy a few months ago
i love it there
my parents live about 0 minutes away
new news from me
i'm having a baby
due in june
i can't even believe it myself
the thought of me being a mother is downright scary but i figure since i'm almost 0
i probably need to start growing up
i'm really excited though
rachel is coming to visit me in a couple of weeks
you planning on coming in for any of the rodeo stuff
you'll never guess who i got in touch with about a month ago
it was the weirdest thing
heather evans
i hadn't talked to her in about 0 years
seems like she's doing well but i can never really tell with her
anyway
i'll let you go
gotta get back to work
looking forward to hearing back from ya
just confirmed with mike
we are still good with that offer
hey girl
you guys doing anything tonight
thats awesome
i'm so happy for him
what day is your actual birthday
i always forget the exact date
hey brook
i was wondering if you sent that check
because if you did
i didnt get it
no big deal
just checking
we had a couple of different deal numbers that we were using for december purchases from sg interests
we bought a volume of 0 at a price of 0.0 on 0/0 on deal 0
however
the next day
we bought a volume of 0 at a price of 0.0 on 0/0 on deal 0
the counterparty agrees with me and they will be reinvoicing us
we arent busy
looks like jen may be trying to put together a happy hour/early dinner for friday
she just sent me an im
i'm assuming it's not in honor of your birthday because it wasnt mentioned
i wont mention it if you dont want me to
anyway
she did ask about you
said she hadnt talked to you in a while
as far as i know
we have no plans as of yet for the whole weekend
i know how much you love football
but maybe we can just hang out on sunday and watch the game
make some good food
etc
by the way
i went to the doctor yesterday and he said everything looks perfect right now
that was awesome news
i'm going to get an ultrasound sometime in the next 0 weeks
hopefully i can find out what i'm having
i lost my waist over the weekend
definitely in the maternity clothes now even though they all look huge
anyway
talk to you soon
i ordered a computer and printer on the enron click at home program and i received a confirmation
but it seems as if it's only for the computer and not the printer
my order number is 0
can you check on the status of the printer
thanks
maybe
what do you think
hey
just wanted to say happy birthday
and
find out how you're doing
perfect i'm sure
you would totally laugh if you saw me right now
i'm starting to look pretty darn preggo
anyway
i may try to call you later today
take care
well

whats your next stop
still
that sounds awesome

hey fletch

hey sean
i just thought about you yesterday because i remembered your birthday was coming up
i have no idea if this is the correct email address for you
so i won't write too much
write back if you can
i have alot to tell you
hey
just wanted to see hoe your trip went
i dont even know if you're back yet
wow
congratulations on your engagement
i remember you talking about her at the reunion
i'm glad your career is going so well
as if there was ever a doubt
well
my news is also big
i'm expecting a little girl on june 0th
talk about a life changing event
pat and i moved to katy to live close to my parents and to have a bigger and newer house
i really love it there
it's hard to believe our 0 year anniversary is coming up in march
i'm still working at enron
still trading commodities
and it's going really well
like i said before
i just wanted to wish you a happy birthday and catch up a little
i know how busy you are
but i'd love to have your new email when you leave seattle
until next time
take care and have fun planning the wedding
hi amber
i have misplaced my truequote id and password and i would like to start looking at the system
finally
is there any way you could send me my info again
thanks
tori
oh
i forgot to mention
john perdew wants your body
i'd like a swatch of seaside baby
my mailing address is 0 stackstone ln
hey jack
i'm assuming you don't know the last name
but i'm betting you haven't known alot of other tori's in your lifetime
anyway
i've been feeling nostalgic lately
so
i thought i would see what was up in your life
i got married about 0 years ago
and i live with my husband
pat
out in katy
i'm working at enron downtown
doing commodity trading
we're expecting a little girl in june
our first baby
anyway
i'd love to see what's going on with you
write back if you can
i'm so glad you wrote back
isn't the internet a wonderful thing
i have been driving back and forth to the doctor and practically passing right by the house you grew up in
i thought about you every time i drove by
and i had to find you
congratulations on your marriage
where did y'all meet
how's your family
gosh
i feel like asking you a million questions
i can't believe i waited this long
what has it been
like almost 0 years
that makes me feel old
i guess i am turning 0 this year
scary thought
anyway
i better get back to work
but i will call you
or
if i don't call first
my number is 0-0-0
p.s
do you remember rachel haygood
she's still one of my closest friends and she says
hi
i'm sorry if i am not being understanding about this situation
but i if you really look back at the last 0 jobs you've had
i think i have been more than understanding about letting you do whatever you wanted to do
it really hurts me that your pride in this situation is more important to you than spending time with your pregnant wife and your daughter
i can't talk to you about this anymore if you are unwilling to understand my point of view
once again
if the situation were different
i would tell you to do whatever you wanted
but
this time it's different and i hope you can see that
i love you
tori
i need to add some more people to our restricted list for our blanco product
but i need someone from eol to send me an update of the current list
can i get this today
thanks
we have two new products on the west desk that we would like to launch march 0st
the descriptions are set up and ready to go
but we need to make these restricted products just like the ep blanco
the customer list
however
will be different than the blanco list
we need to get on this right away
please let me know what i need to do
the 0 products will be epng socal ehrenberg and pg&e topock
the reason why we need to make these restricted products is so that we can prohibit el paso merchant energy from trading them
the reason why we want to do this is that el paso merchant energy is refusing to trade with us
the western region
both on their online trading system
ice
and also in the broker market
we feel that this is the appropriate action to take in order to keep the playing field level
i'm sure this will bring up some questions
which should be directed to our vp
mike grigsby
if further explanation is needed
again
the desk has just made the decision to trade the products in this way
and they are asking me to make sure that we have the ability to roll them out on eol by 0/0 at the latest
thanks for your help
hey sheri
how's everything going
hope you had a good time on your vegas trip
i haven't even had a chance to talk to jen about it
i had a question for you
do you know of any job openings that would be good for pat
i have his resume to forward if you think there is anything out there
i'm glad everything worked out for you
hope you have a great time
i show
0 in my notes as well as on the paper ticket
here is the way we would like to see the restricted list for the ep blanco avg products
i have omitted and added counterparties
can we make these changes as soon as possible
i would like to be able to tell the new counterparties as soon as possible so they can start clicking
thanks
i'm feeling great
other than not being able to sleep very well
and this is just the beginning of that
anyway
thanks for forwarding pat's resume
he does like what he is doing there most of the time
but i have been pushing for a little more stability from him to take some of the pressure off myself
thanks again
thanks for your help
due on june 0th

jennifer lamprecht susan hadix pam macaul dana richardson terra henderson cathy morse diane hoyuela kristin wilson jennifer taylor donna hatter
my mom dorothy glasscock
my grandmother
i have a friend who is possibly interested in the trading positions that we have open
but i wanted to find out exactly what types of trading positions they are
can you give me some more details
thanks
hey jack
sorry i missed your call the other night
i've either been out or exhausted every night
this whole pregnancy thing is really tiring
anyway
i just wanted to get back to you
i'll try to call soon
didnt want you to think i was ignoring you
here's the right email address
talk to you soon
i got ahold of them and they are going to stop by the house tomorrow and look at everything and give us an estimate
you should see me try to play golf right now
it is downright comical
nasdaq is scary
you think we could lose another 0% of what we have in there
should we just leave it in for the long term and wear all the pain now
i will be attending
hey girl
havent talked to you in a while
just wanted to catch up and see whats new
here are the two new index descriptions that we need
then
just to clarify on the pg&e topock product
here is the special language that we need to use
the volumes scheduled to be delivered are subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on all interconnecting pipelines at this location based upon historical operating conditions
the reductions caused by these are excused nonperformance and are not considered a failure to receive or deliver firm gas
we do not want to specifically mention el paso pipeline because the gas can come from a variety of different pipelines
all of which can have operational constraints
i think this is close enough to the original language that it should not be a problem
thanks for your help
here is the resume we talked about
hey heath
sorry it took so long to get back to you
we plan on at least going to dinner
dont know how long we'll stay out after that
i'll do my best
see you there
hey sheri
i forgot my logon and password for dynegy direct
we havent looked at it in so long but now we want to again
hey kristi
the bunko is going to be on april 0th at my house
hope to see you there
please add astra power llc to the restricted list for the ep blanco avg products
thank you
without trading experience
the jobs that you would be interviewing for would be risk analysis or scheduling probably
i'm not sure how much you make but i think it may be a pay cut
not sure though
you can send me your resume though and i have alot of contacts in those areas
i'll do what i can
so sorry to hear about your loss
our thoughts will be with you
ext 0-0
0
yes 0
no 0
no let me know if you need anything else
scott and i talked and we cannot say definitively that triad called us first every single day
there may have been some days when we called them
we can call you if you need further explanation
this is just to remind everyone that bunko is at my house on monday april 0th
please let me know as soon as you can if you are not going to be able to make it
thanks and i look forward to seeing all of you there
hey beverly
do you have phone numbers for any of the people that werent there last time
hey there
hope everything is going great with you
things are still going pretty smoothly with me
thank goodness
my actual due date is 0/0 so i only have about 0 months left
i'm starting to realize why people are always miserable in the last couple of months
anyway
my address is 0 stackstone ln
katy
tx 0
talk to you soon
what we decided is that we are all bringing something and i provide the drinks
i havent heard back from everyone yet but my gut instinct is that we will need at least one extra person
it looks like everyone that was there last time is coming again and also kristi said she would be there
but that still leaves us short
i hope the pool construction doesnt disrupt y'all too much
the good thing is that my dad is overseeing it and he is being really hard on the guys
making sure they are as clean and quick as they can possibly be
kim already said that jeffrey cant wait to come swimming
we'll have to get a water basketball goal
pat will love playing with all the kids
you are so sweet to think of me
i dont know why you would ever be in houston
but if you are
we definitely need to get together
talk to you soon
i never heard back on this request
was it done
hello
i was the one who asked about your high chair covers at fuzzy's pizza the other night
i was wondering if i could get more information on patterns and cost
thank you
i will be here all this week and really any time after about 0 am is fine to stop by
hey
thats funny about john
he definitely remembers him
i'll call pat and let him know
we are coming on saturday
i just havent had a chance to call you guys back
looking forward to it
i probably need the directions again though
not to be inconsiderate
but we did get him a gift last year and it seemed like nobody was really that interested in doing it
we think it's dangerous to start buying birthday presents for some people and not others and the group thinks it's best if we dont start the trend
we definitely want to do something for boss's day every year
but we think it's best to keep the birthdays simple
hope everyone is okay with this
i talked to the people that were here and we all agreed
hey dan
it's tori from the good ole west gas desk
i was talking to the klapper the other day and he said that i might be able to forward my hubby's resume to you to see if you knew of any good fits for his experience in your arena
his background is in ecommerce account management/development and other it consulting and auditing
i'm gonna go ahead and attach his resume
please let me know if you think there's anything here for him
i would greatly appreciate the help
thanks
tori
thanks
can you just let me know one way or the other if his background would be compatible with anything that might come up
thanks
hey melba
guess what
we have come to the point where we no longer need to make blanco a restricted product
can we go ahead and change these ep blanco avg products
both the fixed and index
back to normal unrestricted products
let me know
i need to send jennifer a shower invitation and i have your address but i lost the zip code
duh
can you forward me your zip code
hi
i am an employee at enron and i have applied for an infant spot in the new day care center
i was wondering when we would be notified as to whether or not we have been accepted
i know the center doesn't open until september
but for me it will be first time child care and i need to line something up if i do not get in
also
do you know an exact date for the scheduled opening
thanks for your help
damn
we eat really early here
they bring lunch at 0 oclock if you can believe it
maybe i will come meet you anyway and not eat
it's dead here today
when and where were you planning on going
wow
thats awesome
have a great time
bring pictures to the baby shower
you should be getting an invitation soon
i think my friend jennifer is sending them out early next week
i cant believe i only have 0 weeks left
the trader over there is jb smith
if you would like
you can send me a copy of the invoice
and we will send them a letter with the invoice attached
and tell them to stop sending invoices to you because we consider the issure to be resolved
lets start on the 0th
monday
that way we can start it for may 0st trades
we need to get something for ina for admin asst's day
it is tomorrow
i will take a collection of $0 from each person and get a gift certificate from foley's if that is okay with everyone
i will probably have to go get the gift certificate tonight
so please dont stick me with more than my share of the bill
thats what happened last time
thanks
hey there
just wanted to see how the bike ride went
also wanted to let you know that pat got a job
thank goodness
anyway
write back or call when you get a chance
we will agree to cancel these trades and reconfirm new ones
tori
please disregard my prior email
i mispelled socal's email address
their address is now correct
as we discussed
astra incorrectly confirmed the two imbalance trades detailed below
tony at socalgas said he can cancel the trades if astra and enron send him an email requesting the trades be cancelled
trades to cancel
confirm date agent buyer agent seller therms to confirm that you agree to cancel
then please forward this to him at gtcalendar@socalgas.com and indicate that you agree
you can also hit
reply all
since i cc'd on this email
i will call you and let you know what the new downstream contract will be
thanks parks wesson astra power
llc
looks good
just seeing if you were back from your trip
maybe we can go for lunch sometime this week
let me know when you're free
thursday sounds great
and around 0 would be good if you can make it
we can go to bourays
ny pizzeria
allen center
whatever you want
for deal 0
it should be 0.0 for deal 0
for the 0-0 it should be 0.0
hey there
i was just talking about you with my mom
she said she talked to you again today and i was laughing that she's talked to you alot more than i have lately
dinner friday sounds great
what else have you been up to
did you already have the river trip
we havent been out at all
just too tiring for me to do anything but dinner right now
we're just trying to get everything ready
it's pretty exhausting
well
i better get back to work
talk to you soon and see you friday
river trip sounded like a blast
the pool is going well
next step is the deck and they are starting this week
realistically they could be done in 0 weeks
pat got a job
thank goodness
he starts next thursday
he'll be working downtown at waste management
it was a pretty good offer
good benefits
good company
he's going to be working for the old boss that he had at bank united
we will be able to carpool now
no more bussing it for me
also
we just found out today that we got into the new enron child care center
that was a big relief
so
things continue to fall into place
we're keeping our fingers crossed that it continues
do you not have instant messenger at work anymore
test
hey there
i was wondering if you have nicole's address
i wanted to get terra to send her a baby shower invitation just in case she might be coming into town
or at least it will serve as an announcement anyway
thanks
thanks so much
i am going to write her in addition to sending the invitation since it looks like she wont be in town anyway
i talked to steve and he liked you alot
who else did you talk to
oh
ok
she hasnt said anything but that doesnt surprise me
she is actually the manager of the group and she usually doesnt talk much about her interviews
i'll see what i can find out
still on for lunch today
i think pat and i have decided to wait until he can be listed on the loan before we actually lock this thing up
we are still going to do it
but we both feel better about having both names on the documents
can you tell me exactly how long we will ahve to wait after he starts working
i should be there
barring any unexpected events of course
i sure will
i think that would be a better fit for you anyway
if i hear anything
i'll let ya know
sure

hey andrew
just seeing how things were going with you
i was at dinner the other night with jojo and your name came up
so i thought i would drop you a note
where are you these days
things are pretty much the same around here
trevor is planning a trip to come see me when the baby is born
only 0.0 weeks til d-day
maybe a little earlier if i'm lucky
wasnt sure if i told you that i'm having a little girl
she wont be spoiled or anything
overall i have to say that pregnancy hasnt been that bad of an experience
other than the lack of partying which in my case is probably a good thing
keith holst was asking about you
said to tell you hi
so
hi
thats all from h-town for now
hope you're doing well
i need trade access to the western canada gas products on eol
thanks
i guess i need access to view the site with the p/l
that is
if i am supposed to have it
i did that the first time
it takes me to a page that says i do not have permission to view that sight
and it directs me to send you an email
i cant remember who you forwarded this request to
she said it was done but i still cannot see the products
my eol id is adm0
maybe it was updated on the wrong one
let me talk to wes and find out really where this stuff is
it may be closer to ngpl perm
i have no idea until i see the physical location
should we be invested in oil producers instead of enron and calpine
thought you might like to see a pic of the little one
i heard this yesterday
perfect example of the state of our economy
i'm at a loss on calpine also
seems like they should be a fairly high debt company with all these power plants they are building
seems like they could refinance debt at these low interest rates and improve their bottom line
i dont know
just a thought
the rest of the ideas you had sound fine to me
can you give me the address for the kids center so i can complete the nomination form
also do we put knowledge beginnings or lorraine as the center director
hi lorraine
i was trying to complete the form to nominate the kid's center for this award and i need the phone number and fax number there
i'm not sure why i don't have them
but i don't
thanks for your help
hey fritz
i am going to send you an email that attaches a referral form to your job postings
in addition
i will also personally tell the hiring manager that i have done this and i can also give him an extra copy of youe resume
hopefully we can get something going here
i would like to bid 0 points on chris weinke and if i dont get him
i would like to bid 0 points on jay fiedler
this is a spreadsheet that we used to have in our fundies packet a while back
it is no longer being maintained
but i was wondering if you could cook something up that looks similar to it
linking to the fundies price database
let me know
thanks
i sent this message to colin originally and
since he's out
i am forwarding it to you
i'm not really sure who the appropriate person is
i also just realized that i forgot to include the attachment on the original message
oops
anyway
could you take a look at this sheet and let me know what you could come up with
i'd like to build something that looks like the
price sheet
tab
thanks
i also talked to the manager of the east region scheduling group and he said he would have hr call you for a screening interview
so be ready
call me anytime after about 0
lots of good news out about duke energy
low p/e
take a look
hey cathy
just checking in with you
it was good to see y'all again
but we'd love to come out to the house sometime in october
i wanted to see what your sundays looked like
we are out on the 0-0 but that's all
also
do you have contact info for tom and nicole
i'd love to get in touch with both of them
hey tom and nicole
i wanted to get in touch with both of you
i finally got your email addresses
my little girl
erin
is almost 0 months old now
and is and absolute joy
she's a pro a rolling over and grabbing and chewing on everything she can get her hands on
i wish you guys could see her
i'm attaching a picture even though it's a little old
after you see this
i won't have to tell you how much she looks like her daddy
life has definitely changed
but for the better
believe it or not
i haven't gotten drunk in over a year and have no desire to do so
ha
i'm still working at enron
trading away
it's still been the best move i ever made
pat is now at waste management after getting laid off from the little
com company
again
a very good turn of events
we are loving katy
especially with the swimming pool built in the back yard and some really great neighbors
enough about me
please write back with updates
i feel like i've totally lost touch and i don't want to keep it that way
take care and talk to you soon
tori
hi steve
i just wanted to let you know to change your distribution list for this email
you can take me and jan off and add patti sullivan
patti.sullivan@enron.com and ted evans
ted.evans@enron.com
thanks
that date works for me as of now
and i do have a few things
have fun in port a
i'll tentatively pencil in the 0th
let me know if something comes up and i will do the same
the seats are in the lowest section
within one of the baselines
i cant really remember what row
they are pretty good though
sounds like a good plan
i guess the best thing to do is follow advice of the experts
hopefully we will win in the long run
ok
great
sounds good
let me know if you need any more information
hello
i left you a message on your cell phone a month ago
i thought you decided that you didnt want to talk to me or something
call me
0-0-0
hey there
all is well with erin and with me
although i can tell you that i definitely have not had time to pick up a book lately
our day consists of
wake up at 0
feed erin
get ready
drive to work
work
drive home
feed the baby
eat dinner
play with the baby
bathe the baby
go to sleep
and i'm really lucky if i'm not awakened at 0 or 0 am
but
it's all worth it
i would be glad to give you a recommendation
any idea where you want to be
there are a few people hiring right now for sure
hey
got your voicemail
i'll definitely try to meet up with you when you are in town
i already have a ton of plans in the next couple of weeks so i'm not sure how many more nights i can stay here late
what time are you leaving on the 0th
well
the problem is that i have 0 dinners next week and one om the 0th
it's tough to leave pat at home with the baby that many nights
but we'll see
mike
i need to go to the doctor tomorrow
the only appt i could get was 0 noon and it's in katy
but i will get back as soon as i can
i have been having some issues over the past week or so and i really need to get it checked out
i would like to bid 0 points for wade richey in this weeks free agency draft
well
the gentleman's package seems a little excessive since it has a manicure and a haircut thrown in
it looks like if we do the massage and facial only
it would be about $0 total
the phone number is 0-0-0
i dont know him but he's legit
just looked him up
what job are they calling about
i hope not
but you never know with those hr guys
anyway
if you get some more details
i'll fill you in on any info i have
the plan sounds good to me
i think signs are usually enough
just put a few out at all the possible routes
works here
that works for me
i guess we know why it tanked now
i wonder if we really did conduct illegal transactions
at this point
i would believe anything
this sucks
we have an employee meeting tomorrow
everyone is waiting to here what lay has to say
i don't think you would really want to be here right now anyway
not the best environment
besides
you hate houston
right
have you gotten any other leads
sounds like you have some good prospects
if you can land something decent in this economy then i think you're doin okay
good luck
keep me updated
okay
so here's the deal
ugh
i hate to say this but we may have to postpone again
pat's parents were supposed to come last weekend and they didnt because pat's dad was sick
so they are thinking of coming this weekend instead
they usually leave pretty early on sunday
but with your time constraints with the foleys thing
i dont know if we'll be able to squeeze it in the middle
i'll let you know if anything changes
if not
it may be back to the drawing board
i saw terra
di
and nicole this weekend in austin
it was great to hang out with nicole if only for a little bit
how's john's job search going
it's pretty rough out there
i've been thinking about you guys alot
hoping he can get something soon
anyway
i'll let you go
take care
i think it's going to be virtually impossible for me to skip out early on afternoon meetings for a while
so
i may end up having to be here til 0 on days that we have the bigger ones
this sucks but i think i just have to out up with it for a while
you okay with this
insiders starting to buy here
ok
so it looks like pats mom has to work on sunday so i guess it's back on
we should be able to get there at about 0:0
what do you want me to bring
i met with chris today and i think we are going to try something else before we go forward with these
you can get with him for the details
thanks
ok
my opinion
i think signs are enough but am not opposed to pitching in for an ad
i will try my best to come over friday night but if i cant
what time will you be up on saturday
i have a table and chairs
coffee table
vacuum cleaner
pictures
dishes
thats about it i think
yeah
last week was just a case of bad timing
come back soon
great pictures
too bad you have to go back to real life
anything new on the job search
i probably cant find a baby sitter that late on a thursday
we have a meeting at 0 today
cnbc is doing a report at 0:0
i will let you know
so
here's the synopsis
everything is business as usual
we have alot of cash and almost all of our counterparties are supporting us 0%
we are about to get more credit lines within a few hours
it's going to be rough but everything being done right now is to protect the gas and power trading businesses and we will be the best compensated people in the company
ok
let me know when you guys can try to come up with a solution
also
mike would like to know if eol can work on a new functionality that would allow a trader to create a fixed price physical product that could link to price
basis
and index in order to prevent arb opportunities from the market
any ideas on that
david
where are we on this
is there any hope of getting this done
why dont i try kim or marta first
i would like to bid 0 points on jay fiedler
i also would bid 0 points for charlie batch if i dont get fiedler
i also want to bid 0 points for jason brookins
hey there
we are doing really well
i cannot believe that she's almost 0 months old
anything new with you guys
hope all is well
pat's email is pkuykendall@wm.com and his phone number is 0-0-0
maybe you guys can come out and visit sometime soon
hey
seems like we arent the only ones that think kyle is an arrogant asshole anymore
susan told me that on saturday night she had it out with him and doesnt want him around
also
apparently he's been treating dana like shit and it's starting to get noticed by other people
just thought this was an interesting development
i talked to chris a little bit and he is going to call back tonight at 0 at home
how's this for the daily update
today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued
recent news reports
including the wall street journal article today
have speculated about possible mergers
takeovers and equity investors as options that enron is considering
the reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation
however
i will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company
i will keep you updated on developments as they occur
wow
i wonder
tell me what you think
or any ideas to add
the changes were done by pat
i havent read it yet as it would be odd to pull it up here so i dont know if i agree with them or not
i am hearing from the youngsters that bullets are the way to go
also
i'm out of ene in the schwab
oh well
another $0 down the drain
my fault this time
hi chris
wanted to make a couple more changes on the resume after having someone review it
will forward this evening
thanks again
just saw on cnbc
enron talking deal with dynegy
this is so ironic
they halted trading on the stock
we are restating all financial statement since 0
i couldnt sell in time
i hope you talked to rick
i couldnt get ahold of you
this sucks really bad
agreed
i can't go on wednesday
i have a dinner interview
it was the only time the guy could do it
sorry
thank my buddy rachel for all these things
ok
so we all owe $0
somebody can just give me $0 and then everyone else can pay dana
i'm not in a hurry so no biggie
i'm jealous
i can't go wednesday
have an interview and that was the only time they could do it
well
it's okay
alot of people here are really confident about going head to head with dynegy traders and kicking their asses
and i've had a pretty good year so i'm not that worried
but
that said
i do have a couple things lined up just to see if there's something better
what about you
did you get your interview at pan can yet
i'm doing great
the baby is so much fun but alot of work
i feel tired 0% of the time
enron is actually okay
i feel good about my chances to stay on with the
new empire
but
i'm still taking this as an opportunity to explore some other options to see if there may be something incredible out there that i am missing out on
what's new with you
advice
any trips you want to take
do it now
start saving a bunch of money
and just remember
when you start trying
it could happen on the first try
hey ken
looking forward to meeting with randy tonight
he probably told you already
i know he's talked to some other people that he hasn't been too impressed with
do you know if there is anything special that he's looking for
or i should say
anything that specifically rubs him the wrong way
my only bonding experience with him has been making fun of janie at parties
i'm in
assuming we leave at 0 which i think is the case
hey
thanks for getting back anyway
i thought it went pretty well
he said
let's keep talking
kevin masek was there too
i stayed for a drink with him after randy left and he thought it went really well
i had a good time
seemed like he was trying to be pretty formal though
i was pretty excited with what he had to say about their plans and i know i would get along well with the people that are there so far
and
i think i can bring alot to the table for him
we'll see what happens
i know he'll tell you everything
any new progress on this
can i write you a check for this
and
by the way
have people been paying you
because alot of people dont read their email
this is the rebuild of all the gas daily and index spreads including the addition of aeco spreads along with a few others
i just wanted to send a follow-up thank you for dinner the other night
it was nice to see you again and to hear about the exciting prospects you have at rwe
i know i would enjoy being a part of your trading team
and i truly believe that i can provide you with a good base a knowledge and a strong desire to continue to grow as a trader within your organization
i heard a rumor that you guys may be hiring
is this true
and
if so
for what
i have dinner at my parents
tonight
meeting my brother's girlfriend
have fun though
susan was already paying me
i think there may be some confusion
i'll let you guys work it out
thanks
congratulations
i'm all teary eyed
i knew you picked a good one
sounds great
we will definitely try to see you that weekend
cinco ranch is actually public so that shouldnt be a problem
willow fork is private but i think you can rent it and just pay more
i went to a reception at the equestrian center once and that was really nice
i know whatever you choose will be beautiful
take care
see you soon
glad you made it safely
enjoy the snow
my home email is patrick_kuykendall@hotmail.com
talk to you soon
take care
phone number
0-0-0
i will be attending the party
celestine
i have not been a member now for over a year
can you take me off your mailing list
thanks
the 0th is much better for me as we already have plans on the 0th
sounds great
hey keith
it was great catching up last night
in response to our conversation
although i have already sent me resume there through a head hunter
i thought i would also forward it to you directly
i'd love to have lunch with you in the near future to talk about the prospects
so far
i guess its a good thing you didnt get on here after all

just a short message to apprise everyone of the cleaning results performed on the filter separator from the transwestern m/s
wipe tests taken of the interrior portions of the separator prior to cleaning revealed pcb results of
0
0 and 0 microgram
this was not a standard wipe taken of a specific area
these wipes were taken over large areas to determine presence/absence of pcb's within the separator
after the cleaning operation was completed
three wipe samples were taken of the interrior portions of the separator
all results showed non detect at less than 0.0 microgram
i feel we can be fairly certain that the separator is free of residual pcbs
jeff
would you pass this information on to your counterpart for pg&e
tracy
thanks for the heads up
beginning in january of 0
provide me with the new and old serial numbers for each unit and a closer exchange date
as things
scheduling
changeout activities etc
tend to move dates around
on a related note
i spoke to vector concerning the equipment which was suggested for cleaning on the pg&e system
it is as follows
0 scrubbers
some underground c/s piping
filter separator
horizontal tank
0-0.0 drip locations the vector proposal for mobilization
demobilizataion and cleaning the above pg&e equipment will be approx
$ 0
0
i approached vector about the pipeline cleaning between our m/s and their c/s
they quoted a turn key price of $0,0
because this piping belongs to transwestern
we should contract this cleaning ourselves
if the decision is made to address this cleaning
i think we would want to have it done during the same time period as the pg&e cleaning activities
i will also need some lead time to notify vector and determine an appropriate methodology to be used
vector apparently has an approved methodology for cleaning pipes to 0
one additional note
apparently pg&e has discovered pcbs in their gas compressors
in wipe samples taken of the internal compressors pcbs were found at regulated levels
based upon valving constraints and the innaccessability to the inside of the pipe between our m/s and the topock c/s
a decision has been made to postpone cleaning of his section of the pipeline
should cleaning occur of this section
it is anticipated that it will not occur untill the installation of the filter separator at the pg&e c/s
sometime later this year
vector has been notified of this change in plans and will adjust their cleaning schedule accordingly
guys
i received harrell's memo concerning the fuel use for the turbine and the fact that you had to reduce gas producer speeds to comply with the permits fuel use requirements
my question is
how does the fuel use compare with what solar says the fuel use should be
if we can get solar to provide written guarantees and
up
the fuel use value for the turbine
we can up the fuel value on the permit
the state of colorado perceives increased fuel use beyond manufacturers values as the turbine not operating correctly and in need of mechanical adjustment
from their eyes
this would be a strong indication of excess emissions
and i think there evaluation would hold some merit
anyway
i dont want to send up a red flag to the state of colorado
would you contact solar and compare their fuel use values with what the monitors say the turbine is burning at la plata
then let me know
if worse gets to worse
i may be able to use another tactic
but only as a last resort

i anticipate that we will be required to monitor and conduct housekeeping activities at the site
the environmental clearances are still in effect as long as we stay on our right of way and in our measuring station yard
for any construction work at the pg&e station
we will need written aprpoval from pg&e
i will notify the state and county of california when we do the construction work

0 letter from richard and oreane garcia concerning pipeline integrity and noise issues
transwestern pipeline company offers the following response
pipeline integrity
with the construction of the evaporation ponds over transwestern's right of way and pipline
transwestern has closely monitored the potential for impacts for the pipeline
this includes a more frequent inspection of the pipeline conditions underlying the ponds by taking potentiometric readings to verify that corrosion is not present
transwestern has also installed rectifiers to assist in eleminating the potential of pipeline corrosion
as a dot requirement
transwestern has cathodically protected the entire pipeline system with an external pipeline coating to further ensure the integrity of the pipeline underlying the evaporation ponds
the pipline safety measures implemented by transwestern are designed to not only identify corrosion iimpacts to the pipeline system at the inception of detrimental impacts as a result of corrosion
but also allow for long term stability and integrity by conducting state of the art monitoring and detection
noise issue
in the initial environmental assessment and study
transwestern conducted baseline surveys of the area to determine existing noise levels
this study was completed to assist transwestern in the mitigation measures which will be implemented after construction of the gallup compresso station
pending completion of the facility
transwestern will conduct post noise studys to determine whether facility noise levels have increased above those levels mandated by ferc
in the event of operational noise levels exceeding the ferc regulatory level of 0 ldn
transwestern is committed to performing any and all mitigation measures necessary to ensure that the post noise level of the facility will not be above the level mandated by ferc
decrepancy of trailer park residents
in the letter by mr
garcia
it was stated that transwestern's assessment of the number of residences in the adjacent trailer park was not 0 as had been stated in our original study
but
more like 0 trailers
the number of mobile home residences currrently in the trailer park may in fact be closer to 0
transwestern's trailer park residence count was taken in the winter of the year when the fluctuating job market is normally down and the number of residences in the park was low
the transient nature of mobile home residences and the fluctuating job economy of the area is probably a direct reflection of the up and down nature of the residences
it should also be noted that during the time that the trailer park count was made
the owner of the trailer park who is also the operator of the evaporation ponds was experiencing major difficulties in the operation of the ponds and raw sewage had overflowed the pond embankments and had resulted in the raw sewage ponding in the yards of many of the trailer park residents
it was actually noted that many of the spaces normally occupied by mobile homes had been vacated
this unsanitary condition was also identified by the new mexico environment department
the nmed had implemented enforcement actions against the trailer park owner

consistent activities with respect to the rest of the pcb contaminated system
let me know before the penn state visit
so i can start rounding up the analytical data for the pipeline and stations
butch
you may want to attend this
bret
what do you think about this
we have pretty much proven that we are not the culprits is this activity
i have a problem conducting an ongoing sampling for an issue that were not responsible for
even though we initiated the sampling activity
i plan on visiting the ocd about this issue and either forcing them to justify why we should continue the sampling when the data points to our neighbors
additionally
because of the turnover and inability to get the guilty party to get moving on this
spending additional money and not receiving any return seems like a waste of time
thoughts
george robinson
george
after bret's memo
go ahead and conduct the sampling
the soonest i can discuss the issue with the ocd is in the middle of november
i have reviewed the reports and results of the studies conducted by us and them and the evidence weighs in our favor
at your leisure and prior to the november ocd meeting
prepare a memo to file of the resaons and justification based upon the report results and data why eunice is not the bad guy in this and why texaco is
gradients
plume elevations and characteristics of the contaminants show that this is not our problem
id like to have sufficient evidence
both mine and yours
to force ocd to go aftertexaco and get us out of this issue
i think this would also help bret's case for having texaco
or whoever is responsible
reimburse northern for the costs we have incurred for what is texaco's problem

i reveiwed the proposal by adewumi and it is correct and fairly accurate
for the purposes of a historic account and and in as far as what was provided to him in the way of data and history
his proposed scope seems to be conclusive and appears to be what we need
i have included louie in the distribution and am sure he will have some input
my comments are as follows
0
i dont know how relevant it is to know about the customers facilities at this time
as you know
we have more than one customer
pg&e and socal
and i think that we should maintain a low profile especially with respect ot socal
both parties in the past
have been helpful and very cooperative in matters pertaining to pcb's
because the modeling study will be conducted between c/s 0 and c/s 0
the customers facilities should have no impact on this
0
also
i would like to see if we can deal with pcb's and arsenic at the same time
is it possible to simultanously model both contaminants
0
because the modeling efforts are conducted on a very small portion of the pipeline
can this section be used for all of the transwestern system
in leau of the fact that we have pipe under rivers
over rivers
major elevation chages in short distances etc which are not covered in the section to be modeled
will the pipeline characteristics be covered to the extent that it will yeild information applicable to the entire pipeline system
0
i am also concerned about stirring up the pcb's and moving additional pcb's into the socal system
its been pretty quiet in discussions with the socal pcb person
i wonder if we should notify ralph komai to be on the alert when we start the cleaning

we had an air inspection at the facility a couple of weeks ago and all went well
prior to the state visit
we went through a
trouble shooting
scenario and found out that solar provided us with innacurate permitting information for that altitude and temperature
solar was very helpful and provided us with updated information to reflect conditions at the facility
i submitted a permit revision and it was submitted to the state of colorado prior to their inspection
requesting more fuel but no more emissions
recent testing has shown that even under extreme low temperatures
the emissions are under the original permitted levels
because we did not request additional emissions
i expect the permit to be issued within the next couple of months
bottom line is that no nov will be issued for the fuel use issue
william kendrick
this is just a short update on the conference call just completed with michael adewumi of penn state
concerning the pcb pipeline modeling project proposed for the transwestern mainline system
david roensch
dr
adewumi and myself discussed the latest proposal submitted by adewumi and based upon his answers to the technical and operational questions
it appears that the model will yeild some useful information
adewumi was asked about the simultaneous modeling of pcb's and arsenic and feels that the model can address this situation
he felt that by initiating the model to the pipeline segement selected for the study
between c/s 0 and c/s0
this information could be projected to the other pipeline segments with physical and elevational conditions not represented in the segment selected
as is the case with most projects of this nature
answers to some questions cannot be addressed until we begin the process
it appears that the next step in this process is to have mike terraso contact michael adewumi
david roensch and i will be available to feed technical and operational information to adewumi for his modeling input
it may also be in the best interest of this project to see a team of technical and operational experts from enron and transwestern begin a brain stroming of this project during the data input stage to address issues related to the field cleaning trials
both of the pipeline system and the c/s piping
by working through the process
we may be able to alleviate some potential concerns and increase the cleaning success
although transwestern has been involved in this type of cleaning for a number of years
based upon the liquids data results
the system has met with variable success
the more technical and operational information we can incorporate into the model
the better will be the modeling conclusions and results of the cleaning activity
a meeting was held at c/s 0
laguna on tuesday november 0th
to reintroduce the pueblo of laguna to transwestern's environmental activities at the facility
the laguna's have hired an environmental person to oversee environmental issues on pueblo lands
the meeting centered around three issues
a ust site which had been removed
but not formally closed
a historic removal of asbestos which had been buried at the facility in the late 0's
and the ongoing groundwater remediation at the site
transwestern provided a history of the above mentioned activiites and why these issues were unresolved in the
eyes
of the laguna
transwestern committed to submitting closure requests for the ust and asbestos issues
with repsect to the groundwater issue
a presentation was given enlighting the laguna representative of the difficult nature of the subsurface geology and groundwater characteristics to rapidly clean the contaminants
chlorinated solvents and pcb's
and transwestern's intent to continue its remediation efforts
transwestern assured the laguna environmental representative that all correspondance and data pertaining to environmental issues would be submitted to the pueblo agency
at the conclusion of the meeting
the laguna's understood transwestern's commitment to maintaining the policies and practices consistent with the pueblo of laguna
the meeting provided transwestern and the laguna's with the opportunity to meet and share ideas and opinions and initiate working relationships
the laguna's now have an understanding of the environmental activities at the site and what transwestern's approach is to removing the contaminants
the laguna's appreciated transwestern's efforts and commitment to environmental compliance on the laguna pueblo
jim
yes you will need a usgs
i think its time that we did a maintenace spot check on the white units at the above referenced facility
to stay in line with the operating conditions of the facility permit
it would probably be a good idea to check on the emissions status of the whites at the same time
the state of texas conducted an air quality inspection of the nng seminole c/s
there were no deficiencies or violations identified at the facilit during the inspection
the state of new mexico air quality bureau conducted an inspection of the transwestern atoka no

i do appreciate it
for those teams that have turbines installed after 0 and/or for those turbines which have undergone power unit changouts
the following recordkeeping and monitoring conditions apply
0
daily recordkeeping of nitrogen and sulfur must be taken of the fuel gas which supplies the applicable turbine
s
0
this recordkeeping consists of electronic recording
gas chromtograph for nitrogen and delmar or equivelant for sulfur
or stain tubes may also be used for sulfur
these daily records include measurements on saturdays and sundays
0
the measurement must be taken at the location
an exception to this is that the nitrogen and sulfur measurements may be taken upstream or downstream of the applicable turbine facility provided that there are no natural gas deliveries into the pipe which would interfere or dilute/increase the measurements for the applicable turbine fuel gas
0
fuel gas records in hard copy form or equivalent for the nitrogen and sulfur must be maintained at the facility or at a central location for easy 0
a turbine facility may waiver out of this nitorgen and sulfur daily recordkeeping requirement by obtaining a custom fuel monitoring schedule
cfms
from the epa
approval of a cfms allows a greatly reduced recordkeeping and reporting for nitrogen and sulfur
cfms requests have been submitted for the following facilities
plains turbine c/s monument c/s crawford c/s bloomfield c/s approvals have not as yet been obtained
until issuance of a cfms
an applicable facility is required to continue daily sampling for nitrogen and sulfur
facilities which have received cfms from the epa include
please be advised that there may be certain reporting requirements that might be required for each cfms
i would strongly advise that the la plata and panhandle teams review their cfms and include reporting dates into mcs
so that the deadlines and reportings are not missed
if you have a turbine facility which is subject to the nitrogen and sulfur reporting requirements and would like to reduce the reporting burden

mike i wanted to give a short update on the latest events related to the pcb issue with pg&e
transwestern met with pg&e this last wednesday with an agenda that included some sharing of sampling results collected downstream of their first c/s
topock
and on out west toward their main distribution areas
with respect to the most recent sampling data
low pcb concentrations
n.d
to 0 ppm
have been detected in drips and interconnects between topock and hinckley c/s
the good news is that pcb's have not been detected downstream of hinckley which is approx
0 miles from the topock c/s
pg&e has also initiated construction and installation of some drips and small separators at locations where their gas feeds into other lines or directly into customers
the proposed installation date for the large mainline filter separators is still on target for 0/0/0
now for the bad news
at the conclusion of the meeting
pg&e has stated that they want their topock c/s decontaminated
this includes all piping and equipment
i stated to them the impractabibility and zero success rate of removing all the pcb's from their system and that there would be no quarantees that the deconning would be successful
the contract pcb deconning companies only have permits which would guarantee cleanup to 0 ug
they were told that it would be impossible to clean everything and that in all probability the pcb concentrations would be showing up as the gas continues to move through the system
additionally
the better remediation approach would be to continue to remove pcb containing liquids at strategic locations
even with this
they were pretty insistent that their management wanted the facility cleaned
preliminary $$ estimates range to approx
0-0 million
i think that this is only the
tip of the iceberg
if they are successful with this action
the pipeline system will be next
their pipeline is not piggable and to make it such would require replacement of pipe
valves etc
ill keep you informed on this
michael
our liquids data collections have been pretty lean
its only been in the last couple of months where we have actually collected any arsenic data
i will send to you what data have have with respect to arsenic
including some historic reserch in the abo field of southeast new mexico where the arsenic is generated from down hole
the source is not so much from what is coming out of the wells
catalyst towers were installed in the late 0's to trap the arsenic
as the residual which has collected in the pipeline prior to the installation of the catalyst towers
as a reminder
the state of texas requires releases of natural gas greater than 0 mscf to the atmosphere
in a 0 hour period
to be reported to the regional offices of the tnrcc
these releases include but may not be limited to the following
esd's
startups
shutdowns
pipeline ruptures and maintenance activities
should any of the above activities release natural gas in excess of 0 mscf
a written notification should be faxed to the regional office of the tnrcc within the following timeframes
unanticipated upsets
within 0 hours after the discovery of the upset
maintenance
startup or shutdowns
0 day prior to the expected exceedance
this reminder is being sent to all et&s teams within texas because in the last two northern natural gas compressor station inspections conducted by the tnrcc
they specifically requested backup data and reporting documentation of the natural gas releases to the atmosphere which were greater than 0 mscf
the agency's inquiry specifically addressed knowledge of compressor station venting for esd
start ups and shutdowns
it should also be mentioned that there has been inconsistencies in the tnrcc's position regarding this issue
however
until a position has been adopted by enron's gpg
i am recommending that each facility comply and report as appropriate

just a short note to let you know that i received a call from rod bosche of pg&e apprising me of a meeting pg&e will be having with sw gas this tuesday
they will be discussing pcb issues and the sampling results from the pg&e system
from discussions with louie
a media statement is being prepared by them which louie has a copy of
the statement is a little harsh and makes some statements which are incorrect
louie and i are planning to attend this meeting in las vegas to possibly assist in making some suggestions about rewording their statement and provide some additional insight and history on the transwestern system with respect to pcb's
the results of this meeting will be forwarded at a later date
steve
you have been given all the written permit history and portable analyzer correspondance from myself to and from the state of new mexico
all of my air permit files were copied and sent to you previously
if there is confusion
i apologize but everything that has been agreed to by the state of new mexico has been made available for review and use
if i need to sit down with you and or others to go over this
let me know

i spoke to ralph and he gave me an open week of april 0th in san francisco
he thought that one day would be more that adequate
i need to have somebody contact the pg&e side for their availablity during that week
should i or someone else contact rod bosche or let louie do this from his end with our legal contacting their legal
some of the highlights that i had requested to ralph for his presentation was the following
pcb's are a contaminant
just as benzene is
which occurs naturally in the gas
health issues of pcbs in pipeline are not a concern especially from a customer and employee standpoint
the name pcb lends itself to public outcry of the unknown
removal of pcb's is best accomplished by managing liquids
not deconing fiilter separators are a proven method of pcb removal transwestern's proactive assistance with socal on their system to manage their pcbs most pipelines on the east coast have pcb's and no adverse environmental impacts have occurred michel nelson
a meeting was held with the roswell team at c/s no 0 discuss roles and responsibilities of the title v operating permit for the corona c/s
the sale of the tw crawford c/s has been cancelled
a permit revision was requested to the air quality bureau to transfer the new permit to the existing facility to keep intact the ability to conduct turbine power unit replacements without agency notification
preparations are in place for the forthcoming meeting between pg&e and transwestern over pcb issues on their mainline

will make a presentation concerning socal's experience with pcbs on mainline and ldc systems and present it during the 0/0 meeting in san francisco
the annual certification for the atoka no
0 c/s was reveiwed for completion and submitted to m

we may have to petition the teams for theri analytical

this is the public notice for the groundwater remediation at the tw north crawar facility
because we are emitting emissions to the air from the contamination in the groundwater
we had to have a permit
larry
as per our conversation
presented below are the emissions factors provided by the state of colorado for the t-0 centaur under permit tsp 0.0/mmscf nox 0.0/mmbtu co 0.0/mmbtu voc 0.0/mmbtu formaldehyde 0.0/mmbtu as you already know
the emissions factors for the centaur 0h turbine under permit 0lp0 can be found on page 0 of this permit which was issued on remember
the state has given us until may 0 to have the rolling emissions calculations completed for both turbines at the facility
george/norm because there is no immediate concern or liability with the partially filled excavation
i want us wait for the official letter from the tribe before taking it upon ourselves to fill the excavation
i dont want to send a message to the lagunas about us taking environmental matters into our own hands without involvement from the tribe
if there is a reason to expidite the covering of this open area
then lets send another letter requesting to do so
given the other issues yet to be resolved at the station
lets keep the tribe involved and a part of our environmental activities
i want to maintain a good working relationship with these people
as you may remember
they were a little irritated by transwestern's neglect of not keeping them in the loop previously
lets not open that type of issue again
george robinson
will do
thanx george for the update
norm would you mind visiting with ms
bernacik and explaining to her the difference between the excavation area where the underground tanks were removed and the landfarm area
if need be we can write her another letter requesting the closure and backfilling of the underground storage tanks
george robinson
received the
permit by rule
approval for the turbine power unit changeout for the keystone c/s
the emissions testing results for the plains turbine station was submitted to the tnrcc
discharge renewal applications for c/s no
0 and monument turbine c/s were submitted to the ocd
notification to the new mexico aqb was given for the power turbine changeout at the atoka no
0 c/s
one employee was skill verified for level ii environmental during the routine weekly sampling of the pg&e system
it was discovered that approx
0 oz of liquid had collected in the new filter separator in the pg&e c/s yard
a request was made to analyze the liquid for not only pcb's but also ph to determine if the liquids resulted from the caustic and water cleaning of the upstream portion of the pipe leading into the pg&e c/s
this is the first occurance of liquids at this location since this new filter separator was installed and put inot service
the title v air permit for c/s no
0 has been issued
there are some requirements and conditions under this permit that the team should be aware of and will be required to comply with
i would like to visit with the team at their safety meeting in june or july to go over the conditions of the permit
please give the the dates in june and july when your next safety meeting is
this title v presentation should last about 0 hours
during the quarterly conference call with socal in which we discuss pcb costs on the socal system
for which transwesten is 0% responsible
ralph komai
socal's pcb person provded some addtional information with respect to what is going on with the pcb activities on the socal system
as a result of the pg&e press release
socal management directed additional sampling to be done at their interconnect with transwestern and downstream of this interconnect
ralph reported that a number of liquid samples came back at around 0 ppm
however one sample at their kelso station
near barstow
came back at 0 ppm
ralph had indicated that there has been an increase in the pcb's coming into their collection locations in the needles area as evidenced by the following
based upon 0 data
almost no liquids greater than 0 ppm were revcovered data collected in 0 showed that approx
0% of the liquids were greater than 0 ppm data collected in 0 showed that approx
0% of the liquids were greater than 0 ppm based upon this
ralph had stated that socal would be collecting additional sampling information and possibly entering into an internal montoring program
somewhat like pg&e is currently doing now
i had informed ralph that our needles m/s facility had seen almost no liquids in the last 0 years
other than a recent accumulation of a one time pigging in early 0 when a small volume of liquids
less than 0 gallons
had been collected
we discussed that the accumulations seen on the socal system were probably from existing liquids on their system which had collected in low points in their pipeline and were moving downstream due to the increased flows from tw into socal
ralph gave the impression that there were no immediate management tensions resulting from the recent
hits
he just indicated that they would be watching their system and sampling at a more frequent basis
atttended the nmoga meeting in farmington
nm
it appears that the blm will implement its own noise criteria in areas within new mexico that are deemed sensitive by the blm
the proposed noise threshold will be 0.0 dba
a
there are no transwestern facilities in the farmington resource area which will be impacted by this proposed level
however the potential exists for several transwestern locations in southeast new mexico to be impacted
a meeting was held with the president of del mar
concerning the issues associated with the lead in their lead acetate tape for monitoring sulfur concentrations in the natural gas
a request was made to the company to determine the feasability of recycling the tape and eleviate the management and disposal issues associated with the tape as a hazardous waste
the quarterly socal transwestern pcb conference call was held this week
transwesten's share
0%
of socal's pcb management activities was approx
$0,0
due to the press release by pg&e concerning the increased occurance of pcb's into their system
socal has initiated increased sampling activities on their system and will be proposing to do additional monitoring to track liquids from transwestern's m/s into the socal system
preliminary sampling results at strategic liquids locations on the socal system has revealed hits of pcb's in the range of 0-0 ppm
although
a hit of 0 ppm was discovered
as a result of an isolated hit of pcb's into the new filter separator at the pg&e c/s in excess of regulated levels
a conference call was held the et&s vp to determine forthcoming activities with pg&e
a meeting has been scheduled at the pg&e c/s next week to reveiw sampling on the pg&e system and discuss the recent hit of pcb's in the f/s and what forthcoming activities will be conducted at the site
a meeting was held in laughlin
nv with pg&e to discuss the liquids which were received and analytical result of 0 ppm which occurred at the pg&e f/s
additional discussions centered around the latest migration of pcb's into the pg&e system and control technologies to stop additional migration of pcb's into pcb free portions of their distribution system
annual emission fees were paid to the adeq for c/s no

for my weekly report please use the following
provided environmental oversight and sampling for the cleaning and decontamination of the filter separator at the pg&e c/s
assisted the san juan team in preparing for the forthcoming consolidated audit in july
witnessed the post noise surveys for the gallup and bloomfield c/s's which were ferc requirements under the 0c certificate for construction
leo nichols
as a result of the latest meeting with pg&e over the greater than 0 ppm pcb liquids collection at the pge topock c/s filter separator
f/s
presented below is a summary of the deconning and sampling activity which occurred vector was instructed to use a high caustic detergent
cimclean
as the cleaning agent for removing pcb's from the topock f/s
0:0 cimclean:water mixture
diesel was not used in the deconning process
the only equipment cleaned by vector was the pg&e f/s
transwestern's filters in its separator were replaced
but no cleaning or deconning was perfromed to this unit
the filters were also replaced in the pg&e separator
the following samples were collected during this project
on the transwestern side
0
wipes
0
of the interrior body of our filter separator after the filters were removed
large areas were wiped to determine presence/absence of pcb's
not 0 sq

0
a composite sample of a used filter removed from the upstream separator at the selexol plant
the filters appeared to be exceptionally clean 0
composite sample of the fine powdery rust which had collected in the bottom of the f/s
approximte volume one cup
0
composite sample of the used filters from the f/s
visible appearance of the filters removed from this vessel showed them to be clean and virtually unstained
a small discoloration was present on the ends of each filter confirming that the filters were sealed properly in the f/s
0
a sample of an unused clean stocked filter
this was a control sample
on the pg&e side
0
a liquids sample of the residual in the upstream leg of the topock filter separator prior to deconning
approx
volume one cup 0
sample of the solids
fine

which had collected in the f/s
an estimate of the volume of this material removed form the f/s prior to deconning was approximately one gallon
0
wipe samples
0
of the interrior of the f/s prior to deconning
not 0 cm sq

0
used filter media from the f/s
the operation of the f/s filters are designed to be a twice pass through of the same filter
composite samples were collected of the upstream and downstream portions of the filters
0
wipes
0
of the deconned filter separator interrior walls
the only inconsistency observed during the cleaning and inspection process was the volume and buildup of the black fine powdery hydrcarbon material which was present in the f/s at the topock c/s and conspicuously small amount of rust colored material which was present in transwestern's f/s
as previously mentioned
samples were collected of both materials
the only difference between the two locations was the color of the materials and the volume
it is suspected that the deconning activity conducted in august of 0 loosened hydrocarbon solids present in the 0 feet of pipe which had over time moved and collected in the pg&e f/s
the small amount of rust materials observed in the transwestern f/s is the result of the pigging activity from the selexol plant into the transwestern f/s
i will have reprensentataive samples of both materials
photographs were also taken of the cleaning and inspection activities and will be available for review at the forthcoming meeting in flagstaff with on the 0th of july
analytical results will also be completed at this time
thanx

luepp
we should be aware of the positives and negatives
the positives being the information which steve and company will collect
this appears to be a very useful tool
there is also is no permit emission limits associated with the permit at this facility
there also exists the potential to pay lower emissions fees should this investigation show that the emissions from the units to be significantly lower than what was placed into the permit application
the downside to this effort is that the data we collect may in fact show that our emissions fees which we have been paying actually under estimate those submitted in our application and we would more than likely be held accountable for the difference
0 to the present
additionally
enforcement action could result by the navajos
i say this to apprise everyone of the positive and negative potentials involved in completing this study
from the emission estimates which were placed into the permit application we included a defendable buffer or excess of emissions to account for variations in the temperature
humidity
engine age and poor engine mechanics should they exist
and finally
we have the unknown of not knowing what the three units actually emit
these units have never been tested
this uncertanty in itself may be the driver to know so as not to have a situation which was similar to what happened at atoka no

i received a call from ralph komai
pcb engineer with socal
about a pipeline liquids collection socal wants to take at our needles facility
ralph said that socal will be undertaking a study on their pipeline to determine why the concentration and liquids volume of pcb's has reduced into their system in the past couple of years
0-0
i shared with ralph and up until this year
we have not had liquids at the needles facility since 0
he stated that they have seen reduced concentrations and are curious as to why this trend is occurring
sounds like good news to me
he said that their data shows the following
0 liquids concentrations only 0% regulated at the federal level 0 liquids concentrations only 0% regulated at the federal level ralph has requested that socal be allowed to collect a liquids sample at the needles m/s and i have contacted the needles team about assisting socal with the collection
i would expect that this may have implications with respect to slight increased billing for analytical charges that socal will be charging us for and we reveiw on a quarterly basis with them

sherry
can you help sherry with this set-up
looks familiar
i want to bring interrested parties up to date on the issue of replacing the fuel mixers with carbuerators at the spraberry plant
it seems that this replacement was performed only as a fuel savings activity and that there would be no increase in emissions or horsepower as a result
according to the tnrcc
they will allow this activity provided that the above is true and that we prove that emissions and horsepower will not increase
to do this they have requested that we conduct an emissions test on one of the units with the mixer on and then with the carbuerator on as a condition of their approval
ie before and after testing
i am going to request that we be allowed to do the testing with a portable emissions tester
which has been verified in side by side testing on new mexico units as opposed to bringing in a third party referenced testing company
contractor testing runs about a condition of all permitting issues is that the carbs are not supposed to be installed on the units
preconstruction
until approval has been given by the agency
in this case
we will be allowed to install a carbuerator on the one unit to be tested but not on all units
should testing show other exceedances
emissions or hp
in addition to fuel savings
this will trigger actions requiring perimtting
under the circumstances
i think it would be in the best interest of nng to know for certain that we have not violated the grandfather status of the units and that if our activity requires permitting
we comply immediately
i am sending out the letter request to the tnrcc today
if approved
we should test asap
remember
that sampling ports in the exhaust stack of the unit to be tested will need to be constructed prior to testing
let me know if the team will need a diagram showing the sampling port locations
a phase i due diligence was completed for eott on two liquids pipeline segments in the texas panhandle and in northwestern colorado
the assets are owned by equilon pipeline company
a copy of the findings have been submitted to legal
there were some deficiencies and potential liabilities discovered as a result of this activity
assisted the roswell team in the preparation and completion of the 0 month and 0 title v certification reports for the roswell c/s
no deficiencies or non compliance issues were identified for this 0 month period
annual certification reports were submitted to the tnrcc for 0 transwestern and 0 northern natural gas c/s in west texas
there wer no deficiencies or non compliance issues identified for any of the 0 facilities during this 0 month period
the tnrcc reviewed the emissions testing report for the nng plains c/s and requested modification to the original report submitted
the testing contractor was contacted and a revised report was submitted to the agency
i received word from the tnrcc that they will allow a portable emissions test at the spraberry c/s to confirm that the replacement of the fuel mixers with carbureators will not cause an increase in emissions
i will send out the letter today to the tnrcc reqesting written approval to do the testing
i would strongly recommend that the spraberry team have the sampling ports installed on the unit that they select to be tested and have this testing completed asap
remember
the unit selected must be tested with the fuel mixer on and then remove the mixer and conduct a test with the carbureator on
whoever performs the portable emissions testing will need to ensure that we follow a portocol that i will submit to the state
i'm going to be out tomorrow

i received a call from a permit engineer with the arizona dept
of environmental quality
adeq
concerning the issue of notification of mechanical activities at c/s 0 flagstaff and a mandatory 0 day wating period for agency review and approval
due to the urgency of the c/s 0 work being performed
i had written a notification to the agency friday evening requesting approval to initiate the activities detailed in the scope of work which was included with the letter
on monday
the engineer called and said that he had read the letter and had no problems with the activity proceeding at the c/s
after we had discussed this issue at some length
i posed the question to him of whether it was necessary to notify the agency of mechanical and maintenace activities which will not impact or change a combustion units throughput
fuel use
emissions
horsepower
or cause a change in design
after some discussions i informed him that transwestern will probably inundate the agency with notification letters
he stated that as long as the engines operating parameters would not change
horsepower
emissions
throughput
fuel use etc
and the burden of responsibility will rest on transwestern to ensure that no permit conditions are violated
he stated that we may proceed with these types of activities in arizona without any notification to the agency
the only hitch being
that when transwestern does a major mechanical activity
which would cost more than 0-0% of the cost of replacing a unit
that we provide them a courtesy notification
i told them we would apprise them of such an activity

just a short note to let you know whats going on at bakersfield
i have spoken to the agency inspector about one of the nov issues and have been told that eott will definately receive a an nov and fine for failure to conduct the emissions testing on a heater that apparently should have been tested approx
0 months ago
with repsect to the other nov issue
rick suderman had a testing company in to perform emissions testing on another heater which was required to be tested by today
as the testing contractor began his testing
an 0 issue developed with the equipment the testing company was using and a miscommunication on the part of the testing contractor was directed to rick
as a result
the the inspector observed elevated co readings from the heater that rick had made adjustments in the heater set points
based upon recommendations from the contractor
causing the elevated co readings to result
the inspector stated that the facility would receive another nov for this exceedance
in any event this isssue was not rick's fault and was due to some bad communication on the part of the contractor
we have sent the testing company home and will be bringing in another testing company
aeros
on thursday
this is the contractor who has done the majority of the previous emissions testing for the facility to complete the heater testing and substantiate the innaccuracy of the first testing company's data
with this new data
we shold be able to demonstrate inaccuracy in the first testing company's qa/qc
it should also be mentioned that we have identified other environmental issues which we should discuss at your convenience
butch and i will have completed the permit compliance investigataion and be available for discussions on friday

i wanted to present this summary of the meeting transwestern had with representatives of the laguna pueblo concerning the status of the pcb remediation activities by tw
on the laguna side were members of the laguna pueblo
the peop a technical oversight group that provides expertise and assistance on technical issues for all of the 0 pueblos in new mexico
ranging from ust to superfund
and members of ets
0 members of the laguna team
butch russell
rick smith
advisor for the laguna team
myself
and george robinson
this is the third meeting we had in the last year and a half with this group since the lagunas have started showing renewed interest in environmental activities on their pueblo
the meeting centered around two issues at the site
the closure of the ust and the pcb remediation activity
with respect to the first
concensus was reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples at the two downstream well locations from the ust site on a quarterly basis
and send the results to poep for review
with repsect to the pcb remediation issue
things were a little different
the poep representatives expressed concern on behalf of the laguna tribal coucil that the progress of the remediation activities transwestern is presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals toward achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the lagunas have verified this
they indicated that that have been patient with transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the pcb contamination
but based upon the historic sampling results
that this technology is not proving to be very successful
in fact the results have shown stagnant results
im using their words
they would like to see transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup and closure of this site
members of the laguna pueblo
who work for the poep
expressed concern that the pcb contamination could negatively impact future generations of lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their lands
one member of the laguna pueblo called the contamination a
cancer
with potential to spread
a comment was made by the poep that there was a major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination if we continue to just maintain our present approach of just monitoring the site and installing additional wells
a member of the poep has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from north dakota state university
energy and environmental research center
who claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered difficult to remediate
this site would certainly fall into this category due to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and channels present which direct the pcb containing liquids present at the site
although the poep was not recommending transwestern utilize their service
they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site with them
it shold also be mentioned that syed risvi
the poep superfund representative was at this meeting
he had mentioned that the poep has been in discussions with epa region vi concerning potential classification of the site on the cerclis list of sites for inclusion on the npl
he had indicated that he did not want to see this site included on the list
but stated that transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being done
at the conclusion of the meeting
i informed the poep that transwestern's internal remediation group would contact the ndsu group and discuss the site characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our discussions
this seemed to satisify the poep and they were content with this
john
i would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of people and discuss this issue
a couple of things i want to bring out
first
we will be undergoing row and compressor station renewals with the lagunas in the near future
second
on the laguna tribal lands
they have experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to this whole contamination problem
although we are considered by the poep as proactive up to this point and very easy to work with
direct quote from the poep
they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from transwestern to clean up the pcbs
please get back with me on this
this is a short note to apprise those that the before and after emissions testing for the fuel valves and carbuerator at the spraberry c/s has been submitted to t he tnrcc
the data showed fuel savings
as we had hoped it would and we also received an emissions reduction benefit
according to the agency
this replacement activity will not require an amendment to the permit
which will be a plus for the company
my compliments to all involved for the retesting and efforts it took to make this happen
i will forward the response from the tnrcc as it is received
rick
terry had informed me that solar had trouble with this unit in making its emissions guarantees
prior to shipping it to la plata
i was not aware of this when i permitted the unit.a couple of years ago
in an attempt to solve the problem
in november
i had submitted a modification to the permit to the state of colorado requesting additional emissions as it appears the unit exceeds its permitted levels during the colder months
i received a call form the state of colorado and they said they are hesitant to approve of more emissions for us
we reached an agreement with the state that they would remove the pound per hour limit and keep the ton per year requirement in an attempt to give us more operating room
the higher emissions months would be balanced by the warmer months which produce less emissions
however
after terry went through the calculations we were still exceeding the permitted emission limits when we calculated yearly limits
i dont know if solar might have sold us a bill of goods but based upon emisisons calculations
the unit cant stay under the emissions guarantees that solar promised
we have notified the state of colorado
as the permit requires and im sure they will be following up on this
let me know what solar says
see attached save for thursday

project you are talking about is a small project independant of rogas where a 0
line will be constructed from north coles and run above ground
if possible
to a tie in approx
0 mile away
we will need a waiver for this
there wont be any by pass crossing concerns and only ocal notifications due to the efforts to run the pipe above ground
the reason for constructing above ground is to minimize surface disturbance
im sure that one of the conditions of the approval for this construction actiivty is that eott wil be required to maintain integrity of the pipeline to ensure no releases
inspections
reporting etc

i had asked randi to complete an annual report for the f&g 0 permit
as i did not want to have this hang over our head when eott's 0 application was reviewed
this may be the annual report that were talking about
as you remember
the 0 requires an annual report for activities conducted for the prior year and it is due by jan 0th of every year
it was not been submitted for 0 or 0
because randi has been personally involved in all construction activities at the north coles levee facility
i thought she would be the prime person to complie the reports for us and then we would submit
if this is the annual report everyone is talking about
then
yes
i instructed her to do these
primarily
because she has been involved since the get go and she has the information
she has also promised the reports to me by 0/0 for sumibttal to the f&g
john shafer

this is a short note to let you know where we stand on the 0 mile pipeline construction rogas project with respect to environmental permitting and approvals
the following documents and applications have been submitted to the agencies
california fish and game 0 application kern county floodplain management agency-encroachment application us coe 0 nationwide permit
preconstruction notification reclamation board
encroachment application califonia state fire marshall-waiver to install aboveground pipeline office of pipeline safety-waiver to install aboveground pipeline i am checking to see what state requirements there are for shpo clearances for this project
i would suspect that they would want us to do a field survey prior to construction
it seems that every califonia state and county agency is a candidate for notification or approval
ill keep you apprised
john
i have attached the site characteristics for the 0 locations in az
where transwestern plans to install the four rb0's
with this information please provide emissions quarantees for each location
sta
0-0
we will use the same gas quality for each location
i have a meeting with the agency on the 0th of feb
and would greaatly appreciate the guarantees prior to this date
if possible
i am going to try and permit each site for 0 ppm nox as opposed to the 0 ppm nox number
so i would appreciate your assistance in this also

i want to bring this issue back up for your attention
as i know that everyone is very busy
during the epa title v inspection at the laguna c/s this past week
barbara bernacek
the laguna environmental person was present
she had been asked to be there by the epa
during our tour of the facility
she casually asked if any progress or decision had been made by enron management towards remediation assistance in the groundwater issue at the laguna c/s
i had informed her that we were still actively discussing this issue and would contact her in the near future concerning management's decision
i would appreciate it very much if each of you would revisit my memo below and then lets discuss what should be done and the approach we should take in addressing the laguna's concern about a proactive approach to reaching cleanup and closure
bill
the baseline noise surveys
which have been completed
were performed by hoover and keith out of houston
tx
i have a meeting scheduled with the permit engineers from state of arizona on monday to discuss the permitting for the two c/s on state lands
ive dealt with these individuals before
but the adeq has gone through some reg changes and i want to visit with them on that
after that meeting
i will decide who should do the applications
i have calls in to the person i deal with in the epa in san francisco for the two locations on the navajo lands
pending the outcome of each meeting
i will decide who to use
ive used argent in the past for both arizona permits and indian lands permits
and they would probably be my first choice
i am keeping mr
ayers involved in the permitting process and all changes or activities that impact the permits for arizona
one thing that i shold mention is that i spoke with phil lowery about his desires for this project
he has requested that the existing units at each station maintain operations for six months after the turbines have been installed to act as a backup in the event that the turbines temporary fail or to iron out any potential kinks
based upon the reduction in emissions from the existing mainline units
which will be permitted for a six month period
there will still be an overall major emissions decrease
after the six month period
the existing units will be abandoned in place and not be operated again
also
my intent is to permit these turbines at 0 ppm nox as opposed to the lower 0 ppm nox number to eleminate the problems that were originally encountered on the northern border system
if this was a new station
i probably wouldnt be allowed to use the 0 number
but seeing as how there will be a major decrease in emissions from shutting off the recips and using the turbine
this should be easy to do
the differrence in emission between 0 and 0 is not that great and it will allow the facilities in az a larger range of operation comfort as opposed to the 0 ppm number that rolls says they can do
but has had trouble reaching
one thing that has complicated the permitting is the elevation and temperature extremes at the locations
by permitting at 0 ppm
this will greatly help this
ill share the emissions numbers with you
when i receive them from rolls and the emissions info i have from the existing units
i have spoken to terry hacket about doing the f-0 document for the ferc submittal
and have been feeding him data and supporting information for the report
based upon the scope of work for the turbine installation
the f-0 report will be completed by march 0
is there something ive missed
this is a gentle reminder
and im sure that most are aware
but under no circumstances is there to be any construction activiy initiated for the turbine installation at the four mainline compressor stations
until the air construction permits are issued by the applicable air agency
construction activity is defined
but is not limited to roads
trenching activity
buildings
electrical poles etc
the state and federal agencies take a very dim view on initiating any attempts to initiate construction prior to approval
this approval is considered to be the air permit authorizing construction of the proposed activity
your assistance in this compliance issue will be greatly apprecaited
data generation and agency consultations are now in progress to expidite the permit submittals
should you need further clarification
give me a call

anything urgent we need to discuss
i wanted to let everyone know that the meeting between southwest gas and socal concerning presence of pcbs on the southwest gas system will be this tuesday
i had an opportunity to speak with ralph komai today during the pcb quarterly management conference call that transwestern has with socal to discuss pcb related invoices
as a brief summary
southwest has had isolated hits of pcb in liquids
0 and 0 ppm
and in wipe tests
0-0 ug/wipe
in regulators on their system and they have asked ralph if he would assist them in the management and disposal of pcbs on their system
he wil also be providing thoughts on how and why pcbs move in a gas pipeline
i had asked ralph not to mention about transwestern's agreement with socal for which transwestern pays socal for 0% of their pcb costs
i had asked him to only focus on the southwest system
apparently southwest is not up to speed with the pcb regualtions
however
enough so that they do realize that the mega rule will impact their operations and ralph will probably provide input for that as well from an ldc standpoint
i asked ralph whether southwest seemed excited or worried about the pcb discovery on their system and he indicated that they were more concerned about compliance with the pcb regulations
ralph said he will let me know the results of the meeting

i think i will pass on the meeting
please apprise me of anything i may need to know from the meeting
to bring you up to date on the environmental events of the turbine approvals in arizona
i received the rough draft of the baseline noise survey and you were copied
as discussed
we should address changes to the documents as the contractor has made some obvious conclusions and asumptions which are not valid or representative of what we would like to do or not do
i was contacted by the navajo nation and they have requested that we do onsite surveys at the c/s on the reservation
c/s 0 and 0
for t&e plants and animals and archeology
i have contacted a contractor and they will be on site to do the surveys at both stations
i am planning on having the entire c/s facility surveyed at both locations as there has not been a pin point location established as yet for all the construction and ground disturbance which will take place
in the event there might be changes after the survey is completed
surveying the entire facility will keep us from having the new distrubance areas surveyed after the original survey was completed
the f-0 environmental document for the ferc application will be submitted to donna by this friday
the air permit applications for c/s 0 and 0 have been started
i have a meeting with epa in san francisco to discuss permitting the c/s facilities on the reservation on 0/0
im going to try and move this meeting up if possible
after the meeting
i should be able to have an application in front of the navajo air permitting agency and the epa within a week
based upon experience with the state of arizona
epa and the navajo nation
expect permit approval within 0-0 months after submittal of the application
i was just informed by the navajo nation that prior to receiving approval from the agency fo rthe installation of the turbines
an archeology survey is to be performed at each compressor station site
be advised that an archeologist will be present at sta
0 on 0
0 this friday in the am and at sta
0 on 0/0 monday also in the am to conduct the required surveys
please have someone from each team present at each location during the surveys and allow access to the facility by the archeologist
the survey should only last 0-0 hours
donna
i spoke to the navajo nation about expiditing the report submittal once the archeological surveys have been completed and the nation said that under their current regulations
assuming that there are no cultural resources identified at either location
they are allowed 0 days to review the findings before they are required to issue the final report
she didnt think it would take this long
but said that due to existing surveys back logs
and personnel
it might
ill keep the pressure on
the navajo nation f&w has not returned my call about what they might require
birds of a feather
ill be persistent here also
and let you know when i find out something
byron as per the red rock expansion conference call today presented below are the emissions estimates for the auxillary engines at sta
0-0
understand these are not actual emissions
but are emissions based upon potential to emit
when these units were permitted actual testing data was not required
so each unit was permitted based upon an accpeted emissions limit from an epa approved document
this has worked out in our favor as the emisisons numbers presented in the epa document were high
therefore
this will allow us to net more emissions
if needed
emissions are presented for a single engine only in tons per year
even though there are two auxillary units at each facility except sta
0 where they only have one auxillary unit

the entire facility has not been disturbed
only most of it
id say approx 0%
the other 0% has been impacted but not tot the point of disturbing all the vegetation
just foot and vehicle traffic
i dont have problem with saying the above
but keep in mind
the facility has been there and just because the trees havent been disturbed
doesnt mean that the understory beneath the trees has been pristine
it has always been transwetern's policy to maintain an environmetnal presence at all of its locations
especially at sites where there is some aesthetic value
scenery wildlife etc
i dont have a problem with including resource reports 0 and 0 for vegetation and soils
i have received a verbal from the us fish and wildlife and they agreed with the intent in my letter to them that pipline activites at each location tend to preclude any impacts to sensitive or critical habitats
in addition
the adjacent lands are of the same habitat types as that which are contained within the facility and therefore
would not be an issue of habitat loss
there are not any old tw hands around to positively verify that the site was cleanred and there has been natural encroachment of the trees into the area
i seriously doubt it
again
tw tried to mantain a postive presence at each site
but did utilize the sites for their intended purpose
in arizona
we do not have a blanket approval for discharges of hydrostatic testwater
we do however plan to use new pipe and water supplied either from the closest city
ie flagstaff for station 0 construction
or from a drinking well source
in any event
we will test the water prior to discharge and ensure that the discharge will stay on the facility property to soak into the ground
i cant imagine that there will be large volumes of hydro water as we dont plan on installing a large amount of new pipe
if we need to discuss the above
give me a call
i spoke to john nystedt
the contact person for the navajo nation f&w service concerning the need to do endangered plants and animal surveys at the two c/s on reservation lands
i had sent to him the usgs quad sheets of the c/s sites for review
today he stated that he didnt think surveys would be needed at either location due to the fact that there had been historic disturbance at each location and that there was no sensitive habitiats in or near the c/s sites which would warrant surveys
however
because of the issue of tribal lands
he was going to discuss this issue with the navajo nation director and verify his opinion and he would let transwestern know on monday of next week as to what the tribes final decision would be
but he was almost sure that the trib would recommend no surveys
john has faxed to me the list of approved botonists and boilogists which are approved to do work on the reservation
i have contacted a number of individuals on the list and they are prepared to do the boilogical surveys next week in the unlikely event a survey is required
i spoke with ralph komai
pcb person with socal
concerning the swg meeting about pbcs on the swg system
as mentioned in the last note
swg has discovered pcbs and has been sampling to determine extent and movement into their system
swg receives gas from socal and pge at two separate and independent interconnects
liquids have been collected at the two interconnects from socal at concentrations of <0 and <0 ppm
respectively
they have taken approx
0 wipe samples and have had
hits
but nothing over 0 ug per wipe
in the meeting
swg has expressed aggressive interest to socal about the installation of filter separators at the socal/swg interconnects
they felt that the installation of separators would greatly benefit the reduction of pcbs into their system
becasue of this
ralph stated that swg would be sending him a proposal for the installation of separators at the two interconnect locations
i gave ralph earl chanleys phone number as he was involved in the separator construction project last summer with pg&e
maria
as per your request
please see the attached data
all the below figures were calculated using the 0 hp factor on the mainline
tcv-0 clark
units the mainline units
unit 0 is the auxillary engine and runs back up power
if needed
the year 0 was figured by kerry welch who no longer is with us
0
0
and 0 operating hours and fuel use numbers were calculated using the spread sheet that was provided by our mechanical analyst
the total throughput on condensate has been
0 gallons
for 0
0
0
and 0
this is due to the fact that our narutal gas supply changed in 0 to a more dry natural gas and therefore
there was no liquids associated with the gas
again i apologize the inconsistency in the data
we have had employee turnovers at the facility and different spreadsheets were used to provide the information to the epa
we are in the process of standardizing our data collections to eleminate this problem in the future
i hope this information will help in the permit review process
again please accept my apologizes in the data collection errors
thanx john
for the attachment
how did the presentation go
john
bill this is the latest on the environmental issues for the turbines in arizona
the arch surveys at stations 0 and 0 on the navajo reservation have been completed and nothing reportable was found or identified
each contractor is now preparing their reports and hopefully
will have them submitted to their mgt
for review in a couple of days and then issued to the forest service has given us permission to do the arch survey for station 0 on monday
the arch survey for station 0 is scheduled for tuesday
preliminary quotes for the surveys are $0-0.0 for both sites
the original word from them was 0-0 prior to giving approval
this was definatley a plus
still no word on where the turbine buildings are to be located and what turbine equipment is to be installed at each facility
ge or rolls royce
additionally
confirmed decisions have not been made as to what auxillary power will be installed at each location
wind

i received a call from the consultant who performed the archeology survey at stations 0 and 0
based upon the plot plan provided by construction
the archeology discovery at station 0 does not occur within the area of proposed impact
even though part of the discovery is within the facility fence
the report recommendation to the shpo by the archeologist will be that during construction activities in this area
an archeologist be onsite to monitor and ensure that the site is not impacted
they will also recommend that we fence the discovery area within our facility to ensure that future pipeline activities will not disrupt the site
i have asked that two reports be prepared for each site
one report for each station covering the construction areas and the other reports to include the entire 0 acres at each compressor station
all four reports will be submitted to bret fritch in omaha on monday

look at the attached draft of a letter i plan on sending to the laguna pueblo regarding transwestern efforts to date of finding new technologies to address and remove pcb contamination from the groundwater at the facility
you may remember
we had a meeting in january to hear the laguna's concerns that transwestern was not moving fast enough to clean up the site
this letter addresses our attempts to find a solution to the pcb problem
and that remediation technologies are not presently available to operate effectively at the site given the sites unique characterisstics
id like to send this out on friday or monday
david
nice touch with the nc
i sure john will have some ideas on how to best to get this thing going after the nc gets back with you
ill leave it up to mr
shafer as to his preference to have dinner with mr
smith during our june tour of the c/s facilities
good to hear that the team has bought in on supporting the nc by participation
if you want me to
i can put on a little presentation to the other 0 teams in arizona and see if we can get their support and participation also
let me know and we can do this at one of their safety meetings
david roensch
kermit team
i received a letter from the tnrcc concerning emissions fees that have not been paid for a facility called the
hendrick/wink tank farm
the letter was addressed to a mr
paul newman of eott
the letter stated that we may owe emissions fees for the facility
my question is
do you have such a facility in your team area
and what does it comprise
ie
number and size of tanks
throughput in 0
the tnrcc letter was dated march 0
0 and we are required to provide information to them within 0 days
i just received the letter today
help
i need something from you by this afternoon or tomorrow at the latest
kermit team
i really need your assistance on this
i received a notice from the tnrcc about the above facility
apparently
the emissions fees for the facility have not been paid for 0
in light of this
does this facility exist in your area of responsibility
please let me know
if so
i need the follwoing information asap to aviod an nov for the facility
size of each tank height and capacity number of tanks color of tank
s
and roof
s
fixed or floating roof if floating
internal or external primary or secondary seals how is tank loaded and or unloaded ie trucks
pipeline etc
relative vapor pressure if known monthly throughput maximum fill rate of tank how long does it take to fill tank
alison
have you found out anything about the above referenced
the deadline for submitting the fy 0 emissions fee is april 0
the tnrcc can levee a fine on the facility if we dont provide them with some informaiton pretty fast
your assistance in this will be appreciated
alison
better send me what you have via fed-x or fax
0
0-0
i have spoken to bill about this
we need to send a check to the agency to cover ourselves prior to the april 0 deadline
i beleive that eott is responsible for paying the fee
i have left a message with larry fensted and his associate ruth ann and expressed the need for the $0.0 check by 0/0
i am sending this notification to your department to seek a solution of halting and stopping inappropriate e mail materials which i am receiving
i have been requested by louis soldano
enron attorney for the gas pipeline group
to apprise you of this situation
the content of materials received
i consider offensive
and am sure it would also be considered objectionable and innappropriate by the standards of enron corporation
please be advised
that many times it is difficult to screen this material based upon the headings and titles that accompany the contents
consequently
innappropriate materials such as this are opened
i have accidently opened two such e mails by mistake and have received the
enron warning
that my name and mailbox will be or may be audited in the future and that my name has been placed in a file
because of this
i am extremely uncomfortable about future accidents occuring and more importantly
about the increased frequency and accessability of my e mail box to trash and questionable materials
i would appreciate your immediate attention in this matter
thank you very much

this is a short summary of the environmental findings that were identified during the records review conducted at the corpus christi koch facility offices on may 0st and 0nd of this year
all environmental records which were available in the file data room at the koch office were reviewed
assumptions were made that the environmental records were complete for all assets included in the sale
primary emphasis was placed on those environmental issues which are normally associated with a sale or purchase of assets dealing with distribution and transmission of crude oil
in particular
pipeline and tank farms were the most critical assets which were reviewed
based upon the data review
the koch assets were in compliance with the following
air permitting
permit by rule
standard expemtions
recordkeeping and fee payments were documented nsps recordkeeping and inspections for voc control on large crude oil tanks were documented oil pollution act-opa 0 plans had been prepared and were up to date sara compliance and reporting had been completed spcc plans had been prepared for each site which qualified under 0 cfr 0 spill reporting history and notifications to the state agency were available for review there are ongoing groundwater and soil remediation activities at one site included in the asset for sale
permits for the remediation activity is in place
hazardous waste notifications
annual reportings and fee payments were documented based upon the above review
there were no issues which could be identified which would be condsidered a major environmental limitation or would be a considered a major environmental liability
this statement is again based upon the assumption that all environmental information was present in the data room for the assets in question
it should also be stated that this analysis of koch's environmental compliance is based upon the fact that koch has not held back or provided false or misleading information or knowledge during their presentation or informaiton contained in the facility files
pending further development and interest of this potential purchase
a recommendation is made to conduct a phase i due diligence and site visit to each location to verify findings from the records review
also
due to the past history of koch's operating practices
it is recommended that contract conditions be implicitly stated that eott will not be held liable for discoveries of past deficiencies or releases of contamination which have occurred on any of the koch assets purchased
on behalf of eott
an environmental records review was completed for a block of koch crude oil pipeline assets located in south texas
there were no issues or environmental deficiencies identified during the review
a due diligence was recommended to verify confirmation of the housekeeping activities presented in the records review
the air permit modification for the la plata c/s was received from the state of colorado
this modification allows for additional emissions and fuel use as a result of a change in gas quality supplies in the san juan basin

randy
based upon the records review
this is the only issue that may be aproblem
if a tank has been moved to another location
it would trigger requirements which were enacted on the date of the relocation
for instancif a tank constructed prior to 0 was moved in 0
there would be emissions control requirements placed on the tank as required by the 0tank regulations
if the tank had remained at its original location
it would be grandfathered with respect to emissions
however
because the tanwas relocated
it is looked upon as being a tank constructed in 0 and subject to the 0 regulations and is no longer grandfathered
i was not given this information during the records review
so i dont know if any of the tanks apply
if any of the tanks fit into the above scenerio,eott or koch will be looking at some major $$$$$ to bring any subject tankinto compliance

louie/ed i know you guys are busy
but because of the emphasis enron places on ensuring that action items from consolidated audits are completed prior to the action item completion date
i really need to know how scott and i are to proceed on the subsurface drilling activities for potential contamination at the bakersfield fractionator
the scheduled completion date for six of the items is 0/0
i understand the there is an issue concerning koch's individual and shared responsibility for some of the issues identified during the audit
rich jolly has contacted me asking me when the drilling will begin
as he does not want to see us exceed the 0/0 date and have the items show up as deliquent in his region
whatever you can do to assist us in either initiating the investigations or placing a hold on the drilling would be greatly appreciated
ed
i would appreciate it very much if you would review the action item list from scott jones and choose which items are koch's responsibility and which items belong to eott
and let scott and i know
ill contact scott and have him send you the action item list for your review
as i had previously mentioned
scott and i have until 0/0 to complete the subsurface investigations and knowing which items are eott's and which are koch's would greatly help us
as scott's server is down
ill phone him and have him send you the action item list
again thanks very much

rick
can youcheck on this for me
louie
after the presentation michael gave
there were some issues about the data and predictions ie
like how much solvent do we really need to clean the pipeline and the injection intervals and locations
but not whether the solvent or technology would or would not work
the data did show that terpenoline does remove pcb's from pipeline
but because penn state was so deeply involved in the modeling study
and we were still under the pg&e thumb
it appeared to be in the best interest of tw to see it to the end
there wasnt anyone who had any better suggestions or ideas
the thought was that because of the amount of $$$$$$ we had previously spent
not to see it through would have meant 0 return for the money we had invested
and if it works
the money would have been wisely used
the real truth of course is when we do a trial run
i signed a six month extension to the contract for penn state
i sent out a memo on this
but not for additional $$$$$$
they needed the extra time to complete the modeling study and data evaluation
last summer/fall
tiny had been overseeing the operational side of this
ie terpenoline storage locations and coordinating injection points and the pigging activities
when the decision is made to begin the injections and pigging
tiny will be ready and waiting

it seems we have items of concern that were identified during the consolidated audit at bakersfield which were tied into a previous agreement with koch for which the action team did not know when the action items were prepared
the action dates are approaching and scott and i are having a hard time getting clearification on how to initiate getting the the action items started due to the responsibility of koch for some of the items
ed
the attorney for eott
will be requested by lou
to notify koch concerning their responsiblity
if this sounds convoluted
then you know as much as i
laguna and or moutainair team
because i dont know which team is responsible for the belen delivery point
would someone check on liquids at this location and if present
collect a sample and have it analyzed for pcb's
we're required to do this by the contract
if no liquids are present
drop lorraine and or myself a message stating such

any delays on this project are not from the env
matrix
i received the matrix from the team sometime last week
tuesday
thursday
when i was out of town on business
when i came back on friday
i completed the matrix and sent it back to the team
any delays on this issue are from the team
not from me
as i remember the project
it involved work on the right of way and therefore was covered by the blankets we have for shpo and f&w
there were no project delays in terms of permits or approvals
after reveiwing the documents entitled
baseline environmental investigation of arco north coles levee plant 0
rogas loading facility and associated natural gas pipeline systems kern county
california
and
report of preliminary asessment sampling north coles levee gas plant loading rack area tupman
california
it appears that the following areas should be investigated further to detemine horizontal and vertical extent of identified contamination from the above referenced reports
tank 0 area
total petroleum hydrocarbons glycol reboiler area
total petroleum hydrocarbons hot oil heater area
total petroleum hydrocarbons wash rack area
lead propane comp
area lead total petroleum hydrocarbons cooling tower area
chromates compressor area
btex lead in the
baseline environmental investigation
report
sampling was only conducted to an approximate depth of 0.0
i am not comfortable with basing decisions for further investigations on such a shallow depth
in leau of the fact that many times water soluble constituents may horizonatlly move vertically from surface shallow depths into the lower subsurface areas
this is indeed the case for chromates
i based my recommendations for metal concentrations on the federal rcra subtitle c hazardous waste target levels for metals and evaluated the tph and btex levels with the underground storage tank guidlines for california
there were references to a 0 document in the
baseline
report for specific parameters
but there may have been an update to target contamination level requirements since that date and therefore
i used 0,0 ppm which is a general action level for most states for total petroleum hydrocarbons
again
i did not evaluate the mercury or the loading rack issues
one last issue
as you know
identification of contamination is usually accomplished by sight observations of visible contamination
knowledge of processes and or history
report results of the surface contamination do not show there to be an immediate environmental concern
due to the age of the facility
there may be concerns which were not identified in the reports
however
based upon the locations of the preliminary samplings which were conducted throughout the facility
it appears that the information presented in the reports would be adequate to address suspected contamination at the facility
i spoke with ken jacobs
with the forest service in flagstaff
concerning his agencies approval for the turbine construction at station 0
as a condition of the approval from his agency
he has requested that all the ponderosa pine trees to be removed for the turbine construction activities be flagged for identification
after the trees have been marked
we are to then contact him so that he can visit the site and make an evaluation as to whether the forest service will charge us for the tree removal or whether no additional charges will be incurred as a result of the construction activity
the charges will depend upon the calculation of how many board feet of lumber there are in the trees which are flagged
as this activity is included in the time line for completion of all permits and approvals
please contact me when the trees have been tagged and flagged and i will contact ken jacobs so that he can make a site visit
byron/tiny
i spoke to ken jacobs with the forest service and have attached his e mail below concerning the forest sevice's choice for the building
i have informed him that our new piping and ancillary equipment will remain white which is consistent with the existing equipment
he had no problems with this
i also had asked him if there was a name for the brown which the fs uses on their signs and he did not know of a specific name
so i think the best thing would be to match as closely as possible
the forest service would like the new compressor building to be painted dark brown
the color should be close to the color that we use for our signs
call me at 0-0-0 if you would like to discuss this

ive heard from some of the teams but nothing from others
im under the gun as to finding out where the midland region is in term of permits and and environmental compliance and the only way i can begin to make the evaluation is to have the field data inputed onto the spreadsheet

the reason that you're having such a hard time making contact
is because the foundation is going through some changes in their management
they are having a big pow-wow this week to get things straightened out
the new ceo will be a person named ron marcoux
and i will be speaking with him next week
in the interim
i have been working out some issues with the new mexico/texas director and am scheduled to meet with the arizona director in a couple of weeks
its pretty exciting to see the support from others in enron
based upon initial contacts with the missoula headquarters and regional directors
habitat conservation efforts are where the foundation is placing a large part of its emphasis
ill keep you apprised of the partnership and how others can get involved after my discussions with the foundations new ceo

these reports are required even though the facility is not in operation
if you would like assistance in the preparation and submittal of each document
give me a call and we can set up a time to meet at the c/s to do each report
this should take about half a day
which hr is different

i just spoke with dan walker
vice president of development for the rocky mountain elk foundation about enron's initiative for a corporation partnership
after we had discussed our interest and desire and what opportunities are available with the foundation for enron
dan stated that will be visiting with the foundation's ceo next week and one of the issues to be discussed will be development of an mou or agreement between enron and the rmef
looks like things are beginning to progress
im having quite a bit of interest from some of the houston based enron employees about how they can get involved
any suggestions on how i can
advertise
opportunities within the corporation for employee involvement with the rmef
i'll change it in enpower
i just found out the group is fully staffed
going forward
they would only consider applicants with heavy experience
u have my permission to change it

i received a phone call from frank van ryn of koch
concerning the letter that was sent to him on 0/0
frank has stated that koch will be contacting arco concerning the two contamination issues
apparently koch has been indemnified by arco for the mercury issue and possibly the hydrocabon issue at well
in any event
frank said that he would be getting back with me in a couple of weeks to present a plan and initiate the cleanup
but wanted to discuss the issue with arco
i will keep everyone apprised on the progress
i dont know if you guys are doing this
but a requirement to your air permit states that the facility is to report the number of hours of operation each year to the air quality bureau for the catepillar generator
the report is to be submitted by january 0st of each year
if we need to discuss this
give me a call
i'm in for the night stuff
just tell me when and where
i changed it
the annual pollution prevention plans were completed and submitted to the state of arizona
these plans are requried for the three large quantity generators of hazardous waste in arizona
annual hazardous waste fees were paid and submitted to the state of new mexico for four facilities in new mexico
a conference call was held with houston legal and environmetnal affairs to discuss the alleged nov issued for the p-0 c/s which involved a turbine like for like replacement activity
data has begun to be collected to substantiate transwestern's position concerning the proposed action by the state of new mexico
a field trip was made to the air quality bureau to copy all files relevant to the p-0 c/s and will be delivered to the contract attorney who will be assisting transwestern with this issue
copies of the new mexico eott air permits were received

john some quick thoughts on agenda items for the meeting with pg&e
0
status of the mini filter separator installations at pg&e interconnect/delivery/receipt points
future thoughts/plans for additional separator installations
0
pg&e customer attitudes about potential pcb introduced into their equipment
any new customers with positive hits of pcbs
0
internal sampling activities
how far have pcb's spread into the pg&e system
wipe tests results versus liquids collections
a map would be nice depicting this
0
transwestern continues to be pretty much dry on mainline and extremely dry on the topock lateral
maybe we should have a little presentation showing liquids collected in the last year on the mainline and topock lateral
our commitment to keeping the pcbs as immobile as possible
0
we might consider sharing what we've learned from our pcb modeling study with penn state and what our future plans are
another tranwestern effort to show our commitment
john
if we plan on opening up our separator
has a decision been made to decon it or just clean out the hydrocarbon buildup and replace the filters
if we do decide to decon our separator and or theirs
we will need to line out a contractor to be onsite when we blow down the systems
id like to discuss possibly not using vector for this type of routene activity any longer
there is a company in farmington
nm
riley
that can probably do the job
as you know
this decon work is not rocket science and vector is $$$$$$$
although they do a good job
chew on these and if i think of any other additional topics
ill send them your way

i received from the tnrcc an nov letter for the above facility for failure to submit an emissions inventory for 0
this notification from the agency originally came to rick loveless by way of wayne brunette
i called the tnrcc and spoke to kevin cauble concerning the nov and he pulled the emissions inventory submitted in 0 for the facility
because voc's are the issue
i asked him what the emissions were for voc's on the 0 inventory
kevin stated that the inventory showed voc emissions of 0.0 tons/yr actuals and 0.0 tons/yr potentials
we discussed why eott would submit an inventory as it is not a major source and not required to
the only thing we could come up with is that eott may have anticipated an increase in throughput at this site and therefore
wanted to ensure that this facility was shown as a title v source
according to the phone records from the tnrcc for this facility
craig willoughby of entrix had requested that the faciltiy be kept on the list of facilities required to do inventories
i have a call into eott to determine whether increased throughput is proposed for this facility in the near future
in speaking with kevin
he suggested that if a determination is made that if there is to be an increased throughput that wont exceed the 0 ton/yr limit on voc's
or that throughput conditions remain approximately consistent with previous years
eott should provide written notification to the agency that this facility does not meet the applicability requirements of 0.0
emissions inventory requirements
and request that this facility be removed from the tnrcc mailings
should eott confirm the status of operating throughput to be below the 0 ton/yr voc emissions limit
i will make make written notification to the tnrcc requesting removal from the list
john
i was just thinking that if this deconning becomes a routene activity for us and pg&e
we might want to consider breaking in a company that is less expensive
can more quickly mobilize and get the same quality work product
vector
has to travel from ohio
deconning the separators becomes an internal washing job of the vessel
i will discuss this with tiny about possibly using someone else
tiny
do you think riley would be interested in tackling this issue for us and pg&e
as you know
they do not have a deconning permit from the epa
but with the new pcb rules in place
a permit is not necessary anymore to do deconning activities
how do you think pg&e will respond to us possibly using another contractor other than vector for the work
i suppose we can bring this issue up in flagstaff
mums the word on the pcb modeling issue
john
thanks for your guidance and thoughts
a meeting was held with the third party attorney who is providing assistance with the recently issued nov for the p-0 c/s over a like for like turbine exchange which occurred in 0
a history was given of the incidents which led up to the nov being issued and results of the meeting which transwestern had with the aqb in 0 which lead transwestern to believe that issue had been resolved
the calendar year 0 pcb annual document logs were prepared and submitted to each generator of pcbs on the transwestern system
training was given to the midland region over the correct completion and submittal of forms used to report natural gas releases to the tnrcc
the agency has updated and has become more stringent with respect to regional requirements for the reportable releases which are submitted to them
an incomplete form submittal by a compressor station facility near midland led to this emergency training being given
based upon a phone call with region 0 of the tnrcc
the agency stated that they will be issuing nov's to facilities that submit incomplete
upset/maintenance notification forms for reportable events
a newly revised rule

kevin
i apologize for not getting back to you sooner as i have been out of touch for the last week
i read john's message to you and agree with him that we should develop a formal plan to address how we will generate public support and address any future environmental concerns before they jump up and bite us
as you may know
flagstaff is one of those areas where there is much environmental support to keep the area as pristine as possible and there does exist a number of environmental groups which use this as their agenda to keep development to a minimum
i will forward to you a memo from david roensch
team advisor in the flagstaff area
of an article he found providing the active participation of the environmental groups in the flagstaff area
ive done some cusory inquiries as to land status and have polled the bureau of land management
state of arizona
state historic preservation office and the forest service which is the major landowner between flagstaff and phoenix
i have not heard back from all of agencies as yet
but will let you know if there are any glaring environmental concerns or if there appears to be trouble on the horizon
john and i have briefly traded thoughts on this project and we would like to take a more proactive approach
up front
with regard to public participation and input prior to breaking ground
its hard to deal with public issues when construction is underway
as for the $$$$$ for the environmental studies
you are correct in assuming that the existing portion of the project from bloomfield to flagstaff will require very little capital
as long as we limit and ensure our construction activities to the existing right of way
proceeding south from flagstaff to phoenix is where the initial expenditures will be the greatest
once the pipeline corridor is identified and staked
surveys will need to be completed for the following
threatened and endangered plants and animals
archeology surveys for bones
artifacts
relics etc
noise surveys should this portion of the project require installation of horsepower
the ferc will require an eis
environmental impact statement
and environmental report to be conducted
these activities include not only the environemntal issues but also things like socioeconomics
land use soils
geology etc
past consttruction projects has shown that third party involvement with this greatly expidites the process
john has eluded to this previously
due to the rough terrain and topography of the land south of station 0 into phoenix makes this project extremely hard to give an approximate dollar amount for the environmental baseline surveys and permits to be completed as the entire proposed right of way
0 miles
from station 0 into phoenix will need to be walked and surveyed by several people
i would rather wait until we can identify on a map the corridor route and send out proposals for each of the surveys to be performed on the pipeline prior to giving a $$$$ figure
however
because you need something for a preliminary budget estimate
i would recommend an amount of $0,0 to 0,0 for the baseline environmental work and this might be a little light
in the event the surveys identify something
please dont hold me too close to this number as it is a wag contingent upon a number of variables that are relatively unclear at this time
having the pipeline corridor identified on a map will greatly assist in the environmental budgeting for this project
kevin
as promised
attached is the information that was found by david roensch on environemntal perspectives in the flagstaff area
george
dave cobrain of the nmed has verbally approved of the soil characterization work plan which you submitted to him for review and has said that we can begin work as soon as the plan is approved by the ocd
i have not heard from bill olson of the ocd yet
dave was going to inform the ocd that their office has given approval of the plan and that this might expidite bill's review process
ill let you know when i hear from the ocd
today i spoke with jean calhoun of the arizona chapter of the nature conservancy about the proposed sundevil pipeline construction project
she was very cordial and appreciative concerning transwestern's proactive efforts to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies which may have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project
although the proposed route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established
she did offer some general
yet valuable information concerning the geographic area which exists south of flagstaff into roughly northern phoenix
the area south of flagstaff into phoenix crosses of three major ecological regions identified by the tnc with major biological diversity of plants and animals
the tnc has completed published studies on two of the regions
the tnc has requested that should this project be apporved
these publications be used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed prior to construction and approval by ferc
to the south and east of flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the verde river which is of ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species which live in and around the area of the river
this river could be impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction across arizona
i have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies
in addition to the tnc
and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the pipeline corridor route
part of this concern is due to the extensive and unique biological diversity of arizona
i think we will have a better handle on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and helpful the agencies assistance will be when identified areas are known

donna/arnold sorry about not making the conference call today
the state of new mexico showed up at my office this morning and made a surprise inspection at one of our c/s south of roswell
i felt the need to tag along with them
heres the way it is
the epa is required to address all federal concerns when they are the lead agency is a permitting issue
even when it comes to an issue like approving a turbine installation on previously disturbed ground
they are required to ensure compliance with the endangered species act
esa
this is not a new issue with the epa
im having the same thing happen to me by the epa i had called the epa in san francisco about the status of the air permits for the red rock expansion for c/s 0 and 0
the permitting engineer told me that prior to issuance of the permits
their air group would need assurances that the esa regulations are being adressed
i told the engineer that becasue c/s 0 and 0 are on the reservation and that the navajo nation has its own epa group
that the esa requirements are taken care of by the navajo nation epa
as you remember
the navajo nation verbally told me that surveys would not be requried on the compressor station sites for endangered plants and or animals
i gave the epa engineer the navajo nation fish and wiildlife contact and he said that he would give him a call and that he would also check this issue out with the legal attorneys with the epa
bottom line is that we are waiting for a response from epa as to whether surveys would be required or not
i told him that we were expecting the permits by the end of september and that if necessary
i would schedule esa surveys and circumvent this whole issue
he advised me not to do this
i think his decision had something to do with the epa usurping authority of the navajos and asserting authority on indian lands without indian consent
he said he would get back with me on this by friday as to whether their attorneys agreed that the jurisdiction of the epa on navajo lands when the navajos have an environmental agency which administrates these types of issues
im a little irritated that the epa didnt notify me about this when it first became an issue
but didnt pursue this as i didnt want to possibly delay issuance of the permits
ill send something out via email when i hear from the epa
change per settlement's request
began initial field confirmation of eott crude oil tanks and equipment in the midland region
five of the thirteen teams which have eott facilites have been inpsected and appropriate changes made to the database and spreadsheet
a meeting was held with the midland field teams which have title v facilities
to complete and submit the required annual certifications
all title v locations in the midland region were in compliance for this year
region ix epa has made a determination that prior to issuance of the air permits for the redrock turbine installation
transwestern is to conduct an endangered species survey of c/s's 0 and 0
a contractor has been contacted and the surveys will be completed prior to september 0th
this is not a new issue
as epa region vi
dallas required consideration of the endangered species act to be completed at the luguna c/s
which is on laguna indian lands
the title v permit will not be issued for the laguna c/s until the epa is satisified that endangered species are not a concern

i plan on grabbing not only a digital camera but also my video camera to handle the panarama part of the equations
in conversations with doug cebryk
it looks like the primary routes are interstate 0 and el paso's existing right of way south
i spoke with kevin hyatt about a possible route that exists south to a power plant between station 0 and kingman az
and then heading southeast into the phoenix area
but didnt know if the economics would work out
ive got ensr looking at other routes that might hold promise
i also plan on addressing what might be considered sensitive areas of potential impact
streams
rivers
riparian habitat
difficult terrain
population and critical habitat issues etc
ill have a report to you shortly after the trip

ruth
i spoke to the adeq about the accelerated permit program and apparently there are some internal problems with this program and the third party contractors which are on their
list
at this stage of the game
they recommended that we do not resort to this alternative as most of the work that the contractor would do has been done by the adeq allready
i then indicated that i would be contacting the director of the adeq about the urgency of this multi million dollar project and the benefits to the state of arizona
the permit engineer thought that would be a good idea
because we will be permitting through this agency again for sundevil
and dont want to upset the agency cart
i am going to speak with the permit engineers supervisor and then to the director of the adeq next week about either an accelerated issuance of the permit or more realistically
allowance to do some construction activities while the adeq is completing the review and permit writing
this way
i wont step on any toes
by the way
the adeq said that they dont consider this to be a psd issue
the following time line for permit issuance under the arizona laws at this stage appears to be
another 0-0 weeks to write the permit
one month by the adeq technical staff to do the required internal review and then the epa is given a one month period to do their review
which is requried by the epa for all class 0 permit applications in arizona
because im going to be in phoenix next week
i might be able to set a meeting up with the adeq director and plead transwestern's case
ill let you know how it goes
john
i look forward to you being there
hopefully
for both days
your presence and participation shows the field teams the environmental commitment from houston
concerning the agenda
the first day is devoted to presentations
the second moring will be devoted to a
surprise
participation at a local compressor station about 0 miles west of albuquerque
i havent spread this around yet
except to rich jolly and got his ok
but i plan on dividing the guys into groups of 0 and having them conduct an investigation/audit of the compressor station
i plan on setting and hiding some placebo environmental issues the night before at the station to see if they can discover them and other housekeeping issues the next morning during the audit
we will then convine back at the hotel in the afternoon to discuss what they found and how they would address the issues identified
the group that identifies the most issues
will get a small gift
do i need your approval on the spending of some $$$ for a gift
i was thinking of a couple of $0 gift certificates for the two winners at a big sporting goods store and let them choose what they want
the final afternoon session will be devoted to mock environmental situations under varying circumstances
like we did last year with the whole group being divided into four individuals and participating as teams
thoughts comments
he did not
but he did predict your homosexual preoccupations
dan
sorry about taking so long it getting back to you about this
but i had a couple of crises i had to address
im still realing from the impact
i have attached for your review the agreement which we are in the process of finalizing with the wild turkey federation
take a look at the document and let me know what you think
after your review we can make the necessary changes and modifications
i have been advised by our legal department that each of the three major pipelines owned and operated by enron will need a separate contract
with the rmef
so what we decide for transwestern
will undoubtably work for the others
thanks for your patience in this
after the telephone conference call we had on 0/0
i contacted the roger kohn permit engineer with epa about a possible meeting with his agency to resolve and assist the issuance of the air permits for stations 0 and 0
his message back to me was a reiteration of the last request i made to him
that he could see no way that transwestern would be able to help the epa in this matter
we discussed the possibility of transwestern contacting his supervisor
gerardo rios
about a potential meeting and he indicated that we could choose this avenue if we desired
gerardo's telephone number is 0-0-0
shudeish with the state of arizona just phoned and said that he and probaht baragava are available to meet with us on thursday at 0:0 pm
this is the only time and day of this week that they will be able to see us
i asked about whether kathy oconnell and nancy wrona would be able to attend this meeting and he stated that their calendars were full this week and would not attend
he will need to know by tomorrow whether to book this meeting and who will be attending
sarah had mentioned that thrusday was not a good day for her
should we schedule this and if so
who will be attending in sarah's place
would you please check on the status of this expense report
the last entry i had on it was 0/0/0
0 days ago
my amex bill will be charged interest if i dont receive a check in the near future
your assistance in this will be greatly appreciated
dave
could you send me a hard copy of the transactions in question
i tried to pull them up on the website but i guess it doesn't keep records that far back

seminole and brownfield c/s's were submitted to the tnrcc
a conference call was held with region ix epa to discuss redrock expansion issues related to the issuance of title v air permits for sat
0 and 0 which are on indain lands
the agency provided a tentative date of 0 weeks before the the permits would be issued
the epa has required transwestern to respond to issues related to the endangered species act prior to issuance of the air permit
transwestern is in the process of preparing a biological assessment for the properties within the facility fences of stations 0 and 0
a meeting was held with the arizona deq to discuss what activities transwestern may participate in to assist the agency with the issuance of the air permits for station 0 and 0
the agency gave a date of april 0 as a normal issue date
even under expidited conditions the date is expected to be mid december of this year
transwestern plans on actively pursuing adeq's management to determine if the date for issuance can be further decreased
on a side note
under the current arizona regulations
certain construction activities can begin in leau of receiving the permit and include
foundation construction
laying underground piping and consturction of permenant underground structures
this wil benefit the inbitiation of the redrock construction prior to receivng the air permits for these stations
rawlins pump station was struck by lighting

thanks scott
i heard about the same thing
and was checking futrher to see if this was actually the case
scott
i shold probably clearify something
the existing right of way
which we intend on staying in
at least around cordes junction is located west of i-0
which will not impact the agua fria national monument
which occurs on the east side of the interstate
should we be forced to move to the east side of i-0
then the monument may become a problem
like you
i was taking into consideration all possible issues in the pathway of the proposed construction and also those that are in the near proximity and have the potential of becoming an
opportunity
in the event we are forced to deal with them
i appreciate your wirk in this
hi
have you had a chance to talk with kevin or dana about my moving over to scheduling
if not
should i approach them with my request
larry
roger
thats great that the public notice for station 0 and 0 air permits will initiate on october 0
i really appreciate your work and effort on this
i will be looking forward to reviewing the rough draft for both of the permits during the first week of october
john
we are working out some issues with the station 0 permit and the epapermits for 0 and 0
briefly here they are
first issue
that we did not anticipate from the adeq
it applies to hoursof operation for the generator
the adeq has restricted hours of operationbecause we are close to the psd levels at the facility
in talking to shdeish
the adeq protects itself and applies a 0% safety factor on all applications that approach psd to ensure that the psd levels are not triggered
this is there policy not regulation
what is ironic is thatthey accepted our calculations for the netting
but did not indicate thatthey would apply any safety factor for their comfort
im concerned about the time frame to iron out this issue and the construction start date
i needsome guidance
do we want to spend time fighting this
not knowing how lonit will take to resolve or do we bite the bullet and put on a catlytic converter for the generator and have unlimited operating hours
in speakinwith shudeish
i got the impressions that when an application approaches thpsd limit
they want to see the applicant apply cems or some kind of controtechnology just to be sure that they stay under the 0 ton limit
i knowtime is of the essence
second issue
the epa has given us a pretty good permit for stations 0 and0
but have restircted us to ppmvd values for nox and co
instead of lb./hror ton/yr
the values that they have given us in the permit are ok
0 ppmfor nox and co
at base load operation
ge will guarantee this
however
at lower tempertures and at reduced loads of 0%
the manufactures numbers are0 ppmvd for nox and co
we cant live with this
in our application
westated that we would be operating at low loads for 0% of the time and weapplied a 0% safety factor for the higher nox and co levels and presentedthis in lb.hr and tons/yr
this would have covered us
but because the permits limits are in ppmvd
we would exceed these limits during low loadsand low temps
i have requested from roger that we would accept permit conditions that would allow us 0 ppmvd during low temps and low loads withwith requiring us to do associated recordkeeping and roger said that he woubring this before his management
ill keep you apprised of this issue
transwestern pipeline company transwestern has run into some problems with the air permit conditions for the redrock expansion
for the state permits
the adeq wants to abitrarily set a 0% safety factor to the emissions levels which approach psd
this means that they have written into the draft permit a reduction in the allowable hours of operation for the generator from 0 to 0
this generator is the facility's prime source of power and therefore
needs to be operated for 0 hours
transwestern will challenge the agency's authority to apply a 0%safety factor
for the indain lands permits
the epa has written a permit condition of 0 ppmvd for nox and co under all operating conditions
manufacturerers guarantees only apply at 0 ppmvd at loads above 0% and at 0f
it appears that transwestern may have convenienced the epa to back away from permit limits in ppmvd and include as permit conditons lb/hr and ton/yr emissions limits that transwestern originally placed into its applications
northern natural gas company a standard exemption for the nng martin co
no
0 facility was submitted to the tnrcc
preliminary maintenance activities and newly published ap-0 emissions factors have shown that the martin co
0 facility may be a title v facility
under the old ap-0 factors
the units at the facility were not greater than 0 ton/year sources
continued investigation is being conducted to determine emissions levels from the units at the facility
a request and supporting documentation was submitted to the tnrcc to remove the eott crane facility from the title v operating permit program
new data on the crude oil received into the facility shows the emissions limits for vocs to be less than the title v regulated limit
general preparations are being finalized for the environmental roundtable to be held next week in albuquerque
shudeish
i spoke with roger kohn
region ix epa permit engineer
about the time his agency will take to do the air permit reveiw for kingman and flagstaff
he stated that epa normally gets the allowed 0 days to do the permit review
however
at the request of the state agency
his office will do an expidited review
because of the urgency of transwetern desiring to initiate construction
by this email
i am asking the adeq to request an expidited review of the kingman and flagstaff air permits from the epa
again
thanks for your work and effort that you have put in on this project
shudeish
our advisor in arizona left me a voice mail message that the signs were posted at both locations
thanks for your help with an expited request to region ix epa

thanx dude
please remove me from all future distributions
roger
if epa has approved other alternate methods for determining sulfur in fuel gas
can you approve of these for our sulfur methods
the reason i ask is that we are not set up to do any of the applications mentioned in appendix d
we have approved custom fuel monitoring schedules in place at 0 other compressor station locations and have been approved to use
stain tubes
or total sulfur analyzers
these were issued by region ix and region vi
i can send you copies of the approvals from the other regions if that will help
if not
i would recommend that you write the permit with all the below referenced test methods and we will work out the details
will it be possible to make a change to the permit after things quiet down a bit and we have more time to taylor the permit for you and us
please remove from distribution list
yes

bill as per your request
presented below is a status of the air permitting activity by the agencies as of today 0/0/0
stations 0 and 0
the epa has completed is review of these state permits and has sent them back to the adeq for comment
i have spoken to shudeish
the permit engineer for the adeq
and he is reviewing epa's comments as this e mail is being written
he will give me a call when his review is complete
but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prior to the public hearing
these permits went out for public notice on october 0 and 0
which means that the comment period ends on nov
0 and 0
the adeq plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday nov
0 in williams az
at 0:0 pm
i plan on being there
williams is located approx
0 miles west of flagstaff
az
the address for the hearing is the council chambers located at 0 south 0st street
so far
there have been no responses submitted to the adeq by the public
in epa's review process
they had a problem with methodology proposed by transwestern for measuring sulfur in the fuel gas
we had proposed stain tubes in the custom fuel monitoring schedule
they wanted us to do wet chemistry
we convinced them otherwise
byron
because of this
you wont need to order a sulfur analyzer for the needles facility
this should save you about $0k
there was also an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter emissions from the turbine and catepillar
this has been resolved also
stations 0 and 0
i received a call from roger kohn
the permit engineer for the epa
he is satisified with the permit application contents and has also approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations
there are no outstanding issues on these permits from the epa
the public comment period for the station 0 and 0 permits ends nov
0
after this date
it will take 0-0 weeks for the regional administrator of the epa to sign off on the permits and then he will have them issued to transwestern
as of this date
there have been no comments submitted to the epa for the permits for station 0 and or 0
ill keep everyone apprised of future events
jerry
i have not cancelled the station 0 air permit
i have spoken to roger kohn,epa permit engineer
about the possibility of not doing the turbine installation at station 0 only due to what you described as not enough market commitment
my plans are to hold off on making any decisions and have the epa issue the station 0 permit
if we do not initiate any construction pertaining to the turbine or auxillary generators
then the new permit doesnt apply and we can still operate under the existing permit which was issued about 0 years ago
in enron
0 months is an eternity and who knows what will happern then
by having the permit
but not constructing
we will be ok
if we decide to do the turbine project within the period of time that the permit is valid
then were ahead of the game
if not
and a more firm decision is made to not do anything in the future
ill contact epa and request termination of the permit
usually
the agency places a caveot that if construction does not proceed in a specified time then the permit automatically cancels itself and the facility must comply witht he conditions of the existing permit for the facility
just to keep all permit information together
i spoke to roger kohn and he has sent to me the station 0 and 0 air permits
we are now free to initiate construction at these two sites
i am not the larry campbell you're looking for
thanj you
thank you
lewis eugene adkins 0 sanford larry's cell 0-0-0
midland team
the martin co
no
0 facility is potentially in non compliance because there is new emissions data from the epa which shows the units at this facility emit emissions which would trigger a title v air permit
steve san miguel and stoney tried to conduct an emissions test with a portable analyzer but were unable to collect representative emissions data due to the fact that the unit was in very poor mechanical shape and showed very high emissions
we have a couple of options
spend the $$$$ necessary to bring the unit up to standards that allow a representative emissions test to be conducted and determine whether the emissions from the units trigger permit action or use the new epa data and submit an air permit application
the choice is yours
understand
this permit if issued
places some recordkeeping and mechanical responsibilities on the midland team
let me know what you would like to do
thank you
charlie
can you take care of this
please respond and let me know your thoughts

friday
november 0
0 and he has instructed me that the epa is to receive copies of all monthly water well sampling for c/s 0,0
and 0 in addition to sending the monthly sampling results to yolanda barney of the navajo nation
although yolanda is the primary recipient
the epa becomes secondary as they have the responsibility for oversight of indian lands environmental issues
danny said that the epa would eventually phase themselves out of the navajo's business but until they do
he is requesting copies of all sampling data
i asked him if we could fax him the monthly reports and he indiacted that it would be ok to do so
his fax number is
0
0-0
i will keep you apprised of any future changes in the distribution of the water sampling reports
bill
i have this outstanding bill notice which i keep getting form ipayit
there are about 0 invoices from argent for eott work which they did in 0
it was for the midland eott compliance stuff
i dont know how to let the system know that these invoices have been taken care of
is there someone you know of who can let ipayit know that these invoices have been taken care of
no
his e-mail is physics0@yahoo.com and home number is 0-0-0
scott
it seems that the letter we received from danny is otherwise
in the process of having the navajo epa take over the drinking water program for the tribe
the epa as overseer wants to be kept in the loop for a little while longer
in light of this
we need to not only send to the epa all monthly sampling reports for drinding
but also to the yolanda barney of the navanl nation
i spoke with danny about this and he said that the epas involvement would start to deminish in the future but he didnt when
randy
i tried to send you a note about a week ago about my elk hunt but it came back undelivered
i thought you might have changed your address
guess i typed it in by mistake
age does that to you sometimes
yes
things are stressful
but as you eluded to god doesnt give his kids a spirit of fear
but confidence that he is in control
i never thought i d see the enron empire tumble
but when you torture and strangle a corporation hard enough and long enough
eventually it gives up and surrenders
there is a push underway to isolate the pipelines from the enron umbrella and make all business units with money making assets separate from the rest of enron
transwestern is definately a money making asset
and that is what may keep me afloat
well see
anyway
as long as i keep my focus on jesus and keep reminding myself of that which is important
family and health
i know ill come through all of this
sorry to hear that there is the word
reorganization
in hess
this kind of stuff generally never does anything but upset employees and create a period of time when nobody is productive
i hate this kind of stuff
i know that change is inevitable
but so disruptive
ill keep you in prayer
isnt it great to have the confidence and assurance that we serve a big enough god
that he can handle all our problems
keep the faith
my friend and focus on the eternal
just like peter wrote
were just pilgrims in a foregin land
waiting for the trip home and promise of christ's return
thought you might like this
you know i used to work for a director in ets that always gave 0%
now i know how he did it
not really
just kidding
this is cute
things like this help during difficult times
don i am sorry about your loss
mostly because those in the family of god hate to see pain hit a family member
even under the most dire and seemingly impossible situations
god is in control
its his promise that he will never leave us nor forsake us
that in itself
is a real comfort and security knowing we have his eternal and loving spirit with us at all times
when you get some time
read romans 0:0 and then meditate on it
so many times we confuse our wants for our needs and that are promised by him
because he desires to conform us inito the image of his son
sometimes he has to empty us of worldly understandings and unrighteousness so that he can fill us with blessings that glorify him
once we make a heart commitment and his spirit sets up residence within us
god's promise in romans is to work everything
including a job loss to his glory
if we are eternally minded and understand that our citizenship and home is in heaven
then life on earth begins to look less important and we see the worldly goods as being very temporary
i will pray for you and your family that you see a manifestation of god's work in your life and that you are brought even closer unto him in your christian walk
i will keep my ears open for any employment opportunities
when you're feeling down and discouraged
drop me a line
sharing christ with someone always seems to help me through the day in difficult situations
in hebrews were told to encourage the brethren
i would consider it an honor to hear form you again
keep the faith
its all we have
thanks randy
ive heard him on the radio
sta
0 and 0
i am sending to you via regular mail
the new air permits for the redrock expansion
i will be contacting you in the near future about coming out and going through the permits to assign responsibilities between you and me
if you get some time
i would suggest that you look over each permit as there is additional recordkeeping and reporting above that which is on your existing permit
the old permit will expire when the facility begins operation of the turbine
for station 0
if a turbine is not installed at your location
this new permit wont apply
but in the event it happens
you have the permit
bottom line
you need to keep this permit at each location
thanks
roger
im on board with this
rich
concerning the environmental liabilities which may impact transwestern if duke should direct the liquids from their 0
line into the pipeline liquids tank at wt-0
i have a concern
the liquids that are generated in the 0
line are exempt from hazardous waste regulations
rcra
as long as they stay in the duke line and are not transfered and collect in a mainline tank
because wt-0 is a mainline compressor station
any chemicals or compounds which are regulated under subtitle c of rcra become the responsibility of the owner of the mainline tank
within the past few years
we have experienced the collection of regulated liquids at wt-0 which were not placed there by tranwestern
chemicals which producers and processing
upstream of wt-0
have placed downhole to enhance gas production and other agents such as corrosion inhibitors and pipeline solvents have found their way into our tank and we have paid for the disposal
unfortunately
there is no way to segregate the bad materials from the good recycleable materials
based upon this
i would recommend that we not allow dukes pipeline liquids to collect into our tank
thanks michael for the brief update
it sounds encouraging
i am looking forward to putting the model into motion
no problem with signing the no cost extension for the project
send it my way
fyi from penn state on the progress of the model to remove pcb's from transwetern's pipeline
ray
kay had mentioned that your team was having an ocd inpsection this week
wednesday
ive tried to contact you a couple of times to see if you might need some help
but was unsuccessful
is there something wrong with your phone
give me a call if you feel uncomfortable about any issue prior to their visit
i will be in the office on wednesday but gone from 0:0 am-0:0 pm
let me know how the inspection went
thanks john
ill keep you posted

he's our only salvation
so often we look to other things to give us security and joy and we so often forget
that for those that love him and have confessed him as our savior he is our strength and hope of a future eternal glory
may god be your source of strength
merry christmas

when butch had getman's wife count the number of people using the water at station 0
did the number of users not equal the public water system numbers
ie 0 people daily at least 0 days per year
i though we were always a public water system at station 0
we better discuss this
as we could be in some trouble if we do service 0 people and are not doing the sampling
i have submitted all receipts for the expense reports submitted to you
i will resend them again
david
i got hte same message from don
i found out he became a believer about a couple of months ago and i have been spending a little time sharing christ with him
im sure hes going through a tough period now
if you saved his address you may want to congraulate him into the family
thanks for the prayers
its funny
but im not too shook up about this
what ever happens happens and i know i cant do anything about it
it must the the spirit within me
but im relatively calm about the whole situation
i find that when i hang aroundthe guys in the office and we start gripping
i loose my focus and start looking like a carnal christian
so im better off away from the troops and just trnding to business
bill kendrick seems to be pretty focused also
im glad for that
i know hes under a lot of stress
it seems the people tied to the pipeline assets are the safest
if it is a business unit with income coming in
enron wants you
the gossip and garbage going around about what and how enron is going to do to bail itself out is rampant
i just know that there arent too many people loyal to enron right now
many fortunes and retirements have been lost and many of those who had retired in the last several months are trying to get back on with the different companies
someone said 0 people in enron houston were given pink slips
this is a bad time for all with christmas around the corner
but then maybe
just like september 0
maybe its another wake up call for people to understand that the things in this world arent very stable and reliable
i hope that this turns many to jesus
another one of those romans 0:0 passages which seems to have direct relevance right now
if you can
say a prayer for those that arent employeed anymore and feel like they have lost everything
hope your holidays will be blessed with some of your family coming in
do you have plans to do any downhill skiing in quatar over christmas

im in the office for a few hours cleaning out email and stomping out some minor fires
the two rmef persons we met with are dan walker and allen kerby
allen is the regional director for nm and tx
dan was the guy we picked up at the airport from montana
i think his title was vp of business operations
his number is 0-0-0-0
allen's number in las vegas nm is 0-0-0
hope that all is well with you and the family
thanks
danny for sending out this heads up
steve
what i have on my board is that when cubix did the test for 0 the engine load was 0%
if cubix is willing to provide us a report that shows the load on 0 to be greater than 0%
we've satisified the compliance testing for 0
id like to have a copy of the revised report to submit to the air quality bureau for their records and the facility should also have copy
my records show that the ceiling for using unit 0 is 0% load
under our agreement with the aqb
we can operate unit 0 only up to a 0% load
above this
we need to bring in cubix or have a portable test completed to raise the ceiling of operation
one other thing
there seem to be some confusion about which units are required to be tested at station 0
i have a copy of the approval from the aqb about allowing us to test units 0 and 0 instead of 0 and 0
ill pass a copy of this letter on to anyone who needs it
david got your voice mail last week
sorry about not getting to talk with you
but i am taking the month of december off so as not to give enron my vacation
im not going to give it away anymore
i would have liked to talked to you
things are somewhat stressful around here
probably worse in houston
enron is screening e mails so everyone is a little tense
lots of things are going on with enron trying to bail itself out of this mess
as you may have heard
they severed about 0 people so far
joe kolb and don stevens were among those
ive kept a low key on the daily news reports about what is going on
so i really dont know much
this was a good time to take my vacation
this whole thing doesnt seem to be bothering me
as i am relying on jesus
my higher power and that has been my strength and comfort
its a good feeling to know that whatever happens
my family and i will be just fine
hows christmas in the desert
were you able to find an acceptable substitute for a tree
this was a good time for you to stretch your wings
david
i hope you and everyone in the ayers household has a very merry christmas
i think of you much and hold you in my prayers
when we stop and reflect upon all that man has done to warp the meaning of our savior's birth
it becomes hard to focus on the real meaing
i pray that you are a wonderful witness to a lost and twisted people in katar and remember the love of christ that was revealed to us in his cruxificion
i am thankful for our great high priest who has opened up the doors of heaven for us and by his spirit has given us the opportunity to peek through the veil and know the holies of holies
may god bless each of you and continue to show you wonders of his love and grace
merry christmas
your brother in christ
mark
this is correct
david i got your test

please send this blank matrix to the project manager and have them complete the title information amd items a through e in the upper box on the first page
then send it to me
this will greatly assist me in determining what permits
plans and other regulatory documents will be requried
thanks
guys
with respect to the above
as you know
wgr was responsible for all compliance submittals during the time that we owned and they operated
i know in the past
prior to their taking over ownership
i would remind them each year that a particular document was requried
i figured that when they became owners
they didnt need me anymore
louie
you are right
phil moyer was the environmental contact for wgr and he was the one i would contact and apprise
it just so happens that i have copies of previous annual submittals from wgr for the gomez facility when the facility was under our ownership

please see attached file
look at your color on the recon var tab

due to tagg constraints
the deal had to be booked as two legs in tagg to capture the canadian price
i left bob a message last week and again today that teh utilicorp price is right in sitara and tagg
the confirm should have gone out at if ventura +
0
my understanding from the conversation with bob was that the confirm had not gone out yet
however
the trader got a phone call today that the deal got confirmed at the wrong price
please let me know if i can be of any further assistance
please look at the financial legs of the following deals
thanks

here is the email reminder of the curve setting process
after you set your curves
do not hit finished file
go to the gd pmgr tab and change the date in the left hand corner to two business days out
friday set for tuesday
then go to the curvefetch tab and place your file on automatic calc
can not hit f0
then hit fetch prices button
prices should be brought in for current date
go to the autocurve tab and hit paste curves
when this is done
hit finished file and the date will be updated so that i know your curves are ready to load in erms
please feel free to shout with any questions
thanks
macros intra month physical calcs fixed for floats
please use the following two files as your detail support for finanical liquidations
previously
i believe you were given the capacity hedges file the pricebasisindex file and the pricebasisindex_revised file
all three of these equalled the 0.0 million
you should use the revised and the capacity hedge file
when you use the two files listed above
you will come up with a variance going the other way of roughly $
0,0
this amount should be a
desk adjustment
we have accounted for the variance in our current month
0
file and will simply reclass between the months
please shout with any questions
cathy please seperate two items from your original list
tagg#n0.c for $0,0 and tagg#n0.0 for $0,0
these two liquidations relate to a ngpl storage deal on the desk that should have variances for several months
the net amount of these two liquidations is $0,0
for now
please put this item on the backpage on it's own line
we will reconcile the other storage lines in the next few weeks and see what if anything needs to be added to this line
at that time we will work out the necessary steps to get this item off of the backpage
scott is still looking at tagg#n0.l for $0,0,0 for the remainder of the balance for may
shout with any questions
done
i passed it off today to someone in the public relations dept
i will also look on our bulletin board and see what if anything is out there
i bid $0 of miami's d and $0 on detroit's d
i bid $0 on new orleans d
i have put all of the liquidations for gd central in the fred liquidations file
there is a variance of
$0,0
on the gas daily between what we flashed and what detail we now have
we will have to take this adjustment to the p&l
wil be expense
i do not have detail for basis capacity hedges or lt transport
i am under the impression that these numbers are given to you each month by cernosek's group
for basis capacity hedges
we flashed
$0,0
and for lt transport we flashed
$0,0
the detail in this file plus these three numbers should tie out
if not
please let me know
shout with any questions
thanks for your help
sorry i did not get back with you yesterday
we have been really busy around here
i called the person that i gave your resume to and she is on a business trip until early next week
her assistant is going to have her call me when she returns
apparently she left the day after i gave her the resume
i will keep you informed
if you look on our website www.enron.com and you see anything that interests you
let me know and i will put the resume in
talk to you soon
enron north america corp
sure
just give me a shout
next week will not be good and i would prefer if we could do it before 0 p.m
let me know
ask why
why doesn't the ask why commercials work
i changed the first deal
the second one nz0
kam got a call from credit that this should be with ecc
we have a sheat from bruce mills that says all deals with dynegy canada should be through ecc
i will be there
it is bid week
remind me
no thanks
according to the trader
this is a gas daily daily for the balance of month
this may be a hedge for them for a physical deal
but it is financial from our perspective
per bruce mills
this goes through ena
tell him it is firm
we are obligating ourselves no matter what
and tell him thank you again
see you tonight pretty lady
i like it when you call me sailor
i have rugby practice on tuesday's and thursday's
i can do it before work
long lunch or monday/friday
let me know
please provide me a list of deal numbers that need to be changed
from you email i gather you are saying that all deals done by ena with a canadian counterparty need to be ecc/0rd party and then flipped to ena book/ft-us/cand/erms
is this correct
check this out
can't remember if i have sent this to you before
are you the same ashley lord that went to clear lake high school
i think i saw the ashley lord i went to high school with in the lobby and thought this might be you
if not
please disregard my email
thanks
there are four of us that are not playing tomorrow
done
well
did you survive the week without your husband
i am sure things are alot calmer now at home
how is the little one
jackson is into everything
ashley had to go out of town to a meeting on saturday
so he and i hung out all day
i taught him how to smoke
drink and cuss
ash was real proud
good to hear from you as well
last i heard
you were running a dating service
what happened with that
i have been at enron for close to 0 years
ashley and i have a 0 month old son
jackson
mom is doing good
as we all are
how do you like enron so far
i absolutely love it
i am in the risk management group for natural gas trading
dealing with the traders can be fun
but is usually quite challenging
unfortunately we have a lot of late nights waiting on systems
like we are right now
what group are you with
where are you living these days
we just built a house in pinebrook in clear lake
we had our ten year reunion last weekend
quite strange
i don't know if you know them
but several cl graduates work here
meredith mitchell
dawn kenne
mike pyer
our curves just came out
so i am going to start calcing my p&l
talk to you later
what room
great article on what it truly means to be an auburn man the ties that bind friday night meetings have helped auburn through hard times times sports staff auburn
it started in dark and unhappy times for auburn's football team
five straight games had been lost
late in tommy tuberville's first season as head coach
the team was fractured
divided by the stress of almost two years of trouble
despair and losing
more auburn football talkin
tigers forum
it was defense and offense
offensive tackle kendall simmons said
whatever happened
we pointed fingers at each other
on the friday night before last november's game against central florida
a small group of players gathered at the team hotel at the urging of fullback heath evans
they prayed
they talked about life and the sometimes bitter turns it can take
a bond began to grow among players young and old
black and white
starters and reserves
it wasn't so much about winning and losing or even about football
it was about matters of the heart
we may have had 0-0 guys show up that first night
senior whip linebacker rob pate said
since then
it's just like another thing on the itinerary
it's not mandatory
but we have basically the whole team there
we've got five or six coaches
coach tuberville comes in there
people just lay out their hearts
whatever is on their minds
auburn has won seven of the eight games it has played since that november night
players say they've done it with trust and a unity of purpose that has grown ever stronger
it has carried the 0th-ranked tigers to a 0-0 record going into saturday's southeastern conference west division showdown at 0th-ranked mississippi state
pate says they'll go firm in the belief that they can count on each other in the most difficult times
pate knows about pain and even fear
a mysterious disease
now seemingly under control
threatened his senior season
when you see a guy at his weakest point and he's reaching out asking you for help
you know everything about a guy
pate said
with me
it was my health
before the first game
they set a chair in the middle of the room and every guy in there put his hands on me
we said a prayer together
man
i was crying
it's like that every weekend
somebody on this team is suffering through something
they share it
when you line up on saturday
it's a lot easier to look at that person and know he is going to give it everything he's got
on the field
there has been little but happiness for auburn this season
tuberville says it started when auburn players
strengthened by the bad times
put aside their differences and their individual desires to play for their teammates and their school
i've never been around a team this close
tuberville said
they get along
we haven't always played as great as we wanted to
but we've had guys urging the younger players and younger players pulling for the older guys to get better
it's just a special group
they enjoy being around each other and understand what it's going to take for us to win
the change from not so long ago is striking
simmons says
if you don't really know each other and everybody is in their own little group
things aren't going to work
simmons said
if you have trust in your teammates
you can build a good team
right now
we've got that going
it starts with the seniors
who have seen the good and the bad of college football
they went to the sec championship game as freshmen in 0
then came two losing seasons and the resignation of their head coach
terry bowden
they revel in their success
yet they know it can be ever so fleeting
they take pride in the closeness of a team on the way back
no one understands better than fifth-year senior quarterback ben leard
he went from starter to third team in 0
then won his job back in 0 when hardly anyone thought he could
today
he has the highest efficiency rating of any sec quarterback
we have been practicing since august and we have yet to hear anyone say
man
i'm looking forward to playing in the nfl
leard said
no one is worried about their personal accolades or how they are doing status-wise
everybody just wants to win ball games
the relationships we have on this team are like brothers
leard says nothing that happens can change that
if we lose every game from now on
this will be one of the most special seasons i've ever had in my life
leard said
we've got people excited
we're excited
the fun is back in it for us
it's a great feeling to be able to almost look forward to coming to practice
to see the guys
to have fun and talk
there are no fingers being pointed anywhere
there are no individuals on this football team
evans was one who showed the way
happily accepting the unglamorous role of blocker for tailback rudi johnson
every friday night
evans is still the one who leads his teammates as they share their joy and their pain
heath is just like that all the time
pate said
he's a great example of somebody who lives what he talks
he's a role model
not just for younger people but for all of us
hey goofball
i sent this to you yesterday
i have even read where ronney daniels has said he does not mind having a reduced role as long as we win
hopefully the good times will continue
i get all of those articles from that website ww.tigeronline.com
it is an outstanding website
that article was from the huntsville times
see you soon
you finally win a game and you think your team rules
typical alabama fan
the scuddle butt i hear is that jackie sherrill will be you next coach
did you play with him
we will see if auburn is for real this weekend
i don't know if you are working any this week
but i will send an email any way
we were wondering what there might be to do in denver on friday
since we have all day
are there musuems or things unique to denver to see
i know there is some luncheon on friday
is that for couples or just girls
wasn't really sure
we get in about we land on thursday at 0 p.m
and her grandmother lands at 0 p.m
so we should be at the hotel by around 0:0
should we call your room or meet you somewhere
talk to you soon
congrats on the future addition
we are all doing good
jackson is 0 months and walking and talking up a storm
definitely keeping us on our toes
the program for people with graduate degrees is the associate program
the person to contact that is responsible for that program is kristin gandy
her number is 0-0-0
i have no idea what all the requirements are and when they recruit
what type of position is he interested in
treasury
i have some friends down in treasury that i may be able to pass the resume on if you guys would like
oil and gas experience is not a necessity
just a plus
enron really encourages diversity in every form
even experience
by far the best company i have ever worked for
it was good to talk to you live
i miss our chats
but this is the wrong time and place to discuss that
please do not fret at all about not asking me to stand up
for what it is worth i didn't ask you either
i think you are correct it would have been akward for both of us
this week is a time when you need as little stress as possible to cope with al the people that are pulling at you
so you know
do not worry about us
we are there to celebrate with you and meet your family
take care of the other high maintenance people
because you will be suprised how many there are
try and relax and enjoy it
i am looking forward to seeing you in that dress
see you soon
i will bid $0 for cary blanchare
k arizona and $0 for gary anderson k minn
here it is
here it is
you gonna split the money with me right
just curious how i may assist in getting auburn university's name added to recruiting endeavors
of course i am an alum
and i believe you will find we have an excellent engineering and business school
just curious
thanks
enjoy
i was crying with laughter
i found this picture of you shooting a shotgun
you crazy man
yeah
waht are you offering
it is an absolutely hilarious video of a pakistani man firing a shotgun in a range and the gun shooting out of his hand and him yelling at his friends
real player should be able to play it
that is what i used
i had a good time
send me those pics
it was great seeing everybody and give us a shout the next time you are in town
i think it is arabic for holy shit
i broke my shoulder
how about jacques green and mike alstot
i will throw in troy brown
kevin johnson and james allen
if he did that
he might have come back with a little buckshot in his ass
thanks for your help
i will keep that in mind
here they are
look how large some people are
leo and mitchell
i managed to stay clear of the photos
i do not know who you are
but i definitely do not appreciate the email that you sent me
i do not agree with your politics and please remove me from your list
how does fear have any money left
he has been bidding the house
i think we need some bid accounting here
here they are
man
i was needing some help this week
i think that last comment should have been directed solely to o'neal
when are you running for office eric
you have my vote
you need to stop lying to these boys
you know damn well this old guy was with you step for step
can you reverify the deal id
is this the eol #
eol number are above 0 right now
thanks
there has been a slight change to our email addresses
please send future emails to phillip.m.love@enron.com thanks
sent to wrong address originally
send those dirty jokes to my home email
plove0@cs.com
they are pretty ruthless here about offensive emails
i still want to see the jokes though
are you still enjoying the computer
i need to spend some time getting our home machine organized
talk to you soon
we do look pretty bad
as long as we win that game at the end of november
i will be happy
how was the trip to nyc
i bet you guys had a blast
sorry
i have always listed the address as plove @enron.com how are things going with you
good i hope
we just got back from denver
rachel bonilla's wedding
boy the weather and the air are beautiful up there
we really considered moving
yes
i did get in touch with him
thanks again for the info
he is just being a beach bum
not really doing anything
guess i should have figured that
done
welcome back
did you see the first three games of the divisional series
0 of the 0 starters were former astro pitchers
within the last three years
halama
garcia for seattle
randy johnson trade
hampton and kyle
how sickening is that
however
mcclain has said he is going to up the budget for next year
a vote was taken
and ny,ny was declared the winner
i then went around to everyone and the were cool with nyny because it was putting an extra $0 in everyone's pocket
if you want to talk to everyone and try and convince them
let me know
by the way
how do i get my high score weekly money
do i have to wait until the end of the season
done
fyi
according to trey
this does not go through ecc because it is physical
do you agree
i changed sitara as well
is it 0 a.m
out there
what in the hell are you already doing at work
i know what you mean
as far as the bed goes
you should do what i do
go around to the other side and push your wife into the wet area
i agree with you
we are going skiing in january
if ya'll want to come or come to a football game in the fall
i am not sure if we can make it out there before the end of the year
i have spoken for all of my vacation days
did you see the sorry astros released cami today
the man gave up all of that cash for us and is sitting in rehab for dependency and we walk out him
typical drayton mcclain
talk to you tomorrow
i vote for a long lunch one day of the week or 0 p.m
on monday or 0 p.m
on wednesday
does denise have any interest in learning to ski
i think it is an absolute blast
how are the negotiations going between gwynn and the padres
pretty humorous
yeah man
tell me about that crazy night before
you know us married guys have to live vicariously through our single friends
next time you are headed this way
please do give me a shout
we will have to get together and catch up
we can shoot a little pool at my house or go out to a bar
good luck with the financing
please keep me informed
thanks for the nice thoughts
same goes from me bro
i have been thinking about you for some time and hoping things were going well
i am glad they are going well
i do not think i will be able to attend due to bid week
we are usually extremely busy during bidweek and we will be short handed
please advise of any future sessions
thanks
we are having so much fun
we do not know what to do with ourselves
the p&l's are hosed
we are going to fletch's happy hour now
maybe the numbers will make sense after that
i ran a forwards detail for you on the deal from friday q0.0
price of 0.0
this deal is currently losing roughly $0,0
that really embarasses me
how ashamed i am to read this
the fred file for ontario did not include flashed liquidations detail
it appears the files were not prepared by risk
i have prepared the files and attached them
do you mind including this in the fred file and reissuing
thanks for your help
please call with questions
fyi
i guess i would be in
what is the fee going to be
it is a crap load of work
i bid $0 on troy drayton
tim duncan is what ever the draft personnel categorize him as
guranteed victories
what is your record this year thrill kill
what was your record in basketball
enough said
pretty damn funny
from all i have read
he seems to always thank his offensive line and recievers first
i heard that is what he said as soon as he got the game ball saturday
i can always count on you to put a unique spin on something
i am more concerned with him staying for his senior year
he led the nation last year
juco
in rushing and touchdowns and was juco player of the year
he went to butler juco and led them to a national championship
in the national championship game
he had 0 yards and 0 touchdowns
he has 0 touchdowns so far this year over 0 yards
he is a welcome addition to our poor running game
the hell you did
don't be a dumb ass
you need to remember who is giving you tickets this weekend
bring it
i guess you are right
you don't need tickets
hope you don't need any the rest of the season
i give you that whoopin at the bar this weekend
we are in bid week right now
so i have to work late and can not take vacation
so i am catching a 0 p.m
flight out tomorrow and get to auburn about 0 a.m
i will be at your brother's by 0:0 a.m
on game day
you better be ready
i am coming in on thursday night for the georgia game and may stay in birmingham that night
any vacancies
i think we may play golf on friday
thanks man
i will let you know
i understand mick's point of view
so for everyone
i will also share my day
get out of bed
shower
brush teeth
comb hair
don't forget that deodrant
that's both arms
take the bus
book deals til 0 p.m
and calc three books
get the point
we are all busy
welcome to enron
i think the point of the message
which i think should be directed at a few individuals that have shown a pattern
don't committ yourself to something you do not intend to deliver upon
i don't have to be talking about basketball to get the pattern
i am sorry
i didn't realize your girl told you about our morning routines
actually i was told it was a military invention and that we simply licensed the technology rights
thanks
i know for a fact he felt the same way
speaking of chargers
when is ryan leaf going to be stoned to death in the town square
i figured you would come back with that
did he ever marry that charger doll or whatever they are called or did she wise up to the scam
head
pants
now
that boy's cranium should is a virtual planetoid
it should have it's own weather system
that was low
the poor boy will probably cry himself to sleep on his large pillow
great flick
by the way
do you need any tickets for the georgia game
i think i will have two extra
let me know
thanks
now it is on
bring it bass
the plove is back to sew up this league like i am doing in football
come down my way and hand over my share of this week's pot
i guess i will get the pool again this week since i am playing you
the only one with a chance to outscore me
geaux tigers
stock up on those sharpies
works for me
per bass
like last year we get 0 guys
one must remain on ir for the entire week
note
the person does not have to be injured
pickups and drops are every monday
if you do not know how to add/drop
ask any of us from last year
thanks for the pics
guess this should not come as a suprise to us
unfortunately
rumor has it today dubose will be fired
fyi
barry was not there last week
thought you might want some late breaking news
that was nice
i forgot what your reply was
do you need any of the two extra tickets i have for saturday
thanks
i have no idea
i went and early voted
have fun standing in line
call paul bettencourt
tax assessor's office
sure
all done
i plan on attending
man
i wish you could have made it to the reunion
we had a really good time and it was good to see everybody
what are you doing in norway for a job
i am still enjoying enron
i am headed to auburn this weekend for our last home game of the season
should be fun
if we make it over to europe any time soon
we will look you up
we will probably wait until jackson is a little older so that he will enjoy it more
how is your pop doing
i bet he hates having you so far away
did you purchase a new bronco when you got to europe or have the old one shipped over
boy did we cruise in that thing
stay in touch
i will try and get it for you
what is the word on the tickets
have you heard from your older brother
i think he is planning on spending the night at my house tomorrow
but i have not heard from him
i was just curious
thought bill might need some
but i heard from him and he is good on tickets
so they are still yours for the taking
the $0.0 rate i was qouted was after tax
i specifically asked this question on the phone and at the airport
not a good way to do business
i got steve's email address
here it is
good luck
stay in touch
i still have them and they are yours
as always
only stipulation is that i get to go in with you and get my free coke
still have not heard from your brother

this christmas should be fun
when are you coming out here to visit
hey man
our new address is
0 sterling wood way
glad to hear this
read the whole story
hopefully it is true
i will be there
i do not mind us bringing jackson
i understand your desire to be with him all the time
but i would like to occasionally do something with our friends for a vacation that is just us
i think in time you will become more comfortable
and i will just wait for that time
you need to talk to your mom and decide if we are going this weekend

it is nice to have special friends that you consider family
plus
you know how special you have always been and will be to me

check out this article
jim
please adjust the sithe storage account to a price of $0
instead of wacog
this adjustment should not have to go back any further than 0/0
the pipeline is union gas limited and the storage contract number is 0
please shout with any questions
jennifer
this should eliminate the current outstanding variances and create a variances for all past months that have been cleaned up
the p&l impact of the new variances should be minimal due to the small volume nature of these transactions in the past
i believe the variances will be a gain
thanks for you help guys
please send me more information on book g0
the person that runs that book
ftoc
is not aware of this book
please send me the book name and we will try and track it down
fyi
please send all future central desk/ontario desk inquires to me
kam has moved to the east desk and i am now the lead for the central
thanks for your help
i have not seen the increased volumes
i will ask andy tomorrow about them
the original 0k and 0 k are in sitara
i just wanted to update you guys on the status of the emw reports for hunter
the emw positions_0 file is now updated and accurate
every night when kevin finishes his p&l file and updates the emw positions file
he will email the entire central team
if one of us is still here
we can print out the necessary reports and leave them on hunter's desk
if no one is here
the first person in will need to print these reports out and give them to hunter with the var report
for the time being hunter will be the only one needing these reports
i will communicate any change in distribution that he requests
also for the time being
we will be going into kevin's p&l file
which is in the same location as our intra month p&l's that we sign off on
and printing the four tabs that he has identified in the email attached
when hunter has time to review this format with me
we may make changes to the reports we print out
the emw positions_0 file is in the same location as our ce positions_0 file
please as always
shout with any questions or concerns
thanks for your help
please add me to this list
i am replacing kam on the central desk
she is moving to the east desk
fyi
sounds like a great plan
talk to you more about it tonight
i already have access
i have a few concerns about this
we are suppossed to be the only point of contact for changes in tagg
this is an internal control issue that leaves all responsibility for errors in tagg with risk
if other people are touching deals in tagg
any errors will then have to be investigated further and thus take longer to resolve
i guess my main question for you is
does a problem exist in the current system
is risk not addressing your issues and needs on a timely basis
if so
we need to readdress that issue and resolve it in a more timely manner
please let me know if the others disagree with me
thanks
here was my original response to her
joe hunter is fine with me
here are a list of tagg0's that were already linked
if you have any questions are need help with this
please let me know
thanks for your help
that is all fine with me
just ask mom what she wants to do
she will not flip out again
i think
we can see if she wants to do anything on his actual birthday
what are we going to actually do after the gymboree thing
are we inviting anyone else over
i forgot to tell you last night
ginger called and said tori will be there
i thought there were possibly going to be other kids there as well
what about just going out to eat at lupe's with your mom and nonnie
that sounds good to me
we do not have to have a party with brian/rebecca
kim and ev and then they feel obligated to bring a gift
no big deal to me and i am sure no big deal to them
what are we doing for dinner tonight
what are you doing home in the middle of the day
i did not see the two sitara numbers on the email
please send me the numbers and i will change them now
thanks
these two deals
0
0 are changed for february out
i will tell the risk team that all new deals at ngpl/nipsco should be at nips/ngpl
0
is this correct
fyi
all new deals that are at ngpl/nipsco
need to be in sitara at nipsco/ngpl
please shout with any questions
can you please set this new location up
nipsco/ngpl
with curves the same as the original point
ngpl/nipsco
i believe they are as follows
gas daily should be gdp-chi
gate
the intramonth should be ngi/chi
gate
and the mid should be ngi/chi./nipsco
please shout with any questions
thanks for your help
attached is a file we put together with the daily figures on them for central 0
central 0
the total page should tie to what i gave you last week
i highlighted the five days on each month the highest absolute value change
i then attached those days p&l top sheets
please review this information and let us know what type of detailed support you will need
thanks
guess it helps to attach the file
i am hoping you will be the right person to talk with
rahil jafry referred me to you
i am the risk management lead for the central gas desk
currently our traders utilize an eol weighted average gas price report on eol to set their curves for the next gas day
i.e
their curves set today for tomorrow's gas flow
i was first inquiring with eol if they could possibly provide this report in downloadable format
excel
and they sent me to rahil
who then sent me to you
is this possible
please feel free to contact me for any additional information or if this is really confusing
please let me know if you are not the right person to contact and i will start over with eol
thanks for your assistance in this matter
phillip
thanks for your help
this sounds like a good fit for us
the only issues i have or need addressed is for this file to have the same name and have the curves in the same cells so that we can just link to the file in our curve file
the other concern is that the data be there by 0:0 p.m
everyday
prices for the next gas day
thanks so much for your help
i suggest not watching this after eating or drinking too much
this deal is ok for now because it only has a volume in for january
if the trader changes the volume for the out months
we will need to have it in tagg
thanks
good to see
thanks for forwarding
please add victor guggenheim to your list

my grandfather actually passed away on thursday afternoon and we had the funeral on saturday
i had to give the eulogy and boy was it difficult
i bet a stood there for 0 minute without saying a word
unable to hold my emotions
i hope i never have to do that again
thanks for your thoughts
i actually had a dream this morning about talking to you about it
wild huh
talk to you soon
sorry it has taken me a few days to get back with you
i had to leave town unexpectedly and just returned today
all of that sounds great
how about putting the file in the o drive under erms/0intra/central
please name the file eol curves
please let me know if you have any problems
thanks for your help on this matter
using the wrong head i think
according to the official jazz fest website
there are only 0 days till fest 0
harrah's
harrah's
harrah's
thanks for your wishes and i am confident all your prayers helped me get through the weekend
thanks again for your kind words
has then been fixed yet
thanks for the jesse joke
pretty funny
will you cehck this out and see if it is for real
also
did you talk to the day care about watchmegrow.com
have you heard anything from jim on these
how are we looking on back pages
let me know and i can take some time with you to help and clean them up further
thanks
the room is $0 per couple for the four nights or $0 per person
the fest tickets are $0 a day and people usually go 0 of the three days
there is also a harrah's casino across the street from our condo
the condo's have kitchen's in them so people and buy groceries and stuff and eat there mainly
we go every year and have a blast
if you are interested let me know
can we go ahead and take the unexplained amount
numbers at the bottom of your schedule
for ontario thru 0
it appears that the number will be roughly 0k in income
making the number 0k unexplained and that will be for the months 0-0
can we also do the same on central through 0
this will be roughly 0k in expenses
this will clean up that as well
please shout if there are any problems
thanks
we have had a problem arise today with some deals that are being booked in sitara by originators and deal tickets/notebooks are not being communicated properly to ensure entry into tagg
sitara for prompt month deals
would you mind forwarding this email to your groups and asking them to copy the other desks on any originator notebooks that they get that involve pipelines on other desks
for example
nelson ferries writes all of his deals on one sheet and all deals by pipeline are on one page
this would simply be an additional step to verify all deals are being captured
hopefully this will eliminate any future problems
if you have any suggestions for ways to better handle this
please let me know
thanks
fyi
i have been notified by hunter again that any future srew ups are my behind
so
please verify your p&l's nightly for accuracy
mainly curve shift and new deal problems
curve shift reports should be run for all of your p&l's and new deals should be tied out before calcing
i know you guys almost always do this
i am just giving you a friendly reminder since hunter is going to be watching us even closer now
also
please remember when we change any deals in sitara to notify the intra month trader
i also heard this request from hunter
thanks again for everything while i was out and keep up the good work
i agree with that totally
jeff should we get a meeting set up with lagrasta to discuss this with him
please let me know your thoughts
fyi
a note from the top
if you need help
let me know
check this out
next time check your sources
thanks for your help
this is the kid from opelika correct
i heard when he committed last week
all the publications took him from a 0 star to four star
sounds like a little biased alabama propaganda
i talked with the guy at the vet school today about donations in papa's name
he was telling me to call him anytime i am down there and he will get us a tour of the eagle's new digs and the entire raptor center
sounds like a lot of fun
let me know if you are interested during football season
here is an article for all you lsu boys who kept saying tuberville was leaving
you should enjoy this article
once again
keep your mouth shut til you beat my team
you have not proved anything yet
your so poetic
please continue to share with me your true feelings
it only increases my opinion of lsu alums
can you provide me with a deal number to check into this matter
i have a favor to ask
would you mind asking your team to email or phone me when they make a location change on a deal in sitara
we had a case yesterday where a deal was originally entered at one location for the deal and for the hedge
the point was incorrect and a person in logistics corrected it
the problem occurs in that sitara looks to verify the locations are the same on the deal and the hedge and if they are
it will then value the deal in the trader's book at mid
if the locations are different
it will value the deal at the customer price
this could potentially have a large impact on the trader's p&l
it does not seem pertinent to have your guys changing swap locations in addition to changing deal locations due to time constraints
we will be more than happy to make the changes
and we should also be able to catch these problems in the first place when we calc our books
i would greatly appreciate your groups help in cutting some of these issues off at the pass
if you have any questions or concerns
please feel free to give me a shout
thanks
i have no knowledge of the change
it does not affect me
sorry i am unable to help
your just pissed because i was right about that recruit all along
you might try kathy kelly
fyi
please also know that if the change is simply a meter change
that does not effect the value
only the pipeline and trading zone will effect the value
thanks again
touchy,touchy
seems like the frustration of three straight top 0 recruiting classes with nothing to show for it are getting to you
it will be ok
hopefully mack can get some coaching in their to go with his powers of persuasion
chad
do you even know what is coming out of your mouth
when did you become such a football expert
i recall blanchard and the boys having to teach you about the game
please do not try and compare louisiana to alabama
there is only one university in louisiana
you can not hold it against auburn that napoleonville has only been able to support one university
tulane is strictly academics and we are talking sports
i responded
i just did not copy anyone
did you not hear me
i said i was talking athletics
do you want me to break out academics with you
i will be more than happy to discuss auburn
top 0 schools for your money
us news
world report
behind the service academies
more astronauts than any other university
top ten among universities in terms of fortune 0 ceo's
fortune magazine
the point
don't try and act like lsu is the best school in the land
just because enron doesn't recruit at some schools
doesn't mean they are inferior academically
i would much rather have a degree from tulane than lsu or auburn
in terms of academic stature
you should know that recruiting at enron has and will always be political
you have to have someone from that school in upper managment request trips be made
i can promise you in the next 0-0 years they will be recruiting at auburn
i and anothe alum have already discussed it with hr
this should have been cc to you
i think development made a mistake and cc
tell you what chad
you win
i really am tired of banging my head against a wall talking to an irrational person
i was not trying to make fun of your school
you chose that route
i was trying to make a simple point that recruiting at enron does not make a school elite
does nasa recruit at lsu
does ibm
who cares
the point once again
we were talking about sports
see you in baton rouge in september
go ahead and respond
so that way you have the
last word
i deleted the file
do you have an updated status on this issue
thanks
check this out
hopefully he will qualify
let's hope he qualifies
that could be a game breaker
after meeting with larry joe hunter
we will not be granting tagg access to his group
they were wanting access to change deals that were booked to the wrong counterparty
the problem here lies in that they were wanting to do these changes in the afternoon while we were calcing
this is not an option
therefore
the resolution is we are responsible for these corrections
we must get the deals entered into the system with the correct counterparty initially
our credit risk exposure is the bottom line
if we do not have all the deals to the right counterparty each day
we may not be receiving enough money on letter of credit from cp's
fyi
this is going to be a highly visible area for us to make mistakes
if we continue to make these mistakes
we as a group will catch severe fire
to help us do this correctly
bianca will be handing out a revised and updated counterparty list on a monthlly basis
we will still have emails sent denoting cp name changes
i reccomend writing these down on your sheets to keep for future reference
if all else fails and there is something you are not sure about
please call bianca ornelas at 0-0
if you have any questions
please give me a shout
thanks
i have no seat for him until feb 0th when palmer leaves
i will see what i can find out in terms of kam moving

if you want to
let me know and i would love to go
i like to wade fish so that i can use my fly rod
i need to get my licensed renewed
how much did you catch
this is really funny
ruth
i wanted to give you the details of how we placed these numbers in 0
instead of reducing the purchase price in sitara
we would capture this revenue in the p&l in two months with oa
we want to complete the transaction in the current p&l
we have written a physical annuity between ena and sithe power qp0.0
please settle this with january's physical purchase
0
sithe then receives 0% of this incremental revenue
this was booked in a financial annuity qp0.0
this should also be settled with january's invoices
0
we have placed the power portion of the revenue in schedule b in the ft-ontario book
this is due to the sithe p&l limitations
we will be modifying the book set up for any future deals such as this
a financial annuity was then written between sithe and ontario to recognize the schedule b item in the sithe book and keep ontario flat
tagg#qp0.0
0
the final $0,0 was then granted out to you via origination from the ft-ontario book
same reasons as above
and an annuity was then written to the ft-ontario book to keep it flat
tagg#qp0.0
these four deals in tagg will keep the sithe book flat and should accomplish the goals of your email below
if you have any questions or concerns
please feel free to contact me at 0-0
thanks
enron north america corp
fyi
you may see some january/february oa variances on sithe due to these tagg numbers

just wanted to give you guys a reminder when it comes to new deals out of our traders notebooks
please check each morning when you copy the new deals for the current day that you verify the prior day's last deal was entered
it is very easy to miss a deal the trader does after four and the trader's do not always remind us that they did a deal late
i spoke with hunter this morning and he wants these mistakes to stop
this doesn't happen often
put it is very easy to miss these types of deals in the future
thanks for your help
please do this asap for your books
i will check victor's books
thanks

i just went to look at the file and the data is yesterday's data

i have to say

fyi
i will be in town this weekend

fyi
i wanted to let you guys know of an oa problem that i am seeing on the central desk for december 0
it appears deals that are gas daily priced deals are being priced incorrectly in unify
two gas daily publications came out at the end of the year
the publication on the 0th was for trans
dated the 0th and flowing the 0th
the next gas daily publication came out on the 0nd of jan
and was for trans
0th flowing the 0st adn 0nd
we flashed gas daily prices for the 0th
0st that equalled the gd publication of the 0nd
this is correct
we should pay sat
and sunday based on monday's price
settlements paid the 0th
0st at the 0th's price
i am going to give bryce a call
i just wanted to share this with you since you should be seeing oa forms starting today for dec production
if you disagree with my logic
please give me a shout
thanks
i got an update from bryce
in the back of the publication for 0/0/0
page 0
there are prices for the 0th
0st
it appears the 0th
0st got pub posted at the first page of the 0/0/0 publication
therefore
we are going to see oa on these deals
fyi guys
save this stuff for after hours
you can ask fabiola
we are not in a bind we are still waiting on a few people to get back with us
i think ashley was calling monica and jaime to see if they were interested and ricky and tanya
the only bad thing is they have to let us know tomorrow if they are interested
sorry you are unable to make it
maybe next year
here is my groups book administrators
if you need any further information
please let me know
thanks
no new deals for central desk since bid week
today's file looks good
thanks for your help
that is fine with me
he said however that he will have an answer for me this morning
if he leaves we should definitely cancel
fyi
please book all future gd priced tiered deals as two deals in sitara
the reason for this is eventhough we put a swap on the deal for the volume that should be at index
the swap looks at the volume as a monthly volume as opposed to a daily and gives the monthly volume to the desk at mid
what typically happens is the total volume for the first half of the month comes to the desk entirely at mid
this is causing some substantial oa variances
if you have any questions
please let me know
thanks
as is the case will all ft-ontario deals done at a us point
the deal must flow physically from a us book eventhough the canadian trader gets the long term income/loss from the deal
this is a commercial decision that risk has to abide by
the oa group
specifically john valdes has given jim little the deal numbers in the past that comprise this problem to eliminate repeat performances
this deal in question began in 0/0 and since you are doing december oa i would assume this one has not yet made the list
i suggest forwarding to jim little/john valdes to eliminate future problems
thanks
can either of the two distinguished jim's from accounting help me with a financial liquidation problem from 0
i have a deal nr0.0 that is showing up in my actuals for the beloved fred file for this production month
when i look at the deal in tagg
the deal is an annuity booked to ng-price
i do not believe this should be in the central region
any assistance in clearing this is much appreciated due to the fun meeting we had yesterday regarding financial liquidations
thanks for your help guys
cathy this should clear/address all of our issues in 0 for fin
liq
attached is the fred file
on the recon variances tab
please note the liquidations coded in puke green
bright pink
blood red and blue
these items will resolve our variance within 0k
we will take the 0k expense
please try and resolve those issues before close of 0
let me know if you get resistance or need help
thanks
helps is i attach the damn thing
attached is the revised 0 fred please transfer the emw items to the emw line and settlements will have to resolve these issues
thanks
the feeling is mutual
things are going good
even better if i could get out of here at a decent time
at least i don't have susan's hours
are you coming to her happy hour tonight
talk to you soon
enron north america corp
we need to keep this for jackson
looks like my boy
we will also take the interdesk variance for 0
$0k
also
in 0 theres is a synthetic deal identified as nn0 with nng for $0k
this deal is in sitara 0 under cpr pipeline storage
the terms match and we should have no variance
please ask gas accounting why we do not have a variance on synthetic line
probably jim pond
thanks
0 lone liquidation variances
ces-dynegy
these tagg numbers are efp deals and we had variances show up in forms and we should have used these to clear
ecs
this tagg number has a sitara deal
0 that did not flow
the gas that was suppossed to flow on this deal
flowed on 0
northern natural
this tagg should be part of that variance for settlements
reliant energy
that is a synthetic storage deal that flowed
sitara #0
again
no variance to the desk
move wpl variance to its own line and we will take the remaining variance to the desk
let me know if you need further info on this category
0 lone liquidations
phillips n0.0 is a take to the desk
deal was killed in sitara pgl&c should be transferred to the peoples desk
tagg has the book as take remaining variance
0 lone liquidations
nu0.0 is an emw liquidation and goes with sitara #0
tsf this to the emw line should clear both variances
we need to take the phillip's liquidation just like 0
deal killed desk will also take the remaining $0,0 variance
0 lone liquidations can you please get the tagg number for the aurora liquidation tsf from the east is the ngpl purchase variance for roughly $0k part of the the n0
syn storage
wps liquidation nv0.0 is a option premium that is being paid on sitara #0 0/0-0/0
this liquidation needs to be seperated out to its own line and split accordingly along the months 0/0
0/0
$0,0 and 0/0 $0,0
we should get oa forms on this deal for these months that this liquidation will offset
take remaining $0k thanks
take the variance for 0 lone liq
$0k
the desk will take the lone liquidations for 0
$0k
i am curious why n0.q is a variance in 0 and n0.r is not a variance in 0
if you look in the two fred files
0 has the liq flashed and not in the gl
and in 0 the liquidation is in flash and the gl
the counterparties in both are the same
jim needs to revise 0 file
shout with any questions
thanks
take the cilco 0k from 0
check this out
can you get in touch with fab
fyi
thanks again for your help this weekend
i enjoyed hanging out with you
looks good to me
i noticed a note on an ecc purchase
q0
sitara killed
the wrong sitara number is on that tagg
the correct number is 0
i made the change in tagg
the transcanada liquidation that are not highlighted are the exchange deals that are not showing up in the gl
this is the huge problem that seems to not ever get resolved
to me
this looks to be a sign problem in the fred model
the variance in all cases is exactly double the flashed amount
jim please verify if this is correct
thanks
sorry guys
this slipped my mind today
will you please email joe hunter this information today before you calc
thanks
i am meeting monthly with each person in my group to go over their training plans and get feedback on things they would like assistance with
i need to still meet with souad for this month and need to get with anna and go over the information that i have given her
one thing that seems to have come up several times is the desire to continue the brown bag sessions
some topics that have come up are oa and curve mapping
i have talked with kam about this and we are going to try and put something together
please replace your physical tabs in your p&l to the file format attachedbelow
this should eliminate interdesk variances
you will need to add thmtm information and any transport/flash to actual items that you currentlymay have on your physical tab
i would suggest doing this tomorrow morningwhen you roll your p&l
shout with any questions
thanks
0 is a good time
please add darron giron
dave baumbach and kam keiser
thanks for your help
thursday is great
use this file instead
can you please get this right
this should be the final and correct version
hopefully mausser got it right this time
the issue of respect can be addressed in one simple two word phrase
draft dodger
just wanted to let you know that we are having global counterparties in houston inactivate the spot contract we have with sunoco inc so that anyone that tries to book a deal to this entity wil have to get a contract in place or get this one reactivated
this difficulty should send up a red flag and keep deals from flowing with this counterparty
please let me know if you need any further information
thanks
we will take this variance to the desk then
we will take the dpr/consolidated flash variance of 0k expense
thanks

thanks for the info
we will take the variance on central back page for approx
$0k for prior month book balance in 0

thanks
i think ashley sent fab some info on the fest
we have had to lock into the rooms last week
so i do not know if we will be able to help her get a room unless they still have some available when she makes a decision
sorry to hear about your work life stinking
i definitely know the feeling
the way i rationalize it is that i will take a job that has better hours before jackson gets into school
on a happier note
we are going to dinner with your parents this weekend
should be fun
talk to you soon
don't work too hard
aurora n0.0 0 lone liquidation belongs to sitara #0

thanks
we will take the ngpl variances

thanks
we will take the aurora 0k variance
looks like the deal was flipped out
we will take the mtm variance for 0
0k
this is partially offset by central's variance

ontario

i.e
what desk the variance is with
we will take the mtm prior month book balance variance of 0mm

this is the only august 0 deal we have with them
this volume and price do not match up
sylvia does not recall the deal they describe and has no paper work for it
anr lebanon ohio does not sound familiar
the only thing that i can think of is that they send us a confirmation letter/or transcript from the tapes
if they can prove to us a time and who they talked to we can then pull our tapes
let me know how i can further assist you
sorry
i am happy that neither of those two things is a possibility

the deal is liquidating in the ontario book because the ontario trader did the deal
if that trader does a deal at a us point
the gas has to physically flow out of a us book
not a canadian book
this deal is only for one month

let me know if you have any more questions
i also got some message from souad that you need some help with a people's deal
she thought you said you emailed me on the deal and i do not have an email

please verify none of these are ours
as marina and i discussed this morning
accounting requests that we officialize several books weeks after they have been calced in order for them to run reports
we do not officialize these post ids daily for two reasons
0
the deals in these post ids are related to transport hedges that are captured in our transport model
not in erms
if we were to officialize these post ids and report them on the var
we would then be only capturing half of the picture
since the transport model in our p&l is not in erms
0
all of the deals in these books are book to book and do not involve third parties
to keep this action from disrupting your group
the risk leads will forward an email to you when we officialize these post ids at accounting's request
the following is the list rachel crowell in acctg
asked us to officialize on please shout with any questions
thanks
don't forget kam
please send this info to shirley for darron since he is out

i got the form from john with a note on it about lone liquidations
this relates to a physical deal and i thought we went over the specifics yesterday
this relates to 0 for jan and 0 for the remainder
this is a structured deal with john griffith and we were unwinding a previous deal for 0/0-0/0
the remaining original term stayed intact
it appears you are missing some liquidations that would remove this variance
they are please let me know if you have any more questions
this deal is a real pain in the butt
here it is
thanks
fyi
we need to be more careful with which of the two curves above we use for physical deals
we have had some substantial oa for jan 0 production because the basis curves for these two locations were
0 different
usually these are less than
0 different
if you have a physical mich physical it should be mich_cg-gd in tagg
which is michigan consolidated pipe in sitara
if it is consumers power
it will be mich/cons and cec pipe in sitara
any questions
ask
thanks

she can shoot back at these sobs
yet another reason texas is better than cali
we all have guns so no one shoots up schools because they know someone else has got heat and might put a cap in their ass
do you guys want me to order you jazz fest tickets when i order ours
i am putting in an order for alot of people because if i mail order them it only costs $0 total as opposed to ticket master's $0 fee per ticket
since i am ordering ours this way
i can order everyone's and they only pay the ticket price
i eat the $0 because i am doing ours this way anyway
the tickets are $0 through the mail per day as opposed to $0 at the gate and $0 through ticketmaster
let me know
i am ordering all three days for ashley and i hoping we go all three days

if arizona loses
wolfe takes second and if arizona wins

if you believe this to be an error
see me and i will show you the list
i am not calling anyone out for cheating on their vacation

i draw your attention to this matter because we always seem to have a problem at the end of the year with people having a bunch of vacation and only being able to carry over 0 hrs

i have attached the site for your time sheets
you will need your p# and password to access

please put any future requests in there so that we can keep track of who needs off when
i would like to try and keep from having more than 0 people out at a time
0
physical gas daily options
when booking these
please be very careful
these need to have daily swaps on them in sitara as opposed to monthly swaps
this will insure that the physical deal comes to the physical trader at gas daily as opposed to mid
this is very important to avoid oa variances
0
when booking deals in sitara
please look at your swaps when they are created to verify that they are coming at the right mid/gd price
this is important because we have so many deals that are booked to new mids and i notice last night on a gd option
that the swap did not come at the correct gd curve
0
i am going to set up a mtg
for friday or monday to discuss oa
the process and how to prepare forms

please utilize this opportunity to build a relationship with your traders
this is good for career development

muse
bowden
panicked
after lowder told him his job in jeopardy the associated press montgomery
ala
ap
when auburn's football fortunes took a turn for the worse in 0
trustee bobby lowder told coach terry bowden that he would not be retained after the season
former university president william muse said
when bowden resigned on the eve of a game that fall
he said he was essentially fired
basically
mr
lowder told him he would not be around come the end of the season
and coach bowden basically
in my opinion
panicked when he was told that and came and negotiated out of his contract
muse said
more auburn football talkin
tigers forum muse said lowder did not consult with him before speaking to bowden
whose team was off to a 0-0 start
bowden said thursday that lowder actually did not speak directly to him
but went through athletic director david housel
that's how david and i worked
bowden said tuesday in a telephone interview from his orlando home
we would meet and he would tell me what lowder wanted me to do
i felt like i could do everything i could do and it wouldn't be enough
to save his job
muse made his comments to faculty members march 0
a transcript of the meeting was made public tuesday by auburn officials
muse said he was unable to reach bowden until
the wee hours of the morning
then told him that lowder didn't have the authority to fire him and
urged him to stay until the end of the season
muse said that was
the most celebrated case
of lowder taking such a direct role in athletic decisions
but
there are many others
bowden often commented that
mr
lowder hired me
and that the coach had
regular contact
with the powerful trustee
muse said
bowden said he spoke with lowder
weekly
if not daily
during his first two or three seasons
but
never felt it was a situation that he would tell me something and that i should do it
muse said lowder did not hand-pick the coach
he said an eight-member search committee
including lowder
voted unanimously to offer bowden the job in
let's just say i would not have been hired if bobby lowder had not wanted me hired
said bowden
now a television commentator with abc
there's no doubt about it
bobby lowder controlled the committee that hired me at auburn
both lowder and housel have denied bowden's contention that he was told his coaching fate was all but sealed
they also denied that lowder was pulling the strings on that decision
bowden
always believed
that the only way he got that job was because of lowder's influence
muse said
so he believed very strongly that he had to maintain that relationship
muse said that relationship began to sour when bowden fired longtime defensive coordinator wayne hall
muse also said he is not sure what lowder's relationship is with bowden's successor
tommy tuberville
but that he believes basketball coach cliff ellis has
very
very frequent contact
with the montgomery banker
lowder was out of town and did not immediately return a call for comment
earlier tuesday he said in a statement issued by auburn that the trustees
athletic panel he chairs will continue to provide
support and input
to the president and athletic director and that it's time to focus on positive accomplishments and
stop bickering

you guys just have a bad case of penis envy
ha ha
i wanted to ask a favor
would you mind reminding your group to please let us know when they change a pipe or trading zone or add a location to a deal in sitara
if we do not catch this change
the trader will be getting the deal at contract instead of mid
because the swap does not automatically update when you change the physical deal
if the change is simply a meter
that will not effect the pricing of the deal
thanks for your help
gdp-anr/ok
notice a trend here

what about some
treatments
at one of those spas
or dinner for two at
my suggestion for improving the process within the risk group is to do a better job of verifying all term deals are coming to the cash desk at mid
i believe a large improvement can be made in the settlements area
the forms are not accurate
the entire support is not attached and the form they are usign does not properly divide the variance between the three possible areas causing a variance

did you get to this
separate region
it is within the mich p&l
also starting in october
central transport will no longer be in ft-oc
it will be in aruba and needs to continue to roll up to central
do i need to call you back
aruba-sply is an active book
there are just a few deals and there are two with external counterparties
please set up souad mahmassani in risktrac
she is a new trader on the central desk
she will be running the aruba and central transport books
the following books will be her responsibility
souad would need to roll up to the central desk in natural gas
i would say she should be set up similar to denver plachy
please shout with any questions or additional information that you may need
thanks
here is what i said
the only ft-central-opt book that should move to her is the gdl
the others should remain with geoff storey
she also needs to have the intra-cnt-trans-phy book
sorry for the mistake
according to our benchmark guys up here
it looks like the central transport gdl book did not make it into risktrac under souad
the book is named ft-central-opt-gdl
i also should have asked you to send the ft-peoples-gdi book over to souad
it appears that the remaining ft-central-opt
books
prc,bas,idx
are under martin cuilla
these should be under geoff storey
can you please make these changes
thanks for all of your help
just a status reminder of what is going on
please give me a list of your goals and objectives
we will plan on meeting at least once a month and going over those to determine how i can better help you meet those and we can track progress
we now have a file in the central file in excel entitled project list central desk
there are a list of projects already out there that each of you need to sign up for
this will assist in the prc process in terms of providing me with examples of things each of you are doing that are contributions to the organization
if you can think of a project that will be an improvement
please add it
if you add a project
put an expected completion date and then put the date it was completed
we will meet this week or first thing next week to go over the status of each of your
training plans
fyi
andy and martin will be giving classes to the trading track guys on the two different locations
they are opening these classes to everyone
i would recommend that you attend
i am going to try and attend as well
the only catch is there will be a test at the end and the results will be shared with hunter
i think it would look very good if you attend
i only caution you to pay close attention because the two guys have been known to ask tough questions
fyi
i spoke with the erms team about the problem we have with curveview going through runm
if you open runm on your pc instead of a sun machine
you need to open curveview first
if open curveview before any other applications
the screen will be blue and all others will be set up correctly as well
according the erms guys this is an ancient program and they are unable to fix the logic
pass this on to your groups
this post id for ft-im-centr-cad-gdl and it is official
for some reason it is not coming through risktrac
there are no deals in this book
i think you will have to log off
i approved the request
look at the status of your request and see if it says final approved
if it does than try logging off and trying again
thanks
i think that the correlations for the points in the aruba book must be different
her position is 0 contracts long in the book and her var is $0k
is there any way you can tell me the correlations that are being used for the points that she has positions at in that book
the pub codes are
if-nng/vent
ngi/chi
gate
chi./n/border
ngpl-iowa0illin,uf-ngpl/ok-nw
ngi/chi./people,ngi/chi./nipsco,ml0/cg
any help you can provide would be much appreciated
thanks
thanks for your help
due to my lack of a complete understanding of var
can you give me a lesson if you find out exactly why
all i have ever changed are the correlations
thanks
i am headed out to lunch at 0 and will be back by 0:0
is that good
can you check with it
it looks like souad's var is still way too high
thanks
thanks
we will have to take the pma
it looks like a deal entry error
see the bottom of this email for the locations and mappings
thanks for your help and let me know if you need any additional information
can you follow up with the forum group for me
it appears only 0 of my six employees returned the feedback
i have been assured by every member of my team that they sent these in on time
several members of our class yesterday had the same issue
with one not having any returned
this seems curious enough to investigate
thanks for your help
thanks
please exit the tagg deal so that i can look at the deal
jim simpson has moved from the chicago office to the houston office
he will be taking over the mich-cg book
we need to have the books transferred from hunter shively to jim simpson
the books are ft-int-cen-mkt0-bas,gdi,gdl,idx,prc and intra_cnt-mkt0-phy
jim should not need to be set up in the system
because he was in chicago
he should just need books added
thanks for all of your help
thanks a million
looks like our outing for october 0th for risk just got cancelled
so are we on for some poker on thursday the 0th
who will offer up there house
goss and you can't go now because of some lagrasta trip on saturday so looks like we are rescheduling for sometime in december
sorry to keep bothering you
it looks like souad's var continues to go down
but her net positions 0 contracts and her var is over $0k
can you verify that it is her aruba book that is causing all of the var
she only has positions at about 0 locations and they should all be mapped to the same omicron curve and either ng or chi
gate
i would think that there would not be that much difference between ng and chi gate
any assistance is greatly appreciated
thanks
denver is not my region
you might want to try anne bike
what do you think about setting up a meeting between your group and mine in which each of us gives a short 0 minute presentation on what we do and how things other groups do affect our group
if you think we will need more time
maybe we set up two meetings
let me know what you think
thanks
sure
i will have it to you in the morning
i got 0c0 for next wednesday from 0:0
0:0
how does that sound
can you run a component var report again for me
we can not figure out where souad's var is coming from
it fixed the curves and burton fixed them on his side
the var should be virtually nonexistent
i am also noticing a high var for virawan yawaponsiri
can you also run one on hers please
sorry to continue to bother you with this
jeff gossett just wants this resolved asap
thanks
can you unarchive post id 0
thanks
thanks
just wanted to follow up and make sure we were still on for tomorrow
can we make it 0:0 at chucks barbque
i have your numbers and will give you a call if we run into trouble
thanks

thanks
i too am a little worried about the outcome on saturday
i am bringing two friends that are university of texas alums and am just hoping to show them a good time and what true tailgating is all about
there will be including myself 0 adults and my 0 year old son
is that too many
please let me know
everyone is extremely exciting and my son is now to the age that he will really enjoy it
last year we always took him on game day to see the raptors and he was kind of interested
but now he really enjoys animals
thanks again for all of your help arranging this trip
please also let me know again when the scholarship dinner is going to be held
i am sure some of my family would really enjoy attending
thanks see you at chuck's
sounds great
yes it will
this deal is still in the structuring stage
we simply wanted to get the books set up in tagg and sitara for if and when this deal goes live
i will keep you posted
i think that logistics is also going to be setting up a pipe called mgu that will have all of these deals on them
i will get with you when i hear the final so that we can map the correct curves to these locations
thanks
can you guys map the following curve
empress-us/im needs to be mapped to dawn and omicron 0
please shout if you have any questions
thanks
fyi we will be having a meeting next wednesday from 0:0 to 0:0 with logistics in 0c0 to go over what risk does and what logistics does
should be an informative session
please also remember to email your goals for the next six months so that we can work on making sure you meet those objectives
thanks
from talking with my guys
i came up with 0 more topics for brown bags
curve mapping and how physical deals flow through the systems
works for me or i can do it
i can not do the first one
i vote for kam
see attachment for changes
boy did you call it 0 months ago
we shocked the world
what a great game
i just wanted to thank you again for the great tour we had on friday
everyone talked about it all weekend and we look forward to the expanding projects at the raptor center and hope to be able to help in those efforts
it was great meeting you and i look forward to talking to you again in the future
thanks again

i was out of the office and asked him to respond
let me know and i can get it for you
thanks
kam keiser suggested i call you to help with a request i received from our auditors
can you give me a list of all of the deals that have been put into sitara for the chicago office
the book/counterparty name will be enovate
the arthur anderson auditors have requested this information
they are doing an audit of enovate and want a list of all of the deals since the book started in order to get a sample size for their audit
you should not have to go back farther than 0/0
thanks for your help and shout if you need anymore information
kam keiser suggested i give you a call
the auditors have requested all the deals for the chicago office books
i need to get a list of all tagg deals since 0/0 that are done with the book ft-enov and intra-enov
is this possible
i need to give a list to arthur anderson as soon as possible
thanks for your help
i think the only other solution is to post two curves
one with an sp and one with pr
you should be able to simply set up the same curves as risk type pr and have it look to the sp curve
then you would publish two curves with the exact same name and value
just two different risk types
the only other option i see is to change the deals back to the
old
aeco curve that we used prior to this
i am in
attached is a book request for two new books
one for lavorato and one for cuilla
due to the problems we had last week/this weekend that you guys helped us try and resolve
we are going to have to go the route of canada on these aeco deals and book a spreadsheet for var purposes
please set the two books up like calgary's book
sheet 0 on the attached file
we need to start doing this tonight
because hunter and lavorato want their var reported correctly tonight
they both plan on altering their positions and utilizing all of their var
i apologize for the short notice and appreciate all of your help so that i can get this fixed for tonight's var
please let me know any additional information i can provide you
thanks
this incorporates the change of stevens orig
fyi
i will show you how to work this spreadsheet
just call this guy and tell him what you are going to name the file and why
tell him it is like brian gillis
file in canada
he needs to know the prefix you are going to call the file and then you attach the current date in the mmddyyyy format
thanks
open the file and look at the lavo tab
can you take a look at this natalie
i think you have the binder
let me know if i can help
thanks
i want to keep the two ladies that currently do my oa
any deviation from this will result in bodily harm to you and your family
jennifer who
i had no problems accessing it
thanks
this book simply replaces a book that we were officializing for position purposes only
we have a separate gas daily calc that is for value that goes into our p&l
nothing has changed with that book
please shout with anymore questions
thanks
the deal still has not been signed
so nothing is currently in those books
correct
the information contained in this book matches the information that is in another book that you capture in our p&l
thanks
schrab is going to have to answer this question
he put the deal in after sep began
sorry i can not help
do not suspend this cpid
because we have physical and gas daily deals that are active in this book
sorry for the delay
thanks for your help on this
bharat asked that i forward this information to you
could you please map the following curves to the appropriate omicrons
monchy and ngpl-ia-il should be mapped to chicago
omicron #0 and st
clair should be mapped to omicron #0
do i need to also send this information to burton in the controls group
thanks for your help
here is an updated list of the omicrons
according to bharat
he still does not have access to this screen
is there anyway you guys can do it today and he can continue trying to log in and do it for us in the future
thanks
thanks
sorry you could not open it
it was a pretty funny powerpoint slide
your brother still has not responded to my email
i talked with your dad last night
i think we are going to be hitting dinner with them in the next week before they head out of town
hope pregnancy is going well
can you map the following three curves to omicron curves
nilay did his side and i need you to do the other side according to the it guys
can you let me know when this is done so that i can get souad's var rerun
thanks for your help
you also need to let me know if you guys can go to lunch on me on friday
here are souad's book names
bharat is going to give you the portfolios
thanks for all of your help
we have actually been able to find that bread here at sam's
so we are absolutely set man
if they stop selling it
we can get it over the internet
it is just a little pricier
you need to get us to start buying it here and shipping to you man
sam's has it for less than $0 a loaf
i think ashley said it is close to $0 in san diego
we still need to get you some soup don't we
this should be mapped to omicron 0
how about friday
maybe it was over the internet that the bread was so expensive
you guys still have charger fever out there after a few loses
he is in vegas
dude
you are freakin riot
i almost fell out of my chair with that one
you know what else does
crawfish pie
her name is sladana kulic
she goes by anna
thanks for your help
she is really excited about talking to you and i will bring her by and introduce her
thanks again
all indications are that we will be here
i have not heard anything new to the contrary
if you need to take it off
take it as vacation for now
unfortunately i will be on vacation
thanks for the offer
see this spreadsheet
you will see that previous months match
this spreadsheet comes straight from our crude guys
if the counterparty continues to disagree
get documentation from them and we can take it to the crude guys
thanks
here is a list of the types of deals that always fail
gdd dawns deals eol#0 physical dawn deals fail
eol will only let one trader map their deals to one physical book
don't think you can fix this one
eol#0 mich basis swaps eol #0 this should be a comprehensive list
thanks
attached is a file from the it team for the tagg numbers that are in the enovate books
please shout if you have any questions
thanks
russ/george
has this new location been mapped to the same curves as the previous location
pglc/ngpl
from my standpoint
i think that is the only thing that needs to be done with the exception of changing/adding swaps on these deals
please let me know
thanks
i have a pre existing meeting on this day
i can attend the monday session
this report just in on the wire
0 students at louisiana tech have been detained on possible immigration violations
their names
bin losin
bin cryin
bin whinin they were captured at a football game between la tech and auburn university
we definitely got a scare this weekend
how bout those bolts
took down the mighty broncos
have you been to any games this year
i am sorry
but that will be the only game the chargers play the rest of the year i will not route for them
i am a die hard raider fan
i am sure they are your least favorite team
how about ladanian
he is ripping it up for me in fantasy
fyi
when entering deals with canada
please remember to have the counter parties in a financial deal to be ecc and riskmantra and a physical deal it will be ena to ecc
also remember on gas daily out months
0 legs
that the book on the gas daily swap leg needs to be intra-cnd-we-gd not intra-cand-west
this book is for basis piece
also
please remember to check your new deals completely every day
this will help eliminate future oa variances
do not rely on your trader to catch mistakes
thanks
just think if he came to camp on time how many yards he might have
i am a big lester hayes fan
i wish they still let them wear stick em
i think he called it stick em and he just ran his hands through his hair
jason has never heard of him
but is going to ask around
i will keep you posted
here is the updated file
in
nxavc is just like nymex
it settles as one price for the entire month
i don't know what you mean look for pricing for 0/0-0/0
nxavc is a monthly index
please clarify
i think the confusion with this lies in the fact that last month we had the same issue and i thought you put these deals that are desk to desk in tagg back on my region
these relate to fixed price lock ins with peoples
i think what happened last month happened again this month which is settlements and the risk person did not get the fixed price lock ins done until the following month
we will have to try and work on this for this month
the problem is that they can take their volumes on several deals and we have to wait until it is completely scheduled
sorry for the confusion
unfortunately
i do not have any information about these deals
with these being it day deals
the schedulers and traders will have all of your information
sorry
try sylvia pollan
she is the originator on the deal
try these instructions and let me know if this works
thanks
i can not remember if i called you friday or not
let me know when you want to get together and go over the consumers stuff
sorry if i forgot
the mornings are the best for me
fyi
keep an eye out for this
here in lies the problem
these fix price locks are not deal specific
rather counterparty specific
therefore
we can not modify prices until the end of the month when we know which deals flowed volumes and which did not
this means we have to do this the last two days of the month along with all of the other things we are doing
for every month since may
except september we have been able to do this
it just so happens the one time we do not do it
we had the most locks
the problems we had in previous months were due to liquidations hitting central that should have hit chicago
same deals
different issues
thanks
trip to steamboat
jan
0-0 $0 a night for a house that sleeps 0
that works out to $0 a couple for the week
0 nights
that will give us 0 days to ski
or 0 on 0 off
continental flys directly to steamboat for $0 roundtrip
need to know interest level asap
we have to pay 0% upon booking the house and %0 within 0 days of arrival
i will pay the %0 up front
i just want a firm committment that you will be going
take a look at the house
it is the bettger house
random people that obviously don't work as hard as you and i and they have the time to spend all day surfing the internet
i apologize
i forgot to tell you earlier today that jason and his family have not heard of this guy
like you said he must be in double springs
please look at sheet 0
0
you will see there are numbers lee attribute to you and i
i wanted to go over the months that there is a large difference
see what counter parties make up the difference so that we can determine the absolute correct number for him
i also wanted to discuss oa if we have time
i have a 0:0 meeting and if you need to get back to the auditors
we can address at a later date
thanks
i won't be visiting that country
what is this i hear that you may have a new job for me
i hope so
we keep going in the toilet on wall street
my 0,0 options are now all worthless
that is what i plan on going as for halloween
once again
it appears we have changed a price desk deal without letting them know
i hope everyone understands how bad this makes our entire team look
this issue continues to be brought up in the staff meeting and we are always the cause of it
this is the second time in less than a week and we have gone over this several times
next time this happens
someone is liable to get an exit early pass from the floor for good
to keep this from happening we will now practice the following rule
anytime a price desk deal that involves the central desk needs to be changed
the person that runs the central book will not leave the floor until errol or joey tells you that there book is ok
if that happens to be midnight
sorry
that is the rule and there will be absolutely no exceptions
sorry i have to be a jerk
but it is obvious that being nice about it has not worked
thanks for your help in eliminating this in the future
maybe we will try that
just incase you haven't gotten enough to read about us lately
so i guess i have to start calling you fancy pants
just call me the harpoon
by the way congrats on the girl
is it going to be mallory
she is going to be 0.0 feet tall
i like the name
i think it is beautiful and distinguished
i hope she is at least six feet tall
there is nothing wrong with a tall drink of water
gotta run and get some work done
pl
please do asap
here are the values
thanks
look at slide #0
jennifer 0-0-0
0-0
so much for the nice machine
hey you are not wearing your target purple shirt today are you
i have mine on and i don't want to look silly
thanks
we talked with martin cuilla last night and he thinks we are missing some transport usage tickets that will offset a major portion of our gain
thanks for your help
most current
here is the location of the file and the person that compiled the file
please let me know if you need anything else
thanks
fyi
looks like this deal got zeroed out and rebooked on #0 look and see if you see this
cp should now be cpr pipeline exchange
no variance should occur
thanks
the report named
emw positions
published as of 0/0/0 is now available for viewing on the website
we flashed this as union
they subsequently moved the volumes on gl to cpr pipeline exchange
you have to look at both to get this to reconcile
does this make sense
if not
give me a call
thanks
the report named
emw p/l
published as of 0/0/0 is now available for viewing on the website
per jad

additionally can you also set up ashley worthing like anne bike
thanks for you help and shout with any questions

it has also been a pleasure working with you
i am sure our paths will cross again in the near future
thanks for all of your help the last year
the report named
emw positions
published as of 0/0/0 is now available for viewing on the website
0 hours
absolutely
that is fucking hilarious
it would be even funnier if it had been you that got kicked out instead of me
i have already talked to the bartender and he understands that in the future
we pour our drinks in the bathroom
not right in front of stadium personnel
also
next year
he is sitting with you
i will be there
my original response
i really would like to see the contract to verify things are not being booked correctly
i spoke with patrice and she does agree that we should not have a large receivable balance
try and get me the contract and i will see what i can do
thanks
this time table of 0 p.m
is not acceptable for risk management
most days we are not done calcing the gas books by 0 p.m
now we have just learned that oracle is down and we do not know when we will get to start the calcing process that we normally start at 0:0
please adjust accordingly
than
thanks
i actually was just wanting a copy of the confirms or contracts that we/they signed in order to verify the prices and volumes
i will try and work on asap tomorrow
thanks
i approve
fyi
please let everyone know in eol of the following changes that are effective as of today
i am now over the east desk
kam is over the west and scott palmer is over central
thanks
total bill was $0
thanks
that is fine
shouldn't spend all of your money on booze and tickets to a game that you only watch half of
we will be in an offsite training session all day thursday
fyi
please pass on the condolences of another part of the auburn family to mr
walker
we are all truly hurt by the passing of his mother
from the recent articles i have read in the alabama papers
it appears she was a phenomenal mother and friend
we were also pleased to see his positive comments regarding his teammates
fellow students and alumni of auburn
the auburn spirit is special and it means a lot to those of us who spent time there to hear current players and students share the same beliefs
we are sure he will continue to honor his mother and her memory by his outstanding play on the field and dedication in the classroom
thank you mr
walker for making us all proud to be an auburn tiger
please respond via email to let us know if the university or anyone else has set up a memorial fund or scholarship in her name
we would really like to donate money in her name
thanks and war eagle
the love family dianne
phillip and ashley houston
texas class of 0
0
and
0
can you let your group know that we have made some changes in responsibility in risk management
kam keiser will be responsible for the west desk
scott palmer will now be responsible for the central desk and i will now be responsible for the east desk
please pass this information on and direct future inquiries accordingly
thanks
boy she looks great
so beautiful
ashley and i are still waiting for a phone call so we can bring dinner by
darron and kristi wanted to join us
give me a call 0
please pass on the sentiments of at least 0 auburn alumni
the students that appear in the pictures from halloween dressed in racial costumes should be immediately expelled from the university and their respective fraternities should be permanently removed from campus
we also think that partypics.com should be disciplined and removed from the vendor list for the university
auburn university and it's related organizations should not contribute money to organizations that are willing to take pictures of such insulting behavior and try and profit from them by selling them to disgusting human beings that would participate in such offensive behavior
as graduates of auburn university and athletic and academic scholarship donors
we are appalled by these students behavior and demand immediate action be taken against them
the longer this issue is not dealt with
the worse our university looks in the eyes of the world
please take action and help save auburn's reputation
thanks for your assistance
the love family dianne
ashley and phillip class of 0',0',0
i wish you would come back
it would give our stock price a shot in the arm

sorry i did not get back with you last night
we were up in navasota all weekend with some friends enjoying the clean and quiet country air
we also went to the renaissance festival
things are getting pretty hectic around here
there are a number of individuals who are responsible for destroying one of the best companies in america in less than a year
it is all pretty amazing and really still has not sunk in
we are all just trying to continue with business as usual and hope for the best
if i do get laid off

i hope so

thanks for the call
in
can you get me copies of the august invoice
cora is very confident we have done everything correctly and i am still disagreeing with her
agreeing with you guys
this is pretty confusing and they did not keep spreadsheets or data about these
so i am having trouble tying all the volumes
could you also get me copies of the pipeline statements for august
it looks like i am also missing one of the pipeline statements from july as well
i do not have the statement for the loan of 0,0
thanks
i am sorry this is taking a while
this deal is very complex and traders/schedulers have not kept good records
yep
the report named
east p/l totals
published as of 0/0/0 is now available for viewing on the website
can each of you please set up minibooks for any deals in your books that are with any dynegy counterparty
we have not gotten the request yet
but we expect lavo to ask gossett at any time for this info and we want to be prepared for a quick turnaround
thanks
shout with any questions
per our discussion in the staff meeting
just wanted to send you an fyi
due to problems that are caused for rac
please roll your p&l's each day from your daily file and not the regions file
the rac group looks at our p&l's in the region files each morning to determine rho and drift and this causes a problem if you have saved your p&l after rolling
it appears as though you have data already captured for current day because it copies and pastes formulas from the prior day to current day
thanks for your help and shout with any questions
fyi
based on a call i got from chris abel in controls
not sure if any of your guys roll from the regions file instead of daily
number here is 0-0-0
if you come back to houston and are job hunting
please give me a call
thanks for all of your hard work and helping with the transitions process
fyi we have made some changes in responsibility in risk
kam is now the desk head for the west desk
scott palmer is now the desk head for the central desk and i am now desk head for the east desk
o'neal remains over texas
thanks and please share with your colleagues
the report named

published as of 0/0/0 is now available for viewing on the website
the report named
east p/l totals
published as of 0/0/0 is now available for viewing on the website

i was going to do it this morning
standard reply is that we will be working on the last day and no one knows what it will be like
make a reservation and we will do our best to get you out
the problem is i am sure everyone wants to get out for new year's eve so you might generate hard feelings
i have nothing to do because i consider it to be the most dangerous night of the year and i always stay home
you decide what you want to do and we will work around it
if you stay here
i have always heard the hyatt has a great party and room rate all included
i am sure other hotels have the same
done
fyi
this is set up and has been added as a tab to the bankruptcy post id sheet

sorry for the mix up
intra-east-phy should be intra-northeast-phy
is this in risktrac
just wanted to let you guys in on a few things we have talked with gossett about
today we officially begin the process for the new company
that being said
we now have to tighten the ship a bit
from now on
please refrain from playing games and surfing the internet all day
if you are bored and don't have anything to do
please look for things to do that are work related
this is a good time to improve your skills and learn about things you are not absolutely proficient in
read some options books
study macros in the p&l's
etc
the key phrase here is work to improve your skills so that we can shake off some of the rust we have developed in the last month
all of this is coming from goss and it is serious
to be a part of the new company you have to show that you are willing to contribute and are the best of the best
i know this sounds harsh
but we have all had a nice vacation and i am sure most of you are like me and looking forward to not having such a boring job
it looks as though bidders will be in this week
so we will have some reports and demonstrations to give
please pull me aside or email me if you have any further questions
thanks and happy new year
let me know what she says
i have my request filled out and saved in the same directory
i will send it to her when we know if she can do it
i just got back from lunch
when you get a chance
please stop by and we can talk about you coming to risk
i sit at the end of the row at the row behind the flag that says gas risk management
thanks
thanks
nice
real impressive
i saved the file for us to send to susan trevino for all the book access requests
i added the control group and put goss
kam
valdes and his people in there
so make sure you add that group to your book requests
please take a look at this file and let me know if we need to make any changes
i plan on sending this file to susan trevino by tomorrow afternoon
the file in located in the netco directory under controls/desk matrix
thanks
fyi
the head hunter that i have been talking to forwarded this job description to me
if you are interested in talking to her
let me know and i will give you the info
she told me the salary is in the $0's
i wouldn't expect anything
i am sure everyone will move over as a lateral
they may do retention packages
but i have not heard anything
i have tried to contact you guys three times today and have been on hold each time at least 0 minutes
i cancelled my service with you over a month ago and asked that you keep from sending me a bill
my service was cancelled immediately and i was told i would receive a bill from you and i would then have to call and dispute the bill to have my account credited
i asked at that time since i had waited on hold that time for 0 minutes that this matter be taken care of immediately so that i would not have to call back and sit on hold again for half an hour
your customer service manager
very rudely i might add
said that was impossible and i would just have to do it anyway
since i have had to wait on hold today for so long i want this email to serve as my dispute and have my account closed and the balance due removed since you terminated my service and i did not get the use of my phone
just a word of advice
i would hire more customer service representatives if you plan on keeping customer to serve
this is by far the worst customer service experience i have ever had with a company and i will make sure all of my colleagues and friends know of this experience
i understand that you don't really care about giving good customer service to your ex customers
but i assure you make a fatal error when you assume those people will not share there experience with current and future potential customers
phillip love acct
number 0w-0
sorry pop
i forgot to send this to you
my home email is plove@houston.rr.com
talk to you this weekend
i heard auburn got rid of off and def coordinator
we will see if that changes anything
i hope it is not woody
vandy sucked at offense and defense
he is horrible and i would hope we would go after somebody else
we need to get someone in there soon so they can put the offense/defense in and the players can start studying it to get a head start on next year
i am afraid if tubby doesn't turn it around next year he may be gone
i got a digital camera for christmas that works real well
i will get some pictures to you
guess what i just heard
steve spurrier has resigned
no word yet on where he is going
check out espn.com i got a canon elph 0 talk to you soon

i need to get your nt login so you can be given access to the calcs
thanks
susan

please let me know if you need something further on these deals
saw this morning we hired petrino
i did not realize how successful he has been at the college level
three times his offenses have led the nation in offense
he also did a good job with quarterbacks
he has three playing in the nfl now that he developed
i think this might be a real good move
how are things there
done
looks like florida will not be very good next year
they are losing their best players to the draft
all three of their receivers and their best cornerback and offensive linemen have now declared for the draft today
add to that they can not get a coach to sign on
shanahan just turned it down
they are now going to new orleans offensive coordinator

the desk took the adjustment and we were waiting on lisa to verify the amounts on the a/r
we need to know the variance on the a/r by month to compare to my analysis and we can then change the prices in sitara
the desk took a 0.0 million dollar expense pma
please let me know if and when you guys have the info and we can get it fixed in sitara
until this gets done
oa will have a variance on flash to actual because the desk already took the adjustment
we wanted to get it in for year end

thanks
would you mind sending russ the list of your people that will need access to sitara in netco
i have send him the list of traders
thanks
come down whenever
we can find something to show you
thanks
done
i agree
per john lavorato
we killed all desk to desk deals on dec
0th
that is why this deal was killed
you mentioned that you had price deals that were not killed
can you give me deal numbers for those as well and we can take a peak and see why they were not killed
it is our understanding that all desk to desk
book to book
should be killed because no cash actually changes hands
should this deal have been with an external counterparty
is this value on these deals rought 0k
if so
tell portfolio acct to put them in and generate a pma for the gas books
it is not worth investigating for such a small number and the deal ended 0/0
are these the only four deals you have with the gas desk
attached is a file from eol that has all the current products
we are trying to do a mass mapping for the systems of all of these products
as you mentioned
not all of these products will roll out initially
but we wanted to go ahead and map them in the system
i have put in the old trader's names in a column
column f
if you could check out the list when you get a chance and let me know if you want to change the traders on any of the products and who will be trading the products for the traders that are not moving over
names highlighted in green
also
there are no current products under jason wolfe
matt smith or jane tholt
please let me know if we need to create products for them or if we will be moving existing ones to them
please also let me know which traders need to also have a physical book
the list i gave you this morning is the financial books we set up
thanks for your help and let me know if you have any questions or concerns
let o'neal know if you will be in or out so that we can get some fillers
thanks for the file
i am attaching the basis curves we have set up and the gdy curve file as well
i am finishing the physical as we speak
please look at these three files and let me know if you would like any changes
we are only putting the published curves in the files
at least to begin with
west basis is the rockies at southwest curves and ca basis is the california markets
thanks
thanks for the eol products email
i am attaching the curve files
the ca basis is the california markets and the west basis is rockies and sw
the third file is the gdi curves
please review and let me know if we need to make any changes or additions to this file
they are pretty simple and straightforward and do not link to anything currently
let me know what you think
i am sending them in three different emails because of the size
i will have the physical/gd curve file to you by monday
thanks
looks like the search continues
thanks
i can not open the file

i have also seen him trying to buy beer
that is absolutely hilarious
i have heard a rumor that the chargers are considering moving to la
is that correct
that will be absolutely horrendous
i saw the game of the century the other day on espn classics
chargers vs
dolphins 0
truly awesome
my man at the time winslow
racist
got carried off three times
attached is the curve file for phys and gas daily
i made this extremely simple on our first pass
but i left in the tabs that were in the old/current file
all you would do would be to go to the fin tab and hard code balance of month price for each of the curve locations
yellow column
this will then set the gas daily curve
we will continue to true up to gas daily each day
you may want to also reset the next day's curve as well
since this is a hardcode
you simply type over the previous day's load
the phys tab pulls from the fin tab and adds the phys prem to it
we can increase the complexity of this file by adding formulas or tabs if you like
i figure you will want to keep your model and i can pull info from there as well
i simply wanted to start out at a baseline and build it to best fit your needs
please let me know what you would like to see changed and we will do it
thanks
what
i thought that was your team
i am a big raiders fan and i hope chucky gets that ring this year
hey
fyi
we are getting a guys trip to las vegas for the first weekend of march madness if you are interested
march 0-0th
got a room at the mirage and it is $0 per person for the three nights
i figure air fare is pretty cheap from sd
let me know if you are interested
take care
i just saw a fare from sd for $0 roundtrip
i have to seriously consider moving out there if it is that cheap to go to vegas
hahaha
i am talking to bosse on the phone and both of us fell out of our chairs with that one
you kill me chef vito
p.s
bosse said bring your ass to new orleans
just win baby
i will get her on it
i will have her wear on denise in the same manner i am wearing on you
i was under the impression that there was an outstanding a/r and a/p balance on this counterparty in the 0-0 million dollar range
should be pretty noticeable
i think there is also some stuff under a subsidiary of nicor
northern illinois
make sure both are included
if you guys can get the balances and which deal numbers are outstanding i think we can match up with the cpr reports that i have
should be nicor and northern illinois
if you want to round up the deal numbers/invoices and such
we can get together and i can show you the deals i am showing a variance on
i took an adjustment to the desk for 0.0 million and that is for jan 0
oct 0
production only
let me know
thanks
that sucks
the west books should be gd and gdy for canadian deals
i would think that the central books should have two set up
one for p/b/i and one for gd
i believe i had called you and said that the books should be set up like ft-ont-gdl for the gas daily books
this is correct
thanks
pretty funny
absolutely
i will make the changes and have something to you this afternoon
please modify the curve files you are currently loading to incorporate the database changes
these changes need to be made today
please ask myself or russ if you need any help
thanks
i need all of your official post ids from your old books for the date of 0/0/0
please email them to me asap
are you going to handle this
thanks
please let me know what risk types each of these postids is please
here it is
already got them slacker
here is the file
you would change the two curve tabs and the publish tabs are linked up
the bom file is unchanged
the two basis files now only have basis curves in them
let me know any changes you would like
thanks
i suppose
east is done
looks like due to the enron debacle
you guys can make some money
on ebay the cups i sent you are going for $0 and higher
make your money while you can
do we need to make any changes to the eol products
i see that steve south is now on the trader list
does he need any products for eol
i will work on the curves and get with you on a first pass
thanks
i apologize
we have been a little delinquent on the thank you cards this year
we are usually really good about it
he got those horses and absolutely loves them
we got him a fisher price farm for christmas and he had just opened that when he opened the horses
we couldn't get him to open another give for half an hour playing with those horses
they go great with the farm and plays with them all the time
thanks
here is a rough draft of what we discussed yesterday
let me know what if any changes need to be made and we can sit down with couch
thanks
greg couch forwarded your email address to me saying you were interested in some enron logo sleeves of golf balls
i have four sleeves of titleist tour prestige 0 and 0 sleeves of pinnacle gold distance golf balls
please let me know if you are interested and what you are willing to pay
i am going to put them on ebay tonight if i do not here from you
if you are not interested
i apologize for the message
thanks
that is funny
i just ordered some more to sell on ebay
i can buy four sleeves for $0.0 and they are going for $0 a sleeve on ebay
you might want to sell them
we were actually a skit last week on saturday night live
pretty funny stuff
keep working on your wife about jazz fest
ash is working her too
i think they have finally changed the way our addresses work
it is phillip.m.love@enron.com for now
we will see if it changes to ubs
where are you traveling to today
not sure what happened
i think i am fixing to put a whole bunch of enron stuff on ebay
people are making money hand over fist with this stuff
the books title is options
futures
and other derivatives by john c
hull
the publisher is prentice hall and the isbn # is 0
thanks a million
isn't it crazy
someone is selling a risk management book that they gave us in a class here for $0
unbelievable
i am putting stuff out there tomorrow when it comes in
we have a signature shop here that we can buy that same sleeve of balls for $0
i figure you are going to turn around and sell them on ebay
current price is $0
so
i will sell you the two pinnacle cases for $0
roughly $0 a sleeve
i now have two cases of the titleist golf balls that will also sell at the same price
i can send you a picture tonight
when i get home
i can ship tomorrow or saturday
i will pay for the shipping
if you are interested
let me know
thanks
i feel confident i can sell them on ebay for at least $0 a sleeve
so i will go at that way
thanks anyway
good luck
attached are the curve files for your part of the west
basis
index
gdy
phy and gas daily
please take a look and make sure i have not put a curve in the wrong region
due to size

i understand we are splitting the west into two regions

i am attaching the curve files we have created
please take a look at them and make sure i am not missing curves or have included wrong ones
we are only going to be setting published locations initially
i am sending you the curves in three parts due to the size of the files
the index file has phys index and gdy
and the phy file has bom phys and gd
please let me know if you have any questions
thanks
i just left you a voice mail and wanted to follow it up with an email regarding the termination of deals

thanks again and look forward to hearing from you soon
thanks
i will put the balls in the mail today
congratulations on winning the auction on ebay for the enron values cube
please let me know if you will be paying by paypal
alove@houston.rr.com
or by money order/cashier's check
as soon as i receive payment
i will mail the cube by priority mail
please send me your mailing address
if you respond during the day
respond to this email address
the alove@houston.rr.com is for my home account and i can not access it from work
thanks again
fyi
total is $0.0
please send another sleeve of those pinnacle golf balls to the address below as well
he has paid our paypal account
thanks
i have you down for $0 plus shipping
not $0,0
i show that you bid at $0.0 and at $0
there was no bid for $0.0 listed at all
i am sorry if you did not mean to bid $0
but it is hardly out of the range
these balls were selling this weekend for $0-0
if your winning bid was $0 or higher i could understand your complaint and we could make an adjustment
but $0 is not an unreasonable amount
please let me know if you are planning on paying the $0
i will pay shipping if you use paypal
if not
i need to contact ebay for resolution
i need a response as soon as possible
thanks
add steve south to the trader list and remove the following from risk
zach mccarroll
stephanie hopkins
thanks
can you get the process rolling on this additional book for the west
thanks
sorry for the confusion
i was sending out several emails today
i will send out the golf balls when i receive your money order
the address for you to send it to is
phillip love
p.o
box 0
houston
tx 0
thanks and sorry for the confusion
give me your mailing address and i will get those golf balls in the mail
thanks
need your mailing address to send golf balls
i received your paypal payment
i would suggest you take it up with ebay
see my attachment regarding ebay's policy on non paying bidder
i have tried to contact the person that you outbid
the person that bid $0
he has not responded
i would suggest you try and contact him to have him pay for the item at his highest bid
i have bid on items before on ebay and it clearly asks you twice to confirm your bidding amount
i would be more than willing to change your payment if the price got way out of wack
$0 is actually cheaper than some of the balls were going for this weekend
i hope the person that bid $0 will respond and
get you off the hook
otherwise
ebay will have to intervene on your behalf
i guess it is possible
their system messed up
but it looks like you approved a bad bid
sorry
good luck

as i said
take it up with ebay or the individual you outbid
i see your max bid says $0
an obvious mistake that you had to approve unless ebay made a mistake
for the last time $0 is obviously not out of the price range for those balls this weekend
you won by a dollar
you can cancel your bid before the auction ends and you did not
per the attachment i sent
you have another 0 days to decide to pay or get ebay to adjust it or i will seek payment through them
this is an issue you need to resolve with ebay
i was more than willing to work out a negotiated payment with you since i was willing to take your word you made a mistake
but you have been very rude from the beginning
good luck
fyi
not sure if you know this yet
but you need to become verified on paypal before your payment can go through
this usually entails you getting the two amounts from your bank account that they drafted
usually pennies
once you are verified
i will receive the funds and i will mail out the cube
thanks
please send this person a sleeve of the titleist balls
should be in the garage and send a sleeve of the pinnacle balls to robert stokes
you should have an email in your box from last night
also would you mail the two envelopes on the counter
thanks

thanks
just curious if this got done last night

is this the last list we are going to get
jeff gossett wants to know if we are done so that we can assure don miller that all of the cp's have been taken care of
thanks
can you tell me if this is the last financial list we are going to get
jeff gossett wants to be able to tell don miller if we are completely done or not
can i also get a master list of all financial cp's we should have moved to the bankruptcy book
we want to run some reports to make sure it has gotten them all out of the price book
thanks
fyi
here is the info i have
as she said
not exactly the answer we wanted
i am still waiting on a final list to cross reference with our calcs
we can now calc the price book and we will cross reference the list with a fwd detail of the price book to verify there are no deals with terminated counter parties
because of the translation to the bankruptcy book
we can not calc the bankruptcy book for a while
so we will cross reference those in the morning
i will keep you posted
would you prefer me mailing or delivering personally to you
i was planning on shipping this afternoon
just let me know
i will be out of the office tomorrow
let me know whatever you prefer
this is complete
these deals have been moved previously
thanks
attached is a file with the cp's that are terminated per kim's list and had been sent to it to move to the bankruptcy book
there are six cp's on this list
i will send the legal names to cecilia to get these moved today
with 0,0 lines
i am afraid it would take at least a day for risk to move manually
we will then recheck the book tonight
as you will see on the summary page
the total value of these deals is $
0.0m
if there are any questions
please let me know
i will bring hard copies to the 0a.m
meeting

ena is the enron counterparty
from ng-price to ena-ft-wc-sj
i will get you the list before lunch tomorrow
just thought you could get started on the script
thanks again
darron and i may need it if ed does not cut the cord by tomorrow
i would prefer not to have access to force him to use the estate people
can you do the same thing with a different book id
instead of book counterparty ft-cand-termin
move any deals with the ft-termin-gd book to the bankruptcy book from ng-price
financial deals only
thanks
let me know if you need any further clarification
should be the exact same script as yesterday
just substitute ft_termin-gd for the two books you were looking for yesterday
can you tell me why eh0.0 is not on the list
we are moving eh0.0
in the comments it says it is an unwind of leg 0
counterparty is boston gas
thanks
the positions file for last night is saved out to o_dropbox and is attached
attached is the list of counterparties we need moved today

there are rumors around here that all the employees going to the new company
ubs energy will be taken off of the enron servers tomorrow
if this is true
i do not know what or when my email service at work will be back up
please send in the mean time any emails to plove@houston.rr.com
thanks
hope all of you are doing well
ng-price contains all physical and all intercompany ena-ft-wc-sj financial deals that are out of the money ena
ft-wt-socal financial deals that are in the money shout with anymore questions
do you have an estimated time on retranslation
thanks
we just wanted to let you guys know of some changes in order to keep the terminations being processed in a timely manner
it appears that all netco employees may be taken off of systems access for enron this weekend
in case this is true
darron and i have transitioned from handling these requests
greg couch is going to be leading the estate risk effort and pat ryder and chance rabon will be handling all termination list issues
please send these lists to these three people in lieu of darron and i
as a side note
could you send an updated financial termination list
if this list has changed since you sent it to me kim
to these guys so that they can verify deals are moved to the proper book
it is probably a good idea for future termination scripts to come through greg before going to it because of several book moves we have made to facilitate reporting to ed mcmichael
for example the price book has been basically split into three books
please shout with any questions or concerns you may have
thanks
as far as i know
see previous email
this is the most current list
i would also use this list to verify the basis options are up to date
per our conversation earlier
pat
chance

the very first time that i laid eyes on steve susman
he was clad only in his underwear
moreover
he was shouting and angrily brandishing his fist at me
the northern lights may have seen stranger sights
but i assure you i have not
in 0 or 0
you will understand that i have repressed the actual date
i journeyed to fort worth
texas as a representative of the texas law review to attend some state bar of texas committee meeting
one being held
i think
in conjunction with an annual meeting of the bar
the law review had reserved a few rooms at one of the downtown hotels
i arrived late at night
dutifully registered at the hotel's desk
received my room key
took the elevator to the designated floor
walked to my room
inserted the room key
and opened the door
the darkness that shrouded the room was suddenly pierced by a flare of light that revealed to my astonished eyes a bear of a man
almost naked
leaping out of the bed toward me
shaking a very large fist in the vicinity of my face
and demanding to know why i had violated the sanctity of his room
it will surprise none who know steve to learn that although he was adamantly insisting on an explanation
he refused to be quiet long enough for me to offer him one
knowing even at my then tender young age a madman when i see one
i exited the scene of the controversy with as much speed as my terrified legs could muster and rushed back to the front desk with my tale of adventure and close escape from severe bodily injury
there may well have been some talk of calling hotel security or the fort worth police
but in the end i settled for a new room
the door of which i bolted immediately
after a mostly sleepless night during which i anticipated the imminent reappearance of the madman
i arose
showered
dressed
and carefully made my way to the meeting room
during the course of the day
i spotted the madman across the ballroom engaged in conversation with another individual
surreptitiously pointing him out to one of my friends
i asked if he knew him
the answer was no
but he did know who he was
the name is susman
my man
steve susman
i immediately resolved that my path and that of
susman
my man
steve susman
would never again cross
truth is indeed stranger than fiction
how could i have possibly foreseen as i fled from the madman in that forth worth hotel room so many years ago that not only would my path again cross his but that i would one day serve as his lawyer
that he would serve as mine
and that i would count him as one of my closest friends
i hereby officially forgive you
steve
not only for stealing my fort worth hotel room but also for the injury you wished on me that night
looking back on it
i wouldn't want it to have been any other way
i wish you the happiest of birthdays
steve
thanks for your friendship--i treasure it
all the best

unfortunately
it appears that carrin and i will not be able to attend after all
an enron policy committee
essentially
our executive committee
of which i am a member
meeting has been called for monday
and i must attend it in person
the flights from la to houston on sunday night depart too early to enable us to attend the la event
and the earliest flight on monday morning arrives in houston too late for me to attend the policy committee meeting timely
we are extremely disappointed
as you may imagine
we are very appreciative of your kind invitation and look forward to seeing both of you soon
we will watch the event on television in the hope that we see you being interviewed
i know you will represent us well
let us know if your plans include a houston trip--we would welcome the opportunity to entertain you

i would have no way of getting back in time for the monday meeting
and
0
if it were not cancelled
the most-of-the-night journey back would not leave me in the condition i need to be in to participate effectively in the meeting

as we know
february can be a very difficult month from the standpoint of weather
which affects not only travel to and from the event but also any outside activities during the event
do we have any flexibility with respect to the month in which the institute is held
if it is to be held in february
i would opt to try houston
new orleans
or santa fe
i suggest that
if possible
we avoid scheduling the conference on valentines day or any holiday

volume grid
lump sum $ amount or annuity amount
as discussed our cost of funds implied will be libor + 0 basis points
to be confirmed
ena will raise a precedent agreement with option language in favor of calpine which allows you to request that the period 0 volume be no less than the period 0 volume and up to the total delivered volume of 0,0 based on the agreed to % discount as referenced in point #0
ena will forward the draft precedent agreement which will include the necessary conditions precedent required and with the general commercial terms as agreed per items above

bt
assuming that our bid's stay in the range discussed previously
what are we going to do
i am not going to hard trade the buyers at this point until we know for sure suncor is there
so
can you pls advise
i would suggest we get suncor to give you a
stand still
for the rest of this week which includes a firm number
or better
that they will sell capacity for
by the way
this number needs to be close to zero as there is not much left over
current economics
approx $0,0 bid on the table
plus ena holds option apr 0
oct 0 to put capacity to buyer
under this structre suncor keeps capacity until apr
0
there are no liquids conversations being conducted at this time and pending structure may not be
none of the financial markets support premium payments
for any term
give me a call
bt
pls advise group that we will be meeting today and advise the video staff to ensure it is up and running

the whole reason for setting up and getting approval is being accountable to the plan
give me a call
when you have a moment
bt
steph
what do you think about rfping the pgt capacity if and when we get a standstill from suncor
i was thinking we could send to smud
morgan stanley
calpine
perhaps avista
it might be a bit radical
but perhaps can drive out the highest value
bt
jessica
as part of the process when updating or adding items to my calendar or stephanies
pls send a note to me advising who it is and what the planned agenda is
thanks
bt
dave
we believe that avista has been kicking tires on picking up some term pgt
nova and ang capacity
we may be selling it

we will probably have 0,0 mmbtu/day
starting out of nov 0
0 years

ray
seems like its been a while since we met in san fransisco
and of course so much has happened since then
i have been talking with our in house legal and with canada and i know eric and yourself have also been talking
i believe that the door has been pushed open a little and if everyone tries to get these agreements cleaned up and executed that pg&e and enron
canada
us
can start to transact
with that being said
there are two areas which i would like to refresh from our discussions
0
did you give any further thought to the utilization of daily gas sales as a collateral
i truly believe that this vehicle is a very efficient,easy way for pg&e to enhance the credit with ena and once we have a 0 day bucket
we can get you trading access to eol
lot's of details to work out
but i would like to keep this discussion at the forefront
i can send the details of how this proposal would work if required
let me know
0
as discussed
ena holds some 0 year el paso capacity
i am looking to assign this capacity and possibly and would like to investigate your supply requirements and possible alternatives such that you can consider our capacity
i trust all is well and look forward to talking to you soon

fyi mark
i talked to fred
this meetingis cancelled until further notice
and for sure you and your people were going to be invited
bt
paul
let's try to find some time on friday to discuss next steps
bt
when you talk to robert neustaedter
ask him about the montebello storage field in socal's territory that was blown down this year
i would like to know what application they filed
when it started and a summary of the details regarding this deal
there was about 0 bcf blown down
bt
can you see if you can float out these tickets for tonights game
i cannot make it
i have all 0
bt
leslie
further to our conversation
i don't think the prize in $$$'s is going to give us the leverage we had hoped but i will know better early next week exactly what that looks like
at the very least
we are going to position ourselves with el paso such that we can have a commercial discussion
bt
in consideration of the sensitivities regarding this asset and ena's efforts to manage this risk
i believe we need to formalize and coordinate any external communication with el paso
please advise by name who your lead contact is or would be and what the general purpose of the conversations is concerning
if you do not have a primary contact or do not talk directly to the pipeline
pls advise
thanks

further to your voice message
yes
i did meet in person with robert ayers
the meeting went well
and he was going to contact me on friday
he was considering another offer
a different co
and wanted to make a decision this week
as such i committed to informing him as to whether or not an offer will be made to him
at this time
i am not going to make an offer and will advise him as such upon my next contact
although he has some good qualities i am going to continue in my search
bt
looks like i lost another game
in total i lost $0.0 on sunday
isn't this fun
ps
nice race car in the lobby
can we take it for a spin
pls print out copies for my files
thanks
mark
i was looking at that pricing sheet and would like to suggest that the shading in the commentary boxes
under the assumption that this becomes a printed document and that it is printed in black
white
it is very difficult to read
perhaps a more solid background would work better
bt
steph
further to our discussion
pls review
i took a quick look at the locations and most appear to be east based
you might want to use an analyst to figure this out
also
they have valued the inventories off of the nymex only
or so it appears
and i would have to believe that the value of these molecules is materially different than this
pls review and let's discuss asap
bt
i talked to robert ayers
he is going to accept a job with another co
bt
i am available
pls put on my calender to block off
barry
trust all is well
i just wanted to update you on a couple of things and re-check smud's interest
0
the on again off again pgt assignment of 0,0 mmbtu per day out of nov
0
appears to have surfaced from our counter party again and under the assumption you are still interested i will forward to you latest offer once we have firmed it up with the third party
0
it is my understanding that you own el paso
pg&e topock capacity until may 0
0
ena has some of the same capacity and is prepared to offer this into the market place from the period june 0
0
may 0
0
with the renewal rights
plus some sort of
payment
from ena to smud
rather than renew your existing capacity at full tolls
this is a way to pick up transport below the normal tariff and retain renewal rights after 0
pls advise if either of these points capture your interest
thanks in advance
barry tycholiz
peter
eric
i talked to bradford this a.m
regarding another matter and managed to discuss with him general credit terms for pg&e
he said he would review post petition credit status and also needs to discuss these credit lines as potentially part of our ongoing issues related to pg&e
he was going to discuss internally and advise
i am not sure he will have any comments back by this weds
so this may conflict with the timelines eric and i discussed this a.m
bt
pablo
i did infact lose my
d
drive on my dell computer so it does not recognize the set up
should i go re-install my hard drives
and if so
how do i do that
bt
good news on the cms deal

bt
mara
pls ensure that everyone takes the time today to fill this out with all the customers that we can market this to
including names and action plan
i will need to review with phillip and john later today
bt
mike
for your info
we just received this message from igs re
dwr purchases
as previously discussed seeing the dwr rfp will require some credit and contract enhancements and that process is underway but it is moving slower and with less push than i would like
for sure
there are alot of hurdles
it is our opinion that any transactions that are being done by the dwr with third parties are relatively short dated
0 month
0 month etc
but we will keep you posted as we move forward
bt
fyi
miquel has decided to not pursue anything with in my group
he did say that he was still considering yours
good luck
i did tell him that we were hopefull that he would stay within ena wholesale

further to our meeting last week
the contracts have been executed and the rockies transportation has been sold to cms
origination and trading participated in the p&l
orig = $ 0,0,0
trading approx $0,0
we are a little closer to our q0 targets of $ 0mm in sept
please call if there are any questions
bt
good morning
there is no issue on your e-mail that is going to get in the way of family issues
so don't worry about that
don't knee cap the band because you guys owe me $ 0,0.0
i was just checking on what your decision was
keep me posted
bt
sonya
further to our conversation the other day
i am still not able to read the first couple of letters on the left hand side of the page under headlines
have you had a chance to look at this
bt
never did
but glad we were here to ensure it was captured
bt
can i have copies of this
i would probably drop the range volume and go with a specific amount
0,0
0,0 instead of up to 0,0 as i am sure there is no way they will get that high
bt
sure
eric
i have at least 0 tickets and possibly 0 tickets for tonights game
i believe it starts at 0:0 pm
i did ask eric boyt
have not heard back
can you see if you or any of your people would like to use them
let me know
i want to make sure they get used
bt
we are working on it
but i have been distracted and slowing the process down
bt
good morning
tim belden
trading
and chris calger
origination
are in charge of all power issues in the west u.s
i would also think paul kaufman may already have a hand in these issues
if puc related
bt
sorry i couldn't pick you up on the call
i would love to play
bt
interesting
and probably true
i was watching the news last night and it is unbelievable how much scrutiny all of these assets are going to get in the next little while
the reality is that everything could be a terrorist target
nukes
water
tall buildings
stadiums,electrical generation assets
fuel depo's
crop dusters
pls keep us posted
the implication here is that expansion projects like transwestern could receive pressure on their ability to expand as the generation equation gets stirred up
sonya
can you please contact frank vickers
vp east orig
he was looking at my screen and was interested in getting it
also
can you provide for him a report on what systems his group currently has and whether or not there is an opportunity to reduce some of his costs by using the system that you set me up with
no need to reply
pls contact frank
bt

jacy called me the other day and said you guys met

i have not set you the documents back as of yet
bt

bt
gerry
i talked to both storey and lucci late friday
here is the latest
you had indicated your customer wanted a monthly related price
is that off of ventura or harper or both
paul lucci
denver office
will contact you today or tues
to generate a bid for the ventura and harper gas
i talked to storey on friday and he will work up a firm bid for your customers
he thinks pricing will be near a ventura monthly index + $
0
that's with no orig to canada
that is also with no ancillary deals behind this structure and that is what lucci is trying to pull together
paul
can you please investigate nom procedures
potential dry run structure
oct
0
and verify what the structure looks like as the upstream diversions take place
incl
default positions
at a minimum let's buy the gas and sell it base load to storey
then ena
denver will try to back fill some gas into the deal on a interruptible basis
call if you guys want to discuss
regard
bt
marc
you had left a message on my voice mail last week from one of your customers at sclumberger

let's start to go through this with actual details
bt
yes that does sound a lot like your structure
i fill address from here
bt
call me when you get in please
i have a couple of questions on this
bt
louise
my marketer out of the portland office had word that a ees marketer
george dickinson
was looking to contact a utility in the northwest
the reason that ees was looking to do this was to work with the utility on gas structures that perhaps the utility could market to some of their customers and ees would help them create or structure
this marketing effort is at the core of what ena
wholesale gas is trying to promote and any third part mix into this effort does not help
regardless as to where we are at in our marketing efforts and success to date in these efforts
utility business is a ena customer and i consider them a primary wholesale customer
i have not discussed this is anyone at ees but in my discussions with my peers was led to believe that this issues was tabled with you already and my comments would support your conversations with ees on our behalf
pls advise if you need to discuss or require anything from me
regards
bt
here is the schedule
next game oct 0
against nevada
not the most exiting schedule
bt
patrick
sorry for the short notice to try to catch up with you in l.a
this week
as mentioned
i am responsible for the gas marketing efforts in the west
for a variety of reasons we have been slow in contacting you but i know that from a trading perspective you have a strong relationship with our staff and were probably getting covered on most items you were needing
my groups interests are around transportation
risk management
strategic assets
storage etc
items that we believe are more of a term fit that real time position management issue
we spend a lot of time on fundamentals
research
hedging strategies
load forecasting etc
you had mentioned being in town in early november and if your schedule allows i would welcome the chance to get together
please contact me as you know your calendar and in the interim
if i end up in the city prior to the end of the month
i may try to contact you then
thanks in advance

i don't really care but if you are updating files pleas have this changed
barry tycholiz
i have talked to sierra pacific and they have some storage
i will advise
i think fuller was doing some leg work also
do you think there are any displacement issues that they may be forced to adhere to that would no allow them to shift flows
also
are you able to replicate the delivery point off of jp to make this happen
bt
i should no longer be on this circulation
can you please have me removed
bt

i have approved this expense report
with regards to the wyoming gas fair

thanks

that may be a better date for me anyways
pls put me down

pls add to my calender
bt
jeff
i was talking to mike etringer yesterday regarding this subject and he gave me the name of the cfo ted craver
i understand that you guys were dealing with john fielder
for sure we want to know what they are up to
i think like all deals in california we are going to run into issues with credit
and probably paper but that would pretty much depend on the counterparty
is it edison
or dwr
it is very important that trading and marketing are aware of the hedging activities in a very timely fashion so however we need to ensure that happens will be my plan
do you know the cfo
regards
bt
john
if possible i would like to talk to you regarding two deals this morning
0
jm huber
hedging deal
prudency issues required to protect some risks in 0
0
el paso transport assignment discussions and plan
i can be there any time
need 0 minutes
bt
as you guys know the 0 pgt expansion plans are supposed to be 0,0/day
the landscape of the shippers list is ever changing
rumors of ppl pulling out 0,0/day to malin and stanfield is unconfirmed
we are trying to validate
and potentially avista pulling out as they have been downgraded
they hold 0,0/day in 0
combined this is almost half of the planned expansion
although not confirmed the bottom line is as the 0 shippers back out the expansion it becomes compromised and ultimately i believe the 0 expansion and 0 expansion start to blend together
as you guys know the 0 shippers lists of 0,0
day is made up 0 shippers calpine 0,0/day and newport gen 0,0/day and this expansion has it's own issues
as we know more about shippers moving around i will pass on
pls do same
bt
further to our conversation please find attached the curves on the jm huber transaction that we have agreed to work off of
the 0,0/day of capacity will sit on the books until next week but the deal with huber is effectively completed
in the event that this deal does not close
then the west desk will resume with the same mtm risks that you presently have
any curve shift positive from now until the transaction is actually unwound will be credited back to the orig desk and any negative curve shift from here on in will be credited to the trading desk
plus ena orig and trading will work on a sharing calculation payable for any future deals
in addition to the transportation income being generated
additional orig will be generated by entering into wellhead and market based transactions with the desks
i believe that all of the risks and discussions associated with the structures have been well communicated with each book
by mark whitt
and we will be meeting with each of you early next week to get the structures and booking set up properly
i trust that this note covers the general areas related to this deal and i am very pleased with the high level of cooperation shown by everyone
pls review file and if there are any questions give me a call
bt
pls copy
eric
pls ensure that this meeting comes with a defined plan from legal for discussions related to capacity release
purchase or sale
at full tolls
discount or premium
in addition to this and most importantly what is ena's legal position on the disclosure of commercial terms that accompany and structured transportation agreement
i.e
if we buy gas at a market based rate and assign capacity to the customer
at full tolls
are we going to be required to post the commercial terms to the street
bt
yes
i had also heard that calpine/npg have passed on the early start date
i think pgt will show this to the market
no change regarding the 0 issues as of yet
bt
bt
latest doc's
pls review and comment on wording applicable to regulatory indicator that triggers events
bt
ty and phil
can you please advise as to the status and provide me copies of all documents related to payment # 0 and # 0 regarding the kern shippers
what i really want to do is tie out paper work
signatures and ensure that we are tight on all fronts
pls advise
by co
name
the status of all pending documents and a plan to get signatures as required
bt
thanks
i have taken a quick look at this and will think about other applications
i will follow up soon
bt
absolutely
jessica
it appears that we pay a monthly fee of $ 0.0
mth plus monthly optional charges and all long distance and local charges
i would like to discuss the details of a bill
what is this base fee
are there other plans available
are we getting any value in using cingular
especially this plan
how many minutes are we getting what are the long distance and roaming rates
in aggregate
my monthly cell phone bill for my group looks to be around $0,0
$ 0,0/mth for 0 people total and this is a little high
also
pls verify who has cell phones in denver and what the monthly bills look like for this office
thanks
bt
pls coordinate a vacation schedule planner for me for all of the staff from now until the end of the year
including jan
pls include denver bt
can i get all this printed out please
bt
i just sat down this a.m
and have been either in a meeting or working on a deal
i should be able to get back to you in the next hour or so
bt
ted
it's that time of year
i would like to meet with a few good a/a's to try and place in my group for year end
any comments on the process or path i should take on getting this done
bt
you know
can't trust those lawyers
bt
lorelie
attached is a price distribution table that is set up as a template for sppc power load as it relates to market prices and load
as you can see
this distribution protects your rate base against a rising price environment and partially floats with market prices as they move down
the distribution
fixed price vs floating
may move up a percent or two in relation to the outright price desk that we face today
relative to the historical numbers
but those iterations can be made as required
pls review and we can discuss at your convenience
also
as discussed
i am looking for ways to enhance our ability to transact with you on gas structures but in light of the overall credit positions that may be difficult
with that being said however
i do believe that we can stream some structures to the physical contracts in gas and ensure that from the physical point of view ena and sppc are both protected and i would like to pursue this with you
one area that i would like to start with to have sppc sell ena physical gas
0,0/0,0/day
against a physical gas daily related price
once i have accumulated a payables position
we inherently create a secured line without having to change any of the contracts/paper currently in place
i am also sure this will require further discussions and look forward to catching up with you soonest
regards
barry tycholiz
louise
further to our conversation of yesterday
here is a list
in order of priority
that i have reviewed with the denver office
in all cases
if fred's group is able to make a case that the cfo truly is the financial contact
then we are prepared to leave as is
otherwise as per mark's note
i would like to clarify the marketing role regarding all rockies and san juan producers
both physical and paper
and transfer the primary responsibilities back to the denver office as we had always planned
pls review and advise if you need anything further
bt
please keep me posted on progress
and if there is any way that i can help
photo sessions and baby kissing are my forte
please include in this annoucement that the west continues to be managed by me and mike grigsby
thanks

i did leave you a message on friday that i was unable to meet with dwr on monday

i was going to add a footnote to this note but thought i didn't need to as i know for a fact
by individual
that we do not have any issues in west gas orig
this note was for your information only to reflect the increased level of expectations that mike holds his trading organization to and i support this completely
your work hours are not in question
nor are those of denver

what's going on
calgary
who knows
stock meltdown is a long story
perhaps a bit more rumor than fact but that doesn't matter much at this moment
we are in preservation mode right now
but i believe things will be fine
all in all we have had the best year ever
the street just hated the way we set up some of our off balance sheet vehicles because they created conflict of interest
time will tell who is correct
better run
let's talk soon
bt
is there an action item with regards to the preparation of agreements
if so
i would like dave fuller in portland to work on the creation of the appropriate gas contracts and the discussions with puget

can you please review for your guys and advise if there is any variance
i am not worried about 0 or 0,0 either way because i don't think we will manage down to that level anyways

thank you for meeting with us this week
speaking on behalf of enron u.s
i know there was some very good clarification
information and hopefully action required by all the parties
i look forward to working through some transportation/supply structures and will contact you next week to discuss

i was talking to jay on friday and he was telling about kerr mcgee shutting down their operations
is there any play here for you guys
bt
let's try to get together today
bt
morris
if ena were to sell options to a third party and receive the option premium up front
for example $ 0mm $'s
would that be considered taxable income
we would also be buying the option from another party or hedging this structure and this cash would be used to offset future liabilities related to the deal
bt
mark
pls encourage everyone to talk to their customers today and let's let the street know we are as busy as always and that the overall issues are behind us
i have no new info regarding this matter but believe that the proper vehicles are in place to maintain liquidity
i am very interested in what the wholesale customers have to say about our issues
do they have a mandate to not trade
are they wanting to turn down their exposures etc
if any customers say this
then let me know
pls keep me posted
bt
i am out of town tues

i thought the time together was well spent and there is some action items required on all parties
we will follow up directly with pemex on some contractual issues and potential transport deals
did you get anywhere with regards to your regulatory matters
is there any specific action required by west gas at this time
if so
pls contact me to coordinate
regards
bt
we need to figure out how much short term and long term obligations pemex believes they will have in the next 0
0,0 years
the more obligation they have at the border
the better off we are
what they used to deliver upstream of the border
we can replace for them synthetically
pls update and let's discuss in next couple of days
bt
jessica
pls schedule chris for thurs
bt
can i have copies of all of these resumes pls.sort analysts
assoc
etc
bt
i don't believe that the agreement you had sent to me for cochrane is the latest version
i thought we executed a new agreement with tiered volumes
can you have someone re-check this and get back to me
bt
jeff
thanks again for attending the discussions with dwr
do you have any recon
on exactly which plants dwr has the right to bring the fuel on
as mark indicated
it was about 0/0 of their exposure
and most of that was in the south service area
but i am very interested in the actual facilities and whom used to bring fuel to them or run the units
there is a zero sum game on fuel
but the landscape changes depending on who buys it and how they buy it
any thoughts
bt
mike
i have asked ina to check into the coordination of a tour for our group
trading and marketing
prior to the official move in
i would like to restrict the attendees to the commercial staff
traders and marketers
and this will give everyone a chance to see the new digs
and then i would also like to suggest that we all slide out to the local watering hole for a drink
it is long overdue
any suggestions on a date
perhaps 0:0
0:0 for a tour
then out for a drink
what about next tues
pls advise
bt
meeting with pg&e went ok
they are unable to commit to a letter that i had sent them on swapping out some capacity
but still very much want to trade with us and would like trade access to eol
progress i guess
flights were good
got home around 0:0 am houston time
so it was a long day
if you think we can get the plant names they they are have the toll on
that would be great
bt
steph
why did you have two tickets for l.a
and why will one be used for future travel
bt
i don't know about a speech
but a few words of encouragement and a kick in the ass is inorder
bt
pls make sure that you guys are attending the fundy's meeting
mara and yourself
thanks
bt
i thought we were going to show them a number to work with
what is this conversation about option values on the pipe
bt
received your phone message
call me on thurs
bt
that was today
i had heard they were sniffing around about optionality values
it is not in the agreement
just a question
heh
what's going on
i was talking to kevin the other day and he asked how you were and i soon realized that i never called you back to take you up on the beer
are you around this weekend
i have tickets for the golf tournament

jay
what is status on credit worksheet for mgi
pls advise
bt
my location number is 0b
pls forward packet
thanks
bt
pls do not restrict my ability to kill my career
the problem with me sending this note internally is that they would probably want to hire the writer of this note to help restructure some of our outstanding agreements
for your review
bt
today is my 0 year anniversary
i have yet to get a 0 year belt buckle and inlight of the fact it may be the only thing i get out of this co
would like to know what my choices are
pls advise

see ya
bt
mark
thanks for seeing us this week
i am working internally to get our corporation over the top on the primary contractual and credit issues and believe i am making progress
i shall get back to you soonest
can you please advise as to the payables policy of dwr
for example
if i were to sell you gas via enron online for the month of november
would dwr be paying that invoice on the 0th of the month following delivery
is there any possibility that this could get paid on the 0th of the month following delivery
at least in the beginning
thanks in advance
barry tycholiz
as always

wow
i am positive that your beautiful wife did not sign up for hauling three rug rats
plus 0 dad
around the back streets of london
what have you done
i would love to talk market conditions with you but i think we are banned from doing any work for the next three months while this co
continues to fucks with my money
hacks
although not bitter
for years i have heard the story about being paid fair value for a job well done
and that my time was coming
just around the corner
little did i know that when i made that turn
some guy named jerome
take a minute to imagine
was standing there with a baseball bat looking to smack my head a few times just to make sure i knew i wasn't quite there yet

amy
can you add the cash and rest of month price for henry hub onto your daily pricing sheet
i think the cash to futures spreads for pretty relevant in today's market place as the cash market continues to trade well below futures
thanks
bt
good morning chris
further to our conversation of yesterday
i believe that your skillset would be a positive addition to the west gas origination group
we can provide for you a new learning experience by becoming a key component of the team
you will be asked to provide real time modeling
dcf
research on wellhead to burner tip strategies
you will learn a tremendous amount about the natural gas business with exposure stemming from the wellhead to the burner tip
some areas include
commodity price risk structures
risk management initiatives
financial and physical markets
structured products and transportation related initiatives
please use this note as a formal offer of employment
i would like you to start as soon as you can
next 0 weeks
and will leave this for you to think about until the end of day on monday
pls contact me directly if there are any questions regarding this note or any other matters
regards
barry tycholiz
yes
let's discuss on monday
i am open to either plan
bt
mara
pls ensure that your file includes pipelines that flow east of the rockies
like trailblazer
northern
nbpl
check with the denver guys to get all the pipes
bt
thanks for the reply
let's talk asap regarding this transportation
i can send you a summary sheet as to what we are looking to place
you had indicated that your a larger portion of your load is south
we have some 0,0 year service starting now
and we have the five year to pg&e
we also have the baja
0th of month following on payables is normal protocol
that works fine
i had assumed that for starting out
we would only work on sales to you on a cash basis
or very short term
intra-month
thanks in advance
barry tycholiz
jessica
can you check on getting us set up for every second monday
also
please look into pre-booking conference room space
bt
done
for dinner
let's have perogie
what do you think
has anybody from calgers group met with him recently
i know mike was involved
bt
benny
lavo gave me that voucher to use at the tpc
are you able to get away thurs afternoon
or friday or on saturday some time
let's try to get this used up
in terms of a 0 some
check to see if fletch wants to play
i will re-check with lavo to see if he is available
bt
mike
from what i am hearing
we will not get into the 0th floor to show the staff around
prior to the move in
i still think it would be timely for all of us to get together for a drink but in light of this small logistical issue we may want to postpone until we move in and then go out next week
once things settle down
assuming they do
i look forward to talking specifically to you regarding increased initiatives on our parts to ensure we are getting everything we can out of marketing and trading efforts
it is my observation that we have not made the progress i would have liked in terms of information flow
and although there has been progress
there is a ways to go
this probably has as much to do with individuals as it does anything else
looking forward to those discussions
bt
i think we had discussed this but as a result of security issues accessing the building we will defer until next week our plans
thanks
bt
pls defer meeting plans until further notice
thanks
bt
i would be happy to take a run at this
see where the customer is at
and then set up a joint session for you and me
i will update you asap
bt
web site
jessica
i have a 0:0 meeting with the weather desk can you verify that i have a room booked
my room is fine
just make sure grigsby is not using it either
bt
just checking in
we keep waiting for that 0:0 am call to watch micheal
is she getting close
i heard kim and her had their nails and toes done yesterday
nice
i may want to sign up for that
not the nails part
just the schedule
tic
bill,as requested
i talked to michael tribolet last week and he felt that transactions under 0 year would be ok with pg&e company
i would like to take the next step with them and assuming we get paper executed for ecc and ena
which is pending
i want to give them trade access to eol
cumulative unsecured exposure would be about $0,0/day
estimated
and i would try to get the payments from them to us made on the 0th business day vs the 0th business day following delivery
our master will give us rights for reasonable financial assurances but not definative collateral threshold amount
infact we should keep this at zero for both sides until the air clears
all transactions will come through eol and the products being sold by ena
ecc will be cash or rest of month
aeco
sumas
malin or pg&e citygate
the bottom line on this is do we want to enter into gas related cash transactions that increase of exposure on a receivables basis to pg&e
commercially
i believe they are someone we want to do business with and we can increase deal flow on eol for some canadian and u.s
products
i do not think we are in a position today to ask for pre-pays
please advise if any questions otherwise i am seeking the green light from you to take the next step
regards
bt
yes
i would like to interview some of the candidates
please schedule within reason
and as required
bt
lavo told me that if any of these guys hear about this
he will kill me
pls do not distribute and handle with care with steve
bt
i am fine with them starting at 0:0 pm
is that consistent with other groups
bt
we will but choose the words you use very carefully with regards to what those may be
lc's
cash are difficult
basically the most that they are ever exposed to us for is 0 days of gas
and very little mark to market valuations
thanks
bt
screen saver
there are some good beach screen savers here
will try to put one on our pc
bt
this is pretty funny
bt
bart
let's re-schedule meeting for some time next week
i have not spent the time deserved for this survey and will do so once corporate issues are resolved
bt
entering into term agreements with enron today is probably not the best play until our credit
restructuring issues are resolved
what are you thinking about
all is fine
hanging in there
pissed off like you would not believe
but not much i can do now but wait it out
i have very little interest moving back to canada at this time so it should be interesting
bt
can you look into this
what is it about
good morning
callaway park buys disney world
milly told me that one
the management is trying hard to put on a good face forward
but they fucked this one up nicely
my plans are simple
hang out to see if i get paid
after that
not sure
i am thinking about taking golf lessons
that how bad things have gotten
yikes
ps
send us a new e-mail of the kids
thanks for the note
tic
they are laughing at us now
tic
for your e-mail
this is funny
unclear
dave and lavo have been pretty quiet
but i am with you
if whalley is in
i have to believe those guys are also
chapter 0
coming up
let's not get it installed until we move
thanks
bt
thats fine
next week is early enough
i was in an electronics store the other night
panasonic has 0
portable dvd player
like your sony
with an 0 hour battery
$0.0 us
it is sweeeeeeet
tic
i think we should still do this
and i may join you guys
bt dates please
tom
no problem
can you reply to this note
or advise how to incorporate the rotating symbol into a file
thanks
bt
what date is this planned for
bt
bill
fyi
i have received a formal request from pgt asking enron to provide security on their pipeline
the request is for approx $ 0mm
they are referencing a provision in their tariff that says that if a co
goes below bbb by s&p
then they have the right to ask for security
i have discussed this request with them and they assure me we are not being singled out
i told them we will review the letter with credit and management and get back to them prior to the deadline imposed on their request
nov
0
a copy of this request will be on your desk first thing this a.m
regards
bt
carl
just wanted you to know that i have decided to not offer william a rotation in west gas and i have talked to him this a.m
as discussed
i like his basic skill sets but i decided this a.m
to hold off for the next 0 weeks or so before filling any spots for the end of the year
i am sure he will find a good rotation
just wasn't the best fit for me at this time
thanks
bt
ty
pls check your model
i would believe you have a file reference error on the july 0
0 day payables number
when you include new deals
pls update and re-issue to me first thing
bt
leslie
i presented a form of assignment to pg&e as recently as 0 weeks ago
including other structures
generally speaking
they hate the el paso pipe because of it's flow risk and are not interested in discussing this with me until such time that el paso deliverability becomes more reliable
having them take this pipe as a vehicle to help offset our bankruptcy claim works from an economics point of view
assuming you can agree on values
but i think you will have a battle regaring the quality of service that they are going to get
regardless
it is a an out of the money position for us and we could accomodate if they wish to discuss further
have lisa or michael call me if they wish to discuss logistics around this asset
thanks
bt
mike
this was that item i wanted to talk to you about
i assume kim got to you first
i appreciate your response
it is extremely important that we maintain the highest quality of service to the wholesale customers where we have msa's or full requirements arrangements and obligations
thanks
bt
dave
although we need to track deal count
i continue to get orig amounts granted to you for $ 0.0
that is to small a number to worry about
i would think $ 0.0
transaction would be a better cut line
remember
we are after deal flow
and orig
no need to reply
bt
jeanie
as i read this e-mail i cringe at the thought that we have been dancing around this issue for 0 months yet all around us we will be laying off some very good employees who really deserve to be here
and more importantly
want to be here
plenty of time has been given to this issue
please fix as soon as possible
do you need anything from me
mark
for right now
i would not suggest we pursue any external hires
we are going to see a lot of internal staff from different business groups looking for work
bt
kim
please schedule the appropriate people for a 0 minute discussion
i am sure that this can be resolved
also
be prepared to discuss the
penalties
component of our obligations to put this in perspective
bt
howard
can you please verify what you mean by renewal rights
specifically who owns what rights and until which period
it is my expectation that with the exception of cnrl
ena/ecc holds the obligation and annual renewal rights on nova
ang
we have assigned the pgt permanently out of nov 0 to calpine and sierra pacific
we also have the obligation to give them the matching upstream capacity at that time
also
where do you think aec
talisman and cnrl will be to take permanent assignment of this pipe effective asap
thus changing the deal delivery point around
an the credit situation
included in the shuffle will be the liquids obligations
nominations
ena
ecc can still act as the agent
but most importantly the thing we need to transfer over is the pipe obligation on pgt
stat
pls advise
i want this program continued for my group at this time
bt
no problem
by the way
i heard you guess were able to get the vng deal completed
that is great news
congratulations
bt
chris
why does puget have credit concerns with us
it was my understanding that we had a mtm of $0 mm in which they were out of the money.i thought the risk was realtively short term
winter gas
you would think that they would be fine with loading up on enron
irony comes in all shapes and sizes when a ldc doesn't like our credit
with regards to a meeting
i have yet to make my way up that way
and would still like to make that tour which includes puget
northwest natural
cascade etc
i think that a meeting with these guys on a consolidated risk management plan would be ideal
i will call you today
bt
kevin
do you have the phone number for geysa arujo at the williams shrink
cochrane facility
she called me the other day and i must have taken her number down incorrectly
thanks
bt
we just moved over to our new building yesterday and i was moving my rolodex and your card popped up
everything good by you
bt
thanks for the note back
yeah
i am still kicking
and i am sure you know this that it will take a little more than a bankruptcy to shake this guy
when i grab on
i grab on tight
sorry for putting you through the inconvenience of having to read our documents
i think we have all had to dust off the paper
but i sincerely hope most of it is behind us
i knew karen was at progas
glad to hear that she is enjoying work
i have not been to calgary since may
and am not sure when i will be back up
and if it will be on a permanent of temporary basis
all in all houston is treating us pretty good
work really has been great and i have such a good marketing region
california
arizona
denver
vegas
are some of the highlights
so when i need to
i go blow a few braincells out in one of these fine regions
kim is working a little
0 shifts in 0 year
she may have to pick up the pace on that effort
she is fighting me on that one
house is good
weather right now is great
0 degrees
all the time
there is something to be said about living in shorts and sandals
better run
take care
talk soonest
bt
paul
thanks for the note
do we have a position with these guys today either in the form of mtm or payables/receivables
like everyone else
the street continues to pick it's spots on new dealings with us but i wouldn't mind knowing what our existing exposures are to them
bt
not really
someone from williams called you regarding a document that needs to be signed by the 0th
is that a c/a for nwpipe
she was covering for jan
i did not get a chance to take the call
just heard about it
bt
thanks
enjoy the few days off
bt
dave
i have discussed the schedule related to orig track and until further notice
we will suspend interviews and discussions
louise does expect that this program will continue but agrees that at this time
priorities lie elsewhere
pls contact me if there are any questions
otherwise can you coordinate with karen buckley
et al
let's re-visit program in mid-december
regards
barry tycholiz
bill
as part of our conference call this a.m

thanks so much for the note
it is a bit crazy

great pictures of the kids
leon
the account number in the original document is actually not incorrect
this was the account to which the funds were to have been deposited to
however
sce deposited the funds to a different account
as a result
i agree that we should amend the document to reflect that the account where these funds where they actually ere actually sent and this will conclude our busines
your file did not come over correctly but if you could hand correct the original documents by changing the banking instructions and fax to me
i will provide proper signatures on amendment and we are done

i tried to call you last night around 0:0
i was unable to leave a message on your home machine or cell
really nothing too pressing but schonne is wanting to follow up with us on our plans
i did talk to him and told him not to assume that our pgt capacity will go to newco
because newco does not really exist and may never
so
i told him to review the tariff and make a determination as to whether or not it is still ours to use
if it isn't
then we don't really need to talk
it they determine it is still ours
then we need to think about what the estate should do with it
including the upstream parts
call me this a.m
bt
jim
stephanie will be in this morning
cannot do lunch
and we will be back to you by 0:0 our time to confirm the 0:0 pm conference call
thanks
bt
stephanie
i know that ed mcmicheal has appointed someone from the estate to start to consolidate all of our transportation positions
if any remain
and also our obligaitons
i will confirm his name and from here on in
you may be asked only to assist
not lead these discussions
however
for the purposes of pgt
at this time
i would ask that you continue on your path of resolution
i will follow up with canada this a.m
to ascertain what they have done with the nova and ang portions
bt
i am still here and probably will be here until atleast the end of feb
i have had to lay off about 0 of 0 people which includes outright termination ot allocation to the estate
clean up

i do not see the link to

from
tracey irvin 0/0/0 0:0 pm
thanks for your help
there really are no material changes for texas
the only issue that i see is the month to month change in volumes between december and november 0
this was due primarily to slightly cooler temperatures
entex takes were slightly higher
and an extra day of flow
0 vs
0
let me know if you have further questions
thanks
eric
i left you a msg
but here is the info
call with questions
did she get divorced yet
the new pub code is in erms
the name is gdp
hh + 0afta
eric
i though i was #0
enron north america corp
am i not good enough to be number one in your heart and in public
are you ashamed of me
i'll be there tomorrow night
but only if you'll be there too
enron north america corp
you hated that e-mail didn't you
miss sarcasm
direct
are we
the league is complete
please check your fees on the website and send me a check for what you owe
here are the final standings and payouts
based on what i have collected
the amounts above will change as people pay their fees
my address is if you won $ please give me your address and i will send you a check
thanks
the commish
done enron north america corp
no problem
enron north america corp
i'm old now
but i can always find solace in the fact that you are older
i don't know yet if i am going to go out tonight
but if i do we'll probably go to woody's on richmond
it used to be the velvet elvis
your list of items is correct
however
the entex related transport shows up on the p&l and the gl via transport expense from tom to ed
this number is manually booked to the gl each month by phillip
therefore
this revenue shows up en masse with all of the marketing desk's expense
eric enron north america corp
yes
but i would say that the $0,0/mo during the winter is related to an hpl discount on transport given to the marketing desk in order to make the deal more economical
enron north america corp
i will be attending the lunch
eric x0-0
what time
enron north america corp
i'm feeling fantastic considering i slept till 0:0 this morning
where were you last night
i had a really fun time
there were probably about 0 people from work there and my bro
we stayed out until about 0:0 and then went home
i'm going to start calling you
backout
if you don't shape up
no news on dec yet but nov exposure is around
$0.0 mm
eric
he's doing ok
he doesn't really like his job too much
he is going to wait it out another month to see if a new position comes available
if not
he is applying with dell and gateway for positions in austin and colorado
i think he took a liking to one of my girl friends from work last night so i am waiting to hear about that
by the way
have you seen enron's stock the last two days
it has gone from 0 to 0
it
s good to work for the big e
the big e
we have actually already called springer to get on his
surprise
i'm dating your brother
episode
it's a pretty good deal b/c you get an all expense paid trip to chicago for the weekend
i am actually a multimillionare now
i'm thinking about buying that new car
do you want one
there is not much going on this weekend on my end
i will probably take it easy
and you
let me guess
you are going to try and stop by my place
that will happen
attached is a listing of unresolved issues between tom and greg sharp
i have not included the facility charges
do you want me to add those
please feel free to add on to my list anything that i have left off
eric
hey kyle
attahed is an updated version of the entex model
eric
yea
thanks for reminding me about your b-day
i nearly forgot
ha ha ha
i don't know if i should come to the big birthday bash b/c it is in a shady area
what do you think
i copied your idea
and it screwed up your name
shes pretty sexy
huh
are we getting together to talk europe tonoght
should we tell all interested parties
sorry can't make it
you are coming to the super bowl party
right
i show five fixed for float swaps done for september production
the deal numbers and prices follow
deal # vol swap px resulting customer px let me know if this clears everything up
eric enron north america corp
it looks like facility charges are covered 0/0 forward by the individual deals
mick does not think there are any other outstanding issues for transport as a methodology has been established and agreed upon for 0/0 forward
enron north america corp
count me in enron north america corp
did you get the invite to the super bowl party
june-august were incorrect in sitara
i have made the necessary adjustments
stephanie will have to reissue payments
by my calculations
cabot owes hpl $0,0
see below month volume/d rate was rate should be economics expense as this was pre-merger
desk's the desk's enron north america corp
i think we are staying in tonight
i don't know of any big plans
where is she going
could you please schedule a meeting for wednesday
thurs
or friday with the usual parties
thanks
eric
is hill available for trade
let me know what on my team interests you
eric
you may notice that 0 pma's are $
0,0
or approx 0% to the final p&l
you will also notice that the detail following the majority of the adjustments is unaccounted for gas
at the close of business for the 0 p&l
we saw a gain of approx
$0,0 because of a blowout in ua0
we thought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it to offset the pma's we would take as a result of this ua0 blowout
therefore
the net impact of 0 pma's is $0,0 or 0% of last day p&l
i just wanted to congratulate the team on a great p&l for the month of november
eric
thanks for showing up to the party on sunday
your new name backout
i need to know who of you is interested in playing in a flag football league starting in march

thanks
eric

thanks
things are going well here
i have been pretty busy losing lots of money at work
brian and hector are going to europe at the end of the month
but i can't go because of work
it doesn't bother me that much though
i will probably try to take a trip over there in may
on top of that i am thinking about a cruise this summer some time
brian and i are actually moving this weekend to a new apartment within the park at midtown
brian recently got his bike stolen from the balcony
so we are going to move to an interior apartment
of course
i wouldn't expect you to relate to any of this because you have never seen my apartment
oh well
i guess you have your priorities
other than that
not a whole lot going on
how are things with you and the
when is graduation
and
of course i will show up
although
if i recall
you didn't show up for mine
you can send the announcement to 0 milam st

i haven't heard of the advertising firm
what kind of projects do they work on
i am going to earth day
are you
are you bringing rebecca again this year
we will probably go out to kenneally's
griff's or birraporetti's for st
patty's day
what about you
here is my bracket
i will bring the money down around 0:0
market deals are only captured in accrual value calculations if they are in the wellhead portfolio
i do not recall any sales currently in the wellhead portfolio
however
i do not see a problem with the market deals unless they were marked improperly
e.g
accrual adders
eb enron north america corp
everything is working
thanks for the help
eric

there might be some back office issues with this
how was the well this weekend
enron north america corp
i have his marathon pictures up as wallpaper on my computer
he is so sexy with his shirt off
did you have a good weekend
do you still want to get togehter after work sometime this week
lemme know
sorry about the headache
i hear that slamming your head against the wall is good for getting rid of migraines
oh wait that's what i do at work to help me think about something other than losing lots of money
never mind
thurs is probably best then
if not then maybe next week
i'm sorry
i forgot that you were clairvoyant
i don't think you can make a case that you were smart for betting me without the points
that's like me saying that enron's stock is trading at 0 why don't i buy it for 0 b/c i am confident that it is going to 0
that's real smart
no wonder ees loses money
enron north america corp

so it will be a fixed price product for next day gas delivered at the corpus location

did you make your reservation
tom has come to a decision on what to do with the ubiquitous accrual value
0% of this value should be credited to greg's transport expense on a monthly basis
tom
in turn
will cover ed on this portion of the expense
for example
accrual value comes out to be $0,0 for the month of april
this means that
greg's portion of this value is 0% of $0,0 = $0,0 tom's portion of this value is 0% of $0,0 = $0,0 greg's transport expense is
$0,0
so
tom will cover $0,0 of this expense greg's adjusted expense is
$0,0
greg's p&l is net better off by the $0,0 of accrual value tom's p&l is net better off by $0,0 of accrual value which had not been previously recognized
ed's p&l is net unchanged from all of the above
call with questions
eric
hey
i tried to call you
i need brandi's work #
home # and social security #
what do i look like
a key map
take allen parkway to shepherd
make a right on shepherd and a quick left on memorial
follow memorial all the way to the park
i don't know which side you will play on b/c both sides have fields
i will go
jill
i was wondering if i could get some information on the costilla deal
specifically the repurchase option
i need to know the term
locations
volume and strike price of the call
thanks
eric
there is not enough data on it to make an educated decision
it looks like they have the backing of an i-bank to place some more stock so that is somewhat encouraging
you are going to have to make your own call on this one
if you like the idea and you think they can execute
then go for it
that sounds good
we will be there
melissa
here are the accrual values for q0
more details to follow
feb
$0,0 eric enron north america corp
melissa
those numbers are all inclusive for the wellhead portfolio
sharp's number is embedded within those
his number is estimated at approx $0,0/mo
i will follow up with these specific details
eric
i don't think 0:0 is a great time for us
but don't let us keep you from going to the show
if you want to go to the early show
we won't be offended
we can do something another time
we would love to do something with you if you decide against the 0:0 show
no
i went last year and it was more packed than on a regular day
melissa
as you know
as of jan 0
0 the wellhead portfolio has been segregated from the rest of hplc's physical portfolio
as a result of this segregation
it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly
accrual value
can be determined
this analysis has resulted in the realization that the wellhead potfolio creates approximately $0,0 of accrual value per month
the main drivers of this accrual value are deals that have rolled into evergreen status
accrual term deals
actual volumes greater than booked
half cent bid to mid spread
incorrect markings
and value withheld from mtm because of accrual costs
of the above
greg sharp will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals
actual volumes greater than or less than booked
and deals incorrectly marked
tom will keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed to pay accrual costs
such as gas quality issues
the breakout of this value has been on average 0% to greg and 0% to tom
the following is a breakdown of 0st quarter accrual value
january
total accrual value = $0,0 greg's value tom's value evergreen value = $0,0 bid to mid accrual value = $0,0 accrual costs incorrect marking =
$0,0
total value = $0,0 february
total accrual value = $0,0 greg's value tom's value evergreen value = $0,0 bid to mid accrual value = $0,0 accrual costs incorrect marking =
$0,0
total value = $0,0 march
total accrual value = $0,0 greg's value tom's value evergreen value = $0,0 bid to mid accrual value = $0,0 accrual costs incorrect marking =
$0,0
total value = $0,0 let me know if you have any questions
eric enron north america corp

facility fees should be part of the accrual value that fall's out each month
as long as the deals are in the wh portfolio
this value should not be given to sharp unless he bears the cost of the facilities
there is a file in my folder that has a listing of some of the deals that have facility fees
for further info contact vance taylor
the file is called fac costs
in addition
i am forwarding an e-mail sent by george weissman to me regarding accrual value
he thinks that the coastal deal that shows up as a huge negative each month should have been restructured in april
could you check into this and get back to him
thanks
eric enron capital management

my supervisor is thomas a
martin
i just slept on it wrong so i couldn't move it to the left on friday

any news
eric

by the way
i think luis is out of town
so
if you want
you are the qb
let me know

you fwd it
we are going to be rolling out a new product on eol starting this bidweek
this product will be for physical delivery only on the weekdays
no weekend delivery
currently
the eol/sitara bridge cannot handle this type of logic
so these deals will have to be input manually
let me know if you have further questions
eric
any news on this data
eric
only if you go
wrong address for my brother
he doesn't work for comopaq
and quit putting me last
attitude
i want to get a job at comopaq too
this is a great memo brian
i am so proud of you
did you write this
did i win my bet
why the hell were you invited
i have to go to a work thing saturday night but i will be up for going out after dinner
are you going to actually send the schedule
we might get together a little earlier depending on the time of the texas/lsu game
and it is margaritas
babe
i haven't heard anything
i am waiting to hear
the reg season is over but we may have a tourney
thanks
i am trying to create the wkd for other areas beside hpl/hsx e but keep getting an error msg for length
is there a way to truncate these products so that we can trade them on eol
thanks
eric
that looks good
but i need an index based product for july for the hpl/hsx pool
not the east pool
thanks
eric
we will make but won't be there till around 0:0 ish
let me know if you want me to bring something
love
i don't need to talk shit about the game
i will let the longhorns do the talking for me on saturday
by the way
you can probably see your reflection in that surfboard by now
it may not be rocket science
but not everyone can hack it
isn't that why you left the wholesale side of the business
besides somebody has to take up the slack for ees
let the me know when you need some earnings to cover your loss for the quarter
i'm sure i can spare some out of my book
i guess it isn't as tough as ees
you're right
i would hate to have to come to work at 0:0 am and leave at 0:0 everyday
i guess i just had this opportunity fall in my lap because i never have added the kind of value that you did while in risk or ees
i guess that is why i got offered a promotion to stay and you were sent packing to enron siberia
p.s
shanna has another skank friend coming in town this weekend
maybe you can hook up
you had to hit below the belt
we were having a friendly shit talking contest
which
by the way
you started
and then you took the gloves off
what's up with that
you know that all of us
matt
chad
and i
are just fucking with you about the ees bullshit
if it bothers you that much then say something about it
as far as my comments on your performance here
i was just kidding
i know that brenda thinks the world of you and that you wouldn't have stayed even if invited
besides
i learned from the intramonth guru himself
i was just trying to defend myself because you were saying that all i do is follow tom's lead
and
by the way
i did not make a comment about ees until you brought up the cfa
i know that you
matt
and chad think that i had nerves and that is why i didn't take the test
but why the hell would i have nerves about a test that has no bearing whatsoever on my future
so quit the bullshit
and
texas will still beat the shit out of lsu on sat
you're done
hale is starting on sat
lsu doesn't stand a chance
this reimbursement is for the cfa test
i am in the analyst program
do i need to get my direct supervisor to sign off or get someone in the analyst program to sign
thanks
eric
guess who sent me this
it actually is pretty interesting to see how other companies value their analysts
though
we are meeting at chuy's at 0:0 tonight to celebrate tim's 0th birthday
be there or be square
are you coming or not bitch
crash and burn louisville courtship of rockets in jeopardy associated press houston * the bid by louisville
ky
to land the houston rockets appears to have fallen through
jefferson county in kentucky on monday declined to join a three-pronged proposal that would publicly finance a downtown basketball arena
the plan suggested the city
county and state each issue up to $0 million in bonds to cover a portion of an arena that could cost $0 million
the arena would be built to attract the rockets or another professional basketball team
team officials visited with louisville business and government leaders lastmonth
the rockets have also been in negotiations with baltimore
new orleaand st
louis
but louisville was the only city to publicly court the team
city officials wanted to submit a proposal to the rockets by tuesday
but the county indicated it wasn't ready to participate in the plan
the houston chronicle reported tuesday
please do not issue any statements of commitment
or send a memorandum ofunderstanding at this time on behalf of the county
jefferson county judge/executive rebecca jackson wrote in a letter that was delivered to louisville mayor david armstrong
the letter
dated monday
was also signed by the county's three commissioners
the rockets declined comment on the development
but denied ever giving louisville attorney j
bruce miller a deadline to submit a proposal
meanwhile monday
about 0 protesters chanted
don't pick our pockets to pafor the rockets
in front of the county courthouse in louisville to protesspending public money on an arena
the rockets have been considering a move since november
when voters in houston rejected a plan to build them a $0 million arena
i am trying to pull together a report on the future of the gas market in texas
i was wondering if you have a report that shows new generation coming on in the next 0-0 years as well as a report that shows current generation
the names of the companies building/owning the facilities is not important
the most important data is mw capacity as well as type of generation
i.e
natural gas
coal
etc
do you have this information
thanks
eric
i am taking dad to dinner for father's day tommorow

i am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the program affect my eligibility for promotion
at the end of last year you informed me that i was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid year review
my 0 year anniversary
it was my impression that the only reason that i was held back from promotion into the associate program was tenure
now
after reading the memo
it seems as if i will not be eligible for promotion to associate until i complete 0 years in the program
i am wondering if i am still eligible for promotion to associate during this prc
thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter
eric bass

i had fantastic time on my cruise
unfortunately
i got back on sunday and it was straight to work on monday
i'm assuming you didn't take up permanent residence in belize
so
if you didn't
drop me a line
by the way we are going to see either the patriot or the perfect storm tonight
so decide
i think this is a call for help
maybe you should provide with some service tonight
it looks like we have our 0 teams
we will probably keep the same rules from last year unless anybody has an objection
still to be determined are league fees
draft date
and free agent pickup protocol
i suggest that we draft on august 0th at the enron building on floor 0
for those of you that can't make it
you can draft over the internet
we will be using cbs sportsline again
i think that will be $0/person
let me know if anyone has a problem with the draft date
i.e
can't make it
too early
too late
if not
the meximullets look forward to a return to prominence this year
you all do not stand a chance
eric
im thinking perfect storm
don't worry about it
what day is good for you
there are some conflicts with the draft date
so we will probably need to have it on a different date
please tell me if you prefer 0/0
the day before the season starts
or 0/0
we could also do it during the week
but it will probably takle 0 or 0 hrs
let me know suggestions
hector
i invitate you touch my big
beautiful
american breasts
the new draft date is 0/0 by overwhelming majority
stay tuned for further details
i told you so
we have had a request to change from a draft to an auction system for acquiring players
please take a look at www.fanball.com and take the links to the auction
i think it is auctions a-z
and let me know which option you think is better
by popular vote
we will have a draft instead of an auction and the draft will take place on 0/0
rules to follow
eric
michael
wednesday afternoon after 0:0 would be good for me
let me know if this works for you
eric
last year we played with a mandatory tight end

eric
just in case you were interested
here is some of the correspondence that is going on
here is the analysis that i completed
let me know if you have questions
eric enron north america corp

young razorback fan saves friend from vicious animal
he starts writing in his notebook
but i'm not a razorback fan
the little hero replies
sorry
says the reporter
since you live near fayetteville
i just assumed you were
the reporter begins writing again
brave arkansas state fan rescues friend from horrific attack
the boy replies
i'm not an arkansas state fan
either
oh
i assumed that everyone in arkansas was either a razorback fan or an arkansas state fan
you must be a university of central arkansas fan
the reporter starts writing again
young uca fan saves friend from mad dog
the boy said
i'm not a uca fan either
well
if you are not for the u of a
state
or uca
just what team do you root for
the reporter asked
why
i'm an lsu fan
the child replies
the reporter starts a new sheet in his notebook
little illiterate coonass kills beloved family pet
i know that christa sent an e-mail about this a couple of weeks ago
but i wanted to follow up

i would prefer to have the draft around noon
we can have the draft at a bar

access to the internet
please let me know asap
eric
by popular vote
the draft will take place at noon on 0/0 at bw-0 in rice village
alright
no more memos about bw0 sucking w/o suggesting an alternative
matt
you won't be there
so your input is worthless bryan
two rows isn't conducive to big groups
so pick some place else
matt told me he is going to draft an lsu player with the first pick
eddie

what a shocker
steve venturatos has graciously offered to take their place
thanks steve
thanks
again
for calling me back last night
i am taking a vote on if we need to redraw the draft order
some
have said that it is not fair for steve to be handed the 0th slot
let me know what you think
eric
did you buy enron this morning
he probably doesn't want to redraw because he knows he can't possibly rip you off any more than he already has
by popular vote
we will not redraw
our draft will take place
this sunday at 0:0 am at bw-0 in rice village
in order to counter offer
you must have had an offer
if you remember
you offered me a lesser trade than that already my counter offer is 0,0,0 for your 0
0
i will be at the dinner on thursday
thanks
eric
no ican't do that
how about my 0 and 0 for your 0
alright
how about my 0 and 0 for your 0

but i am willing to do my 0 and 0 for your 0
how do i go about getting my logon id and password
i seem to have deleted the e-mail that was sent out
thanks
eric bass
what do you want for it
my 0 and 0
how about the final pick in the 0nd and my third for your 0nd and your 0th
you might as well cut your losses
you are not going to get over on someone as badly as matt got over on you
so you might as well bite the bullet and make a trade that actually is good for your team
its called bargaining
how is me giving up a 0 and a 0 good for me
its not
i am trying to figure out what you are willing to take
i have to swing the other side of it
i'll let you know
the other side backed out
what do you want for your 0th round pick
what do you want for your 0th round pick
what do you want for one of your 0rd round picks
what do you want for your 0rd round pick
what do you want for your 0rd round pick
i need to talk to you about the tv
on the trade
i will give you my 0 and 0 for your 0 let me know
i am going to get x-rays on friday or saturday
so you can stop worrying
things are sucking right now on the market
so i can't say that i am enjoying my job
but i am looking forward to the fantasy football draft on sunday
shann started her new job today
she is a little stressed about the increase in workload
she is going to visit the family this weekend
so i have a weekend on my own
maybe i can come out this weekend to visit
if you can fit me in
i had a great time last saturday
how are things in your world
i would be willing to swap 0st round picks with you for your 0 and a high 0th round pick let me know
watch it
i want to trade you a 0th
0th and 0th round pick for your 0nd
let me know what you think
chris
do you have the rrc historical production data
eric
bryan and i have a work dinner to go to
but we are on to get loaded tomorrow
well
we have a new flag football season starting up in september
let me know if you are still interested in playing
if you are
i need $0 from everyone
eric
not sure yet
i am hearing maybe on thurs
i'll let you know
don't know yet probably thurs
are you still in tonight
i think probably 0 rows
tell gillette about tonight b/c she was asking last night
what do you think
remember
the draft is this sunday at 0:0 am at bw-0 in rice village
please try to be there on time so we can start promptly
eric
i have inputted rosters and set schedules
please check you rosters
what do you want for tony gonzalez
i will give you walls and terrence wilkins
so
there is nothing on my team that you are willing to give up gonzo for
i find that hard to believe
i repeat
uou have no offer
what do you want for randy moss
so you are basically saying that you wouldn't take stephen davis for gonzo
your team is so bad
i thought we decided that was during the season
up until the season starts it is free
since my team sucks so bad
i want to bet you $0 that i have a better record than you this year
i was thinking that there would be a moratorium on the bidding process for free agents until the start of the season
if you disagree
let me know
the moratorium will last until noon on wednesday
august 0th
you can have no more than 0 players on your roster at any time
your running backs suck
i will give you raymont harris and wayne chrebet for freeman
we will make it effective today so that
you can't stockpile players
how about raymont
bill schroeder and wayne chrebet for freeman
what do you think
chrebet,dillon
any counter
enron capital management
alright
i think this is a good deal for you
you get depth at receiver and depth at running back
dillon
chrebet
schroeder
and raymont harris or lamar smith for williams
hayes
and robert smith what do you think
enron capital management
please take time to answer a new poll on the website
what do you want for fred taylor
do you see he is out for the first 0 weeks
muhsin muhammed and elvis grbac for jeff garcia
raymont harris
and wayne gives you starting qb and depth at rb
all 0 of your rbs will likely not play week 0 and maybe 0
let me know
what is your offer on marcus robinson
hear anything on engram
hey mom
the x-rays were negative
and i haven't heard about the review yet
how is everything on your front
love
what do you want for engram
for kevin johnson
wayne chrebet
and bill schroeder
what do you want for fred taylor
oh
because i was going to offer up stephen davis
but never mind
your boy is being ridiculous
does he really think he will get the 0th best rb for the 0th receiver
engram is ramiro's 0th receiver
you don't get a starting rb
the 0th best i might add
for a backup wr
the reason i want engram so bad is b/c i have his qb and i think he will have a pretty good year
by the way engram was picked the 0th round
dillon in the 0nd
so don't give me any of that
check this out another example of how ridiculous people are
i will give you schroeder and raymont harris
that is a fair offer considering your predicament at rb
by the way engram was drafted in the eight round
so was harris
and schroeder was drafted in the 0th that is an 0 and a 0 for 0
some people are dumb asses
let me know what you think or if you have a counter
counter then
raymont harris
bill schroeder and wayne chrebet for smith
we had said we were going to vote on trades
we have had our first trade
some people have come to me requesting a vote please go to the website and vote on the trade between the the lie downs and the rounders
i took the vote down
we will only vote on trades later in the year
you desperately need depth at rb
lamar smith is solid
jj johnson has shown nothing in preseason where as lamar has been excellent
they were already talking about lamar being the starte before johnson got suspended
if you don't like that is fine but it still doesn't change the fact that you have a shaky second rb and no backups that start let alone play
so let me know
alright i would do davis,schroeder
and harris
for faulk and connell
didnt i just make you an offer for connell
you are not going to get both dillon and davis so if you have to have both of them tell me so i can back out now but the trade i offered you is fair
ok
you want something fair
and you want dillon and davis in a package
how about dillon and davis
for your whole team b/c that is the only trade that i think is fair for my team let me know what you think
i am still willing to do that side bet if you want
some people are idiots
check this out on my offer of schroeder and harris for engram
i sent that file to you in error
please disregard
thanks
eric
you tell me that you are cheating on me
interesting enron north america corp
mother
i had offered to come and be there during your surgery
both you and dad replied that it was not necessary because the surgery was not that serious and there was no timeframe on its completion
you know that i love you and dad very much
and that i do not have a favorite parent
if that was your implication with your last comment
if you are unhappy with jason's actions that is fine
but you have to remember that my brother and i are different people
you cannot neccessarily associate his actions with mine
please take that into consideration
i love you very much
eric
what are you trying to show me
this just sends me to the ap website
thats really bad
i'm interested in wrs not qbs come back with robinson in there
ml
remember
the free add/drop period will end on wednesday aug0 at noon
after that point
we will submit add/drop bids to pat at pryder@enron.com
to review

the person with the highest bid will receive the player
$0 bids are acceptable
each team will start with $0 auction dollars
each week the team with the lowest total points year to date will get $0 added back to their total
the team with the highest ytd pt total will get $0 added back and teams in the middle will get their according dollar amount based on their rank in ytd pts
all trades will be assessed a $0.0 flat fee
also
let me know how you want to handle dues
a total of $0
should i collect them up front
the commish
that is fine with me
but what about shanna
she might be a little uncomfortable with just the 0 of us
that is pretty gay
charlie garner
terry glenn
and donovan mcnabb for marshall faulk
terry glenn and charlie garner for eddie george
would you take terry glenn and charlie garner for fred taylor
garner and glenn for t.d
your receivers are terrible
i am trying to help you out
you don't even have a 0rd receiver
johnson is out with a bum hamstring
that is all i wanted to hear
i dont have dillon any more
beside
stephen davis is better than terrell
are you irritated
enron north america corp
stephen davis
terry glenn and bill schroeder for williams
moss
and travis taylor
did she try your patience
enron north america corp
just out of curiousity
would you do stephen davis for ricky williams straight up
enron capital management
so basically what you are saying is that had you had the 0rd pick in the draft you would have taken r williams enron capital management
alright
no williams can i interest you in a receiver and say lamar smith for robert smith or ron
remember
all pickup requests must now be sent through pat ryder at
my parents want to go skiing from 0/0
0/0 can you take off time then

i got a second room but don't know if we will keep it if we dont
around 0 if we do around 0
i know this is the same as before

i just though you would be interested in knowing that the ut game that you are going to will be at 0 pm
my tickets are in the student section for the game
i have four
i don't know if you want to sit in the student section b/c you really won't be sitting much
most of the students stand up the entire game
so
if you want to sit
we need to work on getting some seats in the alumni section
jason
if you and donnita want to come
you can have my two extra seats in the student section
assuming what i said above is correct
let me know
tony richardson and wayne chrebet for antonio freeman
i can get him if you want to trade freeman
just let me know enron north america corp
did you see that taylor is out this weekend
what do you want for watters straight up
in reality

that is fine
as long as you know how to find it

eric
i don't know what he is going to do
i hope that they start simms
not because applewhite is bad but because simms needs some time to develop
although
i think that mack is going to stay with his 0 qb system because of pride
we have at least 0
by the way
wear your grey
heat
jerseys to the game and bring a blue t-shirt as an extra
i think i can scrounge one up enron north america corp
redskins to stick with johnson at quarterback by len pasquarelli sportsline.com senior writer despite the continuing struggles of the offense and costly fourth-quarter interceptions by brad johnson
the washington redskins will stick with their starting quarterback for sunday night's game against the new york giants
sportsline.com has confirmed
if it was just
a problem
with brad
then we'd look at it
but that's not the case
coach norv turner said
but it goes beyond just the quarterback position
it's more than that
we're not playing well on offense in general
redskins quarterback brad johnson will remain the team's starter against the unbeaten giants
ap
in the wake of the redskins
0-0 loss to the dallas cowboys on monday night
there were rumblings washington might switch to backup jeff george for the key matchup against the undefeated giants
the washington offense
one of the league's most diverse in 0 when it ranked no
0 overall and second in scoring
has been sporadic at best in three games
a seventh-year veteran who is in the final season of his contract
johnson has five interceptions the last two games
including four in the fourth quarters of those losses
he has not been sharp in either his play-calling or his execution
and even some teammates suggested privately monday night that it might be time for a change
one glaring shortcoming has been the inability of the washington offense to throw the deep ball and stretch opposition secondaries
the redskins have only three completions this year of more than 0 yards
and the longest is 0 yards
in monday's defeat
the team's longest play was a 0-yard dumpoff to tailback stephen davis
the redskins
who averaged 0.0 yards per completion in 0 with both starting wide receivers averaging 0-plus yards
are averaging an anemic 0.0 yards per catch this season
but turner
who sources said was reluctant to make a quarterback change at this point and retains confidence in johnson
acknowledged the team needs new focus more than a new starter
there hasn't been any thought to switching
quarterbacks
he said
right now
we need to get better at every position
quarterback and everywhere else
please take me out of my bid for kennison
$0 bid for marcus pollard
what do you want for taylor
that's great
what do you want for taylor
just to let you know
s
davis is worth much more than taylor and m
robinson is worth much more than george
even if george is starting
garner and toomer for taylor
see the bottom for directions
did you mean to trade bledsoe for mack
what about toomer
garner
prentice and either wesley walls or tony gonzalez for taylor and watters
alright then anderson rather than watters
walls
toomer
and garner for taylor
that is the best i can do and that is the best deal you will get for taylor all year regardless of how he does
now i would be willing to talk freeman if you want to thro in either watters
i need to know fairly quickly
have you decided
i am not trying to rush you
but i am leaving early today for austin
so i need to set my lineup before i leave
let me know
that bid won't be there next week
did we ever decide on the whether to change to the owner's club or not
if you want to pick up a player
you need to let me know by today
b/c i will be on vacation tomorrow
i don't know
babe
what did you get
enron north america corp
you can only pick up players for the upcoming sunday's game through the bidding process
no pick ups will be allowed after wednesday on any given week
i just now saw it
it looks like a great gift
more from a daughter than a son
i will look at it when it comes
enron north america corp
here is the room info for next week
see below
rob
the product descriptions look good
go ahead and move forward with the rest of the process
thanks
eric
sorry brian
i am going to austin this weekend
can we all get together for dinner sometime next week
eric
your wrs are terrible
let me help you out
i need your dues by cob today
anyone up for half price pizza tonight
say around 0:0
and yes
i am a fat ass
let me know
let me know whether or not you can make it to the game on wednesday @0
here
woman
alright
you know now that you need to trade taylor
what do you want for him
plove is going to go to dallas
we are going to leave next friday when he gets done
0ish
and go up for the game
the game is at 0 in the morning
so we will come home directly after it
plove says he has a friend who has a place in dallas that we can crash at if we don't want to pay for a hotel
do you want to go
eric
yeah
just come by my desk
i have it for you
matt has a win and harry a loss
they tied but the win goes to the one with the most reserve points
do you still want beasley for gonzalez
george has no value after last weeks games
i will give you garner and
alright
when you find out that mine is the best bid for an injury prone player that has been unable to complete an entire season in his career
you can come back to me and maybe toomer and garner
the third highest scoring back in the league
will still be there
touchy
touchy
if you look at garner's stats he is very consistent
about 0 pts
a game
the game last week helped his cause but he has been good all year
my best offer is freeman
garner
and beasley for anderson/watters and taylor
let me know
your choice of anderson or watters and taylor
our game is at 0:0 tomorrow
can you make it
are you going to make tomorrow
thought you might be interested in this link for a beach vacation
yep
our game tonight is at 0:0
please try to make it by 0:0
as of now we have eight people
tim
can you see if micah can play again
yeah
try to be there on time
preferably 0:0
b/c we only have eight people
no
sorry
horn for m
anderson you are short wrs
you never responded to my last offer
taylor and anderson or watters for garner and freeman
and i will throw in beasley
i found something that new orleans has to offer that houston doesn't
are we done
after the weekly bidding process is finished
you can complete all transactions on the website
since most were out of town last weekend
we were thinking of celebrating brian's birthday again tonight at the cheesecak factory at 0:0
let me know if you will be able to attend
eric
are you serious
i just talked to you 0 minutes ago
if only we had your camaro to cruise in
is this some scam foundation that you have set up so that you can retire early
i know how these things work
i've been around the block
seriously though
i will be happy to contribute
eric
my deal on the other side fell through
so what do you think about garner
toomer
and schroeder for terrell and rice
i forgot
i offered you toomer and garner for terrell and jackson
if you still want to do that then that is fine
if not look at the deal below
can't do it
for one i don't have curtis martin and for two fred taylor has no value right now
propose something for someone i have
our game is at 0:0 this week
we play the other enron team
please let me know whether or not you will attend
our football game is at 0
sorry
yep
i think that despite all of the ballyhoo about simms
and i know you hate this
applewhite should play
i think if applewhite plays and we have a decent running game
we can blow them out
our defense is good enough to shut pretty much anyone down
when are you going up and what are ya'll doing up there
yes
it will be there all season
hi mom
i got your e-mail yesterday
shanna wasn't offended by your poignant political comments
she just knows
in no uncerain terms
that your are republican and are going to vote for bush
disregard the bills that your recieve from blockbuster
i will pay the late fee the next time i rent a movie
how are things otherwise
home 0-0-0 cell 0-0-0 you are going to leave the big e
why
where are you going to work
jason seemed excited about the concert
i think this is one of his favorite bands
i enjoy their music as well but not to the same degree as my eldest sibling
i am actually going to dallas on friday for the tx-ou game
i am taking a couple of friends from work
so it should be a good time
it always is
i need to place a $0 bid for steve christie and a $0 bid for wade richey
thanks
0 of us are going up friday and we are staying with a friend of one of the guys in the group
in
are you coming to the game tonight
do you want to go beat the crap out of some ou fans in dallas this weekend
congrats on the new position
i just heard enron north america corp
what did you think of the debate
i thought
all in all
bush did a good job
mainly because he got his points and proposals across without making a fool of himself
gore looked awfully fake and rehearsed on stage
do you think that the american public notices that the only issue he makes is with bush's tax cuts going to the
wealthiest one percent
that is the biggest load of garbage i have ever heard
i know bush can't say this but
if you do the math
the wealthiest 0% pay the most taxes notionally and proportionately to the rest of the country
so
if there is an across the board tax cut
obviously the wealthiest one percent will get the most notional dollars back
$0 for centers
just a reminder
please try to be at the field by 0:0
solid blue is the outermost track
dashe blue is the internal projection for its path so
i have nothing to worry about
woman
hey allison
not much is going on over here
just gutting it out until the weekend
it seems like the weeks get longer and longer
doesn't it
how are things in your world
you can come by whenever you want to get the check
how much do i owe you again
eric
is a penny good enough
just kidding

what
you tear down the goal posts because you beat the #0 team in the country
what are we going to do for your 0th
i have friday off
so maybe we can get together for dinner on thurs
the most pitiful excuse for a football game that i have ever seen
greg davis needs to be fired and the young players need to play
i.e
roy williams and bj need to play more than just on third downs
let me know whether or not you will come
who
the aggies
longhorns
or heat
are you up for a little golden tee on friday
we need a couple of extra players tonight
luis
do you have a friend that can play
brian
can you ask lenny to play
can you lower my bid to $0 for a
denson
mcnown and toomer for horn and culpepper
hector
this is your big chance to celebrate with your dream girl on her birthday
go get her
tiger
check it out
when are we going to start practicing for the a&m/ut ff tourney
we need to get a team together and start practicing
how were the flowers
exotic
i didn't get to see a live picture of them because they were too exotic
eric
that's no fun
we got another big name recruit
that will probably amount to nothing with our conservative
shitty offensive coordinator
in
they were all fair trades
you are all just envious of the relationships that i have develped with the other fantasy owners
that enable me to help improve both teams through trade
plove is just running his mouth because he can't cover me
remember how i kept burning you and those deep passes
contrary to popular belief
the people that actually show up to the game do have other things they can do if they know that the other team members will not show up
so
let me know whether or not you will be there
i am glad to see your expertise put to good use
not really
but some of the others do
besides
you weren't the only one that wasn't there last week
i though this link was pretty funny and sick at the same time
when a drug dealer is compared to the us president
you know we have problems
are we really going to stay at the shithole hotel in vegas or are you going to get rooms at the bellagio
i don't remember being part of this vote
and who says that this is a democracy
we can go out this weekend
can't make it
i'm sick
gary
we are still in the determination phase as far as what we are willing to sell
obviously
we would like to sell as close to the 0 yr average as possible
however
given the recent warmth of the past few winters and the forecsts
this is probably an unrealistic goal
i will get back to you by the end of the week with an acceptable target
thanks
eric
$0 bids for s christie
g anderson
and d akers $0 bid for kevin johnson $0 bid for torrance small thanks
this is to those of you who can make the game tonight
please try to get to the game as early as possible
0:0-0:0
so we can practice a little
we should have eight pending luis
friend
let me know if anything comes up between now and game time that we prevent your attendance
time to break out some of the old plays
yeah
you can bring him
it wouldn't hurt to have another guy
jason
i'd like to help you out this month but i just made a big expenditure on an exercise machine myself
so
it will have to wait until at least next month
sorry
rison is on gary's team
but is listed as a free agent due to my error
you can pick up another wr for free if you need one
sorry enron capital management
if you have players playing in tonight's game
det v tb
you need to put them in your lineup tonight
put it in the system enron capital management
to whom it may concern
in previous years enron has sponsored athletic tournaments for it's employees
i have participated in tournaments ranging from softball to flag football
in addition
enron has been very invloved with charitable organizations in the community
with these two things in mind
i wanted to propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion
i know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced
including flag football
recently
this is a way that enron can support employee interaction and wellness and
at the same time
give back to the community
my questions are
is this idea plausible
if so
who should i contact with regards to setting up the tournament
thanks in advance
eric bass
hey michael
i just wanted to confirm my position on the team
i know you have already talked to luis mena about putting together a team

sipping vodka a new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak
after mass he asked the monsignor how he had done
the monsignor replied
when i am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit
i put a glass of vodka next to the water glass
if i start to get nervous
i take a sip

at the beginning of the sermon
he got nervous and took a drink

good to finally hear from
judging from your e-mail
it sounds like you had some fun in your exercises
i guess that english degree is finally paying off
luckily you missed out on another series of disappointments from the longhorn football team

anyone up for keneally's after work today
its probably going to rain so that is why the lamination
what about smu area
my bro says this place is nice but don't know how expensive
this is the last one and probably the best
near smu
connected by rail to downtown and near greenville
another bar area

i work for tom martin on the texas gas trading desk and he has some questions on eol
force majeure
language
specifically
we buy/sell gas at the exxon katy plant and were wondering the
force majeure
ramifications of the the plant closing due to freeze-offs
i.e
can we claim force majeure in that instance and what remedies are provided for in the eol contract language
additionally
we buy/sell gas at hpl pooling points such as agua dulce pool and were curious about the force majeure provisions and remedies for these pooling zones
i do not know if you are the right person to contact regarding this information
but if you can provide any insight i would greatly appreciate it
thanks in advance
sincerely

i see east carolina but i don't see teetee
it doesn't bode well for the gallery furniture bowl
dan
sorry to keep bothering you
but does what we talked about earlier pertain to eol trades as well given the language in those contracts
i.e
requiring outside parties to honor contracts if they claim
force majeure
thanks

if you don't have this icon just click on help and search for attachments
do you have the original flight information on our flight out of houston
thanks
i thought you all might find this an interesting read
sorry
the complaint form wasn't very user friendly
i guess the person that designed the form is the same that hired there ticketing help
to whom it may concern
i recently returned from a wonderful vacation to telluride
it was wonderful except for the fact that i traveled on your airline
i was originally supposed to leave out of iah at 0:0 am on 0/0/0 for phoenix and catch a 0:0 am connection to telluride
the only flight of the day from phoenix to telluride
unfortunately
the flight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because of foggy conditions in the houston area
i do not blame america west for this
it is understandable to cancel this flight because of the danger involved in landing in foggy conditions
there is
however
no danger involved in taking off in these conditions
which leads me to the point of this complaint
your ticketing staff in iah was less than helpful in re-routing us on another airline
continental/united/american had several flights that could have delivered us to phoenix in time to catch our connection
so that we could make our connection
instead
we were told that it was impossible to find a flight that could get us to phoenix in time for this connection
subsequently
i called other airlines and confirmed space on flights that would have delivered us to phoenix on time
it now appears that america west was more willing to sacrifice a day of my vacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight
i am extremely disillusioned with the service we received
because we missed our connection we were forced to spend a combined 0 hrs in the phoenix and houston airports and eventually fly into montrose
co where we had to drive 0 miles to telluride
instead of arriving in telluride
co at 0pm on 0/0 we arrived at 0pm
a full ten hours later
this delay caused the waste of one full day of vacation
myself and members of my group will never fly your airline again because of this experience
for your research i provide the following data
persons in party

i was wondering if ya'll wanted to have a happy hour on friday for tim and louise in honor of their recent engagement
do you have any ideas on places to go
let me know
great game
terrible result
i can't really be dissappointed the play of simms or the wrs
dropped passes
the defense was very dissappointing
in
in enron north america corp
unfortunately i don't think tha louise would appreciate that too much considering she is in town and will be attending
so how about kenneally's or
wilkerson is the number 0 prospect in the country at lineman behind johnathon scott a commitment of guess who
texas
wilkerson scott
oh yeah
and by the way here are the rankings
i am going to use a matt lenhart argument
alla texas lost to arkansas last year who lost to lsu
texas played horribly against oregon and still had a great chance to win
and should have won
at the end of the game
oregon beat washington who beat miami who beat fsu who should beat oklahoma tonite
that means that texas should be national champions
get real
one 0-0 season after a decade of failure does not a championship caliber program make
our team did the same thing right after mack arrived
0-0 with big win in cotton bowl
you can expect about the same next year
lsu is getting some good recruits this year
you should be happy
in a couple of years your team will compete for sec and national championships
but don't start talking smack after a win over a lousy acc team
i just explained my logic
despite losing to ou earlier in the year texas is actually better than them
see below
so
i guess we will plan on meeting at kenneally's on friday after work
say tim
let me know if you want me to invite anyone else
too complicated enron capital management
i was thinking about taking brenda to lunch on the 0th of jan
let me know if you are interested in coming
if that date does not work for you
we can go some other day
eric
brenda
i know that i have mentioned a lunch several times and have finally gotten around to coordinating it
thanks
dave
how does friday
jan
0
sound
eric
well
enron north america corp
it looks like thursday is fine
so
how about we meet in the lobby at 0:0
let me know
eric enron north america corp
let me know if you are coming
oh
i invited your rocket power dancer friend
was i not supposed to do that
everyone on the list
as well as shanna and louise
you can invite others if you want
not yet but i will let you know
i went ahead and forwarded your msg to tim
although i already told him that the 0 yr old was invited
he didn't like that too much
yeah why
i was planning on watching at home
are you going to watch it somewhere
now i see how you guys have been winning all of your games
through cheating
you are supposed to have at least one player on ir each week
a designated ir player cannot play
there are no ir moves during the week
that means that at least one person on your team should score no points each week
out
how many 0 way tickets do you have
i am interested in buying in bulk
thanks
eric bass
well i am looking for 0 round trip tickets
0 one-ways
and was looking to spend around $0 per round trip
$0 for each one-way
what is your offer on that size
thanks for you prompt attention because i am trying to book airfare today on one airline or another
hey mom
things are well
just looking forward to the weekend
we are going to happy hour tonight to celebrate tim's engagement
shanna is going to visit toni tomorrow
apparently she has taken a turn for the worse
other than that
just trying to get back into the work groove after all of that vacation
how are things on the homefront
i'm up for going to watch it somewhere
give me a call on my cell phone tonight or tomorrow
0-0-0
i am not a market maker in swa vouchers
so you have my word that i will not sell them back
your bid for these vouchers is $0 in the market
my bid for bulk is $0
i am willing to pay more
i can already get to my destination for $0
so maybe we can meet in the middle
let me know
shanna is meeting her family in dallas tomorrow
so she will not be alone
tim is a friend of mine that went to lsu
i worked with him for about a year when i first started
he had been dating his fiancee during college but they had broken up about a year ago
he had been trying to get back together but i don't think he knew that he would get engaged over christmas
i guess he had bought the ring in hopes of popping the question and when things went well over christmas he went ahead
have a fun and safe weekend
hey dad
we would love to meet ya'll for dinner
just let me know when
the only night we can't is friday
love
send out an e-mail enron capital management
i made a few changes
generally when creating a resume
shorter is better
preferably fitting on one page
so most of my changes have been consolidations
also
i tried to make the tenses of all of your bullet points the same
you want to do this on all resumes and outlines
as a side note
shanna and i would like to take you and donnita to dinner on friday at pappasitos

but in a suspect neighborhood
it looks like they are building a lot of townhouses close though check it out

mom had said that you wanted me to go through bob dunn for my mortgage

i am fine with seeing more houses before buying but was thinking that it might be a good idea to get the ball rolling on the mandell house

low ball contract
this does not mean that i am wanting to buy right away
but more of testing the market and resolve of sellers
let me know when you are available to see more houses
i am free whenever
except for saturday after around 0 pm
no i haven't driven by yet
i would like to see the mandell house again before putting a contract in on it

bass enron north america corp
brett
just thought i'd drop you a line
cool site
i guess you have too much spare time on your hands
nothing too exciting is going on here in h-town
just working
i am trading gas futures and other derivatives for enron
it can get exciting at times
lots of $ flying trading hands
but i haven't got to blow anything up like you
so i feel that my life is somewhat lacking
big news on marilyn

however
just as last month
if you have specific questions on any location or transaction
we can examine those on a case by case basis
thank you
the system won't let me for some reason
i will keep trying
we are heading over to the front porch after work today for some drinks if you would like to join
eric
hey dad
austin was fun
michael ballases and i went up for the day and met up with his family b/c it was parent's weekend
it was good to see them again
i am anxious to see how we play against ou
i am starting to have a good feeling about this team
they looked really sharp on saturday
especially the offense
shanna and i will come out for jason's b-day on wednesday
i don't know what time yet but it should be around 0:0
see ya then
out
sure
just call me the bank that delivers
we will probably be out around 0:0-0 do we need to bring anything
if you haven't paid your dues by sunday you will begin to forfeit

just a little something to get you fired up about this weekend
ive got a 0 yd line seat for the game this weekend with your name on it pal

the league has a waiver process
you need to have your transactions in by noon thursday
i don't have any tickets sorry
are you going to make it up there and try to scalp some
go ahead and put it in the add/drop on the website and i will go through them at noon
it goes by record then points
sorry no tkts
it was a good game though
hey mom
thanks for the info
tough break for rush
i was sorry to hear about that
things are going well
just kind of slow
i have my asthma test today
it is called a pulmonary function test
what do you want to do for your birthday
do you want ot get together on friday or saturday and where
let me know
hey sheila
thanks for the invite
my mom's b-day is this friday as well
i still don't know if we are taking her out on friday or saturday
so we will try to make it
we stayed at the marriot at the capital last year in austin
no
you are going to go dancing with me
that sounds great
i am always interested in a free meal
friday night is probably better for us if you guys want to come into town
if not
then saturday is fine
not my fault
like i knew that jamal was going to blow out his knee
i didn't offer terrell davis
what do you want for torry
ok alstott and troy brown for holt
alright what do you want for warrick dunn
moulds for alstott
what do you want for eddie
supposedly i have
reversible airway disease
which is not asthma but similar
they have given me an inhaler and some claritin
for allergies
i haven't been able to find anything on the internet about it though
maybe this is it
whatever babe
i am concerned but not to the point of worrying my brains out
like you
i tend to trust the doctor in matters such as these
like when i had chest pains
the doctor ran tests to rule out significant problems and did notice an abnormality on one test
instead of running out and panicking i waited and took the tests again and they were normal
now i am not advocated waiting for the next test if that makes you uncomfortable
you should do what you want to do
but i guess what i am saying is that you are not going to die
so stop worrying and let the tests confirm or deny any problem
i think i am going to bail on happy hour
shanna isn't feeling well
but plan on coming by my place for the game on sunday
are we going to plan one for dec
i have yet to get my cipro
when i get a spare $0 i will run out and get some
keep me posted on the trip
i probably need to plan it soon so that i can plan for vacation time
love
just wanted to drop you a line to tell you that my new e-mail address is eric.bass@enron.com
hope all is well
due to the early game this week
please have your add/drops in the system by noon tomorrow
wednesday
thanks
we have eaten at urbana
ibiza
and masraffs
i have heard good things about zula and benjy's
benjy's can get crowded though
how about highlands lodge for dec 0 for 0 nights
it says something about buy one night get one free
i just found that you could stay at highland lodge for 0 nights starting dec 0 and receive 0 lift tkts for that time period for $0 total
that is not bad ehh
sorry i am so late in returning the e-mail
but have been on vacation since last wednesday
as far as enron
it looks like another down day today on the open
i hate to tell you to sell now
but i wouldn't want to own enron right now
i could see enron moving down to the teens much easier than moving up to the thirties
i might just sell now and look to buy back lower
let me know what you think
new orleans was fun
the wedding was nice and it was good to get away for the weekend
how was your weekend
as far as enron
i think long term it is a buy
but wall street has no confidence in managament and there is definately a negative sentiment
i think in the short term we will definately see the teens
i doubt it
he usually shops in town for his
i'll ask
do you still think that colorado is going to win straight up
i have some good news and some bad news
the good news is that i invested all of the league dues in the stock market over the last few weeks
the bad news is that i invested it in enron stock
so
needless to say i am going to have to default on this year's payouts
sorry guys
any news
which night do you want to get together
sounds good
i will make the reservations for sat
is 0 o'clock ok
the card was though
0
0 o'clock it is
see you then
redwood grill
that is good to hear
i was driving through west u last night and saw quite a few
i hit a couple of kids so i figure that netted me a few points
i look forward to seeing you on saturday love
anybody up for happy hour after work
i was thinking kenneally's at around 0
let me know
thought you might be interested
no problem
thanks for joining us
we enjoy spending time with you guys
love
tkts are hard to come by but its looking like we can get in to the game
sect 0 row 0
i am taking friday off
do you want to together for some golf
that's fine ditch me for another tourney
but i undsertand you have to find alternative forms of income with enron's recent performance
the greatest football team in college history plays kansas on saturday
i got your card
thanks for joining us on saturday night
shanna and i always enjoy your company
love
no special occassion really
just burning vacation
i have 0 days left
whats going on in your world
that sounds good
i am taking that friday off
the mood is pretty somber around here today
love
i agree with your comments about managament
it seems like they are caught like a deer in a headlights
i have bought some more shares today
my view is that the company will not fold
the worst case scenario is a buyout
so
it seems like we should bottom out shortly
right
good news on uncle george
what is your logon and password for the-university
i am having some problems with mine thanks
i'm fine nothing new to report other than the stuff in the news
i think everything will work out
anybody up for happy hour at ruggles enron field after work
i thought it was ruggles dy-enron field
so now that we have had this witty banter back and forth
is anyone coming to happy hour
what is jason's phone # at work and at home
we are going to happy hour at ruggles enron
dynegy field after work
any interest
we'll be there all night
you are welcome to invite chance and anyone else down there
change of plans
we are going to front porch
so meet up if you can/want
what do you think
you don't care
brian
things are pretty hectic right now
there is a lot of uncertainty about the future
dynegy acquired enron
it is so odd to say that
for its trading business and ees so i think my position is safe for the time being
up until the acquisition was formalized it was pretty depressing at work
but things have started to pick up again
i am glad to hear that classes are going well
keep the seat next to you warm because i may be forced up there pretty soon
of course
now that enron's name has been dragged through the mud it will probably be a little more difficult to go to a good b-school
good luck on finals and keep in touch
your pal
eric
i like it
how much
he should have been
you are weird
what's up
things are pretty hectic here
you lucked out by getting out of dodge
are you still coming to see the 0-0 nat'l champs on t+0
i think things will be ok at enron
it is pretty depressing right now though
how is school for you
just to let you know
i got seats on the 0 yd line for the game

programs
system utility applications
msn messenger and do the exchange system
interesting
thanks for the update
if wanted to play golf at sugar creek next wed
can i get on without you and how much does it cost
we would love for you to join us
i'm trying to get a feel for everyone's desire to play paintball in the next few weeks
this would obviously not be sponsored by enron b/c enron doesn't have enough cash to buy anything right now
so let me know if you would be interested and
if so
when you would be available to go
the cost should be around $0-0 a person
please forward to anyone i have forgotten or might be interested
eric
they won't be playing but they will be tied up to a post for our enjoyment
hey dave
we are on for noon tomorrow
i will try to make it out to your house tomorrow
i have to go pick up the clubs at the parents house

that sounds great
i will be able to make it
thanks
eric

he seems very happy
things are a little sketchy at enron right now with the debacle that has occured
but everything should work out for the best
don't worry about all of that stuff
you can do what you please with it
i thought you were back in houston for good as of the last time we talked
0 mos
ago
did you leave after that
where are you working now
i will relay your msg to jason
where are you working now
i know you worked for that motorcycle company
do you still work there
jason's fiancee
sorry no fancy accent
had been a friend of his for awhile
they started dating about a year and a hlaf ago and got engaged about 0-0 months ago
she is very nice and we get along just fine
thanksgiving was good
i stayed out at the the parents house for a couple of days and went up to college station on friday for the game
how about you
glad to hear that lucky is well
since you never gave me the $0 for the last time we bet on cu/texas
i figured i would give you the chance to go double or nothing on the second round
i think the line is texas
0
let me know
fyi
since you didn't take care of business
that sounds good 0 it is
we will go for beers regardless
as we talked about yesterday
i am still at enron
while i have a job
i am trading natural gas futures and other derivative instruments
i am living off of newcastle and 0 in the gables pin oak
it is very nice
especially since i don't have a roommate any more
glad to hear that the family is doing well what are you doing at your new job
accounting
what about the firls
what are they doing
hey brett
what's been happening
i hope you didn't buy any enron
it is looking good for the horns
it seems like fate is on their side
every week we get closer to a rose bowl berth
if we get to the rose bowl i will have a ticket with your name on it if you can get away
are you going to be able to catch the game this weekend
btw
are you still in hawaii
hope all is well
your pal
eric
what is your commission
then you are done
sounds like a good job
i am glad you are enjoying it
i haven't taken any big vacations lately
mostly to austin
i did go to new orleans for a wedding recently but other than that nothing
the girls sound like they are well
tell them i said
hi
good talking to you
go ahead and buy on that news
you know its going to be bullish
whatever you think
just let me know
are you telling me that you want me to buy and you will pay me back
thats fine just let me know what i owe
thought you might enjoy
also
in bankruptcy
who is the first to be paid
specifically
are employees first in line
thanks
thanks for the offer
i think some guys at work are going to get drinks today
you are welcome to join if you like
if not
i will take a rain check on your offer
tom
my boss
does not have any documentation with regards to the bonus
but will make an effort to get it when things quiet down
he did
however
tell me that it is clear to him that this money cannot be touched by enron because there were discussions in the past few days about trying to get at the money for credit issues and that was not an option available to the company
what do you think
_eric
hey brett
good to hear from you
it is pretty bad at enron
i still have a job for the time being but things are in limbo right now
the good news is that my division
trading ops
is the most valuable and desirable for any acquisition
the bad news is that we could declare bankruptcy at any time and that would leave our fate in the hands of the creditors and the courts
it is sad to see a good company like this fold despite the fact that we make a great deal of money
oh well
things will work out
as far as the rose bowl
i think we have a pretty good shot
currently we are 0rd in the bcs rankings
the top two go to the national championship game
which is the rose bowl this year
the two teams ahead of us are miami
0
and florida
0
if either one loses
miami at virginia tech this week and florida vs tennesee and possible sec championship game
we should get into the top 0
of course
we have to win on saturday as well
this has been a wacky year in college football
so i think our chances are pretty good
good luck on the proposal
you are about to venture to the dark side
telluride should be fun
we went there last year for a ski trip
again
i might be venturing down that path soon
i should be here when you are in town so drop me a line or give me a call
h
0-0-0 or cell:0-0-0 or work
hopefully
0-0-0
take care
eric
i don't have your work #
what is it
you are invited to join in the excitement of texas in the big xii championship game this saturday at 0 pm at my apartment
we will provide the food
let me know if you guys are interested
my apartment is at 0 pin oak pk
#0 houston 0
goto mapquest.com for directions
eric
you are a dick
i got the cashiers check for the full amount and deposited it at fidelity
i am just waiting for it to post to my account now
a friend and i were debating about payroll in a bankruptcy type situation
i said that there were no guarantees with regards to payroll until the courts approve it
he said that payroll was an administrative expense and therefore should be guaranteed
what do you think
you are an asshole
and where did you see that
i doubt they will show
sure
have you decided on what you would like us to bring
that is nice to hear
i will look forward to speaking with her
hey
how are things going with you guys
we really enjoyed saturday night out at the house
we should get together more often
how is mr
hamilton doing
i was thinking of sending some flowers to either the hospital
if he is out of icu
or the house
can you give me the address of either
love
harry
sorry it has taken me so long to get back to you
things are so bad at work right now
i have nothing to do whasoever

eric
trying to gauge interest for a get together at my place for the saints tonight

eric
do you want me to book this or what
which al's formal wear
now keep in mind that you have $0 to spend via me
if you want to pick up the incremental cost yourself then i will book it and you can reimburse

let me know
i booked your honeymoon
i changed it
no problem
thanks for playing
hopefully we can keep in touch and have the same people next year
i will be settling the league up shortly and will send you a check

i hope your holidays went well otherwise
sorry i didn't get to see ya

jan

i was thinking about taking the gambling/drinking cruise out of freeport
about 0 mins south of houston
called the texas treasure
www.txtreasure.com
the cost should run about $0 a person for the cruise
drinks and
gourmet
dinner included or $0/person for drinks and buffet dinner
let me know which one you would prefer
i personally prefer the better dinner
gambling expenses are not included in the above calculations
the cruise sails from 0pm
0am
let me know if you can make it and
if so
what choice of dinner you would like asap so i can make arrangements
eric
i haven't really thought of that yet
i guess i will wait on the response that i get
hey brian
the holidays were good
it wasn't really that big of a break for me b/c we are still doing nothing at work
how were your's
and how is the job search going
i am still trying to figure out the payouts for the league
i think that you get 0% of the pot for 0nd place
the tigers
future looks pretty bright
esp with spurrier gone now
how do you think they will be next year
oh well
i hope things are going well
lets try to get together for drinks sometime soon
you owe $0 for the league
$0 for dues minus $0 for winning the league pool one week
do you agree
your net payout is $0.0 how do you want me to get the check to you
hey harry
how are things
have you found a job yet
i trust the holidays went well for you
anyways
i have a check for $0 for ffl
where can i send it
eric
actually
i forgot to take the $0 out
so $0.0
hey brian
long time no hear
how are things at harvard
i trust you had a good holiday period
are you still in kentucky or back in boston
how was the first round of finals
things are good down here
i stayed in houston for the holidays
i still have a job
the big date for us
in the trading group
is this friday
that is when the bankruptcy court decides who is the best bidder for the trading group
hopefully we will get back to work sometime soon after that
i really have done now work for the past 0 months
mostly just sitting around and researching mutual funds and doing crossword puzzles
i have been coming in to work around 0 and leaving at about 0 everyday
what oral surgeon did you go to to get your wisdom teeth out
tim needs to get his out and was wondering if you recommended the surgeon that did yours
drop me a line when you get a chance
eric
i still haven't heard from you guys regarding the bachelor party
let me know
we are going to lil
papasito's with some friends on friday
just wanted to know if you wanted to join us
hey mom
things are going well
i heard you guys had a good time at the shower
i don't know michael's address but i will get it
when are we going to get together
eric
do you want to go to dinner on friday with us and some friends
lil
papasitos on kirby
i have not heard back from tommybomb or scott re
your bachelor party
maybe you would like to try them to see if they are going
i need to book the cruise asap though
so let me know
here is the info
mar 0-0 caesars tahoe pkg rate is $0 for the first two nights and $0 for each additional night so
$0 total for 0 nights
the pkg includes two lift tickets per day
0 total per person
voucher for the use of the spa daily
0 daily brucnh buffets this is for the regular room regular rate for regular room is $0/night regular rate for jacuzzi room is $0/night sun through tues and $0 for wed the regular rates do not include anything but the room airfare continental offer nonstop for $0/person
flight time is 0.0 hours other airlines offer 0 stop service for $0/person
flight time is 0 hours let me know when you decide
eric
i forgot to mention that if you do not buy the pkg then lift tickets are about $0/person per day
i think we will probably just book the room and worry about the lift tickets ourselves
alright last e-mail
we got clarification on the rooms
the pkg deal stays the same but if you want to get just the room with 0 breakfasts each day it is $0/night
if you want the premium room
the only difference is that the premium room has jets in the tub
then it is $0/night with no breakfast $0/night with breakfast
mom said you needed it
houston
texas
0
hey dad
did you get the link i sent on the def ann
if so
what do you think
is there anything i missed
i am still waiting on a couple of rsvps for the bachelor party so i will let you know on the transport
how are things otherwise
i haven't heard back form tom yet
but everyone else is going
can you get in touch with him
did he tell you if he was coming or not
we are still wating on bankruptcy court to decide our future
the dynegy deal fell through a couple of months ago
my division
trading ops
will most likely be sold to either ubs or citigroup
keep in touch
eric
hey brian
the auction process concludes today and we should no who the winning bid is tomorrow
it looks like it will be either ubs or citigroup
as far as our friends go
bryan hull got laid off and is looking for a job
he actually got offered to move back to risk but decided not to take the job b/c he thought he had something else in the bag
it turned out that he didn't
matt lenhart
is still here and is in the same boat as i am
tim boucher
is still here and is handling the liquidation of ees
retail book
he may or may not continue on with ees depending on whether or not another company is willing to take a chance on ees
apparently there are some pkg deals in the works
he is also interviewing with other companies
chad got laid off and is touring europe for a month
gillette got laid off and moved to india to teach english to young indians
how crazy is she
and shanna still has a job at enron in tax
the gov't always gets there $$
she is also looking for another job
i think that just about covers everything
i am sure that you have talked to lenny and know his situation
how is hector holding up
i never hear anything from him
tell him i said hello
btw
jason
my bro
get married in february
keep in touch
eric
are you coming
you are the last one to rsvp
i need to know so i can make the reservation
eric
i think you gave me a bad e-mail address for tom so can you find out if he is coming or not
i have made reservations for jason's bachelor party
you are the chosen few
the cruise is set for sat
jan 0 at 0 pm out of freeport
transportation will be arranged for you
we need to leave at about 0 pm on the 0th
i will arrange a meeting place and relay it to you in a future e-mail
the final tally will be $0 a person
i have paid for this already so you can reimburse me on the 0th and i can promptly blow all of that money on gambling
sadly
the gourmet dinner was not available on the freeport cruise so we will have to suffer through a buffet dinner
let me know if you have any questions
eric
0
one person is not on the e-mail
there will be 0 total
it should be fun
see ya then
thanks
of the two
i think ubs is better
it seems like they are a smaller
more specialized company that is more similar to our culture from a risk tolerance perspective
it should be good
of course
anything is better than the way it has been
we are not going to be able to go to tahoe anymore b/c of scheduling conflicts with my boss
so we are planning on going to las vegas from feb 0-0
the airfare is $0/person roundtrip and we can stay at the aladdin or rio for about $0/night

me at golf
you are tiger woods on sunday and i am greg norman at the masters on sunday
i will try to call this weekend
love matt
you are in nyc
no your not
don't set me up with the dirty talker
i am afraid she would embarass me
i hope it becomes a hurricane too
huricanne = $$$$ for me
call me when you get back from your 0 week vacation
it must be really hard over there at
are you really in nyc
you lucked out
there isn't a hurricane
i probably will party tomorrow b/c it is going to be the best day of work ever
i actually kind of interviewed at csfb in nyc
that would be huge if you got a job with them
i know two guys that work there
if you are in banking you better get used to 0-0 hours a week
talk to you later
we cant go get drinks if you are in a body cast
that would look to crazy
i would be trying to pour a margarita down the opening for your mouth
i am glad the weather is good
it really doesn't matter too much about the hurricane
call me when you get back
lucky fuck
i went to woody's last night
there was such a hottie coming in when i was leaving and i would have stayed but today was such a big day at work i couldn

i haven't found out about my test yet
i am pretty sure i failed
i didn't study enough

complex
i had manning but i traded him away b/c i had no backs
now i have vodka collins starting for me
did you talk to max
what night should we go out
if we only go out 0 night i vote sat
if we go out both that is cool too
what time is cu/csu
csu is the underdog and i would bet that they get punished
tell max to stay out of the ghetto
property there doesn't appreciate
thanks for the email
i am hopefully taking off tomorrow night

how was labor day weekend for you
what did you do
can you foward me the rules for that loser league
can you send down your rockies forecast again
i need to look at your numbers for the winter again
thanks matt
that game was great
i was so impressed with griese
gary
the whole office
the defense is a major concern
i am torn between being impressed with what they did on the road in a hostile environment or being freaked out b/c of that defense
st
louis had a good defense last year
i hope their defense is still good b/c that would say a lot about our offense
how was your labor day
the defense couldn't even stop them
they have no place to go but up
i am concerned about the d
you need that to win in the playoffs
i called her again and left a message
i might need to go through someone else
olandis gary tore his acl
he is out for the season
how did that happen
i thought there was all mo's and no ho's
who is that
eric told me to shoot you an email to bid on a free agent
i want to bid $0 on mike anderson of the broncos
let me know what else i need to do
thanks
matt
during the 0rd quarter
do i need to just send you a check for $0 or should i just send the $0
is there just a tally at the end of the year with the payouts then
congratulations
is that in austin or houston
denver was nice
i just played golf and took it easy

i think we might check it out after the game
bbq at tim's or something and then lets go to the crawl thing
i am going to tonight
here is the morning ops
congrats on the new baby
if shirley hasn't left town yet i think i can get him a ticket
let him come even if nobody back out anyway
it doesn't matter squeezing 0 more person into the room
i can probably meet up with you guys around 0:0ish
will you guys still be there at that time
call me on my cell at
0
0-0 if you guys go somewhere else
i will drive if it doesn't rain
my windshield wipers don't work
hoskins car is too small
the girl i was going to talk to in this group is out today
i will talk to her
she is always asking me if i know any analyst who need work
i am gonna be a rock star sat night
this isn't porn is it
i will try to meet you there
did you open an account on world sports exchange
if you open one use me as the referral and i will split the $0 with you and we can make a bet
i might go meet jill and them for drinks around 0 if you want to go
call the cell

i was planning on going but i got home late
i did check out woody's
it was ok
when do you leave for okla
where did you guys go after cadillac

my user name is mlenhart
we can split the $0 that they will put into my account and place a parlay bet
sammy marcos and wayne gonz want to come
you have too much time on your hands
when you do it give me a call on my cell and i will call in a bet
i think we might go to someones place and then go out afterwards
i know someone else who wants to play coed softball if there are space available for guys
try to find out where club monkey is going sat and we will front run them to the bar
here it is
i heard langley is out for the year
who will fill that gap
no subject = ebonics
that makes no sense
i heard it is 0.0
i will try to talk to someone today
it was ok
i went to austin fri night and watched the ut game on sat
how was that wedding
was it worth going up to neckville
oklahoma
are you hitting the town this week
let me know if you want to go get a drink
do you have your resume to email me again
i can't remember where i saved it
i can get you on that team if you can get that girl to play
i guess they need girls on the team
i am worried about them dropping like flies
i thought last year we were injury prone but this year is worse
i am still skeptical about the defense
next week will tell a lot
not you please
she can wear one
i think it is on tues
i need your ssn# for this form
rules of attraction less than zero read in that order
i heard from the girl you beat up
she told me you said
what are you looking at bitch
and then you told her
this is central fool
you'd betta recognize
sounded like you really took it to her
i am going to the tenn game
i am probably going to woodrows for the next game
they told me to send in the resume to h.r
i tried but they have to go through it anyway
i told them to inquire about your resume
it was just those three
you have to read them in that order
we should go to n.o
over the first weekend in december and catch the broncos at the saints
we can do that or go when we planned and hit the lsu game
mike
here are some of the ops sheets
let me know if you need some of the others
the cali power sheet is down so i cannot send it
what did the sluts look like
see about scheduling that weekend then
it is the weekend of dec
0rd
i won 0 of 0 sunday afternoon
lost 0 sunday night and lost 0 last night
struggled at the end
going out thurs
is that nov
0
i probably cannot get there until fri
i can get tickets
that is really classy
i am making money taking the other side of the boys
they suck this year
worst part is that they don't have 0st round picks next year
call chris gaskill
he should be able to send you a file of those gas dailies
later
i cannot go
cooper
here is the list of the hour ahead scheduled flows
generation
load
imp/exp
np0 np0 el dorado sf sf mead if we can get the data starting 0/0/0 that would be great
thanks again for your help
i hope this isn't too much trouble
matt
i sent your stuff into to someone else in h.r
i haven't heard anything yet
you might hear something before i do
if i hear anything i will let you know
woody's tomorrow
i've got a great haircut
i am having the weekend kickoff tonight at woody's
sat i think i am going to hit woodrows to catch the lsu game
what are you doing
did you go to
do you want to go up to dallas the weekend of oct 0th and catch the ou-tex game
i heard it is wild up there around that time
all ou and tx chicks
we can stay at emmitts or something
sorry about last night
dinner took a while at el tiempo
i was dead after eating
are you going out tonight
we are going to woodrow's for the game tomorrow
yeah call me tonight
i might try to go get a drink and just hang out tonight
game is at 0.0
how about the broncos
they looked good
defense is still suspect
you missed a hell of a saturday night
all these hot chi-o's were a woodrows watching the lsu game
they were all in from out of town and we met up with them later to go out
there were about 0 of them and i would say 0 were
what about football
what is up with cu
they suck
i'm not going to run my mouth about the broncos b/c i don't want to jinx them
defense will get better as they play more
call me back
i accidently hit a button on the phone to disconnect
i am in
do you need anyone else to play b/c chad wants to play if we have room
we could always use another pass rusher
are the softball games tues nights
when do they start
where are they
i need to tell that chick
you can play football
we play tomorrow night at 0pm
yeah
both of you can go
just show up
looks like we are going to have to find a couple of loser fijis who can't find dates for the tennessee game and lift their tickets
i am so fired up for that game
tim just told me it is the 0:0 game on espn
cooper
the sheet that you sent me earlier doesn't refresh anymore
it is saying that a rollback transaction is missing
let me know if i need to do anything to fix it
thanks for your help
matt
what happened to griese
here is the info
let that chick know
no
tell her it is off of buffalo spwy
so you are going to just stay in and tame the shrue all night
sounds like you would be calculating a book each day
it might be a good entry into trading
but i would check with them on how they have their program set up to get people into trading positions
let me check with h.r
today
they move slow
i would ask some questions on that posting to find out where it would put you eventually
trading is the way to go
more money in trading and your opportunities would open up throughout the industry
i think she is in
i would stay away from scheduling
you definately don't want to do that
we might go out tonight to sierra
i will let you know
pat
i am bidding $0 for nedney
kicker-denver
where you been bra
i just spoke to someone who said they would make sure you get in for an interview

matt lenhart
what does mmmcchhhaaa mean
is that the scary sound from friday the 0th
things have been good
just been working a lot and living it up a little
that is great that you started teaching 0th grade
i watched florida play last week
they got lucky
we will have to make a bet on the lsu-flor game
i will take the points of course
i will let you think of the bet since you are into that stuff
i went out with jen
max in denver
i guess they are back together
what is a good smaller town in florida to live in
one with golf courses right on the ocean
toni

thanks
matt lenhart

bama is a definate
just call me tomorrow and we can go out there
i hope there is a hottie working 0st
i will hit singles all day
i am in
the lsu game rocked
davey hasn't been playing b/c he has been hurt
if he would have played last week we would have beat uab
denver defense sucks
that game made me sick
i can do can cun for sure
just let me know the dates
what happened to cu
i heard marcus houston hurt his hip
it was awesome
i didn't get your message until last night
i didn't have my phone with me there
it was so much fun
that was one of the greatest games that i went to
where did you watch it
it sounded like you were partying some
i will be in for cancun for sure
i guess that means we need to go back to some more games
i cant believe we didn't go
when are we going to go get drinks with celeste's friend that is the hottie
how about that game
did you get to see it
tell celeste to set it up for thurs
we will go hit some cool place for drinks
i went
it was incredible
one of the best games i have seen there
rohan is the man
we would be 0-0 if he could have played last week
big game sat
we need to do something for the game
what do you mean i wasn't doing so hot saturday night
i thought i was in great shape
i was dancing better than menudo
i was hurting when we left sat
i almost puked in my car when i was driving back to houston
going back to football games is so much fun
but the drinking kills you
i haven't drank that much for that long in a while
it was worth it
i am tired today
but it is nice for everyone to say how we kicked ass this weekend
i still can't believe you didn't get tickets
i had extras
i could have hooked you up
i heard brittney spears was at fred's on sat night
did you hear that
not that i am a fan of hers
i just heard that
shoot me another email when you get a chance
matt
sorry i didn't call you back last night
i went to bed
i will try to call you tonight or tomorrow
sounds good
how long would we stay in cancun
i don't think i can take 0 weeks again this year
i could meet you in n.o
and we could fly from there or if you have to go to cancun through houston i can meet you here
i will try to call tonight after my softball game
hope all is well
have you ever been to monterey
cali
i get to go there in two weeks for a pipeline meeting
it looks gorgeous
is grandma still staying in town with you
you said some embarrassing things on the message
just kidding
this weekend will probably be low key
i am sure i will go out sat
what are you doing
i am down in the crowd somewhere
i dont remember monterey
i think i missed it when i was curled in a ball in the back seat freezing my ass off
i cant wait
i looks awesome
i am playing golf one day
i am going to fly into sf and drive down the coast to monterey
should be nice
i ran on the field
it looked awesome
i had a blast
it was one of the top 0 games i saw at tiger stadium
it is okay if i am getting old b/c i age really well
anyway
men get distinguished as they age
i don't care how old i get just as long as i keep my hair
i can't believe you don't like freds when it is packed
that is the best time to be at that place
i do feel better at work today
i found out i get to go to monterey
cali in two weeks for a boondoggle
it is all paid for and all i will do is booze and golf
i look foward shit like that now
you should be going out every night while you can
one day you will hit the real world and you can't do that
lsu is not the real world
you can still party a lot while you work
you just have to be in pain at work and pretend like you are not hung over so they don't think you have a problem
i usually go out 0-0 nights a week
i try to live like a rock star
like britney spears
email me back when you get a chance
what is up
i didn't have your email
anyway
i think you called last night and i answered and i could hear you talking to somebody
but you couldn't hear me saying hello
dirty george does some sick shit
he lost his hand up his ass the other day
how is the new job
are we on for drinks with the hottie
cool bra
what is up for the game this weekend
do you get to go to ny ever
sounds good
are you going to start working
i have a joke for you
q
what two words clear out a men's bathroom faster than anything
a
nice dick
i don't listen to nsync
i like color me bad more
they are more my speed
they have a more mature sound
you don't know what a boondoggle is
a boondoggle is where another company takes you on trip to discuss business over golf and booze
they pay for it all and it is usually fairly extravagant
they make this job worth it
i am having a shitty day
i am losing a shit load of money
do you go out every night or something
you are living the wild life
what are you taking the gre for
what the fuck is the gre for anyway
is that the grad school test
what is your major
i can't remember what you told me
speech something
where are you going to grad school
lsu
talk to you later
you must be a hoodoo for the tigers
i went in for the tenn game
it was awesome
you dont realize how good we had it at school until you leave
check out md anderson
it is the top cancer research hospital in the country
how is everything going there
i talked to our babe kelsey walker a couple of weeks ago
she was in houston for a bachelorette party
she is still hot
i also saw brooke and emily last weekend
brooke looked good
i am planning on going to jacques wedding
when is it
what lsu games are you going back in for
i am definately hitting the bama game and possibly miss st
talk to you later
i spoke to her yesterday
if she doesn't get you an interview with that guy she is going to get you one later
game at tim or val's
sounds good
we can bring some shit
is this girl from the same town as celeste
i am trusting you that she is hot
i don't want to show up for some drinks and have to sit next to some troll
well just let me know
we can get drinks any night next week
i think mitch is going to come over also
i just got a 0
my mom is so proud she raised a good boy
see how you do on this test
let me know your score
how did you lose 0 points from the last time you took the test
you cannot pretend some of that stuff didn't happen
i actually scored a 0
that is respectable
it doesn't make me a dope addict or dog lover so i am comfortable with it
i didn't cheat like you did
there is no way your score can go down on this
i think you need to retake it and be honest with the test and be honest with yourself
let me know what you really score
did you see the debate last night
i was impressed with cheney
i thought he was more impressive than either presidential candidate
wade might show up if that is ok
i tell him to bring some food
i am not going fucking ice skating
that fag might be
i think there is a power trader named rogers herndon
why
so what are you doing this weekend
we should go get some beers after work at that new place near tim called the station or something
let me know if you are in
whenever
i am ready to go now
you won't be able to throw me when you are on ice skates boitano
give me a call at work or at home when you can go
i didn't bet with her
she still owes me $0
we came back to reality
you didn't miss shit on saturday
merc room was full of nothing but cougars
it was a waste
we need to hit this place called toc
i heard that it is great
texas sucks huh
how was your weekend
do you guys want to play golf sat morning
let me know and i will get a tee time before the game
somewhere decent
if you want in i will get a tee time today
damn
you got a 0
did you answer yes to the animal sex question

my mother would be proud
i am just an angel
you should move to the french riviera
i think i am going to do something similar
i need to go anna nicole and marry a rich old woman and move to the carribean
i think i could quit work and become some old blue hair's boy toy
i would only be a couple of years
i would probably be able to get a girlfriend on the side who is more my age
all i would really have to do is get on a different sleeping schedule than her and i could totally avoid her
fuck working
i don't want to use my mind
i think that is what i am going to work on this weekend
i can go volunteer at some old person place and find a honey
sounds like a plan
talk to you later
she lies
i don't think i can make it b/c we have a west desk dinner that night
there was nothing but blue hairs there
all the chicks were lying about their age
i needed to escape that place
my hair looks great today
they are getting tighter
my new diet seems to be working
i need to drink more water so my skin will get smoother

what else is new in denver
you still selling drugs
so who is going to be the bread winner
you or max
i have been meeting some girls
a lot of cougars
cougars make me laugh b/c they think they are a hot commodity or something
where are you and max going to buy
does he still like the 0 points area
that isn't exactly mayberry
well practice your math and keep in touch
i have a dinner to go to
i was having my toenails buffed

i can start vacation on the 0th
i think that is the day you said you wanted to head to cancun
let me know when you get a chance
here is a good excuse to get out of that concert
lsu football game at 0
you don't need to mention to them that we are going to tear up downtown afterwards
no holds barred is the motto this weekend
i have to be here on the 0th
i don't think we get that day off
if we do have the day off i can do whatever
they guy i trade the northwest is going to be out of town
that is why i have to be here
i will check the vacation schedule
i don't know if i have the 0th or the 0th off
i will find out today
you got to make her forget that dude
your money
we went out too late
there were enormous lines to get into each place
it sucked
we need to get there earlier
i might not be able to play tomorrow night
she cannot play on the team now
she coaches or something like that
i don't think bryan will be at the game either
lisa should be there
i might be able to make it
i will know tomorrow
are you in town this weekend
are you staying in town this weekend
so are you going to get that car
that is scary
that is just gross
i should be at the game tomorrow night
looks like she is going to play
i am in for the happy hour
check this out
it is a beau rivage special
double or nothing means if i win you pay me 0 and if i lose we are flat
do you remember you lost $0 to me on jan 0
your math is bad
our bet isn't if i win you owe me $0 and if you win i owe you $0
that doesn't make sense
you need to stop sniffing the glue
how is the house hunting going
so are you and max going 0/0
i haven't met all cougars
i met a little hottie who is an education major
she is still in school
i am going young so when i get married i wont have to turn her in as early
cougars don't have a long marriage expectancy if you marry someone who wants to trade you in when you are really old for a younger model
geaux tigers
what is up party girl
i heard you are quite the dirty dancer
are you playing softball tonight
what field are we on tonight
i will just meet you there
good one
check this out it is pretty funny
do you get in on it
jeff skilling was walking by when i opened it
why did they cancel it
how does this work
do you know who the winner is
i bet you want to go out with him b/c he has a new truck
boat
yeah
nothing turns me on like a woman in a truck
does she have rebel flag stickers on the truck and calvin peeing on a ford symbol sticker
there is chinese food up here
i think i am going to run down to the delivery van and free the dogs out of the back
i heard you were throwing a huge halloween party
i don't understand your rationale in this bet
i was up $0 going into our bet
you were down $0
for me to now be down $0 is a $0 swing
why would i risk $0 vs
you risking $0
florida's math dept
is lousy
when are you and max going to vegas
i just got back in town from monterrey
ca
it was another boondoggle for work
here is a stock tip for you
pxlw
check it out
also ene
very strong long term
we need to figure out something to do for halloween on sat night
he is going to get hurt
your forgot that the saints are cursed
it is a 0:0 game
if we win i am at fred's right after
fuck eating
what time the game tomorrow
we need you back for softball
we need a catcher
texas did go to a bowl last year and get run by an arkansas team
sec
that was blanked 0-0 in their last regular season game against lsu
big 0 can say they are up this year
but the fact is there are only two teams playing football in that conference
ou/nu
the other teams in the big 0 attribute their loses to a competitive conference from top to bottom
i think they should change the name of the conference to the big 0
at least the sec is full of good teams
the big 0
you can't shine shit
are we hitting sierra tomorrow
we do need a rivalry
we can get a new rivalry and write a fight song about that team
that will take us over the top
i have no plans for halloween
what are you going to do
i was thinking about just throwing a pre-party and then hitting the bars
let me know what you think
mr
jacoby
i wanted to see when was a good time to meet with you regarding the prc process
any day next week during the afternoon would be best for phillip and i
get back to me when you can and we will set up a date and time
thank you
matt lenhart

i didn't go to br
i was in monterrey
cali and didn't get back until late fri
what are you doing sat night for halloween
i haven't seen you in a long time what has been going on
i need to think of a good costume
maybe i will be another mullet

how is the job
you hate gollata huh
fights are a waste of money b/c they are never good
i made my mullet wig
it is a work of art
i look like such a tool with it on

you have to be creative
didn't you take arts and crafts
i thought women were good at that
if you are going to the one in the village i think you should try another place
there is this place called chipotle on kirby two blocks down from bissonet
it is the best
they are out of denver
it is much better than
i might have to be another form of mullet
i will think of something for sat and let you know
these are not like mission burrito
i hate mission burrito too
these are healthy
you cant go off of what coulon says
that guy cant eat anything
i wish i could go every day
i could live on it
we will go some time
no
i am up for having people over and then heading out on sat
if we get a big group together and go out it could be a good night
i am going to take that friday off and come in to br
maybe we should set up a tee time around 0 or 0 pm
i didn't say we were having a party
i said you were having a party
i will spread the word at the analyst happy hour tonight
i will let them knwo that you will provide drinks and food
does susan know about your party
we lost
i hate playing softball
it is no fun
people are going to be upset with you if you plan a party and then bail out on it
susan won't like the fact that you didn't tell her about it

i have missed some good games
i wanted to go in last week
but i was out of town and didn't get in until late fri night

mr
skilling
here are a few questions i would like to submit before your floor meeting on the 0nd floor wednesday
0
enron seems to be taking a new approach to their business by taking assets off the books and looking for new opportunities as a market maker in new markets
is enron going to be just a trading company
0
if enron is just a trading company our earnings could be quite volatile
how could this affect our stock price
will wall street be prepared to accept more volatile earnings
0
volume on eol seems to be decreasing since the middle of the year and new platforms are being introduced into the market place
is this going to have a negative effect on enron's stock price
0
what are some of the new markets enron plans to explore in the near future
0
is broadband coming along as quickly as wall st
expects and how much of our stock price is based on broadband
i hope these questions are in line with some of the issues you wish to discuss and i look foward to hearing you speak tomorrow
sincerely
matt lenhart
i thought it was a funny comeback larry
tonight

i heard people go out and trick or treat on this night or egg kids
lame reply
lame reply #0

matt lenhart
bobby shiring in the newest member of ees

looks pretty safe down here
p/e is only 0
what do you think
bob was canned last week
not suprisingly
i will try to call you guys this weekend
ou was impressive
crouch sucked after the 0st quarter
i think they told bob
don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out
he was a nice guy
but didn't produce
he once said to me
if i didn't have this goddam kid i could retire
his kid less than 0 year old
talk to you later
it said if you do that it is bad luck
i told you he would
it wont be easy
but for a year you would learn a lot
i will try to line up a pig for you
lets meet tonight at 0
done
see you there
no
it just means someone has a lot of ammo
it isn't from that movie
hey mom
i will check on dates today
i can probably come home the 0rd or 0th
how was your weekend
i went to baton rouge and watched lsu play
i couldn't find cros anywhere
i looked for cros but i couldn't find him
i told him where i would be and i was there the whole time
my cell wasn't working on campus
i gave him a call today to find out how we missed eachother
i will check on whether or not i am going to go to new orleans or not
i might go to dallas for new years if lsu goes to the cotton bowl
i will find out soon
best thing might be for me to fly back to houston on the 0th or 0th and if i go to new orleans i can just drive in
broncos will roll the aints
broncos just need to keep griese out of the french quarter on saturday night
how about them tigers
0 wins with 0 games to go
let me know when you want to pay off that bet
it was fun
i am tired now
josh was wearing a ut shirt
i think we are going to end up playing texas in the cotton bowl
i think i would be an ass-whoopin
like texas never had
what did you do this weekend
how is dean's
looks like a cool place
how great would it be to party in dallas on new years eve and then begin the year by kicking texas
ass again
that would all major sports
what is up for this weekend
you lost to stanford and haven't beat any good teams
texas has no running game
they are too easy to defend
what is bounce
i would rather throw myself off the enron building and bounce on the cement
give me a call again
i lost your work number
i can't open these dirty porn cartoons at work
how is everything going
i haven't heard from you in a while
max and jen just bought a house from my brother

i thought i got a copy from you last time
i will check with ricter

i should be at my desk all day
call 0-0 and say his name and you will get connected to his ext
if it rains will the game get cancelled
you lost
you need to pay me
part of losing the bet my man
where are you working now
is there still a game or a number we can call
let me know when you can meet in the lobby and i will go down there
i can't get down there by the end of the year
so you are finally going to get a job
that is good
why cant your state get all their votes in
if they don't vote for bush i am going to be so pissed
sounds like max and jen bought a big house
we might need to make a bet on the lsu-flor game in the sec championship
when do you want to reschedule this meeting
way to show up for the game
we had to get a ringer
but she was pretty good
she is one of those softball freaks that goes out every tues night looking to pick up games
call me before you go down 0-0
we lost by 0 i think
i can't wait until softball is over
i cant stand the two older guys on the team
one of them got mad and was kicking a trash can and throwing his glove around
don't leave me hanging out there again with some of those freaks
i can't take it
can i reserve 0 tickets
thanks
i think i will go with the cheaper tickets
thanks for offering up those tickets
it is going to be an expensive weekend
how about this election
larry's uncle had some but they are like $0
you need to send a warning with that
jeff
can you send down a foward curve for sp
np
and pv
also
where can i get these curves daily
i have to meet with h.r
today

i went to fred's and bogies
it was pretty fun
hey grandma
how is everything going

have a good time and keep in touch
matt
i love saban
he is the best coach in college
i just said i like rohan better than booty
you guys partying this weekend
that is the saddest response i have heard
teachers should be continually tested
i had some idiot teachers that should have been fired b/c of their incompetence
you shouldn't be scared to be tested if you are good at your job and half way competent
democrats are so lazy
how could you vote democrat
al gore makes me sick
enough of my ranting and raving
what are you doing this weekend
i am tired today b/c i went out last night
this is a good scene
probably not as good as miami but there is a lot going on now and our downtown is booming

i need to live on the ocean
i am painting purple and gold tiger stripes all over my body

i am so deep
i am so misunderstood
too much beer retention on my six pack
but my calves and thighs are so sculpted
works of art
i don't have hair on my back and not that much on my chest
i wish i had more on my chest then i could grow a mustache and tell the chicks to call me magnum
you know what my porn name is
it is francis marion
you can figure yours out by taking your middle name and adding it to the name of the street you grew up on

that is a pretty good porn name
she was on howard stern and some 0 year old won a prom date with heard and lost his v-card
she kind of dated him for a bit
nice girl
queen

my # is 0
this is the website and path to the file
it was good to see you too
we should have partied some more
it is tough to stay in denver for too long now b/c of work
i think that website is classmates.com
i am not sure b/c some girl here was on the website and that is where i saw dana's personal ad
i was so funny b/c lisa wimbush said
i am 0 and engaged
and dana said
i am 0 and single
everyone at work was laughing
i hope you are having fun in san fransico
keep in touch
matt

i need to get two
i am gonna stay in town
we are heading to champs for the game if you want to go
for new year's i am going to stay in houston
i was going to new orleans but i don't feel like making the drive now
it is fairly dead at work for me too
what are you doing in sf again
sf is such a cool city
do a lot of your friends from oregon live there
i will check out that web site today
would you mind picking me up two tickets for prague
call me when you get a chance
they have the wrong ext
for you on voice activation thing
new years was fun
i stayed in town and went to that club prague
that place is crazy
were you in new york through the end of the year
i haven't heard of a natl champ party
but i think you should throw one
we bought tickets for $0
it is a different place
what did you do on new years
i wasn't that excited for it this year
are those lsu recruits
where can i see that stuff
i knew about trickett but not the other guy
around 0
i was too dead to get up
i will get it today
his buddy adam got arrested that night for public intoxication
good
safe and clean fun
didn't add to your corruption score
is that the tubbing place
it sucks to be somewhere flat for new years
how was new years
i stayed in town and went to prague
tough loss
pac 0 sure is tough for texas to beat
could you get me access to a foward curve for pv
np
sp
thanks for your help
matt
i decided not to go b/c nobody really had any plans
i didn't want to drive either
chad is moving tomorrow
are you guys partying this weekend
you forgot to add stanford to your list
i think they worked you over too
sure
men's club
how was new years in new orleans
did you shoot your 0 in tha air @ 0
we can get her a lap dance
that is the best news i heard all day
how was new orleans
i sent her a gift certificate from amazon
should be in the mail now and it is addressed to lori
gas did come off
weather looks nice everywhere
how was new years
keepin it real in 0-0-0-0
what did you do on new years
sorry i didn't come
i didn't feel good and i didn't feel like driving 0 hours for a short weekend
i was glad sunday i wasn't on the road b/c i felt like shit
did you see lsu
did you and mike go to maiden voyage
i got your email address
hope you had a great new years
love matt
we just got that center wilkerson
he is the best lineman in the country
i need to pick up my jacket tonight
will you be there around 0
great
he can go there with all the talent in the world and get run by the
i will take that bet
you make them
i just don't think they will win the next two nat'l champ
i mean big 0
i don't think they will win the next two nat'l championships
texas definately won't
i meant the big 0
i don't think that they will win the next two
you must be on this
best conference
kick b/c your team lost
sec had a down year by their standards
but that isn't the point
lsu beat a good georgia tech team to win the peach bowl
texas lost to a pac-0 team
i don't need to pump up the lsu's conference b/c we won our bowl game
i will pay you
but it is pretty sad that you are cheering for an arch rival that smoked you guys in dallas
lsu owns texas
did we not beat you at basketball and baseball in their most important collegiate tournaments
why does everyone from ut think they have such a storied program
you haven't won in decades
your current coach has proved he can't win big games
you guys will be ranked high
as you were this year
but you won't hold that ranking
texas has the easiest schedule and they will manage to lose an early one as usual
all i heard last year at this time was that 0 was supposed to be the year
but look how that turned out
you guys should be a little more competitive next year against ou
good luck
i am going to go out
give me a call at home or on my cell
we couldn't get in
the line wasn't moving so we went to the hub
i tried to call your cell phone and leave a message
i got your message late last night about the movie
my cell phone was upstairs and i couldn't hear it ringing
how was mercury room
nope
we can hit the town this weekend
i like that place the hub
they play good music
we will finish top ten next year in the polls
thanks for sending me another chain letter
i am very superstitious
i have a good idea for that business
there are all these gov't forclosure properties that we should buy up cheap
we can discuss it more next time we get drunk
i want to do it
it will be fun to be your boss
i lost your number in austin
i tried to give you a call last night and clear up our argument from saturday
that got way out of hand and i apologize for that
there is no reason for me to be such a hot head about that
give me a call when you get a chance and we can clear up that mess
your parents got your stuff yesterday
let me know what you want to do with that tv
talk to you later
matt
saban should tell him don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out
yeah

the gas daily pricing is the correct one

i forgot we covered that the other night
there is no question about your birthday and the superbowl unless denver plays
i went to a buddy's house to watch the game and left at halftime b/c i had no interest in the game
your favorite band was on at halftime
i know you were excited about that
so why don't you come over this week and watch 0 0/0 weeks
damn baby chill
did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed this morning
0 0/0 weeks isn't a dirty movie
it's a classic
you will see
so why don't you come over tomorrow
but don't come too late b/c i can't stay up that long
did you cry tears of joy when nsync was on
i couldn't have made it in that band b/c i am too rugged
those guys are little sallys
how can you call those nerds beautiful
the guy with the beard and the one with the dreadlocks are eye sores
and those litte mos aren't more rugged than me
i could kick all their asses
anyway
why don't you come over between 0 and 0
that will give me time to work out for the 0th time of the day tomorrow
i owe you some money huh
i forgot
just send me you address again and i will mail the check tomorrow

i couldn't even stay for the second half
i ate all that papa john's and my stomach almost exploded
i will play you one hand of liars for it

these videos are pretty good

but i think that is the nickname for mack brown
mr
february
it is such a sleazy show though
and it is cheesy
i am not cheesy
but i do enjoy it
i thought you had some good rumors
the equation was helpful
sometimes it is easier to understand if you see the numbers
come over tonight around 0ish or after friends since you don't want to miss that show
this is kind of gross
but it is real funny
i don't think this is your type of humor
but girls here at work thought that it was funny so hopefully you will too
i laughed until i cried
totally serious

lets get seat so we can sneak in booze
lets get tickets
i don't think i will play on sat
i am just seeing this girl
i has only been a couple of months
lets all meet up one night and party
it is only worth it for $0/hole
you shouldn't even waste your money on a nice course
you need lessons
stop losing money to me and wasting your money at a nice course
lessons will help
trying to get a head count on who wants to go to def leppard

i think i wrote down the wrong number

everyone wants to go
we will get a huge group to go
you guys looked like you were discussing lots of interesting things
i bet your boyfriend was upset
when do we need to get tickets
here is a list of people who want to go
i am just teasing you
but you did introduce us to some guy you went out with who is an analyst here
i had so much fun on sat night
it was crazy
you said
this is my sweet baby
saturday is better for me

you are so lucky you get to go skiing
i wish i could hit the slopes
i haven't skiied in over a year
you do need a rich guy to support you in san fran
it is so expensive there
you could just go anna nicole and get some guy who is almost dead and inherit all his cash

who else lives up there
i thought erin and her sister lived there also
i can't remember
keep in touch and stay warm there

0.0 baths

that is pretty cheap
this way we don't need to get another room
i also reseved a room at the luxor that can sleep 0 and a suite with 0 bedroom and a living room
this will cost us $0 per night
tell me which one you prefer

with tax it will be $0.0/night
if we have 0 people paying that will be $0/person
if max's bro in law doesn't go it is about $0/person

we might go to tortucas or something to drink before hand
where are your tickets
we are club level
let me know
hey lucky fuck
i just gave you $0 instead of $0 for the $0 you gave me

i am gonna have to regulate
it is on thurs night for def leppard
bass said that there is a tortuca near the dome where we can eat and drink some ritas before hand
i think we should meet around 0-0

but the concert won't start until about 0:0
someone up here went to duran duran last night and it said the same thing on the schedule
i will call tomorrow and double check
but i really don't think they would start a concert that late
def leppard isn't that old
i am glad nobody got back to me on putting in for the deposit
i will hold
does everyone want to meet at tortucas on kirby south of 0 or el tiempo
no tequilla shots
or cabos downtown tonight

fri was fun
i went to a broker deal and the wine was unlimited
we were crushing $0 bottles for about 0 hours
i will take it easy this weekend
i have a date with cassie fri
but that is all i will do
how was dinner last night
which question
i don't know what i am going to do yet
what do you think
everyone up here loved that
i have spoke with her a few times for quite a while
i would rather go some place that is loud and fun like el tiempo
is there a place like that around
pretty good
i went to a broker dinner on fri and we ran a mean tab b/c of the wine
what did you do
i haven't opened it
i didn't show anyone
i want to get some ritas
maybe i could go to el tiempo if they would let us back in
well i am not going to take her there so i won't worry about that place this weekend
you never said how dinner was last night
what did you do this weekend
you didn't think it was funny
did you like his supply bag
that killed me
by the time you sent this i was already gone
maybe we can do it again later this week
daddy bought a big bertha and was stroking it last night
i bought a big bertha and i was stroking it last night straight and deep
let me know b/c i want to go back out there
this club goes
bling
when i hit it
bout $0 with a new viser

i can meet you at my place then or at the range then
no dout boo n0 doubt
is telas on sheppard a pretty cool joint to go to on fri
i don't think she has
they never hung out in high school and just started living together in jan
they were more friendly rather than friends
hopefully it will be fun
she seems really nice
i don't kiss and tell
just kidding
we will probably just get drinks
just thought i would let you fellas know that brooke burke
from e
wild on
is posing in playboy next month
that is all that is keeping me going
yeah
you and your friends could just send one drink over after another to make me look like a stud
sounds good
just break your necks when i walk by to the bathroom or something
i probably won't be able to keep her off of me after that
give me a call when you get a chance
i lost your number again
between 0 an 0 would be the best time to install the monitor
send em
that is correct
they are with reliant canada
pi phi chick from baylor
i can go to vegas either the weekend of the 0th of april or the 0st
just let me know which is the better weekend
ene sucks

a very successful energy trader parked his brand-new mercedes in front of his office
ready to show it off to his colleagues
as he got out
a truck passed too close and completely tore off the door on the driver's side
the trader immediately grabbed his cell phone
dialed 0
and within minutes a policeman pulled up
before the officer had a chance to ask any questions
the energy trading icon started screaming hysterically
his mercedes
which he had just picked up the day before
was now completely ruined and would never be the same
no matter what the body shop did to it
when he finally wound down from his ranting and raving
the officer shook his head in disgust and disbelief
i can't believe how materialistic you energy traders are
he said
you are so focused on your possessions that you don't notice anything else
how can you say such a thing
asked the trader
the cop replied
don't you know that your left arm is missing from the elbow down
it must have been torn off when the truck hit you
my god
screamed the master trader
where's my rolex
i will be out of town
so who wants to send me some money for this deposit
max also left me a message that he wants to add two people to the party

coach jim haslett had put together the perfect new orleans saints team
the only thing he was missing was a good quarterback
he had scouted all the colleges
and even the high schools
but he couldn't find a ringer quarterback who could ensure a super bowl win
then one night
while watching cnn
he saw a war-zone scene in bosnia
in one corner of the screen
he spotted a young bosnian soldier with a truly incredible arm
he threw a hand grenade straight into a 0th-story window 0 yards away
i've got to get this guy
haslett said to himself
he has the perfect arm
so
he brings the kid to the new orleans and teaches him the great game of football
and the saints go on to win the super bowl for the first time in history
the young bosnian is
canonized
as the great hero of football
and when haslett asks him what he wants
all the young man wants to do is to call his mother
mom
he says into the phone
i just won the super bowl
i don't want to talk to you
the old woman says
you deserted us
you are not my son
i don't think you understand
mother
the young man pleads
i just won the greatest sporting event in the world
i'm here among thousands of my adoring fans
no
let me tell you
the mother retorts
at this very moment
there are gunshots all around us
the neighborhood is a pile of rubble
your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives yesterday
and today your sister was kidnapped in broad daylight
the old lady pauses
and then tearfully says
i'll never forgive you for making us move to new orleans
> two buddies
tony and steve
are getting very drunk > at a bar > when suddenly steve throws up all over himself

i think they will go to the rose bowl
the joke reminds everyone of suzy b/c she drinks a lot
enron would probably do something like this
but i think you need to contact that charity group
they might already have a team
it is good to see that you are such a philanthropist
you going to golf or go play ultimate dork frisbee
i have a tee time for sat @ 0
let me know if you think you can play today
the course is sienna plantation
he is a winner
kansas might turn into a 0 win a year program with cooper there
yeah
i think they will go to the rose bowl
the joke reminds everyone of suzy b/c she drinks a lot
you better be able to golf tomorrow
you obviously haven't seen my new swing
you need to be on your best game to take my title
totally
all i know is we can never go back to teala's
i don't want to get banned at front porch also susan
especially since boone bought some weed from the waiter
what about when he was gargaling puke trying to say
i am a trader at enron
you better be able to golf tomorrow
totally
nope
i bet your teeth are on strike too b/c all the bile in your stomach is eating them up after you threw up for 0 hours
especially since boone bought some weed from the waiter
i think we should wait in line at the grasshopper next time so we don't waste our night
we will know for next weekend
what is up with the avs
are they going to shit their pants again
how was moving this weekend
did you still want to get a drink after work tomorrow
this is their last hope
if they don't win i read that they are going to break up the team
0:0 is fine with me
i will meet you at the bar
what is up with the avs
are they going to shit their pants again
this is their last hope
how was happy hour
i was golfing when you called and i didn't get the message until late
it is a good work out for you to move up 0 flights of stairs
did you move it all yourself or pay someone to do it
mi luna is good for me tomorrow
i love their ritas
how about we go around 0
i can pick you up or just meet you there if you are going straight from work
0:0 is fine with me
i will meet you at the bar
i think they sell tickets for that dude's concert at the hollywood food store around the corner from my house
that actually works out better for me
i will meet you at mi luna at 0
that is the place in the village correct
0:0 is good
let me know what is up after you speak with her
did you call my cell last night
he is a mo
jen has a lot of cougar friends who will be ready to party
we sold this gas for these volumes to ees for index +0.0

i heard there are a lot of hot cougars at changs
have you guys reserved a room for caymen yet
i heard the comfort suites is where everyone is staying
let me know if you guys just want to load everyone up in one room like back in high school
comfort suites is like $0 total for 0 nights
cheap as it gets down there
i was just thinking we would all pile in and save some money
only condition is that ryan doesn't go on a booze cruise and piss on himself
i think they have two rooms with two double beds in each
jen knows the details
but i heard we need to make reservations within the next week
0:0 is good
let me know what is up after you speak with her
did you call my cell last night
he is a mo
i don't have it
but shoot him an email and he will give you a call
i spoke with him this weekend and the place he mentioned was comfort suites
it would be $0/each for the whole week if 0 were in a room
a condo would most likely be more expensive
jen has a lot of cougar friends who will be ready to party
we sold this gas for these volumes to ees for index +0.0
hell yeah dog
they betta be ready to get up on deez nuts
oy vey
i was going to talk about all the dope he used to do and how he used to wear make up in middle school

i felt like a champ on sat
i didn't do all those shots with boone
derek
here is the notice that was sent out by pg&e on friday
this notice would not allow cycle 0 gas to flow
we need to pass on penalties to counterparties who cut us on gas day of may 0
many counterparties are swinging on eol deals
so going foward we are going to rank those counterparties to take the cuts
as far as this deal goes
the problems incurred were due to logistical issues
we did rerank wild goose for cycle 0
but pg&e did not allow for renoms on this cycle
did you call for me at work today
did you call me today at work
how was your wedding on saturday
i can't remember if i sent these to you guys or not
i wasn't that drunk on saturday
i was just joking
i felt great on saturday
like a champ
people get married younger than you
wow
what the hell do they do if they get married that early
i had to wake up early on sunday so i didnt feel like going
were there a lot of hotties
i will be here on fri night
but sat i am going to tim's engagement party
i think i will be out on fri
i am here dog
yeah
paincourtville
la
i don't know where the fuck that is
i will be watching
have fun
test
when are you riding into baton rouge
sat or fri
did chad hit you up to live with him
if you leave on sat i will ride with you guys
i thought that was your area code
kind of freaked me out
you can be a little crazy sometimes
just kidding
don't mess with texas is good
it is about to get really hot here
we reserved a room at comfort suites
i think that is where everyone is staying in the caymens
i am looking foward to it
should be a blast
when is the bachelorette party
what are you guys going to do
i just looked at the prices for flights to cayman and they run around $0
this is going to cost over $0
start saving now
i knew you would bag me again
if you have to work there is nothing you can do about that
i am going to baton rouge on saturday for an engagement party
i will probably go out on friday
when do you get back from chicago
give me a call and maybe we can do something next week
i heard they might move the wedding to miami
i am up for it
should be a good weekend to live it up
memorial weekend = booze + golf + sluts
i think miami would be more fun than cayman
cayman is really laid back
miami = hot sluts
i don't know for sure but that is what one of jen's friends said
i didn't know if you guys had heard that or not
don't bring it up if max hasn't mentioned it
i think miami would be a lot more fun
she called me
she keeps in touch with me
she spilled the beans on the plans to move the wedding
i think if we went to cayman we would spend over a grand each
miami will rock
does miami suck
i haven't ever been there
i have been to caymans and they are awesome
it is really laid back and very expensive
either place will be fun
i just think miami will be a better night life
i just want to meet some models down there
i don't hang out at discos thought
but if i was in miami i guess i would
i think i would need some new clothes b/c all i wear is polos and khakis
i think i will wear a suit with a t-shirt like sonny crocket
merlin can be captain castillo
mini me
or the peck from the movie willow
are you and celeste going to br on fri or sat
nice
how they met
brought tears to my eyes
does this have nudity
what time do you want to leave tomorrow
around noon
totally
this weekend i had to go to baton rouge for an engagement party
i am going to stay in town this weekend
i might try to go tubing or something like that
what did you do this weekend
are you in town for memorial day
i am not dating her
i only went out with her a few times
i doubt we will go out again
how about you
have you been dating a lot lately
sure
we can probably get out there and play at 0
do you think the avs will close out the blues tonight
they haven't looked too good the last two games
i am not that picky

we are golfing on fri so sat might be a better time to get up there
i will let you know
did you get chad's email
i would rather go up next weekend
i will go up this weekend if you are up for it
but if not i think we need a good excuse
did you see the article in the journal where cali's attorney general said he wants to lock up ken lay
ene's chairman
in a prison cell with a cell mate
next sat might be better
i don't think mitch is gonna be able to make it and everyone was out of town last weekend
let's do it next sat if you are in town
i told him i didn't think you could make it on sat and that we were both out of town last weekend so we would head up the following sat
call me again when you get a chance
i lost your number
you think this weekend will be more packed than next
let's just do it next weekend
that way mitch and i can both head in
tim might be able to make it then also
what does that mean
we might have a cook out or something on sat
if that is the case i will let you know
i think chad is pissed we aren't going to austin
he sent me a message that said
u snooze u lose
what the fuck is that
i said i would go next weekend
yeah
i couldn't get an opp to talk to her
did you know her
the product number for pg&e topock is 0
the correct company name for transcanada is the division of transcanada
thanks for your help
matt
yep
i was going to try and talk to her but she was reading and listening to a walkman
i was sweating like a freak when i was running
probably scared her
it looked like i was evaporating
i'm bout it
luis
you love heating oil
nevermind
so why didn't you think that girl was the type i go for last night
how was the game
do you like the avs chances
i think it should be an awesome series
the sitara deal looks correct
i think i have montezuma's revenge
i have a type and she fits it
you obviously didn't know who she was
so is your boss going to make you take out her son
she looks like she fits it
how is your face doing
is the swelling going down
memorial all packed up
we can go out there and just try to get on
hopefully around 0:0
maybe you can get out early and get our names on
you up for golf tomorrow
me you and val tomorrow
it is on espn so that won't work
if i was you i just wouldn't go
just hit the dinner
whatever
ride would be good
i am going to hell for that one
yeah i know
but admit you laughed
do you want to send your resume to enron again
they are on a big kick to hire some new people
might be worth your while just to take a look and see how it compares
i got your message but i need to work
my bad man
i got your message around 0 and i went to bed after that
let's hook up with them this weekend
what is up for tonight
i say we hit club no minor on sat and then uropa
we need to tear it up some
i am up for a few drinks tonight
maybe lz's or something laid back
i want to feel like a champ tomorrow
do you guys want to hit el patio early on saturday and get some blue ritas and then head over to uropa
that would be a good night to go tear it up completely
i booked my flight home on june 0th
i arrive that afternoon and leave to houston on the 0th
so have the frig packed with food and beer and be ready to golf
looking foward to getting home
love matt
lets definately play tomorrow
call me later
let's get some drinks some where laid back and try to meet some honeys
let's go to lz or something
i will
so what did you guys do to stay up until 0am on sunday night
i will invite you to be my caddie
you can carry my clubs and clean them for me
if you do a good job i will give you a crisp $0 bill
i guess i am going up there saturday
i think i will try to take it easy on friday
i can definately tell that i am not 0 anymore b/c i cannot recover at all
i am also going broke going out
so what did you and lisa do until 0am loverboy
send your resume and i will get it to the right people
nintendo doesn't count for your handicap
how about the avs
that was the most impressive game they have played all post season
sorry about that
we were running so late and we couldn't find green
we did turn south and drove around until 0:0 and figured we were too late
i figured your phone died
we ended up at memorial and i played like shit
i was so dead from the night before
i should have slept all day
we can tee them up sometime soon
i think that is a scam to have you send it around
i remember you
i was pretty drunk though
hopefully i didn't make too much of an ass out of myself
we hit it really hard that night for my buddy's birthday
how was your bachelorette party
are you back in austin now
who sings that song
harley davidson of a bitch
i think you said it was elo or something
i am excited to watch it
so you got a promotion at work
that is good news
what is your new job going to be
my friends are liars
this past weekend was an anomaly
it isn't bad to go out and party like a rock star every now and then
i will be in austin this saturday night
so maybe we can get together in austin
we will probably be at it pretty hard again
i have a friend coming in from new orleans so he will want to hit 0th street
lets head up to austin on saturday night
i got an email from that girl at the black swan
she lives in austin but will be at a wedding on sat
i will be in nd
i think my plane lands 0 min
after yours
avs got worked last night
i don't have a good feeling about the series now
they had no answer for the defense
i think i can make it tonight but tomorrow night the hockey game is on
i need the range
just send your resume when you get a chance
enron is looking for a ton of people
i just don't know if they can ever handle that defense
they didn't make any good adjustments in the 0rd period
i forgot you had a wedding
i don't go up to austin all that much
i usually stay down here and go out
where do you work up there again
i am sure you told me
but i forgot
where are the good places to hang out
is it 0th st
you think houston is the armpit of the world
i love it hear
the weather sucks in the summer
but other than that it is a blast
so you do work for strip clubs huh
that is interesting
what is your stripper name
i live inside the loop here and usually don't leave unless i have to golf
outside of the loop is pretty ugly
which part of houston did you grow up in
i think hoskina is having a going away happy hour
but after that i am not doing anything
i need to watch hockey
your mama
prompt month is out there
it is nwpl rox
i went to high school in denver
i have only lived here for 0 years
no wonder you hate houston
there is nothing up in north houston
i went to denver east

i like working here
it is pretty exciting on the trading floor
are you guys going out tomorrow night after the rehersal dinner

boudreaux
what's up
are you going to the tenn game
i just wanted to let you know that i am not considering moving to the denver office
i don't see myself in a marketing role at this point in my career
although this year has been up and down
i am enjoying my role on the desk
i think the opportunity that you have given me as a basis trader is too good to give up
the denver opportunity was just under consideration as an opportuinity to move back to denver
we can talk more about it if you would like on monday
congrats tom tom
you can reach me at
i got home fine
what was the name of that book you told me about
was it the 0th deminsion
dietz's bachelor party was ok
we did the same thing that we did at val's
i am not going to the tenn game
i might go to the florida game
great
way to go
you will lose this weekend
what is the website address
could you please remove me from this distribution
what have you been up to
you still moving to india or is your buddy moving back here
when are you getting your dog dog
only if i have a bad day
if i have a bad day will you let me come over and kick it
it depends what type you get
if you get one of those little furry dogs that you can carry with you everywhere
then i can't like that dog
if you get one with personality like a bulldog it can stay at my place
those little furry dogs act like cats
are you kidding
why would you want a chihuahua
those dogs aren't even friendly
do you think they are cool b/c of the taco bell dog
i think they are all bark and no bite
i think they could get their asses kicked by cats
they look like they were doberman pinchers who were shrunk
you should get a cockerspaniel
your retarded
i used to have one
they are great dogs
yeah i had one
her name was mandy and she was the sweetest dog and my dad has one currently and the dog isnt retarded
all dogs are dumb
they are called dumb friends b/c they don't speak
look
damn it
they have all the personality in the world and they are not that big
i don't think you know what a cockerspaniel is
i think that all they do is bark and freak out
they aren't good dogs
they aren't friendly
and i am not angry
i couldnt see it b/c it was surrounded by a wooden fence
i know you didn't get a dog
unless you took one of your 0 hour breaks before lunch
did you get a lil
chihuahua
i hate those things
you did not
lets bet your dinner on it right now
i think i might need to pay up to get a house
why
don't you think you would lose that bet
you didn't buy a dog
i want to see the receipt
did you get any sleep last night with your new dog
when do i get to see this alleged dog
you probably got one of those robotic dogs
what is its name
this situation reminds me of kids with imaginary friends
what is your imaginary friend's name
stop lying
i don't believe you b/c i don't think you would not have had time to get it yesterday when you said you had it
i havent looked anymore
i will look this weekend
i think i need to pay more than i want to
how old is your dog
pay more than i want
so from now on you need to pay when we go out
sorry man
can't make it
i have a dinner at cafe annie's tonight
both
sweet
you can start by picking up the tab at capital grill
what color is your poodle
now i know you are lying
yesterday the lie was about a poodle
why can't you just be honest with me
the lies and deceit hurt me erin
how many ounces does that little runt bailey weigh
i guess i do but i wouldn't be suprised either way
you can show me it this weekend
me > dog
yeah
it is math
math is universal
me =
jerk
i am tired
your dog kept me up all night
i am tired b/c i kept waking up with no covers and my butt was hanging off the bed
i looked at you and you were covered up to your neck with the covers in the middle of the bed
you look like you slept well
um
i don't remember that
real sweet
you have a stone heart
sad but true
i can think of a few things
you know
whatever
i will let you know later
what are you doing tonight
probablyl gonna just kick it
yeah
alright
talk to you later
i'm bored
tell me a story
i am too tired to type
i am going to stay in
i need to find a house
she is waiting to see if she can get financing
someone should tear him a new one
but it is hard to argue any of his points
b/c i wanted to read a story freak
i am sure they are
houston won't be too affected b/c most of the layoffs affect satelite offices
economy should be good here
are you leaving in 0 min or something
i think i am out of here
i need a haircut
that is all we can do is attack his mom
i am all for it
she should be ashamed of producing such a jackass
ditto
i hope he doesn't publish this and respond to it today
what game
you probably didn't even see it
here is our bet on cu/a&m game this summer
i have cu

we can think of a dinner later
i don't think so
sometimes the sun shines on a dogs ass but i don't see that happening again
if you win lets go to applebys and if i win lets go to redwood grill
that is working out perfect for you
times are getting tight for me
i really liked that house i saw yesterday
i figure since you are not spending money on a dog you can spend it on me
your last sentence sounded like an indian speaking english
i was wondering why you didn't respond
jury duty sucks huh
have you been going out at all
not much
i am trying to sell my house so i have been looking for a new house recently
there are some cool things that i have found
i have been going out a little
but not like we did in the beginning of the year
that was fun
when i move i will throw a big party and we can start it up again
i am not going to do that
my job is too good here
i want to live in denver
but i want the job i have here
i can go there later
hopefully i will get paid and it will work out
i cannot make it
my parents will be in town this weekend
i thought your first offer sucked
what time you coming over
0:0-0
how does that sound
what do you mean you guess
good
that is what i like to hear
if you act enthusiastic
sp
then you'll be enthusiastic
sp
you know i can't wait to see you
this is a photo of the girl i think you look like but it isn't really a good pic
she isn't gross
she is hot
you need to see her on tv
like i said
that is not a great pic
where did you look her up
i dont know what you are talking about b/c she is skinny and pretty
are you sure you are looking at the correct one b/c i don't see her on yahoo
i think you are lying b/c she is not gross
i just did that and she is not in there
she does not look like a man
she is a hottie
this is the site and she doesn't look like a man
danm it
whatever
i think you are messing around and you probably love the comparisson
those photos are all stretched out
i can't believe you don't think she is pretty
whatever
i try to be nice and pay you a compliment and you turn it on me
i guess i will just never compliment you again
i thought it was
i think that girl is hot
if i won $0million that is the girl i want you to hook up with
does that mean you would do it even if i didn't win $0million
oh my god
i am all worked up here at work
i am going to find you a hottie right now
i am all hot and bothered
your mom didn't say she was ugly
stop lying
i think that girl is hot so i don't care
oh
that is different than your first response
quite different
i am going to email your friend jen and see what she thinks
just did
let me know what she says
tori over here thinks bonnie is a hottie
i dont think you look like her anymore
my judgement was off that day
i was around paint fumes looking at houses
do you think i am high maintanence
i just heard that before and tori was joking w
me about that
i don't get it
are we starting our contest tonight
our going out contest
are we starting that tonight or do you concede
i don't know why she thinks i am high maintanence
don't be fucking stupid
i wouldn't do it straight up when i could get points
i don't like double standards being put on me
i am the only one that can do double standards
we will see what the line is
either you will take it or you wont
don't try to negotiate
how are we doing on our contest
i didn't even go home
no really
it was a blast
little tired but i can rally for tonight
where didn't i go
i am ready to go tonight
you going out
yeah
i think we are hitting the strip clubs
no
you are so gullable
it isn't that big of a deal
why don't you just relax about the whole thing
just chill girl
you have such a temper
it is so easy b/c you get all worked up and you are not sure whether to believe me or not
i am gonna buy you a bmw
i resent that last comment
i resent that too
i am going to the strip club
do you want to meet me there
i will get you a lap dance
just kidding
you need to relax a little
you are so mean
why can't you be sweet like me
yep
looks like i found the formula
stay at your place even though you are a bed hog
i slept on the edge
you kept tugging on the covers and tried to spoon with me
its cool though
i will
i will sleep in the middle
sat is going to be the best day of my life
don't worry
you and jen just need to be ready to party
what are you doing tonight
party girl
yeah
i am going to a dinner at pappas steakhouse and then going to party
i will call you at 0am
sorry i didn't make it over sat
i passed out
how was sat
i saw that you guys called around 0am
partying huh
what were you guys doing until 0
i saw it on the caller id the next day
watched lsu and then went to r&r
we got pretty drunk
you guys sounded like you were partying also
did you have fun
go florida
they shit their pants this weekend
i am out of town
i am in portland
you can buy me dinner when we get back

i got her number though
i want to hook up with that girl paige in the brown leather jacket
what happened to you
i had a blast that night
tamu lost by 0
colorado beat texas a&m
i know you remember the bet
the blonde did have a hot body
she doesn't have as pretty of a face
tough loss last night
oh
my bad
i must have had you messed up with some other girl i made the bet with
i am not letting you out of this
we can go somewhere nice
real nice
i was thinking somewhere that requires a jacket
like tony's
someplace that is like $0 an entree
you can't be cheap if you take me out
i won't stand for it
i would have to regulate
i'm the king
that is how i want you to refer to me as
the king
the king doesn't just give gifts for no reason
not jerk
the king
i will do that
try his email address which is pederliefkjeseth@hotmail.com
that is the only way i know how to get in touch with him
i haven't booked a flight yet but i will soon
i thought i won the tie breaker
what happened
sorry i haven't called you back
i am in portland
i don't get back until tonight
i will call you when i get home
hope all is well
he was just trying to run up our p/e
some of the things these guys did was fradulent
did you miss me while i was gone
who is up for milagro or something tonight
did you see the article in the wsj today on that ljm fund associated with ene
great
good to hear
i got back last night
lets go around 0
i think hull is in also
what is up
this weekend i am going to n.o
for a wedding
what are you up to
did you have fun on sat
i had a good time
are you going out tonight
i think we might hit up milagro
it was good
had some good meetings and stuff like that
didn't party or anything
she is nice
i don't think it will lead to much
do you know that girl paige
you partying tonight
yeah
she is cute
i heard she was divorced but i wasn't sure
little young to be divorced
i might
i need to go running or something
means i could be tired afterwards
did you end up going out last night
thurs night was ok
we went to taco milagro
that place is full of old folks now
how was the weekend
you wish that was your problem
i was in new orleans for tim blanchard's wedding
we watched it and then went out in the french quarter
i will probably watch the game this saturday at woodrows
i don't think i want to drive in for the game
i am definately staying in town
i don't feel like battling that traffic
i am thinking of going to woodrows again and partying on sat like last time
do you want to golf sat
how was this weekend
did you get into anything
should have taken the bet and given the points
i didn't hear from you when i offered that
definately
let me know
this is unbelievable
seems like the worst is yet to come
if they have to end up issuing more stock this thing can go to $0
i went to grab some pizza
ate and then passed out
those shot i did with those girls wolly knew put me over the edge
sorry about taking off like that
i had a good time
but i ran out of energy quick
let me know
i will be up for some drinks
i did
the wedding was fun
drank a lot during the day and i was worn out sat night after the game
i am staying here this weekend
i got them
i left you a voice mail last night
send me your address and i will mail them today
are you going to do your halloween party or what
i will start telling jill and her friends
i think you should do it
i will help you out with everything on it
i sent it today so you should get it by thurs
sorry i didn't get back to you last night
i will find out who is in town
i talked to some people and they are up for it
we could watch lsu and then go to r&r
they are having a pimps and prostitute party
enron is going to be a penny stock pretty soon
sec is investigating now
i told dehart to get ahold of me at my parents place
i think he called
but i didn't get the message until sunday
you guys are all welcome to stay at my house
i am sure my parents would love to see you guys again
i am sure my parents will wonder why a bunch of old
fat
and bald 0 year olds are staying at their house instead of a hotel
as for robie
we can give him a blanket and he can sleep out in the side cart of his dirt bike
when is this trip
i have a room reserved
it is $0/night
we can split it up and pay $0 each which is cheap
i think it is around jan 0th
i have the room from that thurs-sat
those brides maids are ready to party
this hotel is right on south beach
thanks for including me
i don't think i will be able to make a ski trip durning that period
i have to go to miami and party on south beach
sorry
maybe if something was scheduled around spring skiing
feb-mar
i could definately go
robicheaux is bald
i remember that bastard was so hairy when i was living with him
i used to have to shave the soap in the shower after he used it
i know some of the houston guys would like to go skiing so keep us informed
i definately need to throw in some shit about that and all the stripper sluts we met in vegas
or the hooker scott hooked up with
that would make a good speech
my 0k is now worthless
i have no money
our stock is taking a bath
i like miss +0.0
iowa st
and ark
yeah
i had it picked out and everything
i had to call the dealer and tell him i am not going to suprise you with it
we can still go to dinner tomorrow night though
probably not
i think you should understand my situation
you guys still going out tonight
there is a double standard here so i can't understand
b/c i want you to understand when i am out of money
but if you owe me dinner and are out of money i cant understand
give me a shout later
we need to dress up and party regardless
i was going to go running after work and then maybe stop by
who all was going to go
ok
what are you guys doing for halloween
boone was thinking about having a party to watch the lsu game and then go out to r&r
i guess there is some halloween thing there
let me knwow what is going on and we can see what is up for later
so are we still on for dinner or what
i think we might go to the garden in the heights party or r&r for halloween
we are going to watch the game first
let me know if you hear of anything else
i am gonna get wasted at this dinner
no
it means i am excited to go
i doubt it
i want to go party afterwards and dress up for halloween
are you going as gi joe again
i think i am going to dress up as a chippendale stripper
i am going to oil myself up and go out in a thong
this is the group throwing the party at r&r sat night
check some of the photos at the link at the bottom
lots of hotties
i think the only way to burn it on my cpu is download it and then burn it
what is xp
i heard saturday
but that looks like it is the following sat
that would work out perfect
i am ready to tear it up
i think we are now going to r&r
boone has free passes
read this article
it is a little dramatic
who told you if you look good with hair you will look good without it
that sounds like a george costanza
hair is important to women under 0
i wish i could make this ski trip and see you in action again
but south beach calls
sorry i had to run last night
so the word is now that enron has about 0 or 0 companies looking to take us over
aol
lucent
revlon
and a few others
i will give you a call later
i dont know but we would be the prettiest in the industry
i am interested in going to the game
i could be up for it
actually they are not looking at us
some of our lawyers defended revlon
i heard it wrong
give me a shout at work when you get a chance
0-0
i think i am going to go to the game
call me
i cant find your number through the operator
you still mad at me
you were pissed last night
you were letting me have it
i deserved some of it b/c i made some bad jokes
but overall you were pretty brutal
i think i am heading to baton rouge for the game this weekend instead of partying for halloween
that will get us to baton rouge in time for ou/nu
i was being nice
you kept starting it and then blaming it on me
you were going nuts
you kept rolling back over and laying into me
you are the one who said you wished i was dead
you went crazy
you were pissed all night
you were venting on a soap box for about 0 hours
only one thing i said was rude
which i apologized for
and you wouldn't let it die
most of the stuff was started by you
you were just venting frustration you weren't able to communicate when you're sober
i was sober and i remember how it went down
i said one rude thing in the car and that was it
you were just going nuts and wouldn't let it die
you kept flipping out on me
weather looks like this
hi 0 lo 0
does anyone have that email where that ut dude gets all drunk
i need to read it for inspiration
i am not fighting with you at all
you are just grilling me
you are an angry person
just messing with you
it was ok
we went to the lsu game and lsu lost so we came home that night
what did you do this weekend
everyone was pissed cause we lost
what did you do this weekend
i thought we would win
they suck
i hate football
i did watch a lot yesterday
but i was tired and slept most of the time
famous vassigh quotes
pass the butter
you gonna finish that
if loving this cake is wrong
i don't want to be right
i can eat twice as much of this ice cream b/c it is fat free
food in lousyana is overrated
texas food rules
texas biscuts rule the world
i like my cookies texas size
don't mess with texas banana splits
mack brown lost in austin to north carolina st
give me a call
how was the weekend

sat there is a big party at garden in the heights
i am going to watch lsu sat and then go to that party at garden in the heights
should be fun
let me know what is going on for your party celebration when you finish
nothing happened with either

the enron stock is down again
0 days in a row
0 days straight
it is trading just over $0
it is going to zero
i might go out
i don't think that i am dressing up
are you going out
i would be up for going out
but i have nothing to dress up in
i don't want to be a soilder during the war
where are you going if you go out
sierra
let me knwo if you decide to go out b/c i think it would be a fun night
the only thing at la strada is a bunch of nancy boys
are your friends trying to meet gay guys or are they gay
that is probably what i will end up doing
i need to find some really nice smelling oil though
does that make a nice scent when baby oil and lotion are mixed
i am first going to rub fake tan all over and then grease up
i am just going to wear my new thong and my new gold bracelet
i am going to look awesome when i am dancing
i don't know what you should be
i think you can do better than gi jane though
you could be an umpalumpa for willy wonka
everyone loves those little guys
anyone going out for halloween tonight
potentially
i want to come over and meet some milfs also
step up and go out like a man
stop crying like a lil
bitch
sierra is gonna be packed with girls dressed like lil hookers
go home
nap and then be ready to go by 0:0-0
call me at home if you go out
i will be home around 0ish
i didn't get your email in time
my number is 0-0-0h and 0-0-0c
we went to sierra and it sucked
total banana farm
i dressed up as a cow with utters and everything
i walked into sierra and there were only a few people dressed up
it was so emabarrassing
saturday i am going to woodrows to watch the game and then sat night we are going to the garden in the heights party
good to hear from you
looks like you got out at the right time
ene is a sinking ship
your boy fastow and skilling have sunk it
are they making you work 0 hour weeks yet
i am tired
you snore
you guys want to watch the game at woodrows tomorrow
there will be some girls there and then we can get them to meet up with us at that garden in the heights party later that night
plus we can be outside watching it
that isn't snoring
that is the sound of my teeth chattering b/c i have no covers
you love it when i come over
i satisfy your appetitie for lovin
i am not going unless lisa promises to get all wasted and boob out
you don't know what that means
where did you grow up
india
them just jokes
i just went to dinner
let me know about thurs
good luck on the test
are we gonna see somebody boone out
you aren't going in for the wedding until sunday now
what do you mean i am perverted
thank god
i feel so much better
i was worrying about it in the shower this morning
thanks for letting me know
we are meeting these people sunday morning at 0:0am to go to the golf tourney
i will have to pick you up around 0 or you can meet me at my house at 0
excellent idea
meet you at my house then
great
too late
meet me at my house
i still need to decide whether or not i am going
i think this guy is putting an offer on my house and i might need to look for a house
how was bama
did you party after we rolled them or was kenny to pissed
i might go
depends on this week
what is a better restaurant to work at
house of pies or denny's
fat ass
just kidding
calling you a fat ass
i am serious about which restaurant is better
denver defense sucks
it is tough to watch because they cant stop shit
i need to email the paper and complain in this article
what the fuck is numbers
i hate live music
i might be up for it though
looks like becoming a waiter is a better possibility every day
the stock is below $0 and the company might go bankrupt
i applied at house of pies last night
what are the odds of enron making it
seems that we are in a cash crunch
i am not joking
it will just be temporary until i get back on my feet
the assets are marked up and we cant sell them
the problem is that we have tapped out our credit lines and we need another $0 billion
seems like we are racing against the clock
i know
i love working here
i wish it would just get fixed
i don't think mgmt has informed us of what is going on completely
i won't be a waiter for more than a year
it takes time
it isn't like i will change my profession to a waiter
it will just be something to pay the bills
i don't know why it is so hard for you to understand that
i haven't heard about my house
i am serious
just getting applications at denny's
house of pies
appleby's and chilis
are you not going to stand by me through this
kam
could you give me access to view this site please
my login is mlenhar
thanks
it works
thanks again
looks like i am going to work at denny's
stock is down about another 0.0
sweet

0:0 or 0
i don't care when
i can't wait
can't believe you left last night
daily dose on enron
we are finished
i need to now get a job at house of pies b/c that is the only way to pay the bills
the economy is down and when enron collapses
the energy industry is going to be in a world of hurt
not to mention the market is going to be flooded with enron folks
can't go to anymore lsu games unless i get a free ticket
i didn't want you to go
i was just going to sleep anyway
i was too tired to give you any action
enron is blowing up
i am going to sell my car and use the money to get the field
go
go dancers everywhere
i have stronger will than you think
house of pies here i come
you just need it all the time don't you
don't you like me for me
or am i just a boy toy to you
i am going out tonight to get wasted if anyone is interested
jill allen finishes her cpa today and she and her friends are going to party
max and jen are looking for you

they haven't heard from you in a while
it isn't going to be happy

i didn't get home until late
looks bad over here
everything was business as usual until yesterday
i think our books were so cooked that it is beyond repair
i will call you later
dynegy trades around their assets
they aren't big risk takers like enron
looks like the deal is now done
now we just need to wait and see what happens
this article mentions your chapter of sigma chi
game is on tv tomorrow
how did you do on your test
no
i was home before 0
definately party tonight and golf tomorrow
they inked the deal
dynegy has aquired us

have a good time
i think i am going to stay in town and golf
we will go party some other time

hull said it wouldn't be a good party anyway
you know you didn't fall asleep
it is called passing out

i don't know about you guys
but i feel a lot better after reading that
now i know something will get done
of course i do
i want to see my sweet baby
how was your day off
did you buy me an xmas gift
don't be cruel
maybe
why
so everyone is pretty pissed over here b/c there is a report that ken lay will get $0 million if he doesn't join the new company
he is getting a golden parachutte for ruining the company
i have fri off
people are pretty upset todya
they have completely fleeced us
i will pick you up around 0:0-0
pins and needles
there is a credit spread b/t ice and eol for phys transactions
yeah baby
i am a limited partner
they did talk to the trading floor yesterday and everyone was upset
the only thing i can say for him is that at least he has hung around and stood in the fire
skilling and fastow bolted
i have no respect for them
i guess his golden parachutte was in place since 0
but that was a situation in which the company is trading at 0 and we are taken over at 0
not 0 down to 0
what is going on
did you end up going out on sat
r&r was fun
we went downtown first and it sucked
i felt like i was in kabul w
all of al queda
r&r was packed though
i didn't get there until around 0am
when are you going home
i am going to stay here
i am going to the ut/a&m game on fri
i am just looking forward to hanging out and relaxing
i need to get some sleep
relax and get my mind off of enron
seems like it is day to day on whether or not we are going out of business
it is wearing on me
i want to see what my market value is
i don't know what is going to happen here
if you want to do a happy hour let me know
maybe tomorrow after work or something
let me know if you are up for it
i guess i won't take paige to this
