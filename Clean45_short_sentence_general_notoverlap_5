thank you for your time to discuss perry gas
michael and i have talked to jim keller
ees legal
and initiated placement of michael on the creditor committee
we are the largest unsecured creditor
jim is working with outside counsel and will be providing documents to michael to insert him quickly in the process
michael will represent us for both ees and ena
regards molly
would appreciate any feedback from talk so we can improve tx
rick
any progress here
rick
any more on this issue
rick
did this go ok
rick
please do not extend offers of employment to anyone without checking with me first
this does not mean a freeze but rather i want to be sure there isn't a person in rac that may be better suited
or could be with a little training
for a particular position
thanks
rick
to your hearts content
fine
i was really hoping we could do this on a best efforts basis with all of us covering any issues arising during the month of december
since there seems to be insistence on a date certain there is no choice but to have steve start in ebs on 0-0-0
ted can't physically be there until then
it will be difficult to have full rac responsibility without physically being there
rick
you have been busy haven't you
rick
i am not sure i understand this
can i still surf without going thru the enron system
can i still use aol
i will only need full enron access about half the time the rest a direct dsl internet connection is what i want
is the dsl line on all the time or is it still dial up
rick
not to worry
we won't be cutting your budget
lets discuss when you get back
rick
sounds great
don't build me a rolls when a chevy will do
rick
wow
pretty bold move assuming you had a choice
i will be in london next week
i'll try to give you a call
rick
i have already left him a voice mail
will let you know when i hear
tx rick
approve as written
continue to hate the deal
rick
fyi-comments
rick
this is fine by me
do you need hard copy of signature
rick
fyi
rick
london
how do we include
rick
thank you very much for taking the time to provide this feedback
feedback
both positive and negative
is critical to improving performance
rick buy
a
senses
i love chi-knees
rick
fyi
rick
can you please add greg whalley to the distribution on this report
which by the way is quite bebficial to us
tx rick buy
sounds like an opportunity for our illustrious steel team
totally supportive of candidate
i hope we can get her
only issue was reluctance to move to houston or london
that will hurt us eventually
rick
bad problem
good response
are there any others where price wasn't being updated
rick
spoke with jeff re txu
lets discuss when you have a minute
rick
missed your call today and i will be in rac prc all day tomorrow
basically jeff said we must get this exposure down but gave no parameters to the statement
he did ask if any recent issue is causing us concern to which we said no
and i also said we know more about this company than any other exposure we have
which we should
i also spoke with m
kopper today and he thinks the proposed deal w
txu to pay slightly more for a plant with the proviso that we get a cleaner contract is a good idea
rather than paying a lot of money to an investment bank
moral of story in my opinion is to try and improve deal structure with txu through the plant purchase or other structured deal
do no more
large
deals with txu that significantly increase credit exposure
$0mm
unless we buy a derivative that reduces exposure simultaneously
continue to stay on top of txu with frequent meetings with their management to maintain a close relationship with good communication
lets try and discuss wed if possible
i guess this is the answer to my inquiry on cypress issue-rick
great news
i think the ad swap idea is one of the most creative things to happen around here in quite a while
rick
looks good to me
rick buy
please pass along to john s
good job
keep moving it forward
if moving forward it will improve
rick
i think you should arrange for a formal presentation of this material to myself and other folks in rac
i believe this is the direction of future risk control activity and all of us need to be updated
scheduling something after the board meeting would be helpful
tx rick
karen
please print this out
i need to edit this
thanks
rick
this slipped thru the cracks
are we still going to do
did you do it already
rick
did i send this to already
fyi
this was very contentious at india mtg w
lay
skilling
we need to understand what our exposure is
you need to become our india expert
tx rick
kind of old but still relavent
fyi rick
have had problems with my computer but i found this memo unread
may be because i have 0 emails
should we still pursue this
i know jack is working on copper mines
maybe you guts started without me getting involved
lets discuss
rick
how is progress on this
rick
mark
here is my response to your request
call with questions
goal
total foreign exchange exposure quantified and communicated to bod
performance
project completed with final tranche of results reported to finance committee dec 0
the notional exposure as well as impact on potential impact on earnings and cta accounts have been quantified and reported to the bod over the past year according to a schedule that has strictly adhered to
also
a template and process has been established to be able to easily report changes in the future
enron has never had a comprehensive review of fx exposure prior to this activity
as an aside
there has been a fair amount of hedging activity resulting from this effort
goal
establish risk and trading control processes for risks unique to ees
performance
systems have been established and monitoring controls are in place across ees
a thorough study of the dsm business has been completed and the results presented to the finance committee
a rac task force has been put in place which has established a work plan consisting of 0 elements that ees has agreed to put in place to get the overall back office and trading and credit control systems where they need to be
significant progress has been made against these recommendations
dsm projects have been spot tested with outside measurement firm and the results reported to ees
these tests have highlighted focus areas to determine where the capital dollars are best employed
goal
solidify the global risk management policy beyond houston and london
performance
complete and ongoing
during 0
project doorstep was initiated by rac which inspected every office within enron to determine if trading was taking place and if so whether the enron controls were being adhered to
a data base system was developed to routinely prompt surprise inspections of these offices and also monitor if the recommendations are being adhered to
doorstep was a huge effort involving rac
aa
and operations to really understand where we have risks
it also helps in defining where we don't have responsibility such as eott
azurix and the new power company
test
fyi
rick
have been unable to return your call
will do tomorrow
it has been crazy here to say the least
rick
no
the conclusion is incorrect
the peakers help to mitigate the risk created by market positions
maybe just change the last sentence to read
because the peakers offset the contract
the var is substantially reduced
rick
just met w
skilling and whalley
var for gas has temp increase of $0mm until next friday
0/0/0
jeff is calling for an executive comm mtg to ask for an additional $0 mm of corp var until next wed
0/0/0
one issue is uk power will be over var everyday starting probably thurs or fri of this week
unless we increase them as well
they sweep retail deals into book once a week on this day
this increase only needs to be $0-0
million
fasten seat belts and apply oxygen masks
rick
good info
i don't believe there will be many more
ei
type asset acquisitions any time soon
rick
thanks
we are in bounds for the moment
rick
tx
caps were eliminated so this should improve
rick
will not attend
tx rick
send him what was in books but no notes
tell him it changes daily in a huge way
tx rick ps i stopped down earlier to thank you for a great job on the bod meeting
see you at 0:0
thanks
they do a great job and are an under-appreciated asset at enron
rick
per your voice mail i would like to defer 0% of my ect phantom stock into the stable asset fund
i only want to defer that which i have to defer due to my section 0b status
thanks
rick buy
probably a smart decision
rick
need your help on the following
each day we are delayed in finalising var
p&l and positions because the uk must wait for a usd interest rate curves before submitting their data to houston
i am also told that it is really not necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of business london
even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it would be better than what we have now
this would greatly improve the efficiency
by 0 to 0 hours
in reporting to senior management
can you guys initiate this change or get me to the right person there
thanks
rick
everyone in rac is invited to attend underwriting mtg on friday at 0:0 am
rick
fyi
please respond
tx rick
deal needs to go to skilling
or ooc
because capital price exceeds return
otherwise frevert could sign
i am authorised to sign for jeff up to $0 mm after i leave him a voice mail
after i review deal i will voice mail jeff and that should work
rick
fyi
rick
fyi
rick
thanks for note
mike jordan in uk is coordinating an effort on this
i'm worried we have more than initiative going on here
hopefully everyone will coordinate
rick
ok
but can't do anything until jan
rick
i have two nominations for md and one for vp
vp david port md ted murphy dave gorte all of the above would be in the specialized technical category
call me if a problem
rick buy
the continued growth of the enron europe office and related businesses has prompted a change in the management of risk assessment and control
rac
in london
effective in early january
0
ted murphy will transfer to the london office and mange the rac activities which include credit and market risk and underwriting
ted will continue to manage the enron global market risk activities
steve young
currently managing rac in london
will begin a new assignment within ebs
also in london
the houston market risk group will be managed by david port as enron continues to expand its trading and risk management businesses
it is vital that trading and credit policies are administered in a consistent and accurate manner across the company
hopefully this realignment will accomplish that goal
please join me in congratulating ted
david and steve on their new assignments
i would like bill bradford there unless someone is trying to llimit headcount
rick
i will request this extension at tomorrow's executive committee of the board mtg
rick
this needs to be sent company wide
lets discuss how
tx rick
i have no idea who sent me this message
i did not like the sound of the name so i forwarded it to both of you
it is not a pornographic e-mail but i the name sounds funny
fyi
trying to stay out of trouble
rick
spoke with john sherriff this am re prc for london rac people
john said they included our people for cross calibration purposes but we could rank our people where we saw fit
so i don't think there is any issue here
the houston prc rankings should stand unless there was new information brought to light to you steve that calls into question a person's ranking
sheila
please double check with the london hr people that this is straightened out
thanks
rick
spoke w
skilling re oi
binary
decision
he is willing to enter into the deal
his rational is that he thinks we will be ok on owc in the final analysis
he did say to reserve for the deal adequately and structure it as appropriate for the circumstances
he also wanted to know if there is anything different here than on owc
i told him that it wasn't significantly different
both strong underlying businesses with huge event risk attached
lets get dash completed and then i will voice mail jeff w
specifics and get his verbal signature
rick
is this correct
rick
after rereading 0 times i see your point
didn't mean it that way
before i sent it out i had ted and karen review as well as another person in corp
none had any comments
i asked dave gorte if he saw anything negative in it
he did not
didn't mean to slight you in any way and i apologize if i did
rick
please get involved here and let these people know this
tx rick
i have done this 0 times now
excellent
god help them best of luck
rick
keep
em coming
rick
karen
wanted to say thanks for the gifts you gave me the other day for xmas
i know i often appear ungrateful but that's what happens when you have 0 thousand things on your mind
the pen and leather
thing
for notes are great
i'll use both in my annual attempt to get organised
rick
thanks
you guys need a rest
have a great holiday
rick
this looks good
possibly don't need last two items
we need to decide when to review this once it is live to see if it is taking off
also
what does t aking off mean
certainly after a month
see what others think about this list and then we can decide what our plan should be
i'll talk to you in a day or two
rick
lets have a brief meeting on this
i'll have karen set up
tx rick
sorry to hear your news
thanks for letting me know
rick
activity levels in credit risk management
crm
have never been higher due to very volatile commodity markets
growth in ees and many other factors
in order to address these market changes
effective now
ken curry will transfer from rick carson's due diligence group to crm and report to bill bradford
ken has a strong background in credit related issues and should be able to immediately add value to the crm group
it is fortunate that adequate depth exists within rac to be able to realign personnel as market needs suggest
please join me in congratulating ken on his move and in wishing him success in this new assignment
rick buy
pam
please send this to rac worldwide
tx rick
i guess i don't have strong feelings if a dash is written here or not but i do care that a troubled situation receive the attention it requires to avoid getting in deeper
there always seems to be reluctance in uk to have a dash prepared
steve always used a huge amount of energy on justifying the task
we all know that if problem deals are not addressed they always get worse
maybe michael could be led to
suggest
an alternative memo or approach
a
problem deal
memo
if you all think a dash is the best approach do it and i don't care if they don't sign it
once the website is functional
it will be helpful to have a complete history of deals and having these kind of memos in dash format will aid this process
one final thought
michael is quite supportive of our effort and i think we should pick battles carefully
rick
i told you wrong on date for next mtg if you need approval
that date would be feb 0
i'm tied up w
bonus/review stuff for foreseeable future
feb works better for lunch
rick
fyi
weird
but ok by me
rick buy
ok by me
only because i know frank
rick
thanks
rick buy
attached
hi
thanks for the note
remember that karen reads all my mail so don't send anything too personal
time to get back into studying
it will be over before you know it and the four years is a small fraction of your working life so keep at it
i will look into london for your spring break
send me the exact times you have off
love dad
i really appreciate it when people take the time to acknowledge mark's efforts and others in rac as well
thanks for the feedback
rick
fyi
wasn't there a discussion on this at prc
rick
please schedule
are your plans to stay on 0
we are doing some planning on office space
i have some people in 0 allen that i would like to move over here but it is not a big issue
i had heard that you were moving
tx rick
we are probably ok for now since we got the space from networks
rick
yes we should present fx exposure at every meeting just like credit exposure tec
format as before
rick
tx please stay on top of this and pass on info to bradford for inclusion in our overall calif
analysis
rick
wow
what's behind this
not that i think it isn't a very prudent decision
rick
are these numbers consistent with your expectations
we will submit to hr if no onjections
traditionally sutton has looked at the range and made the decision where to be inside the range
i don't know if skilling will do the same
i have a voice mail into him to see
rick
lets discuss this before we make offer
rick
you all should have received instruction from sheila w
on the system for salaries
i need that info late today so i can look at over the weekend
numbers are due monday am
rick
chip is assigned to north america primarily but we asked him to get up to speed on the india situation in case a new deal should arise there that requires rac input
he is a sharp guy with lots of project finance experience and also worked in london for eastern
if you don't want him involved and a transaction arises it will be difficult to get someone up to speed quickly
given the complexities
rick
great
this is exactly how i want everything in rac to work
rick
i will be unable to attend this meeting as i will be in canada meeting with banks
bill bradford could attend in my absense if dan thinks appropriate
rick
i go away for a day and come back to yet another $0 million of pge exposure
i guess the lesson is to not go away
where does this end
this is a painful way to learn about derivative credit exposure
please inform all
deal doers
at ees that they better have rac review their deals
mercury
in detail before they sign
this is more out of control than anything else we have at enron
rick
i like this slide from tara
can we use somewhere
rick
this is great
i want to use it at our upcoming credit conference
thanks
rick
my daughter has reservations at kingsway house
0 eardley court
can you see if anyone knows if this place is a disaster
she is going with a girlfriend that doesn't have hardly any money so they had to find a place that was cheap which worries me no end
tx rick
yeah
i heard
childers informed me and rubbed it in that he was key in talking me out of that decision
i think i made the right decision ya think
rick
fyi
rick
maybe have her contact ted since he is in london
rick
craig
received another statement showing another service charge
we should probably cancel this account
rick buy
maybe have her contact ted since he is in london
rick
please be sure this is in some legal record or something so i don't have problems with this in the future
thanks
rick
karen
please print this out and file somewhere
tx rick
thanks
i am very interested in this business so if i can help let me know
tx rick
please print and file tx rick
a
doorstep
inspection of this business was performed in accordance with our procedures and apparently this business is a disaster
we need immediate action on this up to and including shutting it down
this was the worst we have seen at enron and i don't even want to put in this email what i heard was going on there
we need a coordinated solution here asap to avoid a real disaster
if there isn't one already
i'll speak with rick causey here about what immediate action we should take but the more you guys can dig into this the better
more to come
rick
ted tells me you guys have already taken action on this which greatly relieves me
i did not want this procrastinated on
i have a meeting scheduled with rick causey and will get up to speed on what exactly what has transpired prior to that meeting
thanks for giving this your immediate attention
rick
karen
please print this out and file somewhere
tx rick
the above transaction was presented to the board on 0-0-0
there was considerable discussion which i have summarized below
returns
were the returns sufficient to syndicate the risk
i answered positively
which is what the capital price addresses
the dash return is a blended debt and equity return
was the $0 million excess proceeds enough to allow the company to operate
i answered yes since 0% of reserves are producing and little capital will be needed to develop pdnp and pud reserves
is management capable of operating or will they be in chapter 0 again soon
i answered that the bankruptcy was a result of overpaying for wyoming deal and low commodity prices last two years which resulted in a bb decrease below outstanding
we will have to watch this issue carefully
are banks reluctant to support kcs and could this cause a liquidity problem
answered that all creditors were made whole and likely that someone will come into credit but it was a risk
although for the time being they had enough cash to operate
this feedback is just for fyi but it does indicate that board is active and not a rubber stamp
rick
please print and file tx rick
thanks for your note
i want to wish you the best of luck in ees
as far as rac's issues with ees
i would suggest getting together with tribolet and getting some of the lists that have been put together as part of the task force
i would also suggest attending the task force meeting
providing ees management is agreeable
to get a better picture of what is going on
again
i hate to see you go but it will still be value added to rac and enron
have fun
rick
i liked him alot
seems ready
willing and able to make a move
what are your thoughts
rick
sounds fine to me
does it make sense to run resume past brown and sherriff prior to bringing him over
also
is the idea he would be a director
sr director or vp
each of these paths has consequences as you know
rick
thanks for the feedback
i sent my best guy there so i hope there is improvement
we have been talking to a candidate for credit that ted will be discussing with you soon
hopefully we can make progress there also
i want complete buy in from you and john on this guy before we proceed
separately
the scrap metals meeting we had with causey went well
we will reconvene in two weeks to see where we are
thanks again for the feedback
i was a little worried about ted after the md disappointment but it seems he has recovered
rick
thanks
now i just have to convince jeff
rick
this is fine by me
rick buy
since my daughter is going over to london it prompted me to see if that would be a good time for me to come as well
then week of march 0
i could stay a day or two if needed
any thoughts
rick
check out this site
rick
thanks
now i just have to convince jeff
rick
this is fine by me

check out this site

what type of projects
if you give me a brief description of what you are referring to i can forward to the correct person
thanks

please include bill bradford if possible
tx rick
please include bill bradford if possible
tx rick
this was an excellent response
no need to take too much grief though
rick
jeff
this guy sent me this email
probably not any interest to you
but you can decide
rick
this was an excellent response
no need to take too much grief though
rick
are you alive
how is your health
is stress a big part of your life
hope all is well
you are doing a great job there for us but if it gets to be too much we'll try to help
i noticed that west power has already made a fortune this year so it must be crazy
rick
you may have an interest in this
fyi rick
as mentioned in our floor meeting recently
attached are listings of teams that we are forming to better address the business needs of enron as it expands both in volume and scope
supervisors of each rac sub group provided the names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be adjusted from time to time
only the more senior people were included
but others will be included as appropriate
many will have to be multidimensional
there will be no formal leader of the teams because each member is responsible for the activities of the team
regardless of the rac group that you are in
following are several thoughts concerning this process for consideration
the purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer
the commercial business units and achieve this within our control framework
ancillary benefits include cross training of rac employees and heightened awareness of rac issues
de-silo-ization
all existing reporting relationships remain unchanged
for the moment
successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude among the teams
existing rac responsibilities remain in effect
teams should meet weekly
at least
to discuss issues
transactions will require more frequent informal meetings
there are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of credit
market risk or our portfolio
all team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction
offer to help out if needed
if formal cross-training is necessary
force it to happen
encourage weak links in team to perform
each quarter rac management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business unit with the team present
this may take one quarter to implement
if it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it with your supervisor
individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the prc and compensation processes
the existing ees team has been quite successful and in large part was a catalyst to the recent reorganization there
you can have an impact
this process should begin immediately
thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort
rick
you may have an interest in this
fyi rick
fyi
rick
fyi

no further board approval is required
i'm told that new products on eol require the lawyers to get involved but that will happen when you request to put the product online
rick
what do you think
probably ok i guess
rick
i'll be in new york
they will have to fly solo on this
rick
great news
thanks for the heads up
rick
what do you think
probably ok i guess
rick
i'll be in new york

no problem publishing
fake numbers
fake names and the real deal was not done
should be pretty safe
rick
great news
thanks for the heads up
rick
no
i'm meeting w
bradford at 0 to discuss
want to join us
rick
the board meeting has concluded and i can now focus on the task force
the following people in rac have been assigned to this effort as follows
legacy opportunity molly harris teresa seibel james copeland michael tribolet jay hachen minal dalia don rollins rick carson jeff soo debbie brackett sue vasan on going opportunities denise fury mark wilson dana smith andrew greer martin o'leary jay hachen dave gorte darren schmidt david port jeff soo this is a huge commitment of staff from rac and will strain us no end
but it is necessary
if you want rac to lead this effort i will appoint michael tribolet to manage the task
if you want someone else to manage the effort we will assist as we can
regardless of who leads this effort we need following
commitment of ees back office staff people commitment of it resources commitment of skilling to fund the overage to the rac budget
which i am under huge pressure to reduce
not increase
let me know how to launch this program
rick
fine by me
rick
no
i'm meeting w
bradford at 0 to discuss

rick
fine by me
rick
fyi
rick
spoke with ben glisan re our conversation on retail credit and concluded that we should meet with some banks that specialize in this area
can you prepare a brief presentation that would serve as a discussion document for such a meeting
the concept is that a deal flows into a website
that is basically a checklist and the transaction is sized and scoped
if it met deal criteria and portfolio requirements
it would flow directly to an outside shop that would fund
bill
track etc
enron could possibly keep a small interest in economics and of course a skim
lets review presentation
then discuss with ben/andy and janet d
and proceed to banks
ben is clearing idea with delaney
we are shooting for a friday
0
meeting
thanks
rick
fyi

what conference
rick
need to know more
focused on trading
or assets
rick
was speaking w
lavo today on a different matter and he mentioned you were a great help to him in managing his world and was quite complementary overall
i can count on one hand how often this happens in rac so keep it up
great job

i attend a regular meeting with aa and rick causey discussing ees internal controls
they have asked for a detailed presentation on
eam business
tariff curve summary and positions against those curves
credit issues in general
i will try and get more details for this but we should get together soon and get it organized
ees may attend but not present
i think we should give them an overview of the business and what needs to be accomplished in each of the above areas
probably a one hour mtg but maybe two
lets try to meet next week
karen
please set up
tx rick
rick
can you guys make a meeting on march 0 at 0am to discuss something with above group
rick
i approve this request
thanks
rick buy
i approve this request
thanks
rick buy
karen
please circulate to all rac worldwide
tx rick it is with great sorrow that i must announce the passing of andy knight
manager in the market risk group
andy succumbed to cancer on feb
0
0 and will have funeral services in florida
there may be a memorial service here in houston arranged through his church but details have not been announced
please contact veronica valdez for details
andy was with rac and enron only briefly before being diagnosed
but made a real impact especially on those that worked closely with him
andy had a warm and personable style
which along with his technical capability
made him a real asset to the group
he will be missed
thanks for the information on the gb 0
this boat far exceeds what i want
after the show i concluded that either a 0 or 0 foot classic is most appropriate for my needs
would like to also consider the 0 foot model
thanks for the info though and keep me in mind
i enjoyed talking to you at the boat show and my wife was quite sold on the gb line
after looking at most everything there in detail
as i mentioned i am in no particular rush as i probably have a year before i want to go forward on this but if something exciting came up
either new or used
i may be interested
again
i would need your help in obtaining appropriate dockage
in someone's backyard
thanks

no problemo rick
i like this
tx rick
i may have caused some confusion regarding a credit person in new york
karen left me a message that a new credit person in ny had started and wanted to meet me since she was in houston
turns out it was bridgett frazer who bryan hired for credit.com
sorry for confusion
rick
yes

i thought you were attending these meetings already but there are so many of them i get confused
rick
yes
tx rick

the names on this list seem very expensive to me
do we really need this council
rick buy
please put this on my calendar
tx rick
no
rick
wanted to apologize for running out on you in our meeting in london
unfortunately
you just can't keep frevert waiting
especially when he wants to have a beer
lets catch up when you are in houston
rick
elizabeth
i think it best that at this stage i opt out of this engagement
the situation i described to you is looking more and more like it is going to happpen and there is a real possibility i am totally engaged by the time this conference comes around
i am sorry if this poses a problem for you but there should be plenty of time to arrange an alternate
rick
agree
thats what i thought when i met with her over there
why don't you give her a call and try to arrange something
one thing i would rather not pay any relocation expenses since she is moving on her own accord
have suttle call her also
tx rick
i think we will try to want to make this work for you
bill bradford and/or john suttle will be contacting you
tx rick buy
karen
talked to whalley on this
he said he is going to kill deal but needs to do it carefully so he doesn't de-motivate people
so i guess we should keep working on it but it most likely won't go anywhere
a big concern enron has now is that we have $0 billion of int'l assets and the fear is that we lose people and no one will be around to monitor and operate these assets
you need to use discretion on this but not waste too much time
rick
tim
thanks for your note
before janet d
left she had requested additional resources and we began making arrangements to get people in place
we have assigned tracy ngo
ed sacks
paul radous and wendy conwell to power
we also have moved other rac people into credit
mark ruane
vp
ken curry
dir
and carol north
mgr
unfortunately it takes some time to get these people trained on transactional credit issues but they should come along quickly
we are in the market for more
it might be helpful to know if we could clone tracy
how many would you need
given your plans in the market
tracy is one of our best people
also
does being in houston work or do we need resources in portland
i'll meet w
tracy next week when she is in houston and get her views as well
please don't hesitate to let me know if we aren't keeping up and of course if you are gearing up for a new market push and anticipate additional needs let us know asap because there is a 0 month or so training period required for a strong performer to get up the enron curve
thanks
rick
ted
i gave my pass to mark frevert who was going to return it for me
i guess he didn't
i'll leave him a message
rick
norm tourangeau of b of a please call re collateral tx
rick
here is an application for george when he retires
rick
i see no reason not to except they rotate out in a year
maybe we could have them rotate to another group in rac
we need bodies so my vote would be to take him if he passes our test
rick
i'm in
maybe we could form a committee so mark could be on it
he could even chair it if he was up to it
regards
rick buy executive vice president chief risk officer and member of vp prc committee enron corp
thats really below the belt
i think it would be best if we sent a team to you office for a day or two
if we did it here it would be difficult to get people's attention for anything other than a minute
let me know your thoughts
rick
i didn't realize everything was here
lets set a date and get after it
rick
fyi
rick
fyi
rick
probably not worth the time
i think it is kind of a rehearsal
rick
do you guys think these meetings are still necessary
rick
i don't
fyi
we need to discuss
rick
i left skilling a message on this
lets see what he has to say
rick
rudi
i still have a hard time visualizing the risk here
other than pure dilution
which i guess we care about
there must be a way to communicate this issue graphically or with an example presented on a well thought out spreadsheet
if you
we
don't figure out a way to communicate the problem here we have no chance of winning the battle
rick
we can help you interview
bradford and port can really help in this process but its best if you screen them first
as far as dates go we have an enron bod mtg coming up which totally consumes us
this meeting is in early may
so after mid april it starts to get crazy
it would be easier for me if you gave me a couple dates and i will see if we can accommodate
rick
spoke with louise kitchen on another matter but unprompted she mentioned she really valued the watch list work as well as the snapshot effort
she actually raved about the whole effort
keep up the good work and let the group know it is valued
now just do it faster and more efficiently so you can do other stuff as well
rick
thanks for checking
it is unusual that they post interest daily
rick
shawn
thanks for info
we have done a lot on retail credit effort and should probably have a meeting to update everyone
i'll try to set something up
rick
thank-you for your prompt response
r
buy
probably unnecessary to attend regularly from my point of view but i have no issue either way
i think it is a good idea to meet monthly with causey
rick
we have received a request to change uk power limit from $0.0mm var to $0mm
quite sizeable but i spoke with richard lewis and he seemed convinced it was necessary
do you guys agree
what if it were $0mm
skilling will definitely ask why such a large increase so i need to have your full support
rick
i believe the following series of emails is a colossal waste of time
lets get risks into books
risk systems working
options valued and into books.it seems we are trying to build a race car when there are no roads
rick
i think they will get the point
rick
this is the site
it refers to other sites
rick
attached is the list karen gave me for the prc members
seems like a long list
can we shorten
if not i guess it is ok
it will just take longer and be harder to reach consensus
rick
better get after this quickly
are we working on this already
rick
this is a good article
on balance
interesting how utilities have charged the highest rates
tx
rick
how does this list sound for committee
bradford carson lowry petersen murphy davies port schultz buy let me know
tx
rick
good ideas
i want to meet with all groups soon to see how progress is going
will start scheduling soon
rick
dick foster is a consultant to the board of directors who works for mckenzie
each bod meeting he wants to meet with a group and we are on the list
i talked to rebecca carter and suggested we present him the bank presentation and she thought that was a good idea
please make yourself available for this
ted
if you can stay an extra day it would be helpful but not essential if you need to get back
let me know
tx rick
i think the daily it issue meeting has been quite successful in addressing problems in systems and working toward resolution on systems related issues
i would like to expand the scope of this meeting to include daily operational issues as well
i plan on restarting my attendance at these meetings on wednesday
can the rac people listed above please make a start at some of the recurring issues
thanks
rick
sally
got your voice mail as well
don't want to create more meetings
just had a total of three market risk people quit or transfer and each one said one of the considerations was they spent so much time on operational issues that they weren't developing as they should analyzing portfolio risk
i think it might be best if we have a meeting or two and see what issues are identified
it may be better to split in two meetings as you suggested
i need to hear what the nature of the problems are
some i know like ees
metals
uk power but i think there may be some other fundamental issues that are hindering progress here
no need for you to attend
i will let you know what we come up with including if there are no issues at all
rick
recall that jeff had several requests when we met with him
i asked you to write them down
did you
have we done all of them
can you give me an update
tx rick
good
why are we paying someone to do this
i think we should transfer keith to credit full time and put his analysis capabilities to use
rick
we have submitted your request for $0 million of uk power var to the board for approval
i thought about this issue a lot before doing so because i don't feel we are fully in control of the infrastructure there and a large limit can add to the danger
my understanding is that there is an it and backoffice effort underway to improve this situation and it needs to have focus to complete
please keep the pressure on over there to get the infrastructure where it needs to be
thanks
rick
is this the deal you referenced at the exec comm
b
meeting
or is there another one
i asked my guys to check if we had seen deal
rick
fyi
they forgot you
rick
my vote would be to initiate a claim
as i want to see if it works and how much hassle is involved
we should have a meeting to get everyone's view
i will get karen to set up
tx rick
karen
please set up a half hour mtg w
causey
bill
glisan and jeff hodge
time sensitive so we need in next couple days
tx rick
bill-i asked joe to put this together
fyi
rick
fwd to molly
thanks for the note
these events aren't cheap so it is nice to know they are worth while to some
rick
these files are password protected
what is this for
rick
why
fyi
rick
blaise
i have distributed your resume internally to a couple places
we have no people needs right now
just the opposite
but maybe one of the other groups does
will let you know if anything pops
rick
since you are in charge of career development
i want to be president
soon
seriously
you should probably meet with me or some of the group leaders in rac so you have a clear picture
in case you don't
of what we do
i'd be happy to meet with you as would dave gorte
let me know if this would be valuable for you
tx rick
the city buys power
has pa been downgraded due to dot com flops
rick
good job
reserve is low
historically speaking
rick
i will think about it
we are achieving the correct outcome here but the timing is off
concentrate on caulfield and oman
get brown involved to make sure we get those guys
use ene options as a currency to entice them
upside much better than chase/jp
just a thought
rick
ted
my comments are indicated below
i am on the board of mariner and attended a board meeting last week discussing company
they are looking as good as i've seen them since the inception of the deal
it might be a good time to consider selling
probably still couldn't get it off at book but closer than ever before
just a thought
as if you didn't have anything else to do
rick
as with muni bonds
it is nice to be able to just raise taxes to cover your costs
unless you are the taxpayer
tx for update
rick
looks good to me
jeff may want to just sign deals quickly without explanation as he does often on dashes
rick
do you want to talk to this lady
i don't
rick
no interest in participating
as you can imagine enron gets a large number of similar requests and i have adopted a policy of not cooperating
purely from a time management standpoint
sorry
rick buy
can you help here
rick
i will look into this
get back to you soon rick
can we discuss this
rick
no
i already told her there was no interest at enron
no need to pursue
rick
i hate to ask you to make yet another trip
however
there is probably nothing more important right now given markets view of us as a trading company
let me check w
despain on pulse here
get back to you
rick
egm has the largest number of trading books in the company with over 0 active books and despite this you guys do the best job getting worldwide information to us in a timely and accurate fashion
i wish i could get the rest of the company to this point
i'm told that the people referenced below have contributed in a big way to this effort
thanks for the effort
rick
will be out of town
thanks anyway
rick
heard back from tim
please plan on attending
port
bradford
you and i will attend from rac
moody's is having trouble with our loss of $0mm that i told them when they were here
we need to start pulling together explicitly why we lost so much in one day
what the var limits were that day and what has been the experience since then
tx rick
i would like more detail if we have it tx rick
david port should be contacting you shortly
we are in a major revamp of the policy and limits etc
has to be submitted for next board meeting
i don't think there is appetite for increasing overall risk in enron
corp var
so the allocation becomes critical
should be an interesting discussion
more to come
rick
were we involved in transaction
did we run any numbers
were we at the meeting with skilling
was corporate development involved
who
rick
tx
rick
thanks for heads up
i will let you know how meeting goes
rick
i can meet wed pm
can you
call karen to schedule
tx rick
meeting was postponed because whalley going to london
need next week
tx rick
looks good to me
rick
is this who you were going to consult for
rick
looks fine to me
no comments
rick
we seem to have resolved billing/account difficulties
would like to talk to you about setting up a system to manage cash so it can be in place and functional when i decide i have had enough of this place
give me a call next week if you can
thanks
rick
vlady
you may have to do this for me as i will be in nyc the day before with moody's and there is a chance i will be delayed
we should develop what we want to say together so either of us can speak
tx rick
dave
we can act as a check on this
be sure all underwriters are aware
tx rick
this looks great
send it out
rick
just between you and i
i think there may be an issue here of a couple personalities
we can't have that in your group or mine
i'll watch carefully
on the subject of timing
we should probably have a standard to shoot for
time to read contract
run model
review results and communicate
i'll talk to bill about this
on the issue of the hotline
we do not have everyone trained in running models for ees deals
we are working on getting more people up to speed
thanks
rick
will you take a stab at this w
hughes
rick
jim
j block was just a gas contract
at enron
risk is controlled through one of two mechanisms
a book structure with approved limits and daily reporting of p&l or through a one off approval of a dash
no risk should be taken on outside of these boundaries
even though there is no capital
a gas contract contains market and credit risk and should be approved
providing it doesn't fit into a book
rick
lets discuss this
rick
they need to post more cash
let me know
maybe a call to cronin
rick
bill
fyi
rick
billy
would like to attend but will be out of town
rick
more pressure
rick
i would like to attend this as well
rick
unless it would be disruptive
do you guys think this is worthwhile
i think it might be interesting to see what others are doing
$0k rick
fyi
rick
bill
can you attend a joint ews/ees coordination mtg on the 0th
will be all day
janet wants either you or i there but i have spec tech prc that day
can't delegate it
rick
yes
i may attend in the am before the prc
rick
thanks for note
sounds like good progress on people side
it seems
like many things
that a huge effort is followed by a period of nothing
but eventually the balls that have been rolling generate enuf
mo
to make a difference
rick
thanks for note
i recall our conversation
i've had surgery but as you know the worry is did they get it all
surface tissue of tongue on bottom right
this is so weird since i don't smoke or dip which are the primary risk factors
thanks for your concern and i will let you know how this goes
i have found that information control is critical so please don't discuss with anyone
i go back to mda in a month for follow-up visit
ultra sound of lymph nodes
rick
ok but this is a tree and i want to focus on the forest
a few facts on this may be helpful to understand the forest
also
be sure to coordinate with ted on london stuff
tx rick
lets cancel for the moment
bring up at next staff meeting
rick
karen
please set up a meeting on this with bill b and whoever he wants to attend
next week if possible
tx rick
tx
rick
thanks for note
i may need your help here as i won't be able to filter stuff as much as i usually do so if my guys are reviewing something that looks way off let me know
also
spoke with pug re joint meeting and he nthinks we need 0 hours for it and probably won't be able to discuss international assets and lessons learned this time around.is there anyway we can increase time for joint meeting to 0 hours
and have audit and finance as well
pug really wants to leave adequate time to discuss limits etc
he also wants to be sure that all bod feel they are invited
how do we do that
rick
at least you know you are out of control
that is partial success
thanks for note
rick
looks ok to me
rick
whats up with this comment
rick
i think i did this properly
any way you can check
rick
what is status of this
rick
maybe we need to rethink entire process
i haven't been totally comfortable with it anyway but it hasn't been high enuf on the list
maybe after bod mtg
rick
did this lady contact you
rick
a great tool
launched from the right platform
we are definitely making progress around here
keep it up

dance
drama and music programs
refugee services and other community services
the jewish community center is responsible for providing approximately 0% of houston/harris county meals-on-wheels per day
funding comes from a combination of federal and state programs
the united way and individuals
i encourage every single employee to take at least half of your day on august 0th to participate in this effort
rac's goal is 0% participation
it is a unique opportunity to truly make a difference in someone's quality of life
and you will be able to see first hand how your united way contributions improve the lives of people in our own community
below are our united way contacts within each group that will be helping with this process and can answer any questions
please sign up with your team leader by designating whether you are interested in participating for a full day
or for which half of the day
and they will review with each function's department head to ensure appropriate rac coverage for that day's responsibilities
thank you in advance for volunteering your time
let's show everyone that rac is dedicated to helping those that are less fortunate

great job and great team
stick to your guns going forward
rick
today wsj article on page 0 is good example of what we try to capture
they weren't mtm'ing their junk bond portfolio and it went against them
they were also trying to increase earnings by taking on more risk
without the risk system in place
they fired cfo and are looking for a risk person
good reading
fyi
rick
approve as written
rick
she needs a higher prc rating for an office
rick
david
i already apprised whalley of this issue
he is thinking about it

the email and calendar access of ted murphy relative to veronica valdez
have all such access disconnected if you find it connected
thanks
rick buy
fyi

great

if we have any inkling of a sale it should probably be mentioned at this bod meeting

fyi hope this helps
rick
as you are now aware
the united way campaign has now kicked-off and rac is very much an important part of the efforts and activities that have been and will be taking place
first of all
monday morning
each of you should have received a small package of lego building blocks and a schedule of united way activities for the week
the building blocks symbolize enron's commitment to
building houston's future
with the united way and the schedule outlines the coming activities that enron employees will be engaging in to show support for the united way agencies and the houston community
to highlight this week's activities
on wednesday
august 0
many of our rac colleagues will be participating in the 0 enron days of caring
the enron corporate team
of which rac is a large and important part
will be providing assistance to the jewish community center
if you have already volunteered to play a role in this activity--thank you
if you have not had an opportunity to volunteer and would like to
please contact any one of this year's rac united way campaign coordinators--cindy hudler
rebecca phillips
darren vanek
shelli smith
becky caudle
cassandra schultz or chip schneider
on friday
august 0
enron will host an appreciation event in antioch park which will include a complimentary lunch from chick-fil-a and activities to celebrate enron employee efforts during the week
included in this event will be the building block challenge contest featuring managers from around enron including dave gorte and chip schneider on the corporate team
please plan on coming out to join-in the celebration and support our colleagues
of course
underlying all of the planned activities is the financial need that the houston area united way agencies have for the year 0
this year has been extraordinary due to the flooding and devastation experienced by the houston area during tropical storm alison
in addition to providing their typical day-to-day community services
many united way agencies played a crucial role in the recovery effort and still provide support to those affected by the storm
a contribution to the united way this year is as important as ever given the extraordinary need
remember approximately $0.0 out of every $0.0 go directly to benefit our friends
neighbors and fellow citizens in the houston area
i sincerely encourage you to support rac's objective of 0% participation in this aspect of the campaign by making a contribution
contributions can be made by clicking on the enron human resources website at thanks for your support
best regards
rick
unfortunately
i will be on vacation
dave gorte in my group would be a good candidate to attend if you think appropriate
tx
rick buy
after reviewing the doorstep audit at long beach with the team i have the following conclusion
0
we should shut these offices down because we can not control them
they don't make much money and will be a huge negative after losses at long beach
or
0
we establish a rigid template for how these offices operate
my thought is that we create a mcdonalds hamburger type operation
each office is exactly the same and operates under precise and well communicated rules
hamburger
quality is monitored from houston routinely
there are a huge number of these remote offices so we need to address how we proceed
any thoughts
rick
sounds interesting but i am sort of long people at the moment
i bet fastow could use him

fyi

looks accurate to me

thanks so much for the helpful letter on membership and general information
your letter indicated that i should make application through the membership committee
who would provide me with an application
you copied cmde
roth on the letter so i will contact him to request an application or schedule a meeting
i have no contact information for him other than through the pyc
is that appropriate
i found a potential slip at great cove boat club and was wondering if you had heard of this marina and if other members used this facility
thanks again for getting back to me
richard
rick
buy p.s
i heard on the news one of the pilots was from portsmouth
so tragic
i'm sure people there are as devastated as they are here
i don't like this
we must make a decision
rick
yes
input is fine
you will have your hands full at tnpc
rick
was reilly crawling home when he saw you at the underpass
be happy to get together either in office or breakfast/lunch
give me a call
rick
i get snail mail and file the statements
you should too
you can view your account online
with a password
but keep getting written confirmations and statements
you never know if a plane might crash into their computers
love
dad
a time will come when you don't need paper but i don't think we are there yet
i was just thinking of the mountain of things going on
outside of normal stuff
and i decided to make a list
here it is
formation of international credit group
bradford/murphy curve validation issue-port/gorte steel issues-bradford/gorte operational risk metrics/implementation-curry bankruptcy group-gorte/carson/tribolet/bradford retail credit-bradford/carson private equity trading-gorte credit consistency study
buy i think we should have a meeting to discuss above
some are bigger than others
organization and website need to adapt to current business environment
if anything else belongs on this list let me know
karen will set up meeting
rick
no
no
we have the rac seats for all of these games right
rick
thanks for help
this is a tremendous service you guys provide
r
buy
i think you will find much more demand than you think for engineers
although the economy is suffering at the moment
it does not sound like this lady has her act together
i wish i knew more about biomedical engineers
you should talk to the head of the dept
and ask who is big in the industry and send them all letters with a resume attached
don't worry at all about your resume right now
it is almost irrelevant
your grade point average and salutatorian are relevant
there are very few female engineers in the workplace which will help you a lot
you could work for companies like enron
exxon
shell for example but it would not be in your major
my guess is the major pharmaceutical firms may hire you but you need to research this
the first stop should be the head of the department
lets talk more on this topic
love
dad
help
fyi,pls handle tx rick
agree
there should be no issue whatsoever getting him promoted at ye rick
fyi rick
fyi

i worked there for 0 years
including the 0 bomb incident

i would love to give you a call and discuss this but i thought i would write this email first
rick
i can't believe you finally got vlady
you must have snuck in while i was on vacation
by the way
whalley
port and i talked and decided we would try removing all your limits except var
lets see how it works
rick
does anyone ask how the reserve is split between deals
also
do they ask is it can be reduced because of portfolio effect
just curious
rick
good job
recoveries down sharply in
0 due to
rick
now that raptor is blown up
should we begin valuation efforts of assets and include in merchant portfolio
i am not familiar with details of how it unwound so i don't know what we are left with
is this worth a meeting with you or your designesss
rick
fyi
lets have a mtg
i will attend both events
tx
rick
ask port
it was in an appendix to finance comm book
0 mtgs ago i think
it had pug's q&a as well
port will know what i'm talking about

i'll keep in mind
its unfortunate we have to develop expertise in this area
rick

we are considering buying a server
rick
have fun
you guys do a great job on the reporting info for bod and it is appreciated
rick
very good thought
i'll pursue
tx rick
lets discuss need gorte as well

this sound familiar

so noted
watch is a defined term in our system but doesn't mean you don't
watch
everything else

i often wonder if all reserve amounts agreed to find there way to the general ledger reserve
rick
i had my weekly update meeting with my team on metals and was quite encouraged by the report
seems like real good progress on all fronts
as0 systems work
var implementation and trading results all seemed positive
some issues around sap/as0 reconciliation but recognized
metals was one of my biggest worries but has slipped way down the list
great work to your team
rick
i think i would to attend the weekly meeting with haedicke
can you get me invited

please ring draper at aep current position
we have paid them all of the margin they have contractual rights for
$0.0mm gone out today which is margin under our financial gas contract
however
they want full collateral on all of their power position
this is being driven by bill reid on their power floor
ex enron employee
the amount is another $0mm
they have no collateral rights to this
essentially
the credit guy
frank hilton
is hurting us in the market and anything you can do to help is appreciated
i believe some of this is vindictive behaviour from an ex-employee and senior management may not know what he is up to

hi jule
thought about your comment about fidelity
you need to get those checks and monthly statements
call them and tell them to get that stuff to you
don't call the jerk
call the 0 number
you should carefully manage your money
it is very important
love
dad
please circ to all of rac
i want to thank everyone for their hard work during these trying times
lots of our efforts in the past building systems
procedures and infrastructure pay off in times like these
feedback from both citibank and jpm/chase and enron's board members has been very positive relative to rac
congratulations to all
on another note i want to caution everyone in the group from making negative statements in the presence of ours and other groups
especially more junior members of these groups
because they come from rac they are not considered idle commentary and can be
and have been
damaging to morale to these people
we all speculate about the state of affairs and it is a good stress relief but we can not be a part of morale reducing behavior
things are not back to normal but they are improving
upon receipt of commitment from banks
hopefully later today or early tomorrow
our short term issues should be resolved
lots of activities are underway to address medium term and long term solutions
in the mean time
keep smiling
rick

as i alluded to in my note yesterday
enron has received a commitment for $0 billion in additional credit from our agent banks
this is great news
more from a market perception standpoint than an actual cash need
you can be assured that senior management is totally focused on the need to shore up the balance sheet with additional equity
now that we have the debt in place
but the equity we be a longer process
in the meantime
lets get back to work
i would encourage people to talk to their supervisors about this situation if you feel
angst
rick

jeff delapino
sp
from chase has asked me to look into the above transaction to change from monthly collateralization to daily
do you know who is familiar with this deal
rick
lets do what we can
it does sound like it would be less volatile if settled daily
rick
i think we urgently
next 0 days
need to have a meeting to discuss where we allocate capital and risk
counterparties are very nervous and many are not extending us credit so we are having to prepay extensively to do business
both in the us and uk
i have two suggestions
allocate to each business a fraction of our available liquidity or
appoint someone to make the call when a large chunk of cash is needed
for example
egm wants to send out $0
$0 million for sixty days to buy physical to cover an option with koch
we do not have infinite liquidity and we need to address it fast
i will try to set up a meeting tomorrow
rick
i know there is lots going on but i would like to resign from the board of mariner asap
i am having trouble devoting enough time to this function and feel it would be better if i turned it over to someone else
dave gorte in my group would be my recommendation as a replacement
if dave does not have an interest
brad larson could also fill in
any thoughts
if you have no issues i will proceed
thanks
rick
effective immediately
i want to sign all dashes for rac
i have asked dave to continue reviewing the deals and initial the dash but i want to sign them
this will enable me to be more on top of transactions and also allow me to relate to the other things that are going on

rick
looks great
is it a fraternity or sorority
love
dad ps mom is home
janet
thanks for your note
following are my thoughts
first
i am not going to netco
long story
second
i have spoken with ken lay and jeff mcmahon about the continuation of rac and my leading it
they both want rac to continue and want me to lead it and also combine an internal audit function with rac as well
to be determined more definitively
jim has also requested that some rac folks be near his operation as you have which i totally understand
i think i will assign a couple people to his floor but keep the bulk of our operation on 0
we have counterparty credit files on 0,0 counterparties as well as dash libraries and other info that require large secure space
my final issue is that i have had three credit people leave this week so my situation is getting critical
i need to get netco people away from 0 and get remaining rac people sitting together and feeling like a team
everyone is looking and the market is hot for our credit and market risk people
i hope this addresses your issue
rick
louise
we need to get netco people and ubs off the floor on 0
it is demoralizing to the remaining estate people and i am having a huge problem keeping people in their seats
three have quit this week and we need the ones that remain
can you make this happen rapidly
thanks
rick
unfortunately i will be talking with the sec next week

let me know if there is a problem with this request
thanks
rick buy
i think we do not need board approval
but they should be notified at the next meeting
i believe i discussed this with pug and that is what we concluded
therefore
we need a new dash and a quick summary of transaction which would include changes from original deal

columbia gas transmission columbia gas transmission files innovative capacity auction process with ferc fairfax
va
july 0
prnewswire
continuing its quest to promote creative regulatory policies
columbia gas transmission
a wholly owned subsidiary of columbia energy group
has urged the federal energy regulatory commission to consider an interactive
internet-based pipeline capacity auction process that enhances columbia's current open auction process
in a first of its kind filing
columbia proposes a ``bid/offer
system for selling capacity similar to on-line natural gas commodity trading systems
the filing was made in response to customer concerns with the current process and is consistent with sentiments expressed in ferc's order 0
which encourages companies to voluntarily submit ``new and innovative approaches
to capacity auctions
since the filing is not required under order 0
columbia's proposed auction is separate from columbia's order 0 compliance filing made june 0
``under the current mechanism
capacity is not always awarded to the party that places the highest value on it
said carl levander
vice-president of rates and regulatory policy for columbia gas transmission
``even though we conduct our current capacity auction over a five-day period
parties often wait until the last 0 minutes to place a bid
also
since the current process is based on set time periods
customers often call us back after the auction is closed saying they valued the capacity greater than the winning bid
according to levander
columbia's proposal addresses these concerns by moving to an enhanced
internet-based interactive auction that takes into consideration such current market conditions as daily fluctuations in capacity value and the increased level of auction activity due to shorter-term contracts
under columbia's proposed ``bid/offer
system
columbia would ``offer
via its electronic bulletin board
sales terms for all its available firm capacity
customers can then match all asking sales terms for any portion of the quantity and a sale is immediate and binding
if columbia offers discounted capacity
the customer can counter-offer with a different rate
or
if columbia offers maximum rate capacity
then a customer can counter-offer with a different term length
columbia can match the highest bid
subject to a present value process
and the sale is immediate and binding
at any time before a binding sale
the customer can change or withdraw its bid
columbia's ``bid/offer
auction proposal meets the six basic principles outlined in ferc's order 0
* columbia's auction has predictable timing since the auction will begin each day at 0:0 a.m
est
and all available capacity will be posted prior to 0:0 a.m
est
* the auction will be open to all creditworthy bidders on a non
discriminatory basis
* the auction is user-friendly since it will use columbia's existing ebb format
all information concerning rules and procedures will be made available on the internet
* the method of selecting the best bid will be easily understood since bidders will only be able to change one variable with respect to each capacity package made available
* as is columbia's current practice
winning bids and the bidder's identity will be posted to permit monitoring of how the selection criteria were applied
* the bidding process will be transparent to all parties since all bids
without the bidder's identity
will be available for review to all bidders through an internet-based system
``we believe the combination of these factors will ensure that the capacity auction format is
transparent
verifiable
and non-discriminatory
to all parties as well as innovative in design
levander said
levander said the proposal not only meets the commission's principles
it is based on feedback gathered from customers
who expressed a desire for transparent market information
shorter auction periods
an ability to withdraw and change bids
and a real-time
immediate closure process

i am interested in cascade's natural gas demand by broad customer class
such as residential
industrial
and electric generation
over the past year
also
if possible
a list of the larger generators or industrials that you serve
could you direct me to the department or individual who could best assist me in this research
thanks
jason wolfe trading analyst enron north america
mr
boehlke
after speaking to a nw natural representative
i was told to contact you for more specifics regarding information on your customer breakdown
i am interested in gas load by residential
industrial
and electrical generation on a weekly or monthly basis
your financial statements have a quarterly cross-section in a fairly similar format
but i was hoping i could get more specific numbers
including the type of industrial user
high-tech
aluminum
agricultural
etc
and historicals back to last winter
if you could help me out i would greatly appreciate it
as trying to forecast nwpl load without some general nw natural data is impossible
thanks
jason wolfe trading analyst enron north america
i am interested in obtaining a load breakdown by industrial

but am not sure which meter feeds your ferndale
wa plant
also
i would like to confirm the drns for the other three
if you

could provide this information i would greatly appreciate it
thanks
jason wolfe trading analyst enron north america
i'm sorry
i didn't receive the text of your reply
jason
the stream of internet bullshit is never-ending
if the fbi had any concern about this
we would see it on the news
but i heard from a friend's friend that the taliban hates atheists
like myself
most of all
and believes that if you give them lots of money they will destroy themselves in an orgy of hookers and cocaine
because they are immoral
godless creatures
if you don't do as they say
they will blow up your house on the 0th day of the 0th month of this year
like nostradamus predicted
checks or cash
or hookers
can be sent to
thanks
jason
cards win indeed
i like them for the series
are you cleaning fishing boats
too
so when does tara have to commit to big e
can you clean my boat
it has this crusty
fishy stuff on the bottom of the hull
so tara is definitely returning
is this job the new boating equivalent of your uh recruiting job
where you will clean less boats this year than anyone else in your position in the history of triumph boats
btw
i have paid much more than $0 for a raw
water washdown
man-whore
i'm always hanging out
of my pants
that said
perhaps i can get more casual
it's tough for me to get away for lunch
with my new gig
but your companionship is the break that refreshes
we need some quality time
also
i've heard from ellwanger
who is cleaning boats
he offered me a raw
water washdown
and i don't own a boat
you didn't answer if you would clean more or less boats this year than the last guy
and yes
i am with beth
and yes
i am still a stud-cowboy
that is awesome
you must have been jizzing non-stop since the all-star break
the only big-unit i recognize is the one from uh
me
i vote for the 0th also
wait
do i get a vote

you need to have these things at a time when i'm available

i am trying to confirm that the following plants receive gas off of these respective meters on nwpl
ferndale
wa plant
reduced capacity
meter 0 troutdale
or plant
closed
0 could you confirm that the troutdale plant is a direct connect and does not nominate through the cascade ldc
this may be best answered by whomever schedules your supply
also
it would be extremely helpful if you could tell me when the above plants closed or reduced capacity
i appreciate any help you can give me

pecos and lone mountain do not seem to be options when manually booking a deal in sitara
if they are not in the system they probably need to be set up
the meters will be determined before 0:0 during scheduling
the deals will bridge with the una
las vegas meter/facility
let me know what you think
thanks
jason
it will be mapped to pg&e topock index and the pg&e large pkgs gas daily
the zone and una meter exist in sitara already
two of the five meters that will be assigned by schedulers need to be set up
as it is
the zone is mapped to socal curves
but should be pg&e as you said below
jason
dave
what do you know about the nwpl meter 0
camas jr
it makes up a fair amount of portland area load
it's my understanding that this is industrial
possibly paper mills
but i don't have much more info yet
if this is a customer you are familiar with
let me know
thanks
jason
jim
i was wondering if you could provide any info on the deer island meter off nwpl
0
it is a fair amount of load in the area
and i was just curious if this was mostly residential
or if there is a plant i am unaware of
i appreciate whatever help you can provide
thanks
jason wolfe trading analyst enron north america
seattle/tacoma is the summation of a large number of meters
the largest residential loads are broken out separately as tabs
the temps are from the research/weather folder
initially
i am just curious if you can achieve a decent correlation
we can refine things a bit later
jason
fascinating
i'd like to work at getting a piece
how about skewers
i've been working pretty heavily
this past sat i went to the rennaisance festival
which runs for about 0 consecutive weekends in the fall every year in the country north of houston
it is set up like a huge medieval village with jousting
shops
etc
people dress up like elves
swordsmen
wizards
fairies
i even saw a fat guy dressed as a fairy
people are really into it
and travel a long way to go
have you seen the new ford thunderbird
go online if you haven't
and have the big guy look at it
too
i think it looks pretty awesome
but i'm not sure it will be my next car
love
jason
i love you and although i am seemingly incorrigible
i listen to your criticisms
by now you should know that you can trust me through thick and thin
besides
you told josh 0 weeks ago that you liked being with me
despite our stubborn differences
i listened to you then also
let's get real
over the long haul
we have too much in the way of common interests
beliefs
and interesting times
i think we should just invoke a pact to talk more without getting angry
we are not moving yet
when we leave houston
we are leaving together
so unpack your uhaul
love
jason p.s
also
i expect you to do some holiday visiting with me
and vice versa
i know it seems gimmicky
but we sould keep a jar
and every time you get mad
i could put a penny in it
and you can decide every day if i have treated you like enough of a princess to take one out
whatever is left after a month or so
we would take a getaway of however many pennies are in the jar
not funded by the pennies
of course
this would really show how much things have not gone your way
and would be a reminder for me
we could also set up a jay jar
but i guess that would be less full
i am brainstorming to try to get myself to behave
so i know it's corny
also
i like the virginias and carolinas
but we should go together when we go
and i think of you as my partner every day
and i'm sorry i take it for granted
quit applying for jobs outside of houston
the farthest you can go is the woodlands
the game was nail-bitingly close
but chinese 0 year old hookah's strategy of chokonu mayhem was the deciding factor
at one point
beth and i soaked the earth with the blood of wave after wave of paladin assault
and rear-action monk cowards
but it was alan's resource control that won out
but for the most part
i would characterize the game as a draw
bring on the firstperson shooters until star wars
jason
chris
could these numbers be loaded into the db for october
these are cyc 0 pulled from citrix

jason
a good beating reminds me of my uncle sam's place
i look forward to an evening of intense concentration puncuated by controlling
berating direction
and that's just beth's backseat driving on the way to greenway
but seriously
folks
i'm probably not in for any game night where travis is encouraging guys to feel his lance
isn't there enough posturing
if beth oks it i can do a strategy session
that last email from devil-pooch made me yearn for the sight of his blood soiling the field of battle
the key to allan's wins
and i have given it some thought
0
quick advancement
he doesn't attack early
i believe it is to build stone walls
encompassing a larger area than is proportional for his team
and to seal us off
0
large level of resources
enabling him to cue paladins to build as his army is killed
thus he has a constant wave of attacks
he also builds resources until the point he decides to attack
then he kills all but maybe 0 villagers
his army is concentrated and huge
0
build castles on conquered territory
if we wall a large area
build resource levels quickly
then attack as soon as we each have a 0 man army
with additional soldiers cued
we will win
the use of trebuchets is imperative
we should have a total of 0 on our team
towers kill
and we must never sit back and let him rebuild
whenever we hang out not attacking
it's over
i know
houston sucks
i hope you feel better
i think your work
and work ethic
is phenomenal
i will give you many hugs
your biggest fan
sorry this took so long
i talked to geof and got the ok
thanks
jason
what the
thanks
my battery cap looked a little different
i will try to take it off tonight and will take a picture
it wasn't obvious to me at the time how the cap worked
it wasn't nearly as clean around the battery as grandmas

and i am insulted by your inaccurate spelling of this legendary band's name
like the las vegas product
we need to re-map the curve in sitara to pge-topock instead of socal
but we can go ahead and roll out the next day product
jason
around north carolina
no
really
why
whatever
just let me know when you aren't dicking around
if there is an enron next week
she will probably get an offer
unless we are owned by dynegy
then i don't know
either way
don't quit cleaning boats yet
according to cnbc
the dynegy deal is close
with an announcement today
i'm not really nervous
enron's strength is its wholesale trading dept
i'm not sure about non-core business and corporate hacks
though
we'll see how it all shakes out
it's really hard to believe it has come to this
jason
i'm eating droubi's middle eastern cuisine right now
thinking of the times we used to meet there for lunch
i miss those days
it's dynegy
not dynergy
we are totally lbs
no des
we had a bad defensive game
which i hope turns around next week
as we have good people at those positions
our defense has been one of the best
pumpngd had a lucky defensive game
but he has good people as well
our head-to-head with him in 0 weeks is key
curtis martin is a bye for him
so he picked up watters
but you saw last night how dominant shaun alexander is
if he has a good game next week
he may have the starting role or at least split carries
the next 0 games will be tough
jason
the merger will be completed over the next 0-0 months
so who knows where i will end up
i need to be where the trading is
beth and i are driving up for xmas
we're leaving houston thurs or fri before
and will head back for houston the 0th
let sweetpea know
jason
i open my email
and trav is inviting people over
threatening to pull out the ol
lance
and comparing dimensions with matty
i guess that means it's game night
is allan going to around tues
he has been notoriously absent
and may not be allowed to play anymore
oh
and the pause for
friends
was a nice touch
i think that reveals the true
inner warlike nature of millerknight
you go
girlfriend
thurs i can play after thirtysomething
but on a serious note
i need some clarification on when aoe lance night is taking place
and when xbox night
thurs
is happening
i'll bring some miller for mk jason
hey
thanks for trying to squeeze in a few minutes with your friends the weekend you finally fly down to houston
i wouldn't expect you to make a trip unless you had to
sorry
no
who is playing

get back at me so i will know when to show up
thanks
dj
i hear you are good at facilitating a quick
meating

legal risk report
developed the concept of the legal risk report for ect
i began reporting and managing the ect legal risks on that basis
this resulted in a better understanding of legal risks such as the power contract risks
there will be many collateral benefits for the company as a result of this new technology for legal risks such as better decision making on transactions and faster focus on solving problems
0
developed and implemented new chinese wall policy
in the face of almost daily breaches of the then existing policy
a new policy was developed that is fashioned to fit the unique business of ect
the traders and originators helped design the policy and have
bought in
training was completed in june
this new policy should reduce our sec risk
while at the same time
allow us to take advantage of certain information
0
lead power industry to develop a standardized form
pushed isda and eei to work with the major iou's to jointly develop a standard master trading form for power
the form is now 0% complete and is modeled after the ect form
the result will be a significant saving of legal time and effort and more transactions will be completed in the industry with less risk of an unintended default
0
cutting edge legal work
identified and solved many cutting edge legal questions in connection with the start-up of many ect businesses
these businesses include

iii
acquisition of businesses through contract such as contemplated in the ui and the peoples deals

lots and lots of deals done
legal built a closer relationship with several difficult groups with improved results for the company

i could not open the exhibits
mark
jim
per our conversations
i propose the following additions to your draft memo
global trading
all lawyers providing legal services for trading activities
anywhere in the world
will continue to be consolidated into one group reporting to mark haedicke
legal risk books
mark will undertake an enron-wide long term project to categorize legal risks into standardized risk
books
to that end
mark will form a team to work closely with each general counsel or her/his designee regarding the significant legal risks in each subsidiary company
the goal will be to help us better understand our legal risks on a consolidated basis and to provide additional tools to manage our legal risks day to day
it is anticipated that a consolidated monthly legal risk report will be prepared for enron
yes
also
outside legal usually increases over the last 0 months of the year

emilio pinto
at the sao paulo lawfirm of tozzini freire about joining isda
he and his firm are doing a lot of work for enron
he is familiar with isda and said he was interested in joining
i told him he would get a call and some materials that he could present to his executive committee
i reviewed with him the cost of $0,0
please give him a call at 0-0-0-0

please look into this asap and report back to me
mark
yes
go ahead and send it to kevin
it does not look very helpful in that we cannot argue ena assigned ees a lot of value
mark
i plan on playing golf
mark
jim
i am looking for weather data by region for 0 and 0
i believe that there was a lot of extreme weather this year and i am looking to support that
this is background info to support the arguments for standardized power contracts
which are nearly agreed to
let me know what there is and who i should talk to
thanks for your help
mark
can you look into this and get back to me
thanks
mark
the schedule looks good
i don't think there is any need for me to meet with stikeman
thanks
mark
should the first order of business be to decide who is responsible for each form and then review who must approve the changes
maybe we should do that ahead of time
also
should we set a time schedule
mark
no problem
terry
greetings
i have been reading about lliberalization of power markets in japan starting next year
i wondered if you expect ibj or any of the other large financial institutions in japan to make a market in power
would you or someone else you know want to talk about that
let me know
hope things are going well
take care
mark
mary
that is good news
at the rate we are going
we will have enough energy companies before long to have substantial commodity committee meeting in north america
i am still thinking about the breakfast in new york
take care
mark
rebecca
this is the response i got back from my contact at ibj
let me know if you would like to meet terry
mark
terry
thanks for your reply
as our thinking starts to mature
i would like to talk to you about what we see in the japanese markets re energy
perhaps
we can talk in new york in november at the isda board meeting
take care
mark
is your new address working
it was part of ect
but it was sold
mark
alan
please confirm that you have told mike that it is required that legal be consulted on such a waiver
mark
great job
the english language will dominate the energy world
mark
these look fine
have them printed off for me to sign
mark
fyi
does this impact on us
mark
see if you can fit her in
mark
sheila tweed or dale rasmussen
mark
let's try again in two weeks
mark
making progress in energy
mark
martin
thanks for the update
it looks like great progress in being made
mark
today
i talked to the gc of both southern and duke
each gc said they were not really up to speed on the issues
i took the opportunity to walk them through the nerc letter and the action taken at the serc board meeting
they each attempted to argue our fight was really with tva
mark
kristin
kevin is very concerned with this charge
why is litigation now being billed up front
why is there a 0% increase in corporate legal
why is there a 0% increase in corporate secretary
why are we billed for the library when we use primarily electronic sources
could you please work on the answers to these questions and get back to me
mark
i am confirming
mark
please do not send me these messages as i do not have time to read them
mark
please do not send me the reports anymore as i do not have time to read them
mark
please stop sending the newsletter to me
mark
i would like to sit in from 0 to 0
thanks
mark
this is about a trip to brazil
she asked me to pay the $0 in expenses
do you see any rationale to pay for this
mark
thanks for the heads up
mark
i would suggest dan lyons from ena legal for vision and values
mark
i think it must be in moran's area
mark
what do you think of the letter
mark
you would need to start out in the associate program
good luck
mark
i am only aware of the edison institute effort which is a physical power contract
i think he was probably mistaken
mark
my particular concern is that the large majority of enron's derivatives business is in north america
we are growing rapidly in derivatives in europe
but still quite small
in terms of derivatives
we are not a factor on other continents
that is different than major equity
currency or interest rate traders
mark
paul trishmann
check the spelling
you participated in the ogc meeting which was fine
i did not want to miss out on your participation
going foward
please join the legal committee starting this coming monday and every other week
mark
neal
thanks for the message
we are tracking the developments in washington very carefully
have dan give me a call
if he would like
hope you and your family are doing well
take care
mark
i will call mark golden to respond in a few days
i don't think this is entirely negative for us
we can use it to get the products we want
mark
that sounds like good news to be part of the process
thanks
mark
please handle
mark
i look foward to meeting you
i have asked my assistant to get time scheduled
mark
both letters are fine
please arrange dates for the chairman to come to houston
thanks for all of your help
mark
janette
please send him a fax copy only
mark
thanks for the info
next year we want to run those fees through legal before they are allocated out
mark
i am looking for someone in portand to work on power plant development that will mostly be in ca and nevada
i would like you to talk to sheila tweed in my office at 0-0-0
who is in charge of this effort on the legal side
i will foward your resume to her and of course tell her to keep it very confidential
fyi
greetings
john
i would like to promote hodge to vp this time around
i know our system has changed to get that done
but i wanted to get your support on this
i believe jeff has done a good job and added significant value for a long time and has earned it
give me your thoughts
mark
wow
dan please go ahead and make the call and be sure to let them know we are schocked at the amount of the billing
mark
i appreciate the request
but have never given the slides i use out in electronic form
to do that we would need to have very detailed conversations about how they would be used
give me a call if you still want to talk about it
mark
i will see you there
don
thanks for the feedback
i am supposed to meet with mike g tomorrow and i would like to chat with you after that meeting
hope things are going well
i will give you a call
mark
i would be happy to meet with her
but is unlikely we would be able to sponsor a junior lawyer
it does not work well in our business
let me know if you want me to talk to her
mark
yes
i would like to go
let me know the time
mark
can you cover this
thanks justin
ok to talk to him
i just don't want to get his expectations up
mark
thanks
gay
it is nice to hear from you
i hope things are going well
merry christmas
mark
let's talk about it
but some sort of a consulting role seems appropriate
i guess it would be less hands on than usual
mark
alison
i think the energy panel at the agm on march 0
0 in amsterdam should discuss
i
development of energy trading on the continent
ii
energy documentation issues and
iii
regulatory barriers to energy trading
this is a great time to do a panel on energy trading in europe
i will copy paul and justin in london to get their ideas on both topics and panel members
perhaps we can have a conference call next week

mark
i will be over for the isda board meeting on january 0 and 0
with the launch of the credit derivatives business
i think it would be a good time to do a brief securities law/chinese wall seminar relating to the credit business
i would propose to review the rules we have instituted in na and particular issues in the european market
my preference on timing is in the morning on the 0th
and second
in the afternoon on the 0th
please give your thoughts on this
take care
mark
fyi
we need to talk about a presentation in the london office on chinese walls
mark
thanks for the comments
i will make sure tana gets taken care of
mark
please put this on my calender
john
i will get on your calender in january when i am over
it is also my understanding
for the credit trading business you are developing
that chinese walls are not necessary
but it will be necesary to address if equity trading starts up
also
there are probably related issues
like restricted lists and the like
that could apply to credit trading
hope you have time to enjoy the holidays
take care
please respond
michael
i think it is an excellent idea to keep count of the number of isdas we have as a way of focusing attention on our progress
i think it may be a good idea to get a paralegal secondee from a&o or linklaiters
that secondee could then help with overflow work after a return to the firm
mark
i have noticed it
mark
this was the right monday
so next monday was the ogc anyway
mark
let me know if there is anything else i need to do right now
i would think we would want to set up a conference call as soon as we have identified all the panel members
take care
mark

julie
great to have you back
mark
mary
by copy of this e-mail
i am asking justin how big a presence national power is in energy trading
it seems to me national power is more analogous to a dealer than a subscriber
mark
how big a presence is national power in the market
are they analogous to a dealer
mark
welcome
please stop by
mark
let's talk about it
mark
i will be in tokyo next week working on the start-up of energy trading in japan for enron

i will be in tokyo on thursday and friday too
look foward to hearing from you
mark haedicke
do we want to talk to him again
if yes
jeff
please give him a call
mark
sorry
i can't make it
mark
thanks for your note
i think it is easiest to contact julia murray and lance schuler
please call me at any time
mark
mary
i think national power should be more than a subscriber member
mark
dear terry
thanks for your quick reply
wednesday at 0 pm works for me
i would be happy to come to ibj's offices
i will be joined by two others on our team
i would propose to discuss the prospects and challenges for energy trading in japan
let me know if this is ok with you
look foward to seeing you
regards
mark
richard
looks good with one change
please delete the reference to honesty
it's a little too tough
mark
martin

is that correct
how is the weather
mark
alan

korea or singapore

mark
bill

terry

chiyoda-ku
is that the correct address of your office
let me know
regards
mark
travis
could you please spend a few minutes on this and respond to steve wallace
thanks
mark
joe
i think there are several positive things to point out
isda is opening an office in japan as of april 0
they have already hired one person and are looking for addtional people
more importantly
goldman moved one of its top traders worldwide
tom montag
from london to tokyo and is generally beefing up the resources in japan
ibj has contacted me about energy trading and asked for copies of confirms and says there is growing interest in the market place
that's all i can think of for now
take care
mark
next time
paul
thanks so much for your help
i think the legal team you have made available to us is very impressive
i look foward to our success in japan
i have authored many articles on trading in markets around the world
would anyone in your shop like to work with me on energy trading and documentation in japan
mark
mark
i will be in amsterdam for the isda board meeting on march 0 and 0
i would like to get an update on the apx before leaving for amsterdam
for example
do we think it will be successful
what kind of volume is trading
also
i wanted to get your recommendation on what law firms or maybe the apx that i should visit while i am there
hope things are going well
regards
mark haedicke
bill
thanks for the invitation
but i cannot make it
take care
mark
i am sorry for isda that mark harding cannot run for chairman again
i will give you a call
is montag willing to do it
seth
i thought last week was very productive
i appreciated your help
the isda office in tokyo is set to open officially on april 0
0
yasuko horibe
who is currently in the isda office in nyc at 0-0-0 is planning on moving to japan to open the office
give her a call and get more details
get back to me if you don't get the info you need
mark
per our conversations
give me a call
mark
mark
give me a call
mark
please provide your comments to me as soon as you can
the most important thing at this point is to make sure i have the business correctly described
i am working on the letter of intent now
we will have to decide how detailed you want the term sheet and loi
i would think you would want it fairly general for your first few meetings until we get feedback
let me know
mark
there is a proposal to have a meeting of the head traders of enron
reliant
sempra
coral
duke
southern
dynergy and el paso
the idea would be to talk about e-commerce in the energy business
specifically
enron might propose standardization of our masters
start-up of a clearing house for energy trading
electronic mechanism for confirmations
opening eol to other companies to post bids and offers
and discuss electronic protocols for transactions with other energy companies to reduce costs
we would probably discuss the state of regulatory restrictions under the cea
what are the anti-trust issues for such a meeting
what are the appropriate parameters for such meeting
should legal counsel be in attendance
would it be best to make invitations through a formal letter
jeff
please review and let's talk about it
mark
thanks
please work with travis as i asked to take the lead on developing the conference
mark
thanks for the feedback
mark
i think we need coordination on all plant matters
mark
talk to janette and let's get a few other people
mark
paul
i think we should have a brief meeting of you and me and lance schuler to plan out a strategy and then direct raisler
let me know if this sounds ok to you
what do you think is driving the change of mind
regards
mark
seth
there is a new senior person that was just hired in japan to be the head of the office
you should find out that person's name and try to meet with that person in japan as soon as you can
i think enron should try to steer one of the committees to focus on energy regulatory matters in a material way
i am not sure what committtee that would be at this point
i think you should have this conversation with the senior person and i will work on it at the board level
let's keep comparing notes
regards
mark
i am ok with all the changes except the deletion of the last sentence in paragraph 0
i don't understand why abitibi-consolidated deleted that sentence
mark
tim
i am preparing a list of the pluses and minuses for the three main alternatives of settlement
hearing and ferc
i think it will be helpful to channel the discussion
i will send it to you later today
mark
at this point
i think they should be a subscriber member
since trading of paper is an emerging market
mark
sorry for my tardy reply
i have been covered up
thanks anyway
mark
i am not sure
the numbers do look reasonable to me
see if they are ok with sheila walton and would fit in with our standard policy
mark
we have not talked about this
mark
what's going on
where are working now
mark
please print out for bob crane to sign
mark
great conference in amsterdam
it was the best one yet
i would like to have an idsa sponsored energy conference in houston sometime in the next year
i think the time will be ripe to focus on
a
energy derivatives around the world and
b
the application of web technology to energy
if we do it right
we may draw a large group internationally and build our membership dramatically
let me know what you think
regards
mark
yes
i want to continue receiving it
mark
have you thought about arthur andersen or pricewaterhouse
mark
yes
please get the lunch on my schedule and book me to take them on a tour of the trading floor
mark
thanks for the info
mark
bill
i am looking foward to the game
i will try to walk over to your offices by 0:0
mark
rick

mark

mark
i am on the boards on harris county children's protective services and international swaps and derivatives association
mark
liz
i would love to go

mark
i don't know the person mentioned
mark
i will have to take a rain check
i am meeting my son's fourth grade field trip here in sa and as it turns out we won't head back until about 0 pm
have a great tme
mark
i think that is as good as we can get under the circumstances
i would take it
mark
h&k has done only a little work for us
mark
for your review
the latest diagram for the paper website
michael
i am free to discuss this at your convenience
i am hopeful this structure will be unregulated in europe as well
mark
not enough experience
mark
i did it last week
i think it is a great seminar
mark
based on earlier conversations
i have identified the following business methods that may be novel from a patent point of view
0
our site is offering
prime
paper rather than seconds or ends 0
credit risk is managed by the site
credit intermediation
without cost to customers 0
customers can access financial derivatives on paper to manage price risk on physical paper products 0
customers have access to financial derivatives to manage price risk on prime offerings please give me your comments on this so we plan our strategy
mark haedicke
george
i think your proposal is a good one in light of all the facts at hand
i think it is best if we take the high road in approach as you have proposed
i would ask robert to prepare a one page bullet list of your points and then let's all briefly review it
i want to stay mindful that litigation is possible and we have to chose our words carefully in event of litigation
mark
that is a great success
mark
bill
i am thinking i could do it may 0 or may 0
if that works for others
i will confirm next week if those dates work
mark
susan
it is ok to provide the requested information
mark
thanks for the invitation
but i cannot make it on friday
have a great time
mark
yes
the 0st works for me
i already made the mistake of mentioning the 0th to susan and she reminded me what day it was
mark
bill
i am flexible but i like between 0 and 0
mark
ken
how should i help promote the senate bill
does it allow us to do a many to many paper product financial exchange without regulation
what would you change about the senate bill
mark
dave
i didn't see julia's name on the list
i assume it was just oversight
let me know
mark
fyi
yes
talk to cynthia or mark taylor
mark
thanks
i think your list has real potential from a patent point of view
mark
thanks
the talking points are helpful
mark
a couple of other thoughts
0
aggressively pursue litigation claims and manage litigation risks
0
build contracts and legal infrastructure to support new businesses like paper
0
develop top talent in the firms to assist getting all our deals done
mark
i will be there
mark
i could not open the document
mark
rob
she could talk to barbara gray about a position as a paralegal
barbara is looking for help on some of the asset work
mark
not enough experience for our shop
louise
i can take care of this
once in a while
i need to get my hands dirty
mark
jason
i have reviewed the ca and only have one comment
i would like to add a paragragh 0 as follows
this agreement shall terminate on the date one year from the date of this agreement
enron net works llc will be the party to the agreement
the address is 0 smith street
houston texas 0
please set up the agreement for signature by louise kitchen as managing director
my number is 0-0-0 if you have any questions
regards
mark haedicke
cynthia
rick grove and i talked by phone to chairman rainer today about energy
i made the point that energy swaps should be treated just like financial commodity swaps
also
i pointed out that innovation has been slowed for electronic trading of energy by the current regulatory structure
i think it would be a good idea to prepare a
positive
letter from a few congressman encouraging a point of view on energy more like the senate bill
mark
rick grove and i spoke with chairman rainer on friday about energy and he did not budge
he appears to be strongly against us
why do you think that is
pls
handle
mark
peter
the summary is very helpful
perhaps
we should drop the summary into the monthly report
please talk to julia about that
i want to make it as efficient as possible
mark
nora
thanks for the information
as new issues come up
please copy mark taylor
thanks for your help
mark
liz

i have printed it and will initial for greg's signature

i think it is a great opportunity for both you and the company
please work through the move and comp questions with julia
of course i will be available as needed
mark
peter
is there any real risk that contingencies from lgec could spill over to enron canada
mark
please set up a meeting next week with randy and michelle and dan to briefly review the issues below
mark
i am in houston
but would be happy to give him some contact names
what is his background
that will help me come up with the right people
mark
fyi
bob
sorrry for the delay in responding
i am ok with v&e representing the underwriter with the usual carve-outs
mark
i have not heard of the firm
mark

mark
you're very welcome
mark
paul
thanks for the risk memo
mark
peter
thanks for the note
please copy julia on updates of this nature
mark
please put on my calendar
mark
dear mr
esposito
i would recommend you talk to brian seyfried in london at 0-0-0-0 re credit and jere overdyke in houston at 0-0-0 re insurance derivatives
let me know if you need any more help
sincerely
mark haedicke
yes
i am generally familiar with the deal

mark
please check with janette
thanks
mark
janet
i am looking to this now
mark
i think we should try this out
i will work on that
mark
i received the binder
thank you
mark
dave
i wanted to let you know that i will be in israel on july 0
on the date of the vp pre-ranking
this is a long scheduled family trip that would be difficult to cancel
i can call in or get all my comments to you and others ahead of time
mark
that is a very interesting question
i think we would eventually want to include derivatives in the cross default trigger because of their significance
however
since we often have the far larger derivative position
it would seem at least now
this would more often work against us
mark haedicke
congrats on the deal
mark
fyi
put on my calendar
mark
i do not know of any reason
mark
fyi
you call and confirm with dennis oakley at chase
cliff
please find the legal opinion we previously discussed
mark
don
i would like to attend with you
i will check with my assistant to make sure i can do it
take care
mark
bob
after last year it is a close call
but i want to do it again
i am willing to go for one-half again but am ok with only a quarter of the games
let me know when you need the money and i will scout around to see if anyone wants a quarter of the games
mark
janet
i received your message and heard you loud and clear
we need to diversify the talent working on your deals
let's get you together with julia next week to discuss
mark
what has been mandated by aa and what is your recommendation
mark
please put this on my schedule
mark
chris
thanks for the feedback on dale
i agree with your assessment
take care
mark
is our filing date of july 0 still on track
mark
i think attending the isda workshop would be a good idea
mark
please find the docs she is referring to so i can sign them
we should get jeff hodge to sign them
mark
alan
fyi
please forward on to tom
i could not get his e-mail address to come up
mark
fyi
we should talk about attendance at these meetings re electronic trading
i will not be back from my vacation until august 0
is it possible to delay your vacation for two days
if not
i think it will be ok
mark
edmund
thanks for that a&o summary
is anyone recommending any change in the isda agreement or schedules
hopefully this fact scenario would never apply to enron
mark
i can go only if there is no net works meeting
mark
alan
there is a good article on power trading in japan
please pass it on as appropriate
mark
test
scott
thanks for the note
mark
i would try rick shapiro
mark
rick
as you know
clinton should sign
over the next couple of days
legislation on electronic signatures
there is a big need to standardize the approach with respect to e-signatures on trading contracts and maybe confirmations
i think this is an area that isda could provide leadership and possibly make money through a protocol
let me know what you think
mark
bob
i think the rfp looks great
the one question i had was whether or not we wanted to put in the rfp our objective in terms of income from the facility
also
should we encourage joint bids
take care
mark
peter
at this point
it seems to me
it may be helpful
but not materially helpful to bid through a separate entity
do you disagree with this conclusion
mark
lance
it looks fine to me with exception of the reference to kinneman
please revise and send out
mark
please look at this and give me your comments
mark
pete
thanks for the memo
mark
george
we have a new lawyer in alan's group starting in a few weeks
i want this lawyer to help wayne
i think this will take care of the issue
thanks
mark
fyi
thanks for asking
but my schedule does not permit speaking at that time
mark
tim
what's your reaction to this article on cal px
mark
bob
we are working on a
protocol
re electronic signatures
is this something isda would want to be involved in
maybe money could be made
let me know
mark
alan
i forwarded it on to the gc at isda and am looking forward to his comments
great job
mark
bob
i think we say we want the facility to be revenue enhancing and that we are in favor of joint bids
take care
mark
yes i do think so
he may want to coordinate with v&e
but that is ok
please point out we are working with isda
mark
let's try to use v&e on the e-signature things as much as possible
bob
we are working on an e-signature
protocol
and wondered if isda wanted to take the lead in this matter
let me know
mark
bob
this is something we are working on at enron
is this something isda has interest in taking a lead on
i think isda could add value by developing a standard approach to e-signatures
mark
let's do it in august during the week of the seventh
please start working on a short memo for dave and me to send out
i think we need to have at least two dates
the memo should say attendance is mandatory
mark
i think we should get either you or sara involved in this
gary has requested a houston lawyer help in establishing the business in london
mark
tim
thanks for the note
mark
this looks ok to me
mark
thanks
fyi on the lawyers conference
mark
bill
i called shapiro about this and he said they were interested and would cover the meeting you told me about
i would give rick a call at this point
thanks
mark
paul
great news
were there any difficult questions raised by the sfa
mark
justin
thanks for the info
alan and i are going to work on it from this side
it sure looks like we could use a lawyer in new york
after you and alan talk it through
let's agree on a plan to get the work done in nyc to make sure we are coordinated
mark
chris
thanks for the update
let's try to get together in toronto on tuesday
august 0 or 0
do either of those days work for you
i would envision getting up to speed on business opportunities in ontario and addressing the questions you raised
your proposal makes sense
but i would like to defer our decision until we have had a chance to talk it through
mark
yes
michael raised it to me
so that is all clear
with respect to the candidate you mentioned
i think i would need to review his resume and see what the arguments would be
let's get together and talk about this before you go to the recruiters
mark
rosemary
yes
i would be happy to
i would like to get some time on the schedule to review the plan for energy both in north america and europe
it seems to me that we ought to have a meeting in frankfurt in sept and a seminar on energy in houston over the next six months
mark
please add this to my schedule
maybe
i can fly to toronto the next day
ask chris gaffney if september 0 works for him instead of the dates i proposed in august
mark
chris
how about sept 0
i have to be in nyc anyway on sept 0
mark
please review the attached summary of legal risks
mark
in preparation for our meeting on monday
i listed the key legal issues re the ppas
mark
i think you need to do their reviews
i would coordinate with jeff hodge to make sure you get the appropriate feedback from houston
liz
put me down for $0
mark
alan
are we doing anything on aer*x anymore
please let mark holsworth know
mark
i updated mine last week
please confirm it is not there as of today
mark
what topics do you think would be appropriate
i will have just a few minutes
i was thinking cftc
electronic trading
physical trading forms and continued opening of power markets in north america to trading
mark
we should include isda energy definitions
cftc matters re energy and an overview of power deregulation developments in north america
i might also add a few items about international developments and the eei physical power trading form
i am thinking 0 slides at the most
is that what you want
mark
michael
the september isda meeting is coming up and i am starting to plan my schedule
i will be in london on monday and tuesday
sept 0 and 0
i will also be in frankfurt on wednesday and thursday
are you free for dinner on either monday or tuesday
who is the best person in frankfurt to give me an overview of the trading markets in germany
regards
mark
jane
there are lots of countries that at first did not allow derivatives and later changed the laws to allow them
bob pickel
the gc of isda in nyc could give you info on this or jeff golden at allen
overy in london could give you info
mark
yes
please check on that
mark
martin
looks like great progress
mark
thanks for the memo
it is going to be a very interesting area
mark
please set a telephone meeting with alex for me
mark
please see note on frankfurt
mark
shouldn't we go with lebeouf
mark
mark
a concern has been raised about it service providers working on eol or other enron projects and then taking know-how to a competitor
such as dynegy
since these service providers tend to work for a lot of different companies
it seems like this is a significant issue
how do we address this risk in the contracts
do we need to add a non-competition clause
mark haedicke
ron
thanks for your help
let's get together for lunch some time
let me know what works for you
mark
nick
do we have an erergy meeting scheduled in september
let's talk about this
we could do it in either london or frankfurt doing the week of the board meeting
let me know your thoughts on this
mark
rick
thanks for the message
i have sent an e-mail to nick
i will coordinate with him
mark
paul
thanks for the e-mail
i agree with your assessment
i also want to thank you for your support of the legal department
we feel like we are part of the team and i appreciate your efforts in that regard
take care
mark
nick
i will plan on being there and will be happy to comment on item 0
i think we also could talk about regulatory barriers to energy trading in europe
please keep me posted on seminar plans in europe re energy
regards
mark
bob
per our conversation
mark
it seems to me that our standard language should prohibit service providers from working on any similar project for a competitor or disclosing in any way that work was done for enron
also
we may want to specify liquidated damages for violation of this covenant
any objections to this
mark haedicke
jay
you and i can talk through the issues
the key point is that you have to vote the best interest of the corporation on whose board you sit and not your personal interest or the interest of enron
give me a call and we can talk through the business of convergent and what the risks are
mark
i agree
also
i think what we do here will be cited by others
mark
mark
would you please propose language to me along the lines i suggested
thanks
mark
please take this comment into account when you draft up some language
thanks
mark
dad
thanks for letting me know
she seemed to be a wonderful person
things are going well for me and my family
we bought a place at silver shells in destin recently
i am hopeful we will get there some during the summers
thanks
mark
i will be here next week
mark
please schedule 0 minutes with janette
mark
do you think that a bill favorable to energy will be passed over the strong opposition of the cftc
what kind of odds do you put on it
it is a significant change if treasury is not longer against us
but it is a little hard for me to believe that it is real
should i try to make a trip to washington in september
let me know
mark haedicke
mark
let's start using this right away
mark haedicke non-competition
contractor covenants that it will not use for any reason the by accepting work under this agreement
contractor warrants that it will not perform any similar work for a competitor of company
contractor acknowledges its obligations under section 0 of this agreement and
as such

anytime contractor provides substantially similar services to a company competing with the company
it shall take all appropriate caution to protect the information

let's talk about this when you get a chance
mark
please briefly fill-in the attached draft monthly report for net works by august 0
please e-mail your additions to janette for her to compile
thanks
mark
i was happy to do it
i really like your artwork
let's get together for lunch sometime

mark
mary
i asked for a list of major energy trading parties
it seems to me that we should try again to get those on the list that are not already members to join isda
let me know if i can help
regards
mark
mary
here is the list on telecom companies
let me know how i can help
regards
mark
great resume
but too specialized for my group
mark
mark
i was looking for your comments on this memo
thanks
mark h
i cannot be there
but am very glad you are having this meeting
mark
no i have not
mark
mary
spring break for most schools in houston for 0 is march 0 through march 0
otherwise
i am open in feb and mar at this time
i think london is a better venue for an energy conference than amsterdam
also
i think we will eventually want to do an energy trading presentation on japan
maybe at the update on october 0
mark
i would like to change our policy regarding taping telephone trades
i propose the following
0
retention period
change the retention period from 0 months to 0 months 0
record only deal terms
change from taping everything to taping only the deal terms at the end of a call the first change could be made immediately and the second change would require both reprogramming
phillippe is looking at this
and training of the traders to press the record button at the end of a call to record the deal terms
let me know your thoughts on the proposed changes
mark haedicke
per our conversation on coordination of our efforts on california and other jurisdictions
we have developed the following training program
0
anti-trust
we have completed anti-trust training in houston for traders and have scheduled it in portland and calgary
0
sales practices
this training has been completed in portland and is being scheduled in houston and calgary
0
anti-manipulation
this training has been completed in portland
but needs to be expanded to cover local law manipulation issues
it also needs to be scheduled in houston and calgary
also
the above training needs to be supplemented with training on local power pool rules
there is a similar program being prepared in london
a meeting is being scheduled so we can discuss these matters further
mark haedicke
please prepare drafts of the slides suggested in the attached
agenda slide
mark
paul
i have proposed we change our procedure here and we are discussing the proposed changes
i will send you a copy of my proposal
we can talk about in a few weeks in london
regards
mark
i am trying to build consensus on this issue
take care
mark
i think partnering with a lawfirm would be a good idea re documentation
however
i am not sure the isda board is likely to pick a proposal that includes a competitor of the stature of enron
i will call isda and try to get a read on what isda wants to do which is not clear at this point
regards
mark
thanks for confirming the destruction of tapes
mark
fyi
i vote for the monastery
i look forward to our meeting
mark
jenette
please put this tentatively on my schedule
mark
please set up this meeting
mark
try sheila tweed
we did a few transactions there last year
mark
larry
on the resume
only one comment
i would split out community affiliations or just delete it
i will give the resume to a friend of my in hr and ask where he thinks the best fit would be in enron
do you want me to e-mail your resume to a few people i know in other businesses
if yes
please send again without the note to me
mark
i have talked to my friend and the areas where we need help are in coal product and paper product marketing and industrial customer outsourcing
give me a call and i can describe the opportunities and see what your interest level is
mark
bob
i think enron is more likely to use the intranet service
i was unclear however
if additional service was available in the internet service
such as links to the explanatory books
i think generally we would want the convenience of having the isda materials inside for use by any enron employee
if the cost gets too high
i don't think members will pay for it
$0,0 sounds ok to me
regards
mark
peter
thanks for the message
i look forward to getting together
mark
david
per our conversation last week
i have attached a copy of mr
lipman's resume
he has expressed interest in learning more about the coal
paper and steel business opportunities
he will give you a call at 0-0-0 to schedule a time to meet
regards
mark haedicke
thanks for the e-mail
i have asked alan to find a time where we could talk on thursday to make sure we are coordinated on rudolf wolffe

joan
i will talk to susan and see what her interest is
thanks
mark
dan

mark
any interest

mark

please send me a brief description of what icor does
regards
mark
rob
i want to keep a relatively low profile until we settle project stanley
with respect to cooperating with transalta while the lawsuit is pending
that seems to send the wrong signal to transalta
mark
wes
i am forwarding the monthly report on legal
it seems to be inconsistent with the legal budget numbers in the qbrs
overall
it shows legal is slightly over budget for the year
could you have someone compare the numbers and let me know if the monthly report is correct
mark
please update as you fill in the rest of the dates
thanks
mark
joan
great
susan said she would like to go to a few shops as you suggested

mark
please hold for me
i will see you soon
mark
let's plan on talking about bt's hedge claim
mark
peter
please give me a two or three sentence summary of the trading issue and court decision thereon in blue range
i want to report on it over the next two weeks in isda energy committee meetings
regards
mark
peter
you are asking good questions
generally
most employees are part of ena and provide services to all the wholesale businesses
the executives tend to have their own company business cards and stationary
but
most of the business continues under ena or an existing company
occasionally
litigation concerns dictate not following the general rules
you can get more specific info from julia
mark
niki
i would be happy for 0 students to be assigned to legal
mark
large
a few of my pictures
mark
please print these out for me and forward to mark taylor
alan

let me know how it goes
mark
dan
let's go with the following as modified
thanks
mark
i appreciate all the work you did for us
mark
well done
please send a copy of the plan to the ogc and work with janette to schedule a meeting of the ogc to review the plan and get buy-in across the group
let's schedule the meeting for 0and 0/0 hours
i would like you in the mean time to focus on a time line to implement the program
also
please set up a meeting for you and me with phillippe bibi to discuss getting help from it to implement our plan
mark
i don't know anything about this
mark
put me on the 0:0 flight and let's see if we can do dinner at 0:0 rather 0:0
thanks
mark
we are looking at buying several paper companies
i think you should send them to me
thanks
mark
thanks for the resume
i do not need a regulatory lawyer at this time
mark
john
i don't see that as a problem
it was good to see you
regards
mark
send the docs to julia
mark
please see below from isda
do we ever want to go to using the isda for physical and financial deals
should this be a long range plan
mark
i have responded below
also
my title is managing director and general counsel of enron wholesale markets
i would add a bullet
comparison of masters in use in north america
mark
please fix this for me
mark
thanks for the message
i will try to get that fixed
mark
yes
include me on the list
mark haedicke
what is the status of setting up chinese walls
mark
bill
i would talk to lisa mellencamp about representing ena re east coast power
mark
fyi
mary
sorry
i can't make the lunch
historically
the interest in enron sponsoring any event has been very low
i will raise it but i am not optimistic
mark
looks good to me
mark
rappaport's comments are potentially very negative to us
i think we should write him a letter in protest
mark
please handle re paul nelson
please schedule
i am working on the scheduling the meeting this afternoon with power systems and their outside lawyers to ask for the legal opinion we need on this matter
we have to nail down all the facts and then get power system's outside lawyers to write the appropriate opinion
i will keep you posted
mark
please send an e-mail copy of the speech i gave shortly after meeting with mr
ford
mark
george
i will send it by e-mail
take care
mark
please call john arnold and ask him where the traders are coming out on this
let me know
mark
i think it is both rappaport and his target audience
i think dan needs to hear directly from us that we are not happy with the position he has taken re electronic trading
silence by us could be misinterpreted by him
let me know what you think
mark
dan
please prepare a list of items you think i should sign off on and then set up a meeting where we can review that list with the whole team
mark
steve
it looks like a great program
i am happy to participate
i would like to have a teleconference of the panel within a few weeks so that i can make sure i have time to get my materials together
regards
mark
for your files
mark
i got the chart in electronic form
mark
dan
i would like to have a brief meeting with the team to talk through the list
to make sure we are all on the same wavelength
let's do it soon with the idea we would have another meeting to wrap things up as appropriate
mark
let me know if you see any problem
mark
steve
it's ok to put confirmed
mark cc
subject
re
energy bar association program mark
i appreciate your taking the time out of your busy schedule to participate in the program
i will plan to arrange a conference call during the early parof october among the e-commerce panelists
can the program reflect that yoare confirmed
or should we list you as invited
steve
please briefly review the slides attached below and give me your reaction
please forward on to our clients if you think it would be helpful
mark
i think you must be looking for mark holsworth at enron corp
mark haedicke
paul
it is true that there is no wall
however
it is geographically separate
the equity trading is the end portion of the floor
there are three hallways that go to equity trading
each about 0 feet long
it would not be possible to hear anything said outside of the equity trading area
robert bruce is working on updating our policy and procedures in houston and by copy hereof ask him to update you
please confirm we send this memo to mds and key commercial employes
mark
everyone was intrigued that enron submitted a proposal
however
it is difficult to guess the outcome
mark
rick
i would like to have a presentation on local rules such as iso rules in the various locations where we operate
can your group do this as we work on the legal presentations
i believe this is already happening in part
but i would like to make more institutionalized
let me know
mark
please work with richard sanders to decide on the distribution list which should include all mds and robert knight
i want to get it out by wednesday
mark
per our conversation
mark
per our conversation
mark
there is no attachment
mark
please retype and send the memo directly within e-mail
thanks
mark
fyi
i am working on new procedures requiring a
budget
for outside counsel on our more complex deals to improve cost control
mark
thanks
mark
hi larry
i think your best shot at enron would be in paper with bryan
i think we got a gift
i remember susan saying something
i am just the dad
everything is going well
keep me posted on your job opportunities or if you want me to follow up with anyone here
mark
joe
thanks for the invitation
i would love to be there but unfortunately i can't make it
mark
only the 0 slides on power point
mark
does rob want to meet on oct 0
if yes
i want to be done by 0:0
mark
yes for the choice of law but not for jurisdiction
we could agree to non-exclusive jurisdiction in ohio
mark
it is ok with me
mark
i am ok with the seminar
people may have figured out other ways like self study to get their ethics hours in
mark
fyi
fyi
dave
this is for routine and
small
matters only
the resolutions are drafted so that the signature authority is narrow and specific
frequency is only one factor
an example would be certain defined right-of-way agreements and certain defined confirms
i will review the authority that has been delegated currently
julia and deb
please pull the existing resolutions with delegation of authority and let's review
bonnie
thanks for your note
i would be happy to meet with you and review opportunities
give my assistant a call
mark
you are meeting with bowen who has authority to hire
give me a call and we can talk through each of the people
take care
mark
primary
i think we should give an ultimatum to cargill
i could say that all enron trading is to hedge risk too
mark
please schedule this call
mark
please give michelle cash a call or karen jones in portland
mark
set me up for a lunch or a rockets game
the tickets should be coming soon
mark
please handle
mark
please update me on the issues
mark
please schedule something either in my office or a lunch
whatever they prefer
mark
peter
please send these updates to lance schuler
travis mccullough and me going forward
mark
thanks
mark
pete
the report is fine
go ahead and send it out to frevert
mcmahon
bowen and haedicke
thanks
mark
i want to get this started
let's get together at the time provided below
mark
do you know what this is about
mark
mary
this is complicated for oil companies
mobil exxon only does hedging
shell has at least two groups
with one doing mostly hedging and one doing mostly trading for profit
bp amoco is sort of in between
it is very clear with respect to cargill and el paso and shell
each should be primary
the companies may be trying to manipulate the rules by having the hedging organization send in the application
let me know if you need other info
mark
it's ok to use blakes given the conflicts
on the structure
i will forward this message to steven douglas and ask for his advice
mark
here are a few
take care
mark
i am fine with your recommendations except i see no need to have an outside director if not legally required
who would you recommend as filling that director position
mark
fyi
you are the man
i will be out of town on dec 0 through 0 and march 0 through 0
mark
paul
the isda meeting is tentatively set for jan 0
so it may be possible for me to be there on the 0st
as always
the schedule could change
but i would make every effort to be there
again
congratulations
mark
it is ok
mark
dave
based on our discussions this morning
0
internal costs
a capacity charge will be determined for each wholesale business unit based on a time allocation matrix that each lawyer and paralegal prepares
the time allocation matrix will be revised during the year if material changes in the work occur
0
outside costs
require internal sign-off by gc and coo to spend more than $0,0 on a potential transaction and a written transaction budget for proposed outside legal expenses more than $0,0
wherever possible
a firm cap on legal fees should be negotiated
a memorandum will be sent from the gc and
chairman of the wholesale group
laying out the procedure to all employees
0
selection of outside lawyers
expressly add billing rates and efficiency as key considerations
in addition to quality
in the selection of outside counsel
dave
we need to complete our discussion on this point
our new policy needs to be reviewed with outside counsel
0
reopener
need to review where business changes significantly
dave
i have attached the
time allocations
which are used for inside costs only
by attorney to the various business groups
we can derive the percentage of total legal department inside costs from this chart
in order to calculate the capacity charge
for ena and the other wholesale groups and enw
we had used this chart to bill back to the various business units within ena
but we will stop doing that now per our conversation
are you in agreement
mark
i would like to do fewer resolutions authorizing non-vps to sign contracts
and when we need such authorizations
let's make sure the resolutions are appropriately limited
my thoughts are as follows
0
we have a lot of vps that can sign contracts
0
it is generally ok to have confirmations signed by certain carefully selected directors since we are confirming a trade that already took place and there is master agreement already signed
0
there are certain very routine agreements like pipeline right-of-way agreements that are ok for carefully selected directors to sign
0
confidentiality agreements should be signed by a vp
0
any authorization for a director to sign should expire within not more than one year and revoke all prior authorizations
please give me your comments
mark
keep me posted on this matter
mark
bruce
i am tied up for lunch
but let's get together during the day on monday or tuesday
mark
it looks good to me
how do we keep up with changes in a counterparty's business
what if it no longer physically handles a particular commodity
mark
thanks
mark
i will be happy to help if i can
what is the timing
mark
thanks
mark
i had a brief conversation with vicki about splitting the costs 0/0 on the legal side to be consistent with the business arrangement
she asked to use the european operation as a model
at some point
peter you should just give vicki a call and talk it through
mark
please delete me from the list
mark
could you please respond for me
mark
i am ok with it so long as you don't spend much time at it
if there is a material time commitment or the company is competing head to head with enron
then it would be a problem
mark
it looks good
i am in the process of confirming
mark
please start working on a top ten legal risks list
i want to include that list for each of your companies
egm
eim and enw
in the monthly report
this list should be in bullet format
if you have any questions
please give me a call
mark
per our conversation
mark
please delete me from your e-mail list
mark
not yet
but i am told they plan to fund the additional 0,0
mark
please see if you and/or agc's in your respective groups can make time to participate
i have always found it to be a very rewarding experience
let me know
mark
the volume and complexity of our legal work has increased dramatically over the past few years
i think this environment requires additional time to be devoted to legal planning and review in order to provide the best possible service to our clients
within the next month
i have asked janette to schedule a quarterly legal review for each group listed on our new organizational chart
i would envision that we would focus on the following
review of the current monthly legal report and significant legal issues review of the top ten legal risks form contracts and other documentation projects legal budget legal resources
inside and outside performance metrics in addition
i am proposing that any energy trading contract for a term longer than one year by initialled by an agc or member of the ogc
let me know what you think about that
mark haedicke
why wouldn't we use the eei form in ontario
the markets will be integrated
at least in part

isda is planning an energy seminar in tokyo in mid-may
we have heard there may be an energy seminar in march or april in tokyo
have you heard of the earlier seminar
we are trying to decide whether it makes sense to go forward on the may seminar
could you look into this and talk to the traders
thanks for your help
regards
mark
looks good to me
mark
no problema
eric
i have talked to alan aronowitz about this as well
you need more resources immediately from inside
we will also have to recruit outside to get enough resources as the business grows
regards
mark
it sounds premature at this time for isda to put on an energy seminar in japan
do you agree
mark
i am hearing that it may be premature to do an isda energy conference in tokyo because almost all the products being discussed so far are physical
what do you think
mark
here is the memo i mentioned in our meeting today
let me know if there are other items we should put on the list

as a follow up to our meeting with the traders last week about litigation risks
i have drafted the attached hypos
so far
for discussion about legal risks in the changing landscape
let me know if you have any comments
my accomplishments for the year 0 include the following
0
eei form master power contract
ena legal led the industry development of the first master power contract
the form is rapidly becoming the industry standard for north america and in the process dramatically lowering costs and increasing liquidity
in october
we put an eei into place with pg&e with the result that enron credit exposure is $0,0,0 less than under the prior contract
0
new legal risk rating methodology
implemented a legal rating system which simplifies the review of legal risks and makes it much easier to determine whether or not we are being appropriately compensated for the legal risks
0
ews legal website for training
website has gone live for training regarding all major ews legal issues
this website will reduce training costs and increase availability of training to all employees

let me know
i would like to roll this out sometime in january

rob
i am still waiting for the first run of the numbers for legal
i will keep you posted
mark
yes
on the commodity side of our business
there is a long list of lawsuits on commodity prices in ca
this may be a committee discussion item
mark
the intent is that the higher the rating
the higher the legal risk
i believe the jurisdictional risk is a key factor in creating legal issues even if none exist at the time the deal is done
does that make sense
stuart should be on the lc
randy is the gc of south america
mark
thanks for your comments
i think it would be a good idea to have jon on as well
i will add jon and marcus to the list
please let them know as appropriate
regards
mark haedicke
please review and give your thoughts to me and randy
mark
why should we hold them harmless on environmental if they get their money out
we would only want to provide an ena indemnity if necessary
i have asked lisa to look at this

i think the cut is going to be that a person runs a group

the name i have is dr

he recommended that we meet for two hours on one day and schedule some time the next day if it is productive
his number is 0-0-0
he charges $0 per hour and i will pick that up as you would be incurring expenses to come to houston
give him a call and see if he is acceptable to you
if he is
i will propose dates and we can see if they work for everyone
love

does it still make sense to have these meetings anymore
maybe just sit in on novak's meeting
mark haedicke
hopefully when we recruit for other areas
like lng and the like
we will pick up a lawyer with some shipping experience
it seems like overkill to recruit just for shipping

non-trading work is off a little so maybe that is it
be sure to touch base with lance schuler about the work he sees coming up

how can we get some relief on this issue
should we set up a call with peter and me
there really is an earnings impact
let me know
regards
mark haedicke
it's ok with me
mark
no need to do a risk memo if the legal risk rating would be a 0
is that what this one would be
mark
the report is well done
for my purposes it could be much shorter
really in a bullet list format
thanks
mark
john
what is the status on this
i now have eddie daniels dedicated full time to cuiba
hopefully that will help you some
regards
mark
rex
we are trying to make this as limited as possible
can you define specifically what requires an exception
i am the signoff for the wholesale group

me and peter on the guarantees

i appreciate the feedback
i know she has been working particularly hard lately
we are working to add resources
but that is not easy
thanks for your support
mark
i am confused by this
does this mean cuiaba in south america would be covered
what is the significance if it is
mark
does matt have time to do all the lng work
my guess is that he may have the time
mark
thanks for raising the issue
keep me posted
mark
do you have any comments on this contract
please let me and chris know
mark
mark
i would like to get together at the agm
i will ask my assistant to work on a time would could meet and propose that to you
hope things are going well
mark haedicke
thanks
please don't hold up the meeting for me but if possible i will attend
mark
peter
as we have discussed
i think we probably need someone other than dan
i don't think there is any need to lay everything out on use of lawyers in canada

we can't ignore that
let's generally talk that through with jim

i leave it to bruce to see if it makes sense to shorten the list further
mark
let me know if anyone in your group is interested
mark
i think new york is a fair compromise
for north american transactions
litigating in london is very expensive so i think that is not a good alternative
mark
it looks great
mark
your comments
over the past several months
we have reviewed in detail our trading contracts and the companies through which we conduct our trading business in california
in order to reduce enron's non-market risks
e.g
legal
credit and regulatory
in the volatile commodity markets in california or any
future california
we propose the following changes
0
mandatory uniform set-off provisions in all trading contracts for all commodities
set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading contracts
set-off is one of the most critical tools available to enron in a major default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that enron can get the best advantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator
0
master netting agreements for appropriate counterparties with multiple masters with significant opposite exposures
where it is necessary to have multiple masters with a counterparty
a
bridge
should be put in place between the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under the two or more masters
0
merge epmi into ena
power trades are done through epmi
merging epmi into ena and conducting power trades through ena is much more efficient from both a credit and legal point of view
0
no automatic termination for a bankruptcy event
in the pge/sce situation
it should be the non-defaulting party's
enron in this case
option to terminate rather than an automatic termination on
inability to pay debts as they become due
let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts or entities through which we conduct our trading
i believe these changes will
i
improve efficiency
ii
reduce risks
iii
develop the opportunity to do more business with certain counterparties and
iv
substantially improve enron's position in the next california type market
the long range goal is to conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a single entity and a single or limited number of standardized agreements
louise
is enron ready for this
i think it is a good suggestion for the most significant deals
it is really positive in that it would force dealmakers to pay more attention to what the contracts provide
i am not sure it makes sense to follow this procedure for every deal that is dashed
let's talk about what are the objectives
great question
mark
add my name as a person to contact
mark
no problema
print out
mark
you should continue to sign the dashes and just alert me to any matter going to frevert or whalley
thanks
mark
yes

sorry
my schedule does not permit that change
mark
this is way too much of a commercial
two thirds of it speaks only to kiodex
tell him that at least one-half should not be a commercial
he said he was going to discuss new commodities and slant his presentation torward new commodities
he needs to do more
mark
greg piper raised the following questions
is enw a marketing affiliate

enron has complained about the quality of the information given to inside ferc
it is my understanding that requesting the counterparty data is a due diligence step that the trades really happened and that inside ferc keeps the name of the counterparty confidential
we want the data to be as good as possible
if my assumptions are correct
i come out
give the name of the counterparty with stated limitations
jeff hodge
please let me know if my assumptions are correct in the us
glad to have you as an employee of enron
mark
delayed
i prepared an outline but have made no progress beyond that

0
developed new ees trading forms
provided key legal technology and intellectual capital to rewrite ees forms to be largely consistent with the wholesale trading forms
0
developed setoff and netting strategy in the pg&e bankruptcy
led legal and credit team across all enron entities in minimizing enron credit and legal risks
this required an expedited evaluation of enron positions and coordination across enron entities to determine the best possible approach to terminate and then value all pg&e contracts
0
implemented new document retention policy for microsoft outlook
led the resolution of many critical document retention policy issues and implementation of a new policy across company lines in enron
0
thought leader on legal risk managment
continued to develop legal technology for better management and reporting of legal risks across enron
legal risk memos and legal risk ratings are two examples
these legal risk policies have been newly applied in south america and ees to better evaluate and manage the legal risks in those businesses
0
developing new businesses
integral part in developing new businesses in freight
paper
steel
lumber
etc
by preparing trading forms and formulating new ways to manage legal risks
0
deal machine
projects having lots of complex issues including lv cogen ii
pastoria
sithe
invasion energy
electrobolt and huntco
0
management
continued to build a deal-oriented legal team that understand the underlying businesses
0
new generation of master agreeements
taking the lead with isda in developing the next generation of trading master which would be a single master for all commodities

mark
richard is looking into whether we can tape in houston or portland and have a ca person on the line
mark
i have a few thoughts on the offsite
i think we could have a theme of restructuring and change
we would have to make sure it is forward looking and upbeat in that we have learned a lot that will make us better in the future
the presentations could include the following
0
what we learned in ca
sager 0
preparing for workouts
mellencamp 0
lessons learned in international

deregulation of energy markets

mark
i agree
mark
mary
the company seems to have a bad reputation
i don't know if marc rich owns any portion of it or not because it is private
i think
the uk started some investigations re glencore over the past couple of years
i am not sure we want the company as part of isda
i am sure others will have an opinion on that
mark
thanks rob
mark
have we put the updated netting language in the contract
would it ever come into play
regards
mark
peter
this is a tough battle
it may be worse because your clients are either the same ones or geographically very close
i would try to address it by pointing out the limitations of the simplier forms and as a fallback emphasize the increased risk
legal and otherwise
when using the shorter forms
mark
j
please get this message ready to send from me to the specialists
mark
i have asked j to send it out

the schedulers for hpl have relocated from the 0nd floor to the 0th floor
this team reports to my direct report
brenda herod
who is the business controller for the asset group and texas trading region
they are on the west side of the building
just outside my office
while room for this scheduling team was not available on the 0st floor
this move was made to improve communications with the texas desk traders
by being within the same elevator bank
we can now employ
squawk
boxes between the traders and this scheduling team
as we look at space usage on the 0nd floor
this team should be included in space requirements
we are working with liz taylor on those requirements
approved
pls process
thanks
sally beck
we are working very diligently to accommodate the need for space on the 0th floor
unfortunately
we are not able to do any major construction to densify the floor during the next several months while enron property services is completing the build-out of levels 0
0 and 0
in the mean time
we are going to build out the window spaces on 0 to increase the capacity on the floor
while these locations are not prime spots
people will need to occupy them as our business continues to grow
once the window seats have been constructed
estimated to be 0-0 weeks
we will realign groups on the floor and people will need to move once again
i am requesting your cooperation and patience to work with lisa cousino while she works with space planners to coordinate the location of energy operations personnel on the newly-constructed commercial floors
susan harrison is working with lisa to manage the space planning on 0 during this transition period
chantelle villanueva will be coordinating all moves of people and equipment on the 0th floor
if there are any problems once a move has occurred
i.e
missing or non-working phones
boxes
computer equipment
printers
etc
please contact chantelle at ext
0-0 as she will also coordinate the follow-up on all move-related items
if chantelle is not available
maria sandoval will be her backup
maria can be reached at ext
i would also appreciate your help in cleaning up the floor
including the window spaces
we can no longer maintain unnecessary boxes
paper and supplies on the floor
please coordinate with your assistant to have your area cleaned up by december 0
during this clean-up process
if you have any documents that need to be filed and/or archived
please contact carolyn gilley in the information and records management group at ext
0-0 and she will make arrangements to pick up the information from the 0th floor
thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation in maintaining a neat and professional work environment
between now and the summer of 0 when we will relocate to the new building
please keep in mind that we are all working in a temporary and makeshift environment
i would greatly appreciate your patience and good humor as we struggle to use the available space effectively
if i have missed anyone on the distribution list that has just recently moved to the 0oth floor
please forward this message to them
thanks for the pappa's gift certicate
for a woman who can't remember the last time that she cooked dinner
this will come in very handy

i will take that home with me tonight and i will enjoy it during my upcoming days off
i hope that the christmas holiday brings each of you the joy of the season

relaxation and time with family and friends
thanks for your enthusiasm in your role at enron and for your continuing and tireless effort

0 was a year of outstanding accomplishments for energy operations
a direct result of your contributions
i look forward to meeting new challenges in 0 through continuing to work together
this is what we sent to a/p
let me know if we need to resend
thx
g
what is the latest on this
i hope that the two of you received a copy of this
although jennifer
s message doesn't mention it
i assume also that she reviewed the findings with you
did you get a copy of this
it looks as if in september that our intercompany balances were relatively low
ees and ena
with an increase ioctober with enron europe
do you have details behind this
are ees balances gas only
or gas and power
how do we have imbalances with ourselves
what kind of reporting do you get from financial ops on a regulbasis that gives you the details behind this
i am assuming that these imbalances are created from commodity transactions
so that we would reallybe closer to the details than would financial ops
is that a good assumption
sally
whom would you recommend play this role for energy operations
let me know your thoughts
sally
cindy
my schedule was so hectic before going out on vacation on december 0 that i am only now reading your message regarding a business owner sign-off for unify/sap integration
i have asked stephen schwarz to give me his recommendation on the most appropriate person to do so
i think that is a good idea
as soon as schedules normalized following the holidays
i will be back to you with a name
i am not especially surprised that you and kristin did not get a copy of this report
my
assumption
in my message was wishful thinking and not conviction that the sign-off meeting between you and aa had occurred
approved
pls
process
thx
sally beck
fyi

enron has spent much time and effort to ensure that business will continue smoothly as we move into the year 0
ken walther
in working with many of you
has done an excellent job of preparing a work plan for january 0
your work on the first will be the final step in this process
your efforts that day will allow all ena employees to return to the office on january 0th with confidence in our ability to continue business as usual
i wish each one of you a happy new year
i continually feel privileged to work with this dedicated and talented group of employees
i look forward to all that we will accomplish in 0
we are wrapping up several hours in the office and have tested all commodities front to back
we found a few minor issues
primarily reports with report dates that were incorrect
the content and underlying calculations in the reports were correct
these were really just query and formatting issues
all were quick fixes of five minutes or less
so at this point we feel confident about our system situation
more will unfold with counterparties next week
but hopefully all found this as uneventful as have we
hope your new year's celebration was fun
we saw pictures of the london festivies on tv as we were cooking our new year's eve dinner last night at home
see you soon
i am resending the original message that i sent to kevin regarding rick causey's memo
please refer him to the second point in my e:mail
as well as the attachment
thanks
does the info as provided from hr indicate mba's from ut
i know that enron probably has a number of undergrads from ut
at this point
i am specifically interested in ut mba's
as it is the houston chapter of ut's graduate business network for which i will now serve on the steering committee
thanks
sally
reference for future months
these dates look fine
i hope that you have something fun planned
the only slight glitch is that i will receive the bonus sheets on monday
january 0 and that our turn around time is one day
if it is convenient for you we can talk by phone on monday night to review bonuses for your group or we can plan on meeting first thing on tuesday
the 0th
i do not yet know at what time on tuesday we will have to have final changes made
sally
thanks for being so prompt
the address list on the memo below contains the names of all ena energy operations employees who worked in the offices in houston
denver and calgary on january 0st to test our systems
does it work for you to copy and paste this for cliff's note
let me know if it would be better to provide this to you in a different way
thanks
sally
attached please find a completed employee profile for brent price for consideration for promotion to vice president
please call me if you have any questions
the attached is the correct version
please disregard an earlier version of this form sent to chris shenkman by dawn doucet
that version was not complete
please update my listing for direct reports
do you distribute a copy of this to my direct reports
if so
please get an updated copy to them as well
thanks
the industry quote below is interesting
i have a call in to bob to ask him to get you key measurements on eol business to date
sally
preview of info request before targeted 0:0 pm meeting in my office today
i believe that we may have a potentially good fit for avril
but my direct report who would have to add her to his staff is on vacationing out of town until monday
i will talk with him on monday morning and i will have him visit with jeff sorenson
who previously interviewed avril
he liked her and was favorably impressed
but had no position for her
we may then want to be able to talk with avril by phone
since a face-to-face interview will not be possible
we should have a decision then very early in the week
since you will be in houston i can update you in person
i would not panic
this includes ou and ut
you can ignore the ou names
but there are some good students that i can introduce you to when they arrive
john and i haven't talked about this need
but i will certainly think about any likely candidates
danny clark
who used to work in deal clearing
documentation for ect a couple of years ago
is in ees as far as i know
he was knowledgeable and meticulous
understood trading as he was a risk book administrator in a previous life
have you considered him
give me a couple of days to think about potential candidates from within ena
and i will get back with you
sally
attached is a memo that rick plans to send out
i hope that attaching this makes it easy for you to take care of this
i am delivering to him a highlighted copy of the memo so that he will know about a few wording changes that i have made since the last time that he saw this in draft form
he is certainly free to make any other changes before it goes out
call me with any questions
congratulations on your new role in the communciations company
building that business will be exciting and how great for the company that you will be there
congratulations on your promotion to managing director
it is wonderful to see your contributions recognized in that way
sally
please take these meetings off my calendar
thanks
thanks for the note about the video conference
i have put that date on my calendar and i am very interested in the discussion
any details on where i need to go in houston to join in
sally
this is the most immediate response that i have ever gotten on notes mail
just let me know and i will be there
thanks
i liked the new signs for the new hire network this morning
as opposed to the signs for new hire orientation
just wanted to let you know that i noticed the difference
i will be curious to hear about changes to the content as well
hope your are doing well
we will have to have lunch after you get through january
sally
it is officially on the way
we will see how long it takes to get distributed
sally
two of you had to leave the staff meeting before this final discussion point and three of you were not in attendance
so i wanted to send you the attached memo that i distributed at the end of the meeting
this memo will be sent by rick causey via notes mail regarding an additional role that i will assume with regard to global operations
i shared this in the staff meeting so that you would be the first to know
i will still fulfill my role within ena as vp of energy operations
i will not be going away
this expanded responsibility should create addtional opportunities for operations personnel and will validate some of the global functions that we already provide to the organization
thanks for the note
sherri
i know that you read notes mail messages very promptly
sally
thanks
i now know that you read notes mail messages very promptly
sally
thanks for the note
i hope that you are enjoying your role in ees
thanks for the note
i am glad that you are enjoying portland
i am still on the 0th floor
so do drop by sometime when you are in town
i would love to see you
sally
i always have time for lunch
i will ask my assistant to call you to set something up
thanks for your note
sally
thanks
i think
please put my name on the list to attend this forum on wednesday
january 0
thanks
please find out location of this conference call and put the details on my calendar
thanks
sally
thanks for the note
while most of my focus will be on ena
it will be interesting to look at operations around the world
thanks for forwarding mail to me
i apologize for the inconvenience of this
my current e:mail address is sally.beck@enron.com
as suggested within the past few months by the technology group that all addresses use the long name
however
my e:mail address prior to that was sbeck@ect.enron.com
that was printed on my business cards
many of which are still in circulation i am sure
when ect became ena
i changed my e:mail address to drop the ect reference and to use my long name rather than sbeck
so i can see why you would receive my mail on occassion if someone is either making an educated guess on the address or referencing my old card
since there are at least 0 sbeck's here
have you thought about adopting use of your long name address rather than the shorter version to help in further differentiating between us
that might help eliminate confusion going forward
thanks for your note
sally
please forward to james scribner
he will call with his e:mail address
i can not attend as i will be in the london office for the remainder of the week
hope that all is well with you
we will have to catch up soon

sally
please distribute attached memo to all enron north america employees

thank you
sally beck vice president of energy operations
the draft of the memo looks good
however
your memo says that the memo will be sent to all us employees of ena
ena by definition includes canada and mexico
therefore
please send the memo to all ena employees
not just those in the us
several of those referenced in the memo as being promoted work in our calgary office
so the memo should certainly be sent to those employees in calgary
i am at x0 if you have any questions
friday won't work for me for lunch this week
but thursday is open for me at this point
would that day work for you
if lunch won't work
then we will plan some time on the calendar for thursday or friday
let me know
i will look forward to seeing you
thanks for keeping me posted on this
do let me know if there are further problems
friday at 0:0 pm
does that work for you
sally
please print a color copy of this for me
thanks
congratulations on your promotion to senior director
a promotion that is very well deserved
you do an amazing job of balancing children and work
and contributing so much on your work on 0
congratulations on your promotion to senior director
that makes all of the life juggling seem a little more worthwhile
doesn't it
congratulations on your promotion to senior director
a promotion that is very well deserved
i follow your career within enron with interest
i won't be able to join wanda and juanita in calgary next week
i will find myself in south america next week
in sao paolo and buenos aires
should be interesting
but a long flight
i am cross referencing my calendar with your vacation days
and i will get back with you later today on a suggested date for a trip north
fyi
i had included diane seib and melinda whalen
from calgary
in my promotion memo from energy operations
i believe that they both work under peggy hedstrom in operational roles
i am sure that they didn't mind having their names included twice in promotional memos
peggy says that you and juanita are headed to calgary next week
and she wondered if i would be coming
i will be in south america in what should be summer there
i do plan to make a trip to calgary soon
in addition to other things that peggy and i have to cover
i plan to host a happy hour in calgary to honor peggy's promotion and diane and melinda
also
i hosted a happy hour in houston for energy operations employees who were promoted last week
and i wanted to do the same thing for the three in calgary
approved
please process
thanks
sally beck

too
i look forward to the next one

perhaps a more manageable list
for this effort

just wanted to let you know that i have asked patti to do this

she will be out of town from march 0 through march 0
so i will have to come to calgary sometime after march 0

i will certainly get you a signed copy of the review as soon as i can
peggy hedstrom will be out of the office from march 0

our spring break week is march 0

she has a stack of all of the resumes that either i have received or those that responded to the posting
i hope to start interviewing next week
although i will only be in the office monday through wednesday
feel free to move forward with whatever you need to do
i trust that i will have several good candidates to consider
and patti is doing a great job
also
i need to find out if she would like to be considered for the fulltime position

kevin sweeney forwarded this message to me
fernley may have made you aware of his decision with tani when you and he talked yesterday
if not
i thought that you might be interested in this
sally
fyi
this should make things easier in london as there will be one point person to focus on global
i am not sure that her background will bring a lot to the table in the early stages
but she did seem sharp when i met with her last week
this announcement did surprise me a bit
as when i last talked with fernley he was not leaning in the direction of utilizing tani in this role
sally
i was forwarded a copy of fernley's announcement regarding your new role foglobal products trading support
your discussions in houston last week mushave swayed you to accept the challenges that are there
congratulations oyour new role
as you step into your new position
please let me know how i can best support you in my role over global risk management operations
i am forwarding a copy of the announcement regarding my expanded role that wassent out in january
assuming that you were not paying particular attentioto trading operations issues at that point in time
this may be one of those:mail messages that you skipped
i thought that it might be helpful for yto understand the focus that i will have in working with trading operationsgroups around the globe
i certainly will look forward to working with youtim and kevin
i understand that kevin will move into a role that is focused full-time onsystems implementation
who will assume the day-to-day lead responsibilityfor global products trading operations in houston and how will that individual report in to you
i will be in the london office during the week of march 0
i will leavehouston on sunday evening
so that i should be in the office by noon on monday
i plan to be there through thursday evening
let me know if youwill be in town that week
so that we can schedule some time together
sally
attached is a referral and resume on an hr professional that i thought might interest you
the referral comes from james scribner
a guy that has just accepted a job offer from me
james and i worked together previously at a bank
and he is very discerning in his evaluation of talent
when i asked if he knew of any other talented people at fleming
his current employer
that we should know
he immediately suggested tana
his read is that she is very bright
creative
and innovative
she has worked on many special projects at fleming
but james believes that she would certainly consider a generalist role as she learned enron and would then
earn
her way into managing special projects
i thought that i would give ena a first look at this candidate
if you are not interested or do not have a need
please pass this referral along to other hr groups
fyi
james will start work here on april 0
thanks for your homework on this
we will definitely take a look at these two places next week while we are in london
let us know what we need to do to schedule this
i look forward to meeting you
one of your earlier messages suggested meeting on monday morning
monday is great
but we would have to make that an afternoon meeting
brent and i will be on the flight that leaves houston at 0:0 pm on sunday evening
arriving at gatwick around 0:0 am
by the time we clear customs
take the train
check in to the hotel and shower
we will not be in the office before 0:0 or 0:0
do you have a time available to meet with us that afternoon
thanks
sally
we are working on the details of todd's accomodations
i view this as a business trip on which we are allowing him to bring his family
ena is picking up the cost associated with the family
sounds as if i need to make sure we moderate expectations on those accomodations
but we will get that handled
that is great that edith will be in london for part of todd's stay
your notes ask for astros tickets for wed
april 0th
monday is actually the 0th
wednesday is the 0th
the astros play st
louis on both of those days
both evening games
i would be happy to give you four tickets for either one of those games
just let me know whether you actually want the 0th or the 0th
we will definitely plan to get together while you are here in april
i would love to see jo as well
we will have to work the details
i am planning to be in london next week
arriving the morning of the 0th
monday
and staying through thursday
so we should see one another before april
i am working on an agenda right now for next week
so i will be back in touch within the next day or so to confirm some time with you there
sally
0pm sounds great
i will look forward to meeting you
have fun in san antonio
it is a very popular spring break destination
enjoy it
brent price and i will be in the london office next week
wanted to see if you
frank and mo might be available for dinner one evening
we arrive on monday morning
march 0th
and will return to houston on friday morning
our tuesday night is booked
having dinner with fernley
but monday
wednesday and thursday are available
does it work for you with the baby to do evenings
let me know
i have asked my assistant patti to help me in setting up meetings for next week and i had asked her to arrange a lunch with you and brent
plus some time for just the two of us to get together
we are continuing the worldwide operations/controls review at the request of the two rick's
causey and buy
that will include a look at continental power
uk power
uk gas and global products
looks as if sometime in april will be the date for that
however
not next week
sally
i didn't get a response from you regarding my e:mail that i sent last week
but i have heard through the grapevine that you will be making a trip to houston next week
my plans for being in london next week are firm
so it looks as if we will miss one another
my offer stands to help you in any way as you take on your new role
so i trust that you will take me up on that offer as needed
i will look forward to working with you as we develop common standards for operations worldwide
with effective exception reporting
this is a key initiative for 0 and will involve trading operations in all locations for all commodities
brent price and i will be in the london office next week
arriving monday morning and returning to houston on friday
the purpose of my visit is in regard to my global risk management operations role
i believe that rick causey met with you regarding some operations support that brent and i will provide to fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during the assimilation of michael jordan
the jp morgan staffer that fernley has hired
brent and i will be working with fernley next week to iron out the details of our support for fernley during that transition period
we will also map out an enron trading operations introduction for michael jordan
which may involve a short stint for him in houston
my goal is to provide a strong resource to fernley during this transition period and to work with fernley to provide whatever assistance
training
and orientation to michael in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as possible
another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with fernley and his business controllers to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we would commit to for 0
i know that barry and richard sage have many good ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all enron locations with trading operations
my earlier trips to london this year were focused solely on helsinki
and did not allow time to positively focus on leveraging worldwide operations experience
i value input from other trading operations professionals and i look forward to the ideas that can be generated in working with barry
richard and some of their direct reports
i also contacted tani nath about my trip to see how i could support her as she moves into her role in global products
i have not heard from tani
but i understand from others that she will be in the houston office next week
it will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip
but based on my commitments in houston and rick causey's desire to move forward on providing trading operations support to fernley
next week is the best for me to be in london
i did meet with tani for an hour when she was here week before last and offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role over global products
i trust that she will contact me for that support as needed
i have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while i am there to discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your business efforts in london
i look forward to meeting with you next week
this trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are conducting at joe sutton's request
by circumstance
as you know
we have taken a look at helsinki and subsequently oslo and frankfurt
there will be a similar review of continental power
uk gas
uk power and global liquids
the review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of north american locations and some entities in the us in which enron has a large ownership position
it is likely that the continuation of this effort in london will occur in mid april
copies of the drafts of the findings for oslo and frankfurt were provided to fernley as soon as the team returned to houston
we hope to finalise those drafts this week as we receive comments from fernley and the business managers in oslo and frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided
fernley suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final copies
so i will have those forwarded to you today
the sydney and singapore trip was a lengthy one
as it also involved a last leg of the trip in london with regard to support for singapore
the houston team returned the middle of last week and worked with aa on an early draft last friday
i can also provide you with a draft of that report
the completion of which was pending input from bill bradford early this week
he made the trip but was out of the office last week
we did do a preliminary review of the sydney and singapore findings with rick causey and rick buy on friday afternoon
to accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week
they understood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them
0
i just talked with scott earnest and asked him to send you and john sherriff copies of the lastest draft of the report on singapore
this draft now incorporates comments from bill bradford that were pending last week
he made the trip to sydney and singapore
but had to be in new york last week
meaning his imput was delayed until yesterday
you and john should receive those drafts today
0
i sent an e:mail message to john sherriff after you and i talked
simply to clarify the several purposes of my trip to london
since you said he was asking
i have scheduled a brief meeting one-on-one with him while i am there
0
to outline for you the primary points on my agenda for the week
they are the following
iron out with you the trading operations support that brent and i can provide for you during this transition period finalize details with tara rozen on work permits
accomodations and all of the details on having support personnel in london map out with you how we can provide training
orientation and contacts for michael jordan when he arrives to help make his assimilation a smooth one
which as you and i discussed
may involved a short stint in houston
meet with you
barry

from rac
operations and aa
i am in london this week and have picked up your message with the attachment
if you could let me know what it is that you are trying to do with this
then i will be glad to help you where i can
are you trying to create a job description to be used to search for a local candidate in japan
do you need a job description for internal purposes to create a position on the tokyo team
is this a job description that you want to use in discussions that we may have with eugenio perez in a start up role for the risk books
these three options would all require slightly different descriptions of the role
so it would be helpful to know how you will use this
please let me know and i will be glad to work on this for you

energy operations has two sets of season tickets for astros games this season
one set is four tickets in the field box level
and the other set is two tickets in the terrace level
i have also purchased one parking spot in a lot that is a couple of blocks from the stadium
i have divided the tickets among you
with my husband's help
he identified
good games
i.e
teams that everyone likes to see
and those are distributed equally across my direct reports
tickets for the other games have been distributed based your percentage of energy operations employees
for most games
you will receive all six tickets
you can use these tickets for yourself and for a small reward for a job well done by someone in your group
the parking information will accompany the group of four field box tickets
patti is including a map of downtown with the parking lot pinpointed
your tickets will be distributed to you this week
i hope that you and your staff will enjoy these
i also received over 0 tickets from cliff baxter
greg whalley and dave delainey for the exhibition game on saturday
april 0
i have chosen to distribute two tickets a piece to all directors and managers in energy operations who are not my direct reports
since you will have first call on the season tickets going to your group
i thought that it would be nice to make these tickets available to the next tier of leadership
i wanted to make you aware of this before these are distributed tomorrow
finally
i have purchased a block of tickets for two upcoming games
one a weekday afternoon and one a weekend
i will let you know these dates soon
as i would like for my direct report group to join me at these games
do you know what this is
iso makes me think power
any clues
sally
per my voice mail message
attached is a draft memo regarding brent's role in london
any comments would be appreciated
fernley and i plan to send this out sometime next week
prior to brent's assignment starting on april 0
glad you enjoyed the game
that was quite a climb to those seats
i did it a couple of times with my two year old in arms
and wasn't sure that i would make it
that's good that you could watch from a lower level
sally
below is an announcement that was sent to employees within enron europe todfrom fernley dyson and me
most of you have probably become aware of theassignment that brent will have over the next few months in london
we anticipate that he will be back in the houston office by the end of the second quarter
i thought that you would like to see how we have describedthe role that he will play in london
brent will retain his current role within north america
and will be conducting his houston staff meetings via conference call from london
susan harrison and steve jackson will play leadership roles for his gas team whilhe is in london
susan with a focus on operations and steve with a focus orisk and interfacing with jeff shankman's on daily p&l and position information
needs
please wish brent well in this additional assignment in london
i would asthat you help defeat the
out of sight
out of mind
syndrome
and that youkeep brent informed of ena issues as you would if he were in town
via e:mail or telephone
also
please work closely with susan and steve when you aredealing with issues that cut across commodity lines
susan will be attending the monday afternoon staff meeting
glad you enjoyed the game
it was certainly a panoramic view from up there
i am that you continue to be pleased with your decision to come to enron
and i am certainly glad that you are here
i will look forward to meeting you during your visit to houston next week
i will work with carol to schedule a time that will work for both of us
have a nice flight
sally
we interviewed the 0 finalists in austin yesterday
interviewers were gene humphrey
thomas suffield
roger ondrecko and me
the four of us met this morning in houston to decide on our suggested scholarship receipients
based on my conversation with sue white yesterday in austin
i called her today with the names of the three suggested award winners
i conveyed this via voice mail
as sue was not in her office
she had told me that her schedule would be tight today
so it is likely that she and i will talk tomorrow morning
she wanted to be able to discuss our recommendations
i would not anticipate any changes as a result of my pending conversation with sue
however
i think that it will be best to withhold the names of the recepients until after that conversation
she will most likely then contact you to confirm their names
i have phone numbers
addresses and e:mail addresses for all three
and i will provide you with those as soon as the official notification from the university takes place
gene
thomas and roger are all interested in attending the dinner in austin if schedules permit
the week of april 0th is a good one for me for the dinner
obviously
many schedules have to be coordinated
i know that rick causey will want to attend
he will have been in london the week prior
so he may be available
i have also talked with cindy olson and i know that she would like to be included if her schedule permits
today was brent's last day in the houston office for several months
let me know how i can help with these arrangements
enron north america corp
i already have this date on my calendar
count me in
sally
glad you enjoyed the game
the field will make baseball much more fun in houston
energy operations will enjoy participating in this program
i would like to bring this us up at my staff meeting on monday
april 0
so i will get back to you with the number of students and the contact person
s
next week
sally
i have asked patti to get us together to discuss your e:mail message as soon as possible
hopefully
we can work that out this week
i llok forward to talking with you and i will be glad to help you in any way that i can
the scholarships
while sponsored by enron
are technically awarded by ut
i will be talking with sue white today
and i will get her take on whether or not the university wants to contact the winners or whether enron should do it
i will let you know
the 0th is a great day for me for the dinner in austin
so if that works for recepients and faculty
then that would work our well
keep me posted
sally enron north america corp
fall sounds good to me
in talking with sue today
she stated that dr
rao would like to inform the winners of the scholarships by letter from him and that it will most likely be another week before he does so
i asked her to contact me when the letter is going out to the students so that we can follow up with either a letter or phone call from some of us at enron
i will keep rick causey
the other interviewers and you
or someone in your office
updated on the timing of notifying the winners
sally enron north america corp
willie harrell security request approved
sally beck
thanks for the update
i am glad that you and fernley were able to get together
let me know what you hear from mark or tim about their discussion
when that is set
i will put out a memo that outlines the changes that we are making as scott pleus devotes full time to ebs
hope your weekend was a good one
have you seen brent yet
sally
approved
sally beck system would not allow me to submit request electronically
please incorporate the management contact changes per sheila glover for the 0 plan
i tried to call you back today
but was told that you had left the office
tried to leave you a voice mail message
but no one in the office knew how to transfer my call into voice mail
they were good about answering your phone
however
i will call you tomorrow morning before my first meeting at 0:0
if i miss you
i will ask my assistant to interrupt me when you call back
i will be in meetings with operations people from london and sydney tomorrow
but can easily step out to talk with you
we would love to see all three of you
sounds as if you might arrive on friday around 0:0 or 0:0
so we will plan on dinner together
you can see the kitchen in progress
the upstairs is untouched
however
so you can make yourselves at home
i will let everyone know tonight
and they will all be glad to see you
i haven't talked with cara since the weekend
so i didn't know that she might change her plans
i will try to catch her tonight
just let me know on the $'s
i can send that whenever you might need it
and i would suggest that we start a repay program after another few months as you all get caught up on other things
no rush
love
sally
please incorporate these changes into the 0 plan
thanks
i do know susan so i could probably approve this request
however
in my staff meeting on monday
i know that katherine was there
and not you
one of the major points that i made centered around my approval of requests for eol access
we can discuss when we get together on friday morning
susan needs to put her managers name at the bottom of this form
and the manager should okay this as well
sally
approved
sally beck
i read the applications
letters of recommendation and resumes on the plane to austin and in the hospital this weekend
below are my suggested seven appointees to the analyst advisory board
i made the selections based on their answers to the application questions
plus i attended to get a mix of male and female
commercial and merchant service analysts rotations
current operating company assignments
undergraduate schools
etc
i am sorry that i will not be able to join you in the meeting today
analyst school current rotation rationale ilan caplan ut calme structuring both msa and commercial analyst rotations erin rice trinity calme structuring vocal

diverse background courtney votaw pepperdine corp
pr adds interest to the mix with her rotation
background adrian woolcock rice ees sounds mature
good ideas
kim
sally says that wes colwell will be assigning ena representative
patti
we did talk about the creation of these new positions within gas support
i have also discussed this at length with brent
and agree that the shift of manager positions to front to back looks across each region
eliminating the oa and deal validation manager roles
makes sense
upon the recommendation of susan and brent
i am comfortable with appointing jeff gossett as the manager of the west region
charlene
outlined below are the points i promised to send you before our meeting on wednesday morning
i don't know your agenda for the meeting
so it may or may not be appropriate to discuss all of these items tomorrow
background
as a long-time supporter of the analyst program
i became concerned over the last several months as frustration emerged from other supporters of the program
many of those expressing frustration are heavily involved in the recruiting process
it is their commitment to both recruiting and providing analyst rotations that has been key in attracting talented candidates to what has been the merchant services analyst program
i initiated a meeting
announced at rick causey's staff meeting
that would bring us together so that we could consolidate our concerns and then discuss them with you in a constructive manner
our intent is continued support and improvement of the program
the meeting took place on march 0 and included the following
brenda herod ena
energy operations executive lead
lsu brent price ena
energy operations executive lead
ut jeff sommers calme executive lead
univsersity of florida ed coats corp
tax core team member
ut
a&m
lsu and university of florida sally beck ena
energy operations executive lead
ut and ou carolyn barrett ebs howard selzer enron global e&p summary of concerns and discussion points
one program
or two
prior to campus recruiting in the fall 0
an announcement was made that there would be one analyst program
not much materialized from that point to clarify what that meant or how that would be managed
in fact
those of us involved heavily in the recruiting process saw that the msap and the commercial anlayst programs were managed separately and differently in terms of campus recruiting
rotations and orientation
we feel uninformed and therefore are hampered in discussing the analyst program on campus
single start date
the single start date of july 0 for analysts is impractical and inflexible
a concern from our points of view for an innovative company
the july start date does not consider december graduates and is not necessarily practical for undergrads whose graduation dates are in may
lack of communication
we are some of the most involved and committed senior managers in the msap
and yet we have received little information or communication about the program
we hear rumors of
tracks
but no facts or details
some of us had heard about the single july start date
and some had not
commercial focus too heavy
presentation materials
the attitudes of support staff in the associates/analysts program and interview processes are heavily focused on commercial needs
without understanding support needs
lack of input from biggest supporters
given the time and effort that many of us put into the msap
we are concerned that we haven't been asked to join with you in some of your plans for the program
we are concerned that decisions
example
the single start date
are being considered in a vacuum without what could be some valuable input from some of us
msap has taken a step backward
previously
with a dedicated leadership team and staff
the msap had made great strides in the consistency of our on campus efforts
the quality of candidates
the acceptance rate of top candidates and the pride of participants in the program
we feel that the focus on the msap has diminished considerably over the last nine months
and we are anxious to work with you to renew excitment for the program
summary concerns/discussion points

sally beck
sounds like a good idea
i am glad to theresa is getting some benefit from the program
sally
sounds interesting
and scottsdale is supposed to be nice
enjoy
do you want to give your tickets to someone in your group and join the management team
up to you
enron north america corp
you have a ticket
we will see you there
with you pager on
patti will get your ticket to you before thursday
i would enjoy being involved in the kickoff for the first gas ops program
keep me posted on date and time
thanks for attending the meeting yesterday
i hope that you will let me know when and how i can best be involved and provide support for your efforts
sally
thanks for your note
between meetings today
i will construct a loose job description and e:mail that to you later today
i realized after you left that we did not talk about compensation
it would help me in creating this role with our hr group if i knew ballpark figures on compensation
we have a good comp team that can research that for me
but a short cut would be to know from you what you are currently making and what you would be looking for in making a move
feel free to call me or respond via e:mail
my number is 0-0-0
sally
tara
when i tried to approve this request
sheri gave verbal approval
i got message that it had already been approved by another access approver
patti
we will look forward to seeing you in rick causey's cao staff meeting on may 0th at 0:0 in eb0c0
i listened to your voice mail message
thanks for the clarification around the recruiting process for one analyst program
my dad was released from the hospital on saturday
following what seemed like a very long ten day stay
he lost a lot of weight while being fed only by iv for 0 of those days
so he is under orders to eat everything in sight
hopefully
this most recent operation will result in overall better health for him going forward
thanks for asking
sally
it is hard for me to say how this would work on behalf of all of my direct reports
sometimes it is tough to have all assistants out at once
to meet at 0:0
you all would have to leave around 0:0
which could be early in the day for some groups to lose assistants
would it work to start a little later in the afternoon
if before 0:0
i think that all assistants will have to check with their managers on the convenience of an earlier departure time
sally enron north america corp
barry sent me a copy of the draft memo announcing his role within ebs
since scott pleus is currently in that role and does have people reporting to him in ebs that are in trading operations
i would suggest that the memo contain a mention of the transition
example
scott pleus is currently director of trading operations for ebs
he will be transitioning to an origination role within ebs in mid may as barry pearce assumes his responsibilities for ebs
the current trading staff for ebs will report to barry effective with his start date in may
i also heard from barry today that todd lindholm let him know that he is out of the picture with regard to commercial support for bandwidth trading operations and that barry will report to john echols
so sounds as if that is clarified
glad you sent a note
as crazy as life is at our house right now
i did not get the message from tammy
lots of catch up in the office last week
which will continue this week
i think that chris is home by now
and i am sure that you and erica are glad to have the additional company
we are starting to talk birthday with meagan now
i will get back with you in a couple of days after meg and i have gone through the ja catalogue
thanks for asking
sally
have fun in wharton
remember that hines bbq is the best bet in town
leave room for the pie
let's review calendars so that we can pin point a time for you or you and chris to visit
i will keep that date confidential
so that it will be reserved for you
sally
did you mean to have an attachment to this e:mail
there was not one attached
hope your long weekend was a good one
uneventful on monday
at least
got your message last friday
it seems as if kristin is more and more interested in the ebs role
especially after her continuing discussions with jim fallon
the timing of her trip to london is somewhat up in the air
may be the end of this week
may be next week
i think it will still be good for you and kristin to talk in person
kristin and todd are both very qualified and you would love working with both
kristin's established working relationship with jim fallon would definitely be a plus
i don't want to lose both of them from ena
however
at the same time
so i would suggest that we make it an either or propostion
i got your message on housing/location in houston
i am headed out of the office soon for an offsite meeting hosted by ena's office of the chairman
i will call you on friday when i am back in the office and talk through some options on housing
i gave a copy of this document to wes colwell immediately following last week's meeting with a note that he needed to respond to you
he is the most appropriate respondent from ena
sally
i understand that ashley worthing has been hired by enron to start work this summer
i think that she is graduating from texas a&m
she is my cousin's daughter
so i am just curious whether or not she is coming in as an analyst
please let me know if that is the case
thanks
fyi
sounds as if we can't delay tom's residence in the flat any longer
we have pushed the date several times
if there are some other delays
you may want to consider flying back with your family back to houston
and then returning on your own to finish the project
you could stay in a hotel from that time period
what do you think
can we assure tom that you will be out of the flat by the 0th of may
sally
fyi
let's talk
i am already booked for tuesday am
could you attend and would you want to
let's talk before getting back to margaret
sally
you have the right earrings
they are tiny
but that's what she would like
she will be really pleased
she loves her silver ones
but they are not great for everyday wear
gold is better for her ears
sounds as if your weekend was fun
ours was nice
errands and stuff on saturday and the enron picnic at astroworld on sunday
otherwise
just camping out in the mess at our house
i did talk with mom on saturday night about a psychologist vs
psychiatrist
sounds as if from her er buddy at the heart hospital that she has decided that they need both
one for counseling and one for meds
i believe that she and dad will each see a counselor type on tuesday this week
i hope that they will begin to find some relief
sounds as if they are really having a hard time
at least mom
we would still like for you to come visit
let's talk dates when you're ready
sally
he has been focused on sitara for a long time
he reports to scott mills
who is the user lead for the project
i am copying scott on this message
as his sitara team is small and he would know best what deliverables are on the horizon and how critical tom's involvement is to those deliverables
i suggest that we involve scott in these discussions
sally
stephen joined enron on january 0

is there any other info that you need
are you still planning to be in houston next week

please print the attachment for me in color
maybe three copies
thanks
amanda is at camp from sunday
may 0 until saturday
june 0
then meagan leaves on sunday
june 0 and will return on saturday
june 0
if we decide to do a family vacation
it would be either the week of june 0
july 0 or july 0
after that
meagan starts bearkadette practices through school start in august
with a few days at bearkadette camp july 0-0
looks as if we will have one girl or the other with us at any point during the summer
unless amanda schedules her austin visit during one of meagan's two stints at camp
let me know when you want to talk dates
i made the assumption when you said that jim fallon had said that kristin's name was
in play
that he and kristin had coordinated a transition with kevin presto that made him comfortable
at an ena offsite meeting on wednesday and thursday last week
i talked with kevin during a break to see if was comfortable with kristin's number two as his risk lead
unfortunately
kevin knew nothing about this
so rather than discuss the transition
kevin had to react to and absorb this as a possibility
he had some very valid business reasons as to why kristin's movement over the summer months would be risky for ena
you and i can discuss those if you would like
his reaction was not
never
but instead was
not now
he and kristin talked on friday and agreed to a transition in mid august
let's discuss
sally
below is the name and phone number of the woman that i worked with to arrange our tour of enron field
she may not be the person to talk with regarding displaying a boat
but will very likely be able to give the correct contact
it was nice to meet you
i have enjoyed getting to know bethany through ncl
good luck
jill mccormick
i heard this morning from susan harrison that sandra had submitted a letter of resignation to bryce baxter
who reports to susan
i have not talked directly with bryce and i have not seen the resignation letter to date this afternoon
i have left a message for bryce and i will get with him on tuesday morning to see a copy of the letter and then can leave you a message after that
sally
i am sorry that i will not be able to join you tonight for dinner and to hear julie andrews speak
tonight is the induction ceremony for the high school drill team members for next year
with parents being introduced as well as our daughters
so the place that i most need to be tonight is at klein high school with meagan
thanks to mary for arranging the dinner
i hope that all of you enjoy the evening
the final speaker in the series is jane goodall
and that will be next tuesday
may 0
please let me know if you have any suggestions for a spot for dinner
that night is meagan's 0th birthday
so i have asked her to be my guest that evening for dinnner and the lecture
i can't think of a better idea for this birthday than to expose her to a group of very bright
motivated women
i will look forward to introducing her to those of you whom she has not yet met
well done
beth will be a great resource
sally
this makes great sense
glad to have you as a true ena resource
thanks again for meeting with my expanded staff yesterday
let me know how i can best support you as you make the changes that you outlined
i was impressed with my brief glimpse of jeff at yesterday's 0:0 meeting
sally
congratulations on your new role as chief strategy officer
your leadership in ena was appreciated and i will miss your active participation in ena's business
however
i hope that we will have opportunities to work together in the future
sally
congratulations on your added role of chairman and ceo of ena
i didn't realize that when i said hello in the elevator last week that we would be seeing more of you in houston
i look forward to working with you when you arrive
congratulations on your added role of ceo for enron europe
i look forward to continuing to work with you and the staff in london on risk management operations initiatives
i talk with brent price several times a week
i know that fernley has appreciated his participation in london
and i hope that you have found his involvement to be beneficial as well
we are almost at the half way mark on his assignment
so i will talk with you next week when i return from calgary to get your input on his role to date
mary
as brent price is out of the country until july
i am travelling out of the country more frequently
i would like to temporarily designate susan harrison as a signer
susan is the director of our off-system settlements
volume management groups
this temporary designation will ensure that we maintain appropriate signing coverage while brent
i are unavailable
thanks
sally
irena
can you attach file
patti enron north america corp
thanks for the reminders
hopefully
this will take care of this
thanks for the update and attachment
it will be great to have you back here in houston
i have heard lots of good things about your assignment there
however
so i know that the london group will miss your presence
i will try to call you wednesday morning on my way into the office
i
approved
please process
sally beck
sounds as if you will have a full day on monday
i am glad that you are eager to get together to kick off your role
we will have to save that for tuesday
however
i am taking the day off on monday to be with my parents who will be in from austin for one of my daughter's piano recital
0:0 to 0:0 on tuesday would be a great time for us to get together
there are two other meetings that day that i would like to have you attend with me
one is a weekly risk forum luncheon from 0:0 to 0:0 and the other is a meeting at 0:0 on trading operations for tokyo
i will give the details on location and list of attendees when you and i meet on tuesday morning
enjoy your next few days
i hope that orientation is helpful on monday
check with my assistant
patti thompson
on where you will be sitting
i look forward to seeing you on tuesday
sally
i agree that discussing the numbers in person with aa would be the right way to handle this
and
i am looking to brent in managing the current reconciliation process so he can best address the timing of the meeting
my expectation is that the vast majority of the $0mm variance will be explained and finalized by monday at 0:0 am
this finalization obviously involves both the gas operations group and gas accounting
i will be on vacation on monday while my parents are in town for a visit
but i have carved out time during the day at 0:0 to be in the office for an update on the reconciliation
as it is very important to me
sally
lunch probably won't work in that time frame
i will be out on vacation on monday
tuesday's lunch is a standing risk forum meeting and wednesday i will be out of the office during the lunch hour for a school function for one of my daughters
i will check with ted murphy on the tuesday risk forum meeting
as occassionally the meeting is cancelled
i will get back in touch if the tuesday lunch does open up
would amita like to meet at another time during those days
there is a possibility that i could do an early dinner on tuesday evening
how does that work with amita's schedule
sally
fyi
let me know who angelic will report to and what she will be doing
thanks
according to records from the analysts program
the following interns will be working within energy operations during the summer
the assignment stated below is as reflected in the program's spreadsheet
name school start date assignment luna carlson university of florida july 0 ena
risk reporting and analysis joshua koenig university of florida may 0 energy operations
gas operations management jolly jose university of houston june 0 energy operations
gas operations management michael taylor lsu may 0 central desk logistics daniel graham morehouse may 0 ena
financial settlements angelique woods university of texas may 0 ena
risk management first
please respond to me today and let me know to whom the analyst will be reporting and what their responsibilities will be for the summer
hopefully none of this is a surprise and the appropriate arrangements have been made for desk
phone and computers for all
secondly
please make a point of seeking out these interns and welcoming them to enron
finally
after i know where these analysts are placed
we will have a brief meeting with the analysts
managers and any of you under whom they will be working to discuss ideas on making the analysts assignments meaningful this summer
i welcome ideas on this from any of you
my new employee who will be working with me on global standards for operations for all trading/origination locations started with enron yesterday
her name is shona wilson
and i do not know her extension
she was in orientation yesterday
and i will be meeting with her today from 0:0 to 0:0 to discuss her initial assignments
of which working with india is one
i will have her contact you later today
although she is new to enron
she has had extensive experience with price waterhouse coopers in internal audit
controls and process redesign for trading firms
both in the us and in europe
she will work with other seasoned professionals on my team to set up the infrastructure that is needed in india
sally
i have this on my calendar for september 0 and i am looking forward to it
thanks
i have signed up for june 0st
there is no indication on the e:mail that you forwarded of the location for the focus group
i assume that more details will follow
congratulations on the new role
i think that it will be an interesting challenge and that you will do a great job
how soon do you start
sally
fyi
i believe that shona will prove to be a great asset to enron
we are following up on her leads for talent
sally
i asked my new hire to suggest names of people that she knows that would be good for to consider hiring
here is her response
tony vasut had called her and asked for this list as well
do you have him keyed in on our blitz effort for hiring of risk personnel
or is he working on some other initiative
i have not reviewed the names nor shona's comments in detail yet
but i wanted to pass these along for inclusion in our efforts
sally
per my voice mail
somehow my intent to copy you on this didn't work
shona's extension is 0 and she is sitting on the 0th floor
sally
please print for me on legal size paper
thanks
i assume that granting access for someone for whom lorraine becker is the supervisor should be approved by you
i get hundreds of these
many for employees outside energy operations
thanks
sally
ditto
scott's name is not familiar to me and the only person from my group who is in the london office now is brent price
i looked up scott's name on our enron people finder
and it would appear that he is in the it department
i assume that he is someone who is on assignment in the uk
so i would suggest that you contact beth perlman in houston who leads it for ena or talk with mark pickering in it in london
my role in houston is over the trading operations groups
but does not include it
i wish that i could answer your specific question for you
but i think that referring you to it will get you the answer that you need
happy anniversary
i hope to leave the office soon and am planning to call you to wish you that over the phone on my way home
not much unpacking yet
our main focus up until sunday morning was getting amanda ready for camp
there was still a good bit of painting going on this week
so this weekend i do hope to get quite a bit unpacked
we got our first letter from amanda yesterday
and it sounds as if she is having fun
said that she was homesick and missed us
but was not sad
has some of the same girls in her cabin that she had last summer
i plan to shop this weekend for your birthday gift for amanda
as we discussed
she will have a continuation of her birthday when she gets back home next weekend
so by the end of the weekend i should be able to give a total for gifts for both girls
love
sally

that meeting was about my 0th of the day that began at 0:0
and that was day three of the week with that kind of scheduling
i apologize if i seemed impatient in the meeting
i know that you are working for the best interests of energy operations and enron
by the end of the day i was probably looking for crisp
clear solutions to an issue that probably doesn't lend itself well to that
why don't we set up a lunch so that you and i can have the opportunity to talk separate from immediate issues at hand
i will have patti get a date on the calendar
sally enron north america corp
i did walk out of the room with the two booklets
employee profiles and pre-review rankings
that had been distributed
and i left a message with sheila knudsen as soon as i got back to my office on wednesday night to let her know
they were delivered to sheila on thursday morning
can you verify that sheila received those from me
thanks
sally
please pring attached presentation for me in color
thanks
my trading operations team
under the leadership of mary solmonson
is sponsoring a working session on thursday and friday
june 0 and 0 in the ballroom at the rice
mary leads the team that manages global databases
our global contract
counterparty and facilities databases that create the common platform that facilitates the consolidation of information for credit aggregation
risk exposure
customer information
feeds to sap for financial reporting
etc
in addition to managing these databases
mary has harnessed information from these databases in a new way to create an effective prospecting tool for use by originators and traders
this tool can help measure and increase coverage by industry segments
this project
entelligence
has been endorsed by greg whalley and jeff shankman and is currently under development for delivery later this quarter
we invite you to speak to the group of enron employees from offices worldwide who will attend the working session next week
please let me know if you are interested and if june 0 or june 0 fits your schedule
thanks for considering this speaking opportunity
i didn't know about this one
i'm going to follow up with brent on this one and i will get back to you in a day or so
we'll save the scott mills discussion for a later date
on another note
i enjoyed lunch today
let me know when you want to get out of the building again sometime
sally
i didn't know that you were talking to jennifer
i had put her on the list of attendees at last thursday's meeting with tom gros
he had asked about someone being included that had been involved with enron online
i felt that she might be perfect to be involved in networks with her exposure to eol
i don't know whether or not you realized that she was in the room for that conference call
what is she going to do for you in gas
we may be hardpressed to find another strong candidate for the networks project who has been as involved with eol
sally
we have lunch scheduled for june 0
according to my calendar
i am looking forward to it
sally enron north america corp
we willl consider that a rain check
just let know in a cooler month when you will be around and i know that david will make his schedule work to play
separately
i didn't get time to speak with you individually when i was in calgary the last time
if you have a few minutes amidst the sap training while you are in houston
i would love to visit face to face to hear from your perspective how your interactions with my houston operations group are going and to see you have any suggestions on areas of improvement
just give me a call at x0
sally
scott earnest announced in the staff meeting today that in a meeting he had earlier today with jeff shankman and vince kaminiski that jeff announced that he had gotten the nod from mark frevert to manage the lng book of business
this sentence structure is bad
but you get the drift
that is probably what shankman has alluded to in terms of increased responsibility
i will assume that is in addition to gas
but i don't know that for sure
scott has been working on setting up the risk books for lng
working closely over the last several weeks with vince kaminski
we need to talk about this business and the best way to support it
have you had any conversations with jeff on this
i got the memo from naomi that you sent
first
who is doug imrie
does he have a strong background in trading operations
will he be able to coordinate effective reviews from a controls perspective
and will he be able to be the front-runner on how mg runs its business so that we will get a jump start on how best to assimilate the business
i think that this effort should be much broader than deal testing
it should encompass assessing people
processes
controls
systems support
etc
to do this quickly and effectively will require persons who are knowledgeable about daily trading operations
i don't know naomi's background
but i wonder if she will be the right person to lead one of these efforts since she does not work in operations on a daily basis
patrick conner left me a message today to be certain that we are plugged in with an appropriate team from ena to review the chicago and new york offices
from the sound of naomi's memo
it looks as if andy cornfield is assume to have the us responsibility
again
i don't know andy
should we circle the wagons and develop a plan for doorstep reviews that includes some others in the process
particularly those that have been involved in some doorstep reviews to date and those that have daily operational experience
i have also mentioned shona as a good resource as well
i hope that your holiday was wonderful
nikki told me that you would be working from home today
but i decided not to bother you there
i will try to have patti connect me with you during my commute on tuesday morning
i start with a 0:0 meeting
houston time
so i should be in my car from 0:0 to about 0:0
i let nikki know about a rescheduled date from rick's prc last week
i don't think that there had been any widespread communication about the new date of june 0
will you still plan to come to houston next week
i have scheduled dinner for us on wednesday evening
assuming that you will still make the trip
just let me know
will you also be back for the meeting on june 0
before you left for vacation i had tried to reach you regarding the mg acquisition
that should make life fun for you
i wanted to talk about resources and how i might be able to help in both the further due diligence efforts and longer term in the assimilation
as in my voice mail
i believe that a doorstep review of trading locations would be critical
both from a controls perspective and from the perspective of an up close view of how they run their business
it seems that might help jump start the plans around how best to assimilate the business
i had suggested my new hire
shona wilson
as a potential resource and then there are several of us who have already been involved in doorstep reviews that could be involved both in the us and in other locations
brent has forwarded a memo to me from naomi connell who seems to be formulating a plan for the doorstep reviews
i don't know the names that she mentions
other than tani nath
and i am sure that she is unaware of additional resources from houston that could be used
we can hopefully talk about that tomorrow morning
i interviewed analyst/associate candidates in the office on saturday
as did four other directors/senior directors from energy operations
i completed the evaluations of the four candidates that i interviewed and submitted those
but was unable to stay for the decision meeting after lunch due to commitments to attend a funeral
i talked with ted bland this morning and he suggested that i provide you with a list of candidates that could be a fit in energy operations
analysts tara piazze
potential fit in one of my risk management operations teams joseph piotrowski
aa consulting background
would be a good fit for my operations team focused on eol
these are ena employees
i need to add more strength to this group charles ames
currently works in back office for a brokerage firm
wants to trade
would like to have him in risk to learn the business and enron's risk books
we could immediately benefit from his background
while he learns enron and how we manage risk
then he could add even more value in moving to a trading role
if appropriate better fits as direct hires
not analyst or associate
based on work experience and fit
mike perun
vp of small bank
ted brought him in with my group in mind
two of my directors interviewed him on saturday
we'd like to consider him as a direct hire jason sukenik
undergrad and masters degrees in accounting
plus mba
could be good fit as direct hire in as manager/director based on experience associates ryan ngo
i believe that kevin presto suggested him for my group adele pickens
she's on my list
need to research interviewers comments who suggested my group for an assignment for her
i don't think that anyone from energy operations interviewed him or her
jennifer bagwell
apparently remarked to two interviewers that she did not want to trade
would like to see if there is a fit for her in managing risk or operations let me know about next steps in this process
i would be glad to talk about any of this in more depth
i left a voice mail message for dave delainey this morning asking for clarification around the lng business
as soon as i hear back from him i will let you know
and then based on that info we can decide on best next steps
we will look forward to seeing you on the 0th
glad we could work out a date
thanks for confirming mark's participation
mary solmonson
one of my direct reports
will be sending information to your attention on the following
specifics on location of meeting at rice hotel attendee list
names
titles
operating companies
brief background on mary solmonson's global database management group suggested talking points for mark's talk agenda for the meeting we will be sure to get this informaiton to you by friday of this week
so that you can provide mark with a copy when he is in the london office on monday
thanks for your help--sally
i meant to send this to you
sally
thanks for the info on your trip
have a great time
i will be anxious to hear about the presentation in natchez
love
sally
buried with shankman today
i will e:mail you tomorrow
hi
mike
it is almost 0 pm houston time as i am reading your message
so my hope is that you have already headed home today
i would love to visit with you
would it work for us to talk at 0 am
0 pm london time
on friday
another good time for us to talk my be during my commute into the office
i would expect to be in my car from about 0:0 to 0:0 am
houston time
tomorrow
my car phone number is 0-0-0
a few weeks ago i put together a list of key individuals for you to meet when you do come to houston
once you have scheduled a trip
my offer still stands to set up these meetings for you
it may be easier for my assistant to coordate these things in houston than for you assistant to attempt that from london
given the time difference
i will look forward to speaking with you
i understand that your value in the office is already felt
sally
approved
please process
thanks
sally beck
i will be out of the office after noon on friday
june 0
headed to the hill country to pick up one of my daughters from camp
i will not attend the friday afternoon meeting
you will be able to reach me on my cell phone
0-0-0
as needed during the afternoon
this reporting tool looks very useful
i am glad to know that you are managing with this on a regular basis
do we have a well-defined follow-up process to ensure that the outstanding confirms do go out soon
this is a great tool to share with other groups that are doing confirmations
it would be nice to have a standard format that all groups would use to track this
have you shared this with other groups within energy operations that are doing confirmations
i would include global products as well
sally
i am not close enough to know bob's exact role within the group to know the impact of the prospect of losing him
i am forwarding this to brent to get his assessment of the impact
i do know that the number of deals that we do currently has skyrocketed with eol
so i feel sure that the group is stretched right now
again
though
brent would best be able to address this
as you are probably aware
i personnally made the commitment to bob several years ago to help in managing his workload so that he is available as needed at home for his wife
for bob's sake
i would want to make sure that he is in a situation where that is understood and appreciated
thank you for contacting me first before going to bob
sally
they all made me laugh out loud
i am glad that they all were able to get up
thanks
i have heard through the grapevine that you produce a weekly status report on the mg aquisition and assimilation
would you please include me on that distribution list effective this week
i believe that it is assumed that fernley dyson will have day-to-day responsibility for this business once the aquisition is completed
however
in my role over global risk management operations
i find myself fielding questions regarding our assessment of operations and any issues surrounding assimilation
brent price
who reports to me and is on temporary assignment in the london office
has been keeping me updated on progress to date
his return soon to houston
however
will create a potential information gap that the weekly status report may help to fill
thanks in advance to your attention to this
bob is a good
solid player
he won't change the world
but he is diligent about getting a prescribed job done
i personally like bob a lot
and am very interested in making sure that he is in the right role for him
his wife has ms in its most severe stages
he was a manager previously
and we jointly made the decision to reclassify him as a senior specialist in order to reduce the expectations on him in his role at work
he needs to be able to leave work at a very reasonable hour each day in order to relieve a caregiver who is with his wife while he works
i made a personnal commitment to him to make sure that his work load would allow a reasonable and predictable end to his work day
and as long as he is in my group i will personally make sure that works for him
i would hope for him that if he ever considered a change that a new boss would be able to do the same
danny contacted me about bob
more from the standpoint of asking me what impact it would have on gas if he moved
i suggested that brent would be better able to address that
i did tell danny that the onslaught of eol transactions has been a challenge for gas confirmations
and i am sure that they are not long on people
i assume that danny is following up with brent
sally
thanks for the offer
i will take you up on it
can you get a list of recent ou grads hired at enron
i have the list of summer interns from ou
i thought that i would invite both full time and summer interns to the cookout
i am looking at sunday
july 0th as possibly the best date
probably starting about 0:0 in the afternoon
how does that date work for you
i assume that summer interns will still be with us then
what is your opinion on dates/friends to accompany you
david will of course be there
and mike mcconnell and his wife will be there if the date works for them
we can make this work either way
do you think that people would prefer to bring someone along
or simply attend solo
i will take your suggestion on this one
after you get me the list of ou full timers
i will combine it with the list that i have of summer interns and we can make sure that it looks complete
thanks for the help
sally
enjoy the time off
just let us know when that week comes who your in charge person will be
sally enron north america corp
thanks for your front-end research on this
it's too bad that the training provider can't be as responsive
in a trading organization
0 to 0 months is an eternity
sounds as if they are inflexible as well
our audience for this training would be risk book adminstrators and traders
so 0 days away from the desk is not very workable either
after i get over my irritation at timing and inflexibility
i may want to book them for september
although with a much smaller audience than would be desireable if they insist on sticking to their 0 day method of delivery
could i get an outline of their 0 day course to review in order to make this decision
thanks
sally
thanks for the response
i will look for your list so that i can send out invitations
sally
looks as if this date will work for mike mcconnell and his wife
too
i thought that i might also invite ted jacobs if he plans to be in houston that weekend
do you have an e:mail address for him
thanks
i know that amanda will enjoy seeing you next week
thanks for making some time for her
let's definitely schedule a return trip for the two of you with some golf/cart time
ugh
i am happy for you
but know that enron will be losing as you leave
i am pleased that the opportunity at reliant is an exciting one for you
and i know that you will do a great job
it has been fun to work with you
ginger
and i too will miss that
best of luck to you
sally
fyi
this came as a surprise to me
didn't know whether or not you knew about ginger's departure
sally
thanks for the update
i want to send her some flowers at the house
can you let patti know if she is headed home on friday
thanks
sally

he will serve as the executive lead for our continuing recruiting efforts at two other enron employees will join us for lunch
james scribner

i think that we have lunch coming up on the calendar on july 0
i look forward to catching up then
sally
let's book friday
july 0 for this lunch
i will work on further details
thanks
sharron
it is too late in the day in london for me to catch you by phone today
i will call you tomorrow and would like to throw out an idea regarding an on-going resource for operations in london
if you are comfortable with my idea
then i can discuss it in person with fernley while he is here this week
we have time on the calendar plus dinner this week
since receiving your e:mail message last monday on your needs in power
i have spent three
full days in prc meetings since then
i have shared your needs with both todd hall and kristin albrecht
my power business controller here in houston
and have gotten their thoughts on how we could be of help
sorry that i keep missing your calls
i will be meeting with fernley
but i will also try to reach you by phone tomorrow
there are five summer interns and six recent full-time hires from ou that i will invite to the cookout at my house on sunday
july 0th
i asked jody's opinion on whether or not they would like to bring along a guest
and his answer was yes
so i will invite all to bring a spouse/guest
i thought that i would also include lexi elliott
the recruiter from the analyst program that will be covering ou
have you decided on the make-up of the recruiting team at ou in the fall
if so
this might be a good event in which to include them as well
i left you a voice mail message about james scribner as a potential good member of the team
let me know your thoughts and i can include anyone else that you would like
i plan to get invitations out to everyone by july 0
attached is bob superty's summary of the impact on the late noms today
we do not anticipate any pipeline penalties
on those pipes where the nom type is
intraday
there may be some pipeline imbalance created for us to work through
the logistics staff will have a lot of work to do on thursday morning to contact customers asking them to renom on the pipes where our noms were late
overall
these pipelines worked well with us today
let me know if you have any questions
sally
i don't think that john jacobsen should be reviewed in london
pulp
paper is still an ena group
even though we have john reporting to you
i would not roll that up under global products as it exists today
we did review him in our prc
for some reason
hr has confused the issue with the pulp
paper employees by putting them under global products rather than ena
a step they took i believe without any outside direction
does this make sense to you
sally
i am not sure that i have a high-resolution photo
since i'm not sure what that is it probably means that i don't have one
so we probably do need to schedule a photographer
i will be in the office next week
wednesday through friday
then i will be on vacation the week of july 0th
let me know when the photographer will come
so that i will know what to wear
thanks
and have a great long weekend
sally
welcome to enron
i'm glad that you made the decision to come here
hopefully
that decision will feel right to you in a very short period of time
look for kristin albrecht and leslie reeves in power on 0
they know more about our power business than almost anyone on the floor
they both report to me
kristin heads risk management and leslie leads operations
they can help you on any details about our power business
my office is on the 0th floor
eb0
stop by if you get the chance
i will be moving to the 0rd floor during the week of july
actually while i am on vacation
have a great long weekend
sally
end of july should be fine
i am planning to be out july 0

sally
attached are my accomplishments for the first half of 0
i will also ask my assistant to deliver a hard copy to you on wednesday
july 0
let me know if you have any questions or need more information
thanks
attached are my accomplishments for the first half of 0
i should have had these for you on tuesday for your prc
hopefully
better late than never
i am not certain how the coporate-wide prc process will work in late july for vp's
i have provided a copy of this to dave delainey for the ena prc which will take place on july 0
i thought that i would provide you a copy as well
i will also have patti deliver a hard copy to sharron next week
what do these changes do to you
sally
home and cell phone number are correct
i do not have a pager
sally
this looks good
please send this wherever it should go
thanks
lunch on august 0nd works well for me
i have it on the calendar
i am planning a cook-out at my house on sunday
july 0th for enron summer interns from ou and recent hires from ou
mike mcconnell and his wife plan to join us
if you are in houston
i hope that you will be able to join us too
probably around 0:0 pm
invitations should go out in the next few days with specifics
wanted to get the date on your calendar
however
let me know if you will be in town
sally
as mentioned
i will be out on vacation next week
this contact list should be helpful if you need anything while i am out
sally
just a reminder about my being on vacation next week
i also wanted to let you know that i gave your names as contacts while i am out
sally
just wanted to let you know where we will be over the next week
i am still at the office hoping to get away before dinner so that i can head home and pack
i will call when we are back in houston on sunday

brenda
i mentioned to tom that i will be on vacation the week of july 0
so i will not attend the july 0th meeting
please remind him of that
thanks
brenda flores-cuellar@enron
just a reminder for monday to get this for me
too bad they didn't deliver these
thanks
sally
today was the final ena prc
relative ranking results up through the senior director level are final
you and your management team can begin the process of giving performance reviews to your employees
i spoke with sheila walton today to inquire about an expected time frame for completing and conducting the employee reviews
she indicated that the target completion date should be the end of july
promotions will be effective august 0st
it is dave delainey's intent to announce ena promotions sometime after he returns from vacation on july 0
this drives the end of july target completion date for reviews
i do not yet know if delainey wants all ena promotions to be announced in a single memo
or if each group within ena will prepare such a memo
i will keep you updated on this as i get direction from him
please note the following change since our energy operations prc in june
in order to place focus on the qualitative feedback during this mid-year review process
we will not share performance clusters with employees when conducting their reviews
it is very important for all of us to be consistent in this process
so please communicate this to all in your groups who will be giving performance reviews
it is important to note
however
that the content of an employee's review should be consistent with our view of that employee's relative ranking
in other words
an employee in the satisfactory category should not be given a review that simply states that the employee is doing a great job
clearly
a large number of employees performed at a higher level than those employees in the satisfactory category
so the feedback to that employee should include some specific areas of improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in the organization
help you achieve the groups goals
etc
also please note the following
performance reviews for anyone in the satisfactory
needs improvement or issues categories must be reviewed by hr prior to these reviews being given to the employees
this will ensure that our feedback is commensurate with the relative performance of that employee
this has been the stated process for the bottom two categories
and we are adding satisfactory to this process as well
please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team
yourself
or an hr professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced members of your management team
or those management team members where you have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and perhaps tough performance feedback
i believe that we have spent some time in identifying these situations
i ask your help to ensure that we follow through on this commitment
thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid-year prc process a meaningful one
it is dave delainey's intent to announce it if 0
please join us for an informal lunch on friday
july 0st in the dining room in eb0m
rick causey
enron's executive lead for the analyst program
and david haug
enron's executive lead for the associates program
have been invited to join us as well
we are interested in renewing acquaintances with those of you whom we met on campus and in getting to know those of you whom we did not see in the interview process
we hope that you are enjoying your summer assignments at enron and we look forward to the opportunity to visit over lunch
please let me know by return e:mail if you will be able to attend the lunch
rob
let me know if you get feedback from aec that does not indicate that they are getting what they need
susan and bryce are both very capable and responsive
so i am confident that aec's questions can be resolved quickly
sally
thanks for the update
i am confident that with leadership from you and attention from bryce that aec will be satisfied soon
sally
i will be hosting a cookout at my home for ou summer interns
recently hired ou grads and the ou recruiting team on sunday
july 0th in the late afternoon
more details will follow soon
but i wanted to let you know the date so that you can hold this on your calendar
i will look forward to hopefully seeing all of you there
and my husband will be glad to be surrounded by many fellow sooners
today's ena prc was a pre-ranking session for vp's
all vp's will be reviewed at an enron-wide prc scheduled for early august
representatives at that enron prc from ena will be janet dietriech
dave delainey
john lavorato and greg piper
they will use information from today's ena prc meeting in representing you at the enron-wide vp prc
i have provided copies of your accomplishments and consolidated supervisor feedback forms to dave delainey for reference during that process
your reviews will be given after the enron-wide vp prc
and will not be completed before the end of july
i will schedule an august date with you for your review as soon as i know the exact date of the final prc meeting
separately
you both should sign up for the executive influence and impact course that is required of vp's
i thought that the course was very good
all vp's are strongly encouraged to complete this course
it is a 0 or 0 day course that is offered every month or two here in houston
i would contact dick amiable to inquire on how to sign up for this
james
i didn't see your name on the distribution for this so i'm forwarding it to you
patti
per sally's instructions
i am forwarding this document to you
patti x0
thanks for the note
i had received a copy of the consolidated supervisor
evaluation form
today i also met with jim and he provided me with his
bullet points on your accomplishments and strengths
as well as your summary
of accomplishments for the period
if there is anything else that you think
would be helpful for me to have
please let me know
i will be in my office
eb0
between 0:0 and 0:0 today and tuesday
without scheduled meetings
if you would like to stop by so that i can put a
name and face together
please feel free to do so
this is my first day back
in the office after vacation
so i have a lot of catching up to do
but i
would be glad to visit with you for a while

prc meeting
sally
jim row
my supervisor
let me know that you would be representing me at the
prc meeting on wednesday
i believe jim's summary of my performance should
offer a very good overview
but if you have any further questions for me
please feel free to call
many thanks
nicole
this is my first day back from vacation
we need to augement e:mail so that requests sent when someone is on vacation can be routed elsewhere if urgent
this is request is approved
why are there so many different formats for granting systems access
some have an approval button
some don't
you requested a return e:mail
it seems as if each time i look at one of these it is different
the status button and detail button below contain no information
today's enron-wide associates prc meeting has been cancelled
it was scheduled to start at 0:0 today
following the analysts prc
apparently
the analysts prc is running long
since both meetings were scheduled for the same location and with joe sutton as the chair
the associates prc has been cancelled
i do not yet have a rescheduled date
i will let you know when i do
i am also sending an e:mail message to the associates that i am representing so that they will informed of the cancellation
thanks for taking the time to meet or talk with me about the performance of your respective associate in preparation for the prc
today's associates prc meeting that was to begin at 0:0 has been cancelled and will be rescheduled for a date yet to be determined
both the morning analyst prc meeting and the associates prc meeting were scheduled for the same location and with joe sutton as chair
the analysts prc meeting is apparently running very long
so someone from the program office called to cancel the associates prc meeting for this afternoon
i will let you know as soon as i know a rescheduled date
in preparation for today's prc meeting
i was able to meet in person with most of your supervisors to get input on your job responsiblities
accomplishments and performance
for those that were unavailable for a meeting
we managed a phone call or at least a series of voice mails to accomplish the same thing
i also have any materials that you may have provided to your supervisor for the mid-year review process
as well as copies of the internal feedback that was gathered through the pep system
with this delay in the meeting date
i have the time to ask for a copy of your resume
the prc process clearly focuses on your performance specifically from january through june 0
however
it would be helpful to me in representing you to at least be familiar with your backgrounds
please e:mail a copy to me or you can send a hard copy to eb0
a couple of you have come by my office to meet with me
i would also be happy to put a name and face together for others of you or to talk by phone if you are not in houston
my extension is 0
thanks for including me
congratulations on emily
i know that you and she will be getting used to one another over the next few weeks
and that sleep will definitely be a scarce commodity
those first few weeks can be both wonderful and terrible at the same time
savor the baby stage as much as you can
and before you know it emily will be cooing and responding to you in a way that makes all of the sleepless nights just melt away
enjoy your new role as mom
it is a wonderful
life-long experience
sally
i have been traveling on business and also have just returned from vacation
so i have not yet seen the proposal that you referenced
i will hopefully discover it as i go through my inbox in the next few days
how do we get the right focus on support for calgary
mark taylor wanted to hold up transferring confirm responsibility to calgary
so we still need to provide excellent service to them
while i can appreciate that diane is out
that should actually be a red flag to us to pay even closer attention to the calgary stuff
every screw up looks big to them
and they can't understand how mistakes continue to happen
while i know that they can't appreciate the vast number of transactions that the group is currently handling
we still need to be able to deliver top notch service
unfortunately
we stub our toe enough with calgary that they view of our operation is one that delivers pretty poor to average service
that is a terrible internal pr issue
let's put our heads together on not just the confirm issue but all of our dealings with calgary so that we quickly turn around our error rate
and/or their perceptions
and can sustain excellent service
i am copying susan because she has dealt recently with an issue brought to our attention by rob milnthorp
president of enron canada
she responded to rob quickly and handled things professionally
so she may not have shared the details with you at the time
but now we need to look at all of our outstanding
potential or past issues with calgary and get a solution in place
she can fill you in on the details in that situation
susan
do you have any ideas on how we can reshape our image with calgary
i got your message and i have asked brent to get with me when he is back in the office on friday
he has been in new york re
mg since monday night
together we will do two things
0
devise a foolproof plan to insure an excellent level of service to calgary starting immediately
and
0
work with mark taylor to understand his concerns over the movement of confirmation preparation to calgary and to eliminate his concerns
we will keep you posted on both items
sally

we have a new date
monday
july 0th beginning at 0:0 am
i will contact your supervisors after the prc meeting to let them know the final results
your supervisor will give your performance review and will be able to summarize the feedback received through the pep system during the review
thanks for providing your resumes
i will feel more informed during the process
the associates prc meeting has been rescheduled for monday
july 0th at 0:0 am
i have also sent an e:mail message to the associates letting them know about the new date
i will be in the chicago office on monday
july 0
i will be sorry to miss a lunch at brennan's
enjoy it without me
sally
i will be out of the office from wednesday
july 0 through friday
july 0
i am taking my older daughter on a preliminary look at colleges
i will have my cell phone with me
the number is 0-0-0
my assistant
patti thompson
will have hotel phone numbers where i can be reached as well
the following persons will be key contacts for trading operations while i am out
natural gas operations brent price x0

kristin albrecht financial products operations sheila glover x0 coal

lng scott earnest x0 weather todd hall x0 dpr mike moscoso x0 mpr david maxwell x0 i will be working in ena's and mg's chicago offices on monday and tuesday
july 0 and august 0
patti has contact numbers for me at both offices
key contacts in houston are those listed above
with changes noted for gas and power operations on july 0 and august 0
i will be back in the houston office on wednesday
august 0
fyi
i will be out of the office for the two meetings on wednesday this week
i will be working in chicago monday and tuesday next week
i will be back in the office on wednesday of next week
todd tells me that a logo has been selected
can you e:mail that to me
if not available electronically
i will see it when i am back in the office next wednesday
if no one has stepped in to a look at hours spent on the confirmation process and opportunities that may be presented there
i will do that when i am back in the office next week
my first move will be to sit down with jeff sorenson who leads the confirmation group to put some meat around the hours that james scribner sent you
when we look at numbers of confirmations and compare several months of data we will be better able to identify which activities were stressed by increased business and which activities seemed to absorb increased business more easily
i also think that jeff will be the best source of information about ideas on streamlining
opportunities to simply life at enron and perhaps create value externally
all of the advances made over the last several years
auto-confirm
the decaf system
auto-faxing
digitized signatures
document scanning
etc
in our confirm group have been ideas generated by the business group and led by them for implementation
no doubt
jeff has some good ideas on where to go next
did you mean to send that e:mail to me
it was greek to me
and i assume that the sally it was meant for was that sally conover
feels like a monday
doesn't it
sally
can't remember at this point what the question was
thanks for following up
i will call you if i remember
sally
the associates prc was completed on monday
july 0
as the prc rep
i will communicate the final ranking from the prc process to your supervisor
i received a copy of the rankings from charlene on friday while i was on vacation
i will be communicating the final rankings to each associate's supervisor today
it is your supervisor who will the one be to give you your performance review and the ranking
in your case
i would guess that jean and your new supervisor will have to work out which one
or both
will do your review
sally
this was great
and i saw myself in a number of these
it must be too long
but that is who i am right now
sally
hope that the trip goes well
it should be interesting to look at that business
keep me posted
sally
to give you more clarity
stephen transferred to ebs effective july 0
0
his move to ebs was agreed to earlier in 0
with the understanding that it would be effective upon the completion of the sap implementation for ena on july 0
stephen was playing a critical role in ena to insure a smooth transition for sap
and todd lindholm at ebs was in agreement that stephen would remain an ena employee through implementation
with his performance review being based on his work for ena
stephen is very talented and will no doubt do a great job at ebs
during the first 0 months of 0
however
his heart was already at ebs and he failed to communicate with my other direct reports on sap issues
consistently missed my staff meetings
recruited our other key sap expert to ebs without a back-up plan for ena
etc
it was his failure to make his sap assignment a priority that landed him in the needs improvement category relative to other directors on my team
it is the r elativity of his performance that is key
not necessarily the label of that category
kristin will be working for ebs at the time of this class
reporting to barry pearce
please contact kristin or barry for the appropriate rc within ebs to charge for the fee for this class
if you charged ena at the time of enrollment
please reverse that charge
thanks
requesting update access for what
can't tell from this request what it is that you want me to approve
is this request for sheila glover or rebecca ford
unclear
next to sheila's name is the word trader
is this supposed to be her title
she is not a trader
she is a business controller
can you provide some clarification so that i can act upon this
thanks for your earlier phone message
leola
this is still a bad process and the information is not sufficient to give an approval
i left you a return voice mail regarding scott
let me know if i did not understand the role that you are trying to fill
i hope that jo likes dr
moore
i thought that everyone in his office was so warm and friendly
fyi
yeah
yes
staff meeting is 0:0 to 0:0 on mondays in eb0
convenient for you at this point
the united way executive solicitiation is underway
you should have received an e:mail message about a week or ten days ago which let you know that you this year pledges should be made on line
mark frevert reminded everyone at today's ena staff meeting to complete their pledges by tuesday
august 0
if you have not already done so
i would encourage you to complete your pledges before tuesday
patti thompson can tell you where to go on line to do this
peggy
united way may not apply in canada
so ignore this if not appropriate
there is a problem with this process
when sally goes to website
enters her id
password
steve.beck comes up
not sally.beck
until this is fixed
she will be unable to process these requests
please either fix this or find another way for her to approve
thanks
patti x0
sally beck's assistant
it was great to see a friendly face
don't ever hesitate to wave or stop in and say hello
can you believe that i had been on the 0th floor since the summer of 0
i know that sets some kind of record at enron
it is kind of fun to be up here
the appreciation for the jobs that we do in operations has grown over the last several years
thanks to the hard work of you and so many others
my family is doing great
the children start school tomorrow
meagan will be a junior in high school
we took a brief trip with her this summer for an early look at some colleges
it will be a big year for amanda
she starts junior high in 0th grade
and tyler would tell you proudly that he is
two and a half
what a delight he continues to be
i know that erin has worked hard
i hope that she and her husband are doing well
sally
i can't shed any light on the topic choice
surely you can redirect the topic
brent may have more info
sally
is there a person who can attach a name and number to this request
i receive many requests daily and i have yet to any two alike
makes it tough on someone to act on these
especially when sent with a name
when i click on the address included in this message
someone else's name comes up
steve beck
i don't know who you are
what you want me to do
or if you even have the right person
can you help me on this
can you give me the name of someone who sends messages from arsystem@ect.com
to make matters even more frustrating
when i tried to e:mail back to get some clarification
i got a message that said my e:mail was undeliverable
no contact name
no phone number
and no ability to e:mail back
i'm stuck
thanks
sally
to all energy operations employees
ena has experienced extraordinary growth thus far in 0
i am especially proud of the accomplishments of energy operations in supporting this growth
i wanted to express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication that you have demonstrated
we have done great work and i want to recognize you for that
although we have done much
we have additional goals to accomplish within ena and energy operations this year
therefore
as we go forward
i want to make sure that you have all the necessary tools to do the best possible job
and that any barriers that may impede your work are removed
to help in this effort
i have asked a consulting organization
s.j
bashen corporation
to survey our organization
to
take its pulse
if you will
to help us understand what in our environment fosters success and where we could improve
in essence
to assist us in acquiring the
necessary tools
and breaking down any
barriers
sjbc is comprised of seasoned consultants who assist organizations like ours to help on issues like this
sjbc will meet with members of our group in a private setting where we can highlight our successes
discuss our concerns
ask our questions
make our comments
and the like
this collective information then is studied by sjbc with the goal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses
specific input will not be identified by the individual who provided that input
many of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a sjbc consultant
please schedule a time to participate at your earliest opportunity
as this effort will be a success for our group only if we cooperate to the fullest extent
of course
given the size of our group
it will not be possible to meet with each of you
therefore
if you have not received a call from sjbc by august 0 but would like to share your thoughts with them
please feel free to contact cheryl brown at 0.0.0 and cheryl will be glad to include you in our survey
communication is one of enron's core values
i want to stress that only through open communication will this survey be a success
please be candid
thank you
sally
great job
as usual
on the united way kick off today
i saw amy leeand eylesse kalmans as i left the hyatt and i told them
please pass the kudos along to the rest of your team
the theme was timely
the staging was great
the questions on the gameshow were even educational for newer enron employees
giving a little histsory and folklore about enron
i knew the i especially enjoyed the breakfast at depelchin last friday
their programs are important to all of us and the tour was very moving as we met some of the children in the shelter
can you arrange with bobbi
thanks
david is doing well
too
he is working contract
having quit burlington resources about a year ago so that his work schedule could be more flexible
yes
tammy is still with us
we marked our 0 year anniversary with her in march
except for that six month period when she was with her dad in kentucky
i truly am blessed
sally
not surprisingly
the organization is moving faster than rick buy's vacation schedule
our meeting is set with mark frevert
rick buy
you and me on august 0
two weeks from next monday
dictated by rick buy's schedule
i am concerned that waiting that long to get with mark to discuss the potential formalization of a global risk management operations role will put us behind the curve
mike mcconnell and jeff shankman plan to release a memo tomorrow on the structure of the global markets team
which will include a discussion on brent's role and reporting responsibilities
brent and scott earnest are flying to london next monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in that office to iron out details on supporting the global markets businesses
many of their discussions will be with mike jordan and some logical points will be raised around co-ordination between eel and egm
in a conversation with gary hickerson on tuesday regarding his business
he stated that he wanted to be sure that i had responsibility over london operations
as he will have support personnel in london and wants to be certain that efforts are coordinated
separately
jeff shankman said that he was certainly comfortable with brent in the operations/cao role but that he wanted brent to report to me to ensure consistency
access to support resources and logic around systems issues that cut across the ocean
i told him that you and i had had discussions about a more formalized role to encompass responsibility for london and that we had a meeting planned with mark frevert on august 0
that's a lifetime to a trader
and jeff said he hoped that we could nail that down before the end of the month
what are your thoughts about an earlier meeting with mark frevert
the summary of doorstep findings can be finalized early next week
i have checked mark's travel schedule
he will be in the houston office next week
with thursday
august 0 as the best day to potentially schedule a meeting
i am not trying to rush this process
yet i know that by the end of august much will have been decided around coordinating between ena
egm and eel operations
i would like to be in a position to help guide those decisions
rather than arrive at the party late
do we have these numbers for hector
thanks for copying me on this
it is interesting to see your thoughts
i suggested that tom visit with both you and mike while he was in london
i told mike that i support many of the ideas of commoditylogic
however
i also told him about my two dark-side fears
0
that it resources reporting to networks would make it even more difficult to get the attention on projects that we need
and
0
taken to the extreme
that this concept would disinsent operations personnel from coming up with creative solutions to managing the growth of the business if all good ideas are swept away to this special team for them to handle
part of the fun in operations is improving things
and i would hate to rob some of our most knowledgeable people of the chance to implement creative business solutions
that was always one of my favorites
the old parent trap is always great too
i wish that i could be there
i know that brigeda must be excited about the slumber party
when does she start school
today is day #0 for the girls
amanda loves her classes
meagan thought that the first day
sucked
i have been on the phone with her counselor and assistant principal this morning trying to undo a bad decision that she made on her class selection
despite annual struggles with algebra and geometry
she signed up for both physics and pre-calc
i don't know what she was thinking
amazingly
for a school as large as klein
i was persuasive enough with the assistant principal that they will ignore the july 0 deadline for changing your schedule and they will let her drop physics and add a study hall
she still will take pre-calc
but she is in a regulars class that will be a review of algebra ii during the first semester
which is probably exactly what she needs
i was prepared to go all the way to the school board if necessary to get her a schedule that makes sense
but luckily i didn't have to go that far
hope that you have a good weekend
love
sally
the employee for whom access if requested is not an employee of energy operations
i would assume that with his supervisor listed as ed baughman
that he is in a commercial origination group
someone else should be reviewing and approving this
definitely clever
i wish that i had thought of the changing the clock thing when the girls were younger and had slumber parties
i didn't know that there were computer games that work on higher level math skills
i will definitely look into that for meagan
i wish that we could meet for lunch
keep me posted on cara
i have called her a little more frequently lately in hopes that she would spill the beans
but no movement on that yet
i think that next week we will know the schedule of games when meagan will be dancing
she did not make the dance for the first try-out
it was jazz
not her strong suit
but she did make the dances for the next two try-outs
a kick rountine and a pom routine
there are two more try outs
one more for kick and one more for pom
hopefully she will make both
each routines is danced at two games
one at home and one away
so if she makes the next two dances
then she will be in 0 out of 0 dances for the football season
i think that she would feel pretty good about that
the last two try-outs will be next week
i will keep you posted
have a great weekend
love
sally
i think that you and allan misunderstood the request from nelson wu
if you look at his resume
is already with enron as an associate
his e:mail to allan sommer seems to indicate that he is interested in a rotation in allan's group
normally
i think that associates talk directly with someone in a group in which they may have an interest
i don't think that hr gets involved in this process
i am not sure how i got into this loop
it seems that if allan has an interest in having an associate do a rotation in his group then he should talk with nelson
sally enron north america corp
life is busy at enron and i literally receive hundreds of e:mails every week
this is not the best way to communicate with me on priority issues
i have looked at your proposal and would be interested in learning more
can you provide more details beyond your presentation
what is your background and experience
can you provide information on your company
fyi
rick agreed with the attached note that i sent him
by voice mail
i suggested ted murphy as a substitute for rick buy for the meeting
we are set for next thursday
august 0 at 0:0 in rick causey's office over lunch
i am meeting with ted this afternoon to fill him in on the purpose of the meeting and to be certain that i have his support
rick causey suggested citing some of the items in my memo to him when we get with frevert
any words of wisdom or suggestions for the meeting
hope that everything is fun and relaxing in maine
sally
i have been able to move up the meeting with mark frevert regarding responsibility for operations for ena
egm and eel to thursday
august 0 instead of august 0
i will keep you posted
i met with brent's direct reports yesterday afternoon and announced brent's new role
i will have three persons leading the natural gas team
steve jackson
leslie reeves and bob hall
i am confident that this will work well
i am sorry that you won't be here to join us for the lunch for kristin
it was a trick getting a date that worked for her schedule and mine
since this is her last official week with ena
i did want to do this before she starts her new assignment
sally
thanks for the update on dad
keep me posted on what you hear
no
i didn't get the message that cara had called
with almost two teenagers in the house
my personal messages fall very far down the list in importance
i will e:mail her today and maybe we can talk tonight if she can't talk from work
sally
around midnight last night as i was creating our calendar for the week
i ran through the incoming calls on caller id to find the piano teacher's number
i think that i saw yours
did i miss you sometime this weekend
with almost two teenagers in the house
my personal messages have dropped very far down the list in importance
i an never quite sure that i get messages that anyone calls
feel free to call me at work
or i can try to catch you during my commute tonight again
hope you had a good weekend
ours involved homework
shoe shopping and continuing the search for new clothes
our friend mo was in town from london and had burgers with us on saturday night
sally
can you join me at this meeting
i plan to talk with tom gros tomorrow to let him know that you will be the liasion with commoditylogic for energy operations
then i thought that we could both attend this next meeting as a transition
then it's on your calendar after that
sally
as a result of the creation of the global markets business in the last few days
i would add the following persons to the attendee list for the ase in dallas
brent price vp operations and cao
global markets tom myers director of accounting
global markets brent is in london this week
and will be on vacation the week of august 0
with the demands of a new role
brent will be best able to address the feasibility of one or both of them attending
should have sent you a copy of this
please put this on my calendar
i assume that this every other week meeting will replace the weekly friday meeting
thanks
thanks for taking the time to give me your input on the analyst program
it will help to have that info in my meeting on friday
as we said before
i would like to be able to utilize todd hall for special projects from time to time
i had mentioned to mike jordan that once todd completed his commoditylogic role that i thought that we could take some of his time to follow up on continental power issues
which could fit nicely with some work he could do on weather in europe
i don't know about the one month timeframe
i would prefer that todd review the initiatives and determine the best way to proceed
it might mean a couple of weeks over there for starters
and then a follow up
shorter trip a few weeks later
i don't think that todd is keen on any elongated stays in europe
particularly without the family
can we still use todd
todd is completing his short-term role on the commoditylogic team
and it is my hope that he will be able to provide some help for you after that is completed
while also working in his role with weather
i have sent a message to brent and i am sure that we will talk
sally
i will be there
sally
i got your voice mail message and i understand your concerns around todd's time
i think we have it backwards for james to dictate how and when todd's help would be needed
i think that we can review the
to do
list from james and get back with him on how much of that we can help with
who would do it
what the timing would be
how we might suggest organizing and prioritizing the work
etc
as i said originally
i knew that todd would not be interested
nor available
for a month's worth of work
todd's tendency
remember this with weather
too
is to think that he has to do all of the work himself
he has had enough experience that his organization
guidance and leadership can be very valuable without his doing all of the work himself
if james
list looks long and involved
how could todd lead these efforts
what kind of team might he ask james to provide
what additional short-term resources might we be able to tap into in houston
etc
we have to think a little out of the box to offer a potential solution to james
if you are willing
i would be glad to explore this with todd and challenge him to think about how he could provide leadership to the effort
but not do all of the work
i want him to think like a consultant on these projects
not as the contracted hired help
let me know what you think
sally
sorry that i missed you this morning
i attended that last financial council meeting on sap this morning just prior to my lunch meeting with mark frevert and rick causey
nothing substantial came up on helsinki
so it was fine that we didn't get to talk today
i had wanted to be prepared on how to address out current activities there
so i can get an update on that when we talk tomorrow
i have a meeting on the analyst and associates program from 0:0 to 0:0 tomorrow
i will call you around 0:0 when i get back from that meeting
i have this on my calendar
at this point
i do not plan to bring anyone else to the meeting
sally
please print the attachment below for me in color
thanks
i like the trip idea better than a party
personally
so i am glad that mom and dad seemed to like that alternative
and in june
i think that the mountains sound great
i have a preference for western mountains
big
open sky
grand tetons could be great
but if mom pictures north carolina as the spot i am sure that we can find something good
we were in ashville a couple of years ago
which was very near the blue ridge
we stayed at a place that was supposed to be terrific
but we did not care for it
i am sure that there are other places in the area to research
there may also be some spots around charlottesville
also just off the blue ridge
i think that some people from here have vacationed in that area
so i will ask around and see if there are any good suggestions
in magazines
i have seen pictures of places in tennessee and georgia
i guess they do have mountains
that look nice
i will see if i can find the names of those places
thanks for pursuing this with mom and dad
sally
i didn't have this on my calendar
lexi
because i wasn't on the list for this event that you handed out regarding the recruiting strategy
my husband has a commitment away from home for wednesday night
and with the children in school already
i can't really ask the older kids to babysit for the two year-old during prime homework hours
patti has some names that i have suggested for this event and she plans to call you with those names
very few of the names on your e:mail message were on the recruiting strategy schedule that you handed out
so i would be surprised if any of these folks have this on their calendars
you may need some of the names that patti has for you
i have put the other dates on my calendar
however
and i am in the process of lining those up with our home schedule to make sure that these will work for me
enron north america corp
if you absolutely can not find enough of the right players to go on the cruise
let me know
my husband is scheduled for a baseball game on wednesday night
if i could find some diamond level tickets for another day for him
he might consider giving up his tickets for wednesday night
this is a last resort sort of measure
however
so i hope that you find success in response from others
but do let me know
same time
same place
just not as often
i would like to maintain management team meetings on monday afternoons from 0:0 to 0:0 in eb0
my plan is to alternate weeks for ena and egm meetings
there are a few direct reports
whose work extends across ena and egm
who will attend both meetings
today was the ena management team meeting
next monday
august 0 will be the first meeting with the egm management team
i will look forward to staying current with each one of you and brent on the growth and challenges of the businesses within enron global markets
i have asked patti to cancel one-on-one meetings that we had scheduled on the calendar going forward
although this new structure changes the direct line reporting relationship
i will continue to be very interested in the professional development of each of you
i hope that we can schedule time together on an as needed basis
this was sent for my approval
the manager listed below does not work in energy operations
this should be sent to someone else for approval
thanks for the follow up
please move forward with this offer with the sign on payment
thanks
enron north america corp
please print the attachment for me in color
i have to put that burnt orange on my bulletin board
put this event on my calendar and research flight information for me
i would fly over on the afternoon of the 0th and back on the morning of the 0th
check with karen to see if she is handling hotel reservations
or if we should make those
thanks
was lisa a recent hire that susan harrison brought in
i don't immediately recognize her name
but wonder if that's who this is
also
i left you a message about bob klein's resignation
as i learned from jeff sorenson
i am sure that jeff has communicated this to you
sally enron north america corp
i met with karen marshall today
she is in the community relations group and is organizing the dinner on september 0th
i suggested that she add to the invitation list the other interviewers this year for the scholarships
roger ondreko and gene humphrey
brent price and loftis fitzwater
one of last year's scholarhip recepients who started with us as an associate this summer
i have also volunteered to coordinate with the university on appropriate attendees
as some of karen's info is dated and she does not know people at the school
i will keep you posted
sally
yes
harold powell is providing the clothes for the show
beverly scott
with harold powell
is coordinating and commentating
she offered to call all the girls to set times for them to come in and choose outfits
i was planning to do that as a go-between
but when she offered to coordinate that i decided to take her up on it
she just moved her daughter back to baylor
so she was to begin calling the girls on monday this week
i had given her a list of names and numbers
i talked with linda smithey this morning and she had not heard from beverly yet
either
so i am concerned that she hasn't called everyone on the list
i took meagan in on monday night to choose outfits
and beverly had some great ideas on music
commentary
etc
so i know that she is working on it
just a little more slowly than i would like
i have a call in to her to see if i need to take some time from work today and make calls
why don't you call beverly directly today and just coordinate a time for jenny to go by
her number at work is 0-0-0
i will be at the meeting on the 0th
beth perlman tells me that you are in charge on this system
it does not work
i thought that this was going to be corrected last week
i am confused about why we are using a system that does not work
i understand that there are bugs in the system
was the system tested before being put into production
i tried to reach you by phone
you were unavailable and i could not leave a voice mail because that was full
i talked with torey hayden and verbally okayed the access for bob hall
please call me and let me know when the system will be working correctly and how you are going to manage these approvals in the interim while the system is not functioning
you might at least put a contact name and number on these things if you are going to continue to send these out before the system is fixed
my number is 0
i look forward to hearing from you on solutions and timing
glad you got some rain
we are still doing lots of watering on the yard
no water rationing in our area yet
but it has been put in place in many areas in and around houston
i have to be in austin for a presentation and reception late afternoon on september 0
so i thought that it would be fun to try to come earlier and have lunch for your birthday
i haven't made flight reservations yet
but i am sure that i can work it to be at the university club by 0:0
looks as if the whole family will go to hallettsville on the 0th
david and i will enjoy the drive
and i am sure that the girls will enjoy the sleep on the way over
on sunday
the new fortune magazine was a roadway for my two-year old's cars
on monday
my sixteen year-old used the cover to cut out pictures of money for a school project
last night
the magazine made it into my hands around midnight when everything at home was settled in for the night
what a nice article
i smiled while reading it
how nice to see your accomplishments recognized in print
congratulations
i hope that you have plenty of copies for your mom and dad
sally
i received the note about the wellesley recruiting team meeting on thursday
i will look forward to seeing you there
will you be in dallas next week for the ase
i will be there
i did let melissa know when the dates were announced that i will quietly slip out about mid afternoon on thursday
amanda's school open house is thursday at 0:0
and parents will follow their children's schedules and meet all of the teachers
with this being amanda's first year in junior high
it is important for me to meet the teachers and understand their expectations so that i can best support her in school
mary solmonson and brent from my team will be there for the duration
i look forward to seeing you there
too
sally
do you know who this is
i don't recognize the manager's name
thanks
thanks for your comprehensive note on your plans for middle and back office in japan
i have done a quick review
and i agree with your thought processes
i also agree that being able to leverage trading operations personnel and experience in sydney
with lower wages
makes a lot of sense
while distance is great
the small time zone difference makes this a good option
i want to take a little more time to review this in more detail
after several months of schedules that have been too full
i have initiated a practice of holding one day a week open for work at my desk
with no meetings
that day is friday this week
so i have put a review of your document on the list for more careful review on friday
i can send you a note then if there are any other comments that i have
i should have apologized in the first paragraph for standing you up while you were here in houston
jeff shankman was on the war path with some concerns over v@r calculations on the day that you were in town
and my schedule was thrown to the winds until we could get him comfortable with the calculations
he was over his limit that day
never any questions when he is under
i hope that we will have the opportunity to speak in person sometime in the not too distant future
mike jordan and i have been working on a worldwide forum for business controllers for all commodities and offices
i am working on securing a location in or around houston
shooting for october 0,0 as potential dates
more details to come on that in the next day or so
i know that is a long way from toyko
but if the dates work for you i hope that you can join us
the enron-wide prc meeting to review the mid-year performance for all vice presidents has been rescheduled several times
currently
this meeting is set for september 0 and 0
per david oxley
performance reviews for vice presidents should be conducted after this prc process is completed
assuming that the meeting takes place as now planned in september
i will schedule your reviews sometime after september 0
bob
i will assume that your review will be given by rock
but i will keep you informed on this process along with peggy and brent
on another note
enron hosts an annual management conference each year for vice president level and above
you should all receive invitations to this event
in recent years
it has been held in san antonio
i do not know the location for this year
but i do have the dates for you to hold on your calendars
november 0-0
let me know if you have any questions on either one of these
in cleaning up e:mails
i can across this one from sheila
is this one of the corrections that was made to the june information
any update on july
thanks
fyi
i responded to sharron
rsvp
yes
i will attend
i will arrive in san antonio in time for the dinner on tuesday evening
count me out for golf on wednesday
i don't think they would want me to play

no manager is listed below on this request and i don't know the employee
the manager blank must be completed for me to be able to address these
without that
i can't possibly tell what group this person is working in and whether or not it makes sense to grant the system access
please return this to me for my approval when complete
not too mountainous
but i am sure that would be fun
it's kind of hard to fly to bermuda from texas
easy from new york
but not that much traffic between houston/austin and there
a few years ago when we went with david's family to yellowstone
we were able to get a great deal through continental through their group rate department
that works when you travel with a group of 0 or more
all on the same itinerary
i think that our round trip from salt lake to houston was $0 each
hopefully we could arrange something like that
if airfare is more like $0,0 between here and bermuda
that could be tough
should we pin them down on an exact location
maybe have them pick two or three and rank them
then we could check on accomodations
airfare
deals
etc
to see what would be most feasible
or should we research a few places and present those choices for them to consider
what do you think
seems like there will be 0 of us
counting baby white/lowrimore
and what do you and cara envision
a weekend
a few days
a week
our kids will get out of school on friday
may 0
the 0nd of june is that following saturday
we are having a great year here at enron
especially in the business unit that i am in
hopefully
that translates to really great bonuses in early february
i hope to be in a position to fund airfare and hotel for everyone
it is good to be getting feedback on these standards
after you have received all responses
i will be curious as to the number and nature of changes suggested
i think for this to be powerful
we will need to expect all commodities and all locations to meet common standards
i will reserve judgement on that however
pending your assessment once you have gotten all responses
let's let her float in that vision for a while
wow
thanks for copying me on these
sally
i will be at the presentation
i can not make a faculty lunch that day
it's my mother's birthday and she lives in austin
so i have already committed to lunch with her
just let me know the details on how soon you would like for me to arrive at the alumni center
and if there is anything else that i can do

i have let lexi know that i have a conflict with this meeting time
i will be doing a business review meeting with jeff skilling on global risk management operations at 0:0 on september 0th
i just wanted you to know that i continue to be committed to the recruiting effort at ou
i have asked lexi to update me on the meeting
sally
have you had a chance to talk with dave b
on any of this
it might be helpful for you to put a call in to tom martin today to give him your phone number and to let him know that you are working closely with dave and that you are available for any questions
nothing may come up
but i think that tom would feel better with this gesture
probably wouldn't hurt to log the same call or e:mail in to the rest of the guys on the list
that will give all of them a feeling of continuity with regard to information from dave on this project
do you have contact information for brenda
if not
i would get that from yvette convey
her assistant
she is making the rounds with patrick conner and the corporate development team
doing site visits on two additional paper mills that we may purchase
thanks
sally
i thought that you might want to know that randy gay's wife passed away on friday evening
randy is the manager of the west desk gas logistics group
his wife had been on a liver transplant list for some time and had been moved up on the list several weeks ago as her condition became more severe
unfortunately
she developed complications during the last two weeks which resulted in her being removed from the transplant list
randy has a four year-old daughter
several of us will be attending the funeral today
over the past several weeks within ena
we have raised funds for playground equipment to complete a fund raising effort that randy's wife had headed for their civic association
through donations from ena employees
the original goal for the playground equipment was far exceeded
great idea
hopefully we can make that happen
these days with mom and dad
i have asked patti to copy you
cindy and them on my travel plans
that way all of you will have numbers where i can be reached if something were to come up
hopefully
never needed
have a great time in new york later this week
i sent you a newspaper article in the mail today
that you may get before you leave
i think that we sent this to the wrong e:mail address at first
i'm trying again
here are the home games when meagan will be dancing in the half-time routine
friday
september 0 0:0 pm saturday
october 0 0:0 pm friday
october 0 0:0 pm
homecoming
there is a chance that she could be added to two other home games if alternates are needed
nothing definitive on that
of course
she did get put into a routine last year as an alternate
but you never know
we would love for you to come for a visit this fall
and it would be fun if it would work around one of these games
i have also given this schedule to cindy
as she and brigeda were interested in making it to a game
i am headed to dallas early tomorrow morning
patti has sent you a copy of my itinerary
i heard today that curtis smith has resigned
i am sure that both ot you know that curtis and jeremy wong were viewed by users as critical resources for erms support
even at a stand still
my team had great concern over the rumored loss of curtis and/or jeremy
and with the assumption that sitara will not go forward for valuation
then erms really has become repositioned as one of our key
strategic systems
there is much to do to
catch up
if you will
with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several years during the sitara development stage
and our business continues to grow and change rapidly
requiring responsive enhancements on an on-going basis
i would like to get together to discuss the staffing plan for support of erms as soon as possible
we need to understand how day-to-day production support will be managed and how development work will be effectively handled
i will ask my assistant to set up a meeting as soon as possible
please set up a meeting with steve and beth as soon as we can
i believe that beth is out sick at the present
i was able to get into the application this time
i could see the request for shona on the screen and i clicked
approval
the status did not change from pending and there was no pop up on the screen that indicated that the request was processed
so i do not know if this worked
please print all attachments for me
thanks
october 0th sounds great
we will reserve the guest room for you
thanks for the resume
i have been out of town the last several business days
so i am just now catching up on e:mails
david told me that he ran into you at lunch
small world
how are things going for you
i hope that this was a good move for you
sally
i would like to participate in this focus group
however
i will be returning from austin on friday morning following the enron scholarship dinner the night before
i am scheduled to land at hobby at 0:0 am
it is unlikely that i will be in the enron building before about 0:0
and i am scheduled to go into a meeting at 0:0 that involves a number of players and would be difficult to reschedule
if your responses from participants for the friday session is thin
and you schedule another time
please let me know
i have been out of the office on business for the last several days
recruiting at ut yesterday
and returned mid-morning today to a full schedule
i am just now reading your e:mail and therefore could not respond by noon today as you had asked
sally
i already have a meeting scheduled for friday from 0:0 to 0:0
i will join you in the facilitator training as soon as that meeting concludes--it may not last a full 0 minutes
in case i can not make the meeting
i have printed the attachment
thanks
the week of september 0 is not a great week for me
i am out of the officfrom tuesday at noon through friday afternoon
so my monday and tuesday morning are already booked
i checked to see if there was anything that icould bump off the schedule for monday
but i am doing several performancereviews and have richard sage here from london to go over several things
the next week
i am at a communications training session on monday
september 0 and then will be in a v@r class on thursday and friday
september 0 and0
let's try for tuesday or wednesday that week
the 0th or 0th
i havpatti checking on some travel details for me
i have to make a presentatiofor recruiting in austin on wednesday late afternoon or evening
let me know what works for you
sally
sheri thomas
x0
one of my direct reports
has responsibility for the call center that supports enrononline
there is also a call center for clickpaper.com
sheri will know the name of the person who is heading that effort as well
i am sure that it would be interesting to compare notes on their efforts and yours
welcome to enron
it was nice to meet you last week
sally
it was good to see you last week
too
that was a big group
and there were many people that i just passed in the halls
i would love to participate
but i will be out of town on september 0
rick causey is hosting an offsite meeting from septemer 0-0 in san antonio
thanks for thinking of me
sally
the 0th won't work for me
unfortunately
rick causey is hosting an offsite meeting from tuesday evening
sept
0
through friday
sept
0
if you were to arrive early enough on tuesday
we could try to do the review before i catch the plane on tuesday afternoon
the only problem with that is that the vp/md prc is scheduled for september 0 and 0
i don't know that the vp portion of the prc will be completed on monday
or that the results would be available to me on tuesday even if the process is completed on monday
we have been asked to hold vp reviews until after the prc process is completed
i will contact you as soon as i do have the results from the prc and we will set up a specific time for the review
either in houston or calgary
seems like it would be a good time of year for me to head north
sally
thanks for you message
i am glad to know that you like what you see in the office to date
i am planning a trip to chicago soon
so i will look forward to seeing you there
please set up a 0 minute meeting for me with dave
thanks
does this make sense to you
seems like they may have the wrong person
can you follow up
thanks
we will need this
so i am sending it to you as well

any thoughts on this one
sally
great job on discussing status and next steps with the group this afternoon on opm
the presentation and your comments were direct and concise
and your delivery of the information was very well done
you were poised
organized
prepared and confident
it was an effective and informative presentation to the group
thanks for your dedication and enthusiasm on this project
who are these guys and should someone from our group meet with them
yes
mary solmonson from energy operations has volunteered to host a student in the job shadowing program
mary may have one of her directors host the student
please use mary solmonson as the primary contact for this program
her extension is 0
thanks
i am not aware of an enron-wide issue
but it would seem strange that two such instances occurred within your group
you may want to contact someone in security to give them the details so that they can investigate
please print and start a file for me for year-end prc 0
yikes
thanks

ted murphy and bill bradford to discuss common needs around risk systems
i will be in the office the afternoon of september 0

i have asked ena's compensation team within hr to conduct a compensation study for me for all positions from manager level through vice president
this analysis will include employees who are dedicated to ena
eim and egm
it had been the plan to complete our compensation analysis by focusing on the manager level and above
following the market analysis for senior specialists and below that was completed by yvonne land
i learned recently that yvonne has left the company and that she had not begun the analysis for managers and above
todd burke
who recently joined enron
will be conducting the market survey and compensation analysis
i met with todd recently
he has had wonderful experience with towers perin and watson wyatt
and i feel that we are fortunate to have him devoted to this project
please give sufficient thought and attention to requests from todd
the quality and timeliness of your responses will directly impact the quality and timeliness of the analysis that i will receive from todd
i think that you should each have a vested interest in the success of this project
todd also plans to resurvey market information for senior specialists and below so that his view of compensation will be complete and timely for all of energy operations
since we recently took action on compensation levels for key players at the senior specialist level and below
i would not anticipate further adjustments for those levels as a result of todd's review
you should receive a message from todd in the next day or so in which he will detail steps in the compensation analysis and what your role will be
sally
i am not trying to twist any arms with this question
but is there anything we can do so that jody can make the presentation at ou
since he was the top graduate from the energy management program at ou
it would be great for him to be at the presentation next tuesday night
i know that recruiting events can be a drain on staffing
but it is also time well spent
i do know that jody is in a role that has real day-to-day commitments
so if there is not a feasible way to have someone calc a book for him i will understand
i just wanted you to take a look at this
thanks
this approval request is incomplete
it does not include the name of this employee's manager
i do not know the employee
and without the name of the manager i can't possibly approve this
please get someone to complete this request
too late with your spreadsheet
the instructions that we got from donna were that i should review the resumes
pass them to brent for his review
and then on to causey for his review
considering our schedules and the large number of resumes to review
that would have been an impossible task to complete by thursday at noon
i received the resumes after lunch on tuesday
just before leaving for the airport to catch the plane for oklahoma
i asked patti to make a copy of the packet for brent
and i knew that rick would not want to take the time to review the resumes without some organization and screening first
i reviewed as many of the resumes as i could on the plane on the way back to houston today
all of the liberal arts resumes and about one third of the business resumes
and brent reviewed them last night after his training class
we got those to rick today by noon
as he was leaving the office
i believe that rick will review what brent and i put together and then will pass the resumes along to you
since you only e:mailed your spreadsheet this morning after brent and i had done our reviews
you will have to cross-reference the info on the spreadsheet with the selected resumes
brent and i would have appreciated some organization and screening of the resumes as well
i would suggest that in the future that your team should make copies of the resumes for everyone that you would like to have doing the review
the plan of passing them from one person to another is not practical
and i should not have had to make the copies for brent
if you are going to ask vp's and md's to help in this process in a very short time frame
then i would suggest that you use their time wisely
if someone from you team had organized the resumes into three groups by gpa's or majors
that would have given us a good starting point
instead of a jumble of resumes
two page resumes were not stapled together and there were a number of resumes of mba's included
which should be considered for associates interviews
not analysts interviews
please give us organized information to react to
not simply a jumble of data that we have to weed through
all of us want to participate and to be as involved as possible in the recruiting process
but we need to be able to rely on the program for some basic administrative and organizational work
i send these suggestions with the intent of constantly bettering the program and with the intent of helping you to succeed in your role
not being critical
i hope that you will take these suggestions in that light
brent and i
and i am sure hunter
too
would have appreciated
i will take a look at my calendar and let you know when i can come north
i am heading to the airport in 0 minutes for a flight to austin to make a presentation at ut tonight
capping off about four weeks with a lot of travel for me
i will catch my breath on the plan and look at my schedule for the next few weeks and i will let you know
i sat by sheila knudsen at the ena staff meeting on friday afternoon last week
and asked her if we should now schedule vp reviews
the vp prc meeting
much rescheduled
did take place on september 0 and 0
sheila said that as of friday
the 0th
that hr had not received the final results from the prc
and that we should wait on reviews until we had that in hand
i will check with hr this week so see if all is finalized
so that we can schedule the review
i will keep you posted
this employee and his/her manager
bob schorr
do not report in to me
this approval should be sent to someone else
diana

let me know if you need anything else
patti thompson x0
i updated that systems matrix recently
in preparation for our much rescheduled meeting with aa on risk controls
that is on my calendar for friday morning this week
so i will bring copies with me to that meeting
i have been publishing an ena operations report monthly since june
to date
i have been reviewing it with dave delainey
fine-tuning each month the types of information and format that he likes
i will bring you a copy tomorrow and would like your input on content and format as well
with the recent reorganization
i am working with egm and eim to create the same report
after we have mastered that here in houston over the next month or so
i plan to share the format with london so that all of our wholesale businesses can use the same format
in addition to these monthly operating reports
we are working on a daily report to be operational by the end of the fourth quarter that will track compliance with our fundamental operating standards
we are in the phase of determining the source of reporting
systematic or manual
and the frequency of reporting
daily
weekly
monthly
for all commodities and locations against the operating standards
as we get this to a first draft stage
i will share this with you
as well as the timeline for full implementation
sally
i have read this series of e:mails but i am not sure that i fully understand the issue
did willie not do his job
are there problems with how sap works
are both of these an issue
please let me know if we have a far reaching problem with sap and netting
thanks
sally
i know that there are a number of things that do not work as we had anticipated in sap
i also know that there are several things where we have to change our processes to accomodate differences or gaps in sap
we also have significant issues with the timing of certain runs within sap and a mismatch of that timing with our business processes
there was a concerted effort kicked off by the sap team last week to try and identify and resolve issues
they met with my direct reports
however
we have to reconvene as we ran out of time to cover all issues
i have asked leslie reeves and bryce to get back to me on even more detail on this example so that we can fully understand how much of this issue was attributable to human versus system
i will get back with you as i know more details and as i can share with you our list of first
hits
for sap fixes or enhancements
thanks for sharing this with me
sally
yes
he is working on the short list
i do have to say
however
that i have not had questions from him on any of those names
i will leave him a voice mail message for an update
please put this on my calendar
i don't know if i will make it there
but i would like for it to be on my calendar
thanks
it was good to see you in norman earlier this week
as always
i appreciated your attendance at the presentation and at coach's afterwards
i am sure that it is rewarding for you to see former students such as jody and nate participating on the other side of the recruiting table
you have done a great job in changing and promoting the program
i am pushing lexi to resolve the question around interview dates for summer interns asap
i have also left mike mcconnell a message to make him aware of the issue
i should be able to get back with you next week
hopefully with a change in our strategy
if you do become aware of five ou
texas tickets
please let me know
we will certainly purchase them
i just made the assumption that all tickets may already be sold
on another note
david has worn his ou shirt to work and has gotten lots of compliments
he has a number of people that have asked him about school shirts
caps
etc
do you have a list of the schools that you can get merchandise for and the types of merchandise that you can get
let me know
we can probably place a few orders through you
invitations have been mailed to all vp's and above for the annual enron management conference to be held at the hyatt hill country in san antonio november 0-0
hopefully
you have received your invitation
more to save the date than to provide any detail at this point
if you have not received your invitation
please let me know
thanks for looking into the ou/texas tickets for us
with the ages of the kids
i think that we will pass on those single tickets
the kids love our home tradition for the game
and weren't sure that they wanted to give that up
i have cake pans in the shape of the state of texas and the state of oklahoma
one daugther decorates one
and the other decorates the second cake
add some bean dip and chips and it's our own version of a tailgate party
we were hoping to bring meagan up to look at ou this fall
with our eye on that last game of the season
however
klein high school has started the football season very strongly
winning all games to date
that means that we may be headed for high school playoffs again this year
meagan is on the drill team and must be at all games
last year
we played right up to thanksgiving in the playoffs
so
we have decided to pick a weekend in the spring after drill team contest season is over to make that trip with meagan
we are interested in caps
shirts
etc
for ut
ou and texas tech
do you have a list of what is available for those schools
thanks for your list
i have talked with brent and of the three names that you have listed
he wants to include only cindy horn
i have thought more about heidi mason and jan-erland and think that they should be included
while they do roll into europe and also have a tie to accounting
they are the individuals in sydney and toyko that we are depending on to stress and enforce controls
heidi particularly does have active responsibility for risk
confirmations and settlements on a day-to-day basis
and in addtion to their role reporting in to europe
we are looking to them to oversee controls for other non-eel traded commodities in their locations
weather
coal
etc
i will include fernley on the invitation list
as i had mentioned the meeting to him when i saw him in san antonio
he can certainly respectfully decline
this employee
and his supervisor
bob schorr
do not report in to me
someone else should be approving this requested access
i think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards
but i wonder about the most appropriate timing
enough of a global message and the means of delivery
on the means of delivery
i am not sure from your note whether or not i fully understand the intent
is there an article to be included in an enron publication and in addition a letter to be sent under john's name
if so
to whom will the letter be sent
or is the letter from john an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article
with regard to a global message
i think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature
applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities
with these operating standards implemented worldwide
we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide
these global standards also should enable enron to expand its business reach more quickly
with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations
i am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across
finally
a question regarding timing
the last i knew after you and brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated
shona took this to do after brent's return to houston
for comments to all business controllers
i don't believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed
understand and have implemented these standards
and not to belittle the process of creating the standards
the tough part
and the real meat behind this
will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards
my commitment to rick causey is that i will have that global report in production by the end of the year
there is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report
shona has commissioned mike moscoso to work on this
and i believe that mike has already been working with james new
so i question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against
would a more appropriate time be after the global operations controller meeting in october when we should have worldwide buy-in and commitment to these standards and
hopefully
our first draft of a meaningful exception report
sorry that this response looks so long
i have been interrupted 0 times while responding
so i hope that it makes sense
thanks for sharing this with me
since you asked for input
i hope that you don't mind that i gave you some
sally
late jan sounds great
meagan does have a couple of big things on the weekend in january
national charity league senior presentation
big dance that she and i are committed to help with
the bearkadette ball and a winter party for cotillion
i believe that these are three weekends in a row
january 0
0 and 0th
so the last weekend in january would work well
and i will need a rest from formal affairs
does that work for you
and do you want to do it on a saturday or sunday
saturday probably works better for me
just so that i am back in houston and doing laundry by sunday afternoon
fernley
i think that you are right about easy access to the standards
in fact
at the global operations controllers gathering in houston in october
we are going to roll out a website created for global risk operations
the global standards will be one of the items included
as well as contact lists for operations controllers worldwide
calendars for all enron offices worldwide
a
what time is it there if i am here
page
etc
i would like for this to be introduced at the offsite as surprise
just a little bang out of the announcement
so i would appreciate your not sharing this plan widely at this point
however
i thought that i would let you know so that we would not duplicate any efforts
would you please forward a copy of our current draft of operating standards to shawn
thanks
fyi
yes
my response was lengthy
fyi
this is fine
sally
i can never tell from these things what they are asking to be approved
since gregory's address looks as if he is at corp
just let me know who he is and what i am being asked to approve
please reply with history attached
thanks
sally
this request is approved
your request forms that you send still don't provide enough information in layman's terms so that i know what you are asking to be approved
are we working on this
i read your note back to shona
and i understand john's desire to put a reminder in front of people
including commerical staff members
about the need for operating standards
if this is the best time to put that in writing for europe
then by all means go forward with that
if there is an efficient way to reference this effort as an enron-wide initiative to define and monitor these standards across all locations and all commodities traded
then that would be great
it simply helps put the london initiative in the context of an enron-wide effort that we all feel is important
sally
hope are things in london
i have seen beth apollo at two meetings in texas recently
one in dallas and one in san antonio
we have been making the texas circuit
not quite as exciting as your travels
i have heard from stephanie
and she
paul and rebecca are headed to texas at the end of october/beginning of november
she will be interviewing students at ut on october 0 and 0 and then she and her family will be in houston from wesneday
november 0 to saturday
november 0
they will be staying with us at our house
it will be fun to watch tyler and rebecca get to know one another
she is an older woman
but i am sure that they do well
by the way
stephanie is expecting baby number two
i think that when she is here she will be about six months pregnant
i thought that i would let you know what her travel plans are on the off chance that you might be in houston at that time
it would be fun for all of us to get together
i don't know if i had told you
but chuck randall has joined enron and this week i saw another old first city banker
jeff baker
who was on his first day here
we could also schedule a first city reunion if you could be here
if it doesn't work this time
just let me know the next time you will be in houston and i will round up all the usual suspects for a lunch or happy hour
i may need to head to london in october or november
i will let you know if my travel plans develop
i hear from beth that you have taken a very adventurous vacation
mountain climbing
how was it
i will be anxious to hear
sally
is this a timeline for all of ena
or just for the accounting group
thanks for sending the dates in writing
we already have this on our home calendar and all five of us are looking forward to your visit
i did confirm that there is a home football game on friday
november 0
so if you all are interested in going
we will have plenty of tickets
the weather should be great here then
i have also blocked off friday
november 0 from work so that we can do something fun with the kids
zoo
children's museum
etc
i sent mo an e:mail message about your stay in houston in hopes that she may need to be in houston at that time
i will let you know what i hear from her
this memo apparently was already out on e:mail when we were meeting in my office regarding confirmations
the language regarding jeff's role on financial confirmations and settlements was left in the memo
it wasn't clear to me when we met whether scott and leslie had talked while looking at a draft of the memo or whether she had seen this on e:mail
since you said that you had not seen this memo
please follow up with scott
leslie and jeff to ensure a common understanding around financial confirmations and settlements so that can be communicated within the organization
there should not be confusion over who has responsibility for financial confirms and settlements
this memo as sent will create that confusion
thanks
decisions
decisions
they are tough for her
i suppose that if she wants others to host the shower that we can just split the cost of a couple of packs of diaper pins and then focus on eating all the sandwiches and cake that we can
do you think that we will be invited
that really sounds ugly
and i don't mean it to
i think that your idea was a great one
but if she has too many offers we can probably just as easily be guests
let me know when the deliberation process is completed
sally
0 counterparties for a total of $0.0mm makes me think that each one must be pretty large
i am copying leslie on this note
as i would like to know the names of the counterparties in the over 0 day bucket and how many dollars are associated with each one
also how likely we think that collection is in each case
leslie
i know that it may be that reconciliation is not far enough along at this point to provide this kind of detail
but it is the type of question that dave may ask
fyi
i will be recruiting at wellsley college for the analyst program on thursday
september 0
i will fly back from boston on friday
september 0 and i should be back in the office between 0:0 and 0:0
my assistant
patti thompson
x0
has numbers where i can be reached
while i am out of the office
the following persons will serve as key contacts
gas operations bob hall x0 leslie reeves x0 steve jackson x0 power operations jenny latham x0 leslie reeves x0 dpr mike moscoso x0 mpr david maxwell x0
peggy
is the eol bridge functionality working for you in calgary
jeff gossett was in a meeting with me on monday this week discussing systems issues
beth perlman mentioned that the eol bridging had been completed
but jeff spoke up and said that it was not working correctly
you or someone on your team may want to call jeff to understand the issues that he was having to be certain that you are happy with the functionality that you now have in calgary
thanks
attached is a memo that i have sent to mike jordan regarding the operations controller forum set for october 0
0 and 0
i want to send the official invitation early next week
i have conferred with mike on attendees from eel
since i do not know all of the reporting relationships in london
i did want to share this list with you and get your input as well before it is finalized
please let me know your thoughts on attendees per the attached
mike was not sure that you would want to be included
but i certainly want to invite you and would very much welcome your attendance
if you can come
i would be great for you to address the group if you would like to do so
just let me know
jeff skilling
rick causey
ted murphy and bill bradford are confirmed as speakers
and i am waiting to hear from mark frevert on his participation
i expect to sent a preliminary agenda out for review next week as well
and would welcome your comments on that
hope you have a great weekend
sally
while recruiting on campus recently i became aware that a decision was made at the program level to not interview this fall for 0 summer interns
in talking with students and faculty at the university of texas and university of oklahoma
it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an internship with enron
as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for summer 0 interns
i have communicated my concerns to lexi elliott and her manager
shelley jones
and was told by both that the decision to delay interviews for summer interns was made at a program level based on enron's staffing
when i asked about the competitive data available regarding the practice of other firms on summer intern interviews
i was even more concerned to discover that neither lexi nor shelley had that data
it would seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for our analyst and associates programs
i have had conversations over the last two weeks with lexi and shelley
with no resolution
when they could not provide the competitive data to either confirm or eliminate my concerns
i volunteered to have james scribner
a senior director on my team
obtain this market information
lexi and shelley either did not have the time to gather this data
or were not sure how to do so
they were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this critical information
i now have information at hand with regard to firms that will be recruiting at ut and ou this fall for summer intern positions
and based on this information
i believe that enron is at risk for not hiring top students as interns for the summer of 0 if we do not interview for these positions this fall
while my research only touches on two of the schools at which enron recruits
i want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many
if not all campuses that we have targeted for recruiting
as administrators of the program
you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to carry the enron message to campus
i believe that we also have an obligation to make this a two-way messaging system
i strongly believe that we must address this potential risk for enron extremely quickly
as teams will be on campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days
i suspect that many enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of the program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer internships
in working with rick causey and mike mcconnell
executive sponsors for ut and ou
respectively
they are as concerned as i about the decision on interviewing summer interns
i have copied both of them on this note to the two of you
please let me know how this can be resolved
with the help of james scribner and others
we have already compiled a list of students at ut and ou that should be targeted for summer internships
i will offer as much of my time as is feasible to work with staff members of the program to devise creative ways to turn this around
fyi
i will keep you posted
it is with regret that i have accepted steve jackson's letter of resignation from enron
steve has made a choice to leave enron and to join another company in the industry
i know that you will join me in thanking him for his many years of service to enron and the contributions that he has made
his risk expertise and his knowledge of ena transactions will be missed
as will his leadership on the gas team
although steve's official last day with the company is in two weeks
today is his last day in the office
he will be available by phone over the next two weeks if there are questions that you may have on any open items that you were covering with steve
patti has his home number if you need that
we will also plan a happy hour for steve and we will let you know when and where that will take place
effective tomorrow
jeff gossett will assume leadership of the gas risk group
reporting to me
jeff will join bob hall and leslie reeves as business controllers for natural gas
to continue to work together to provide leadership for the processes
controls
people and systems that support all aspects of this key business for north america
please join me in congratulating jeff on his new responsibilities
thanks for looking into this for me
enron north america corp
good input on those leather pants
i can just picture her shopping
we will look forward to seeing you for lunch on saturday
the weather looks as if it should be good for the game that night
see you soon
please keep this for reference as we create a holiday contact list
thanks
i always compile a contact list for energy operations during the holidays
thanksgiving
christmas and new years
just let me know who appropriate contacts will be
especially for the dpr and mpr
during the dates that you are out
sounds as if you should see a white christmas
sally
i am so glad that you will be able to attend
i will have a fully developed draft agenda available within the next couple of days
it may help to know that the plans for sunday will start with a cocktail reception at 0:0 at the hotel
followed by dinner at the hotel at 0:0
we hope to have mark frevert join us that night to informally address the group
sunday night will be low-key
as so many of you will have travelled a number of hours to get to houston
on tuesday
the plan is to meet until mid-afternoon
0:0
so that some of the london participants can fly back to london that evening
i do believe that some will stay tuesday night and will plan to have meetings in the houston office on wednesday
if that is the case
i will also arrange a dinner for tuesday night
hope that this helps
hector
the key employees that jeff has identified are senior specialists
with the exception of will kelly
if you remember
these are the risk employees that i was concerned about when steve jackson tendered his letter of resignation
steve will be taking a similar role with a competitor
and it is not inconceivable that he might approach some enron employees to join him and help ensure his success with his new employer
we don't want this to happen
waiting until the end of november to implement an effective retention plan does not make sense
please call me tomorrow and let's talk about how we can jump start this
thanks
sally
it was a pleasure to meet you and to talk with someone who knows ercot
pjm
etc
thanks for taking the time on both wednesday and thursday to visit with us
you should be hearing from lexi soon regarding our super saturday event
thanks for the note
and thanks
too
for taking time on both days to talk with us
you should hear from lexi soon regarding the super saturday event
thanks for asking me
i enjoyed the opportunity to meet your team and to talk with them
thanks for forwarding this contact list
you should add my contact information to the list as well and redistribute to the team
thanks
office 0-0-0 home 0-0-0 cell 0-0-0 brenda flores-cuellar@enron
hector has still referred to the key players under jeff gossett as managers
however
only one of these
will kelly
is a manager
the remainder are senior specialists
let me know if you would like to discuss any of this in detail
we are potentially exposed for steve jackson to hire some of these players away
steve is going to have deliverables at his new employer
our competitor
which will require that he have good people
he will be moving to columbus
ohio where he will not personally know anyone locally to hire
he does know these risk specialists here
and being young and single or childless
their mobility factors could be high
enron would not want to lose any other talent to steve's new employer
attached is your actual form
i did not have a totally blank one to forward
as i have actually done work on all evals on my disk
so i am sending yours so that you can erase your data and use this as a template
hope this works
i did find one that i have not used
you will just need to change the information at the top of the page
i was in austin the end of last week recruiting at ut and
in a sense of open-mindedness and fair play
was at ou on sunday night and monday recruiting as well
james and i have not had a chance to talk following your conversations
nor am i really caught up on e:mail messages
i have some tight deadlines on a couple of things for friday
so it may be monday before james and i have the opportunity to talk in any detail
i am forwarding a message from a wellesley student which includes her resume
let's make sure that she is on our interview schedule for our return visit in november
i talked with her quite a bit before the presentation
and was impressed with her
she has followed up with phone calls and this e:mail
i am sending her some additional information on enron at her request to help familiarize her with the company
her work experience to date has been with more traditional energy companies
sally
i scheduled this meeting in houston to best accomodate schedules of some of our enron speakers
the hill country or even galveston was going to make it impossible for jeff skilling to join us
i would look at this meeting as if it were to be held outside of town
i have preliminarily reserved rooms for all of you at the wyndham warwick
part of the reason for this forum is to meet and get to know your counterparts in other enron operating companies and from around the world
if you can stay at the hotel
this team building will probably be enhanced
this memo is not to force you to pack your bags and stay at the hotel
but to let you know that my budget for the event did include rooms for all of you for sunday and monday nights
i hate the sunday thing
but in trying to minimize the time out of the office for those who will travel from far away
this best suited their schedules
please let patti know on thursday whether or not you would like a room at the hotel to make it easier for you to fully participate

if hr can not find this signed review
can clara communicate with someone in your group in houston to be able to access a copy of the review by 0:0 am on friday
that is the deadline for the final tally on completed reviews
defined strictly by hr as their having received
and retained
i guess
the signed review
the goal is 0% completion by then
for reporting in the ena office of the chair staff meeting on friday afternoon
although many employees are now not under the ena umbrella
we are tracking the completion of reviews by their operating company assignment at the mid-year prc time
thanks
of course
i believe you said that this guy left the company
and if that is the case we may be alright without the review
but getting a second copy from clara would probably be the best bet
thanks
crazy week
0:0 pm and i just finished a project for delainey that i got at noon today
cancelled everything on the calendar and have been immersed ever since
patti gave me your message with your home number around 0:0 today
just as she was leaving
apologized for not giving it to me earlier
however
given my immediate project
i don't think that i could have called until now
and at 0:0am london time
i think that this e:mail is much better
i am still really crunched tomorrow morning
all of our mid-year reviews must be completed by the time we have our ena office of the chair staff meeting at 0:0 tomorrow
big push
after an over percentage completion rate of about 0% at our ena meeting two weeks ago
some of those unfinished reviews were mine to give
0 direct reports is a killer
i wrote three last night after tyler went to bed
finished at 0:0 am and gave all three reviews this morning
i have 0 more to write tonight
and to deliver tomorrow morning to be at 0%
i will try to call you on my way into the office tomorrow morning from the car
if i miss you then
it will be late afternoon houston time before i could call you
next week shapes up to be much better
i am definitely very interested in continuing our conversations
would love to have to over here and involved in operations
so i will either catch you from my car tomorrow morning
or we can talk on monday
glad you could make it yesterday
i don't play
at least not in front of others
so i do look for golfers from time to time
i will keep your number handy
enron capital management
i have this on my calendar and i will be there
thanks

as of friday
october 0
it seems that this student had not heard back from enron
what is the timeline for getting back to students regarding super saturday
would you ever be interested in helping us with recruiting at ou

sunday evening will not be heavy
simple welcome and intros
drink and dinner
i know that many will be tired from traveling
we have arranged for a private showing of the movie rogue trader
complete with comfy chairs and popcorn
which i thought could be fun for the group to see as a means of setting the stage for our discussions on monday and tuesday
this can be optional
as i know that jet lag my get the best of some
the morning on monday will set the stage
why we have gathered
endorsement of our efforts
causey
perhaps you
brent and i could each give a short
state of the union of operations
according to us
covering ena
egm and eel
then definition of the operating standards that we must uphold
discussion
plans on reporting and buy in on these
monday lunch will allow everyone to share with their tablemates a project in which they are involved that will have an impact on global consistency of operational controls
or a project which through sharing or expanding could have such an impact
each table can report back as we gather to start the afternoon
having defined and discussed fundamental operating standards
we will move monday afternoon to review of the doorstep concept
what
why
how and lessons learned
then we will discuss next steps around this on-going project
just before the afternoon break
we will roll out a new communications tool for the operations controllers
a website tailored for the group
we will finish the afternoon by tying in operations performance and its impact on assessing and measuring market risk and credit risk
with ted murphy and bill bradford addressing the group
monday evening will include a tour of enron field and dinner at ruggles center field terrace
bill bradford will join us for dinner
and we are waiting for an rsvp from ted murphy
tuesday morning will start with jeff skilling as our real keynote speaker
he plans to spend an hour plus with the group
he will make an informal presentation and then will entertain questions
the rest of the morning will be spent in breakout teams
with assignments to come up with specific action steps to strengthen operating controls
improve the accuracy of information provided and move toward best practices in providing mid and back office services within enron
before lunch
tom gros and i will share a short story on commoditylogic
philippe bibi will join us for lunch to share his it vision with the group
after lunch
we will wrap up and summarize next steps
including a date to reconvene much of this group perhaps early in 0 to check progess against our designated next steps

my dad is experiecing serious health problems
and he will be in houston on friday for an appointment with a specialist that i have arranged
i will be going to the doctor's appointment with my dad
depending upon waiting room time
i may not be in the office for the 0:0 meeting in eb0 to discuss the findings from the recent internal audit projects
i have asked shona wilson to attend in my place
please continue with the meeting
as i know that this is a difficult meeting to schedule
i will get an update from shona when i get back to the office
fyi
handled
i believe that all of you have met frank
whose last name i can't remember
the hr generalist who is currently working with hector to serve the hr needs for energy operations in ena
frank is working on a contract basis at this time
and sheila walton is seeking feedback on his performance to date in order to evaluate the duration of his work as a contractor and the feasibility of bringing him in as an employee
i have given sheila my feedback
but suggested to her that you may have had more contact with frank than i have had
please take the time to send sheila an e:mail message or voice mail to let her know what your experiences have been in working with frank
your input will be very valuable to sheila
thanks for taking the time to do this
i would like to formulate the breakout groups prior to the forum
i would like your input on likely persons to put together in these breakout sessions
let's talk tomorrow
i hope that you have fun
are marathon and fun mutally exclusive terms
we will see you on monday
sally
thanks for the note
i remembered that you will be coming in from london
hope the trip is uneventful
sunday evening will not be lengthy
as i am sure that you will be tired
we can't wait to see the three of you
tammy and tyler will be at home on wednesday afternoon and will be expecting you whenever they see you
meagan has drill team practice after school until 0:0 and she drives herself home and amanda rides the bus home after school
arriving about 0:0
mo will be in houston while you are here
if it still works with your plans
i thought that i would take the day off on friday
november 0 so that you
paul
david and i could do something fun with rebecca and tyler
the football game is that evening at 0:0
i had also thought about arranging a lunch on thursday
downtown
irma's
either for us with mo
or even to expand that to include a bunch of ex-first city folks
mark wilson
james scribner
chuch randall and charles delacey all work here for enron
we could call mg shetty
and with you and mo and me
it would be quite a reunion
let me know if you would like to do either one of these two things and i will arrange whatever sounds good to you
our phone numbers are
home 0-0-0 sally's office 0-0-0 david's cell
0-0-0 sally's cell
0-0-0
cary
thanks for the response
we will keep your name on the list and will contact you for any spring events
sally
you got the right one
thanks for telling me
but i already knew that without your having to tell me
i cherish having sisters and love you very much too
okay
maybe one of you is more cherished than the other
but don't tell cara i said that
thanks for the call
brenda herod is the operations controller for eim
brenda and brent in their roles over eim and egm
respectively
are both direct reports of mine
brenda is out of the country through the end of this week on vacation
touring europe with her mom
if there is a need to address this issue this week
let me know and i can start down that road until brenda returns
let me know
i did hear an unsubstantiated rumor this week that clickpaper.com is set to go live in london within 0 days
i am trying to find out if that is true
if it is
it would be a repeat of a commercial decision in houston to do so this past july without letting anyone in the mid and back office know
we had to scramble to set up an infrastructure to support that in a big hurry
not ideal
i hope that history has not repeated itself
let me know if you have heard anything on this
thanks for your note
i was great to meet you
i am glad that you could take the time out of the office to make the trip to houston
i will look forward to seeing you when i am next in london
sally
i think that four weeks is a good time frame for this
we can re-evaluate at the end of that period as to whether or not this is still needed
as far as the right time
you should talk with jeff gossett
gas
and scott earnest
global products
they can give you the best estimate on timing
i am copying them on this memo
when your schedule is set
i assume that you will provide jeff and scott with a copy of the schedule
dates
names and contact numbers
please send me a copy as well
this it presence on the floor during critical calculation times will be very much appreciated
i understand that not only will this provide immediate contact when and if system issues arise
but that your team will be working with the book administrators on improving spreadsheet macros
the week of november 0 is the week of the enron management conference in san antonio
it begins on wednesday evening
so most people will be travelling on wednesday afternoon
i will be in the office on monday and tuesday that week
so those days work well for me for your visit
i just wanted you to know about the conference in case that has an impact on other meetings that you might want to have in houston that week
let me know
i will look forward to seeing you and introducing you to others on the team
we are looking forward to seeing mo next week here in houston
have a great weekend
sally
please use my office for the interviews on november 0th
my office is eb0
if you need additional offices
you could contact several of my direct reports who have offices
brent price
brenda herod
bob hall
mary solmonson and james scribner
sally
i was probably hopelessly stuck in traffic when we were to talk
and did not even realize that the time had passed
construction on my route in to work is to continue until early january
and my alternate routes have proven to busts
i will call you tomorrow and see if i can catch you between issues
thanks for making the trip to houston with your crew last week
it was great to have people from so many different offices
supporting so many different commodities
and yet with so many similar issues
your support for the interaction between offices is so valuable
thanks again for all of your efforts
sally
please print this for me in color asap
i need to review it today and get back to louise
thanks
i did not see an attachment to this memo from mp
enron north america corp
lexi
in our meeting last week
i thought that we handled both greg and ryan
and were comfortable with round 0 interviews only
0 interviewers
with this disposition
greg as a keeper
wasn't he the one who worked in the career center
and no to ryan
i will be glad to do a phone interview this week with enron north america corp
i have attended three ase's and would be happy to visit with you about my opinions
i will ask patti to schedule a meeting
sally
i told tom last week that i have a standing systems meeting on thursdays at 0:0
so this change doesn't work for me
can we try 0:0 am on thursday this week
thanks
sally
thanks for setting this up and for copying me on the schedule
hopefully
this will be fruitful for everyone
and maybe unnecessary at some point in time
thanks
sally
i hope that each one of you will arrange your schedules tomorrow to make the time to vote
also
please encourage everyone on your staff to take the time to vote tomorrow
for those employees who typically work later hours
please suggest that they take the time to vote before coming to the office
everyone should feel that they have sufficient time to make their vote count
it should be interesting to watch the returns tomorrow evening
hopefully
we will have all played a part in the outcome
great
we will look forward to seeing you on the 0th and 0th
i will work on an agenda this week
and will send you something later in the week
sally
mark frevert has reviewed the attached addition to the upcoming organizational memo and has asked that i forward it to you to be included
this would be included in the section under commercial support
added as an additional bullet point beneath the one that addresses business analysis and reporting
i believe that these bullet points are on page 0 of the draft memo
please call me at x0 if you have any questions
enjoy the trip
two of our most fun vacations were at south seas planatation on captiva island
sorry that i didn't have time to respond to your e:mail from last week
it will be great if you can use some of the baby stuff
yes
the bed and changing table match
maple with a small amount of blue
not bright
trim on the bed and maple only on the changing table
our bedding could probably go either way
boy or girl
if i remember correctly
the bumpers are red ticking trimmed in blue chambray and the dust skirt is red ticking with blue chambray and red bandana trim
it's not as loud as it sounds
just take a look when you are here
we also have a beautiful cradle
with bedding
for you to look at and a great baby swing
as the baby gets older
we also have an entertainer
now takes the place of what we used to call walkers
i am mailing you a martha stewart magazine on babies
yes
she does those
too
as well as several cataloges that we get that have cute nursery items in them
yes
good news on dad
i hope that in the next few weeks that his medication will kick in and he will see some improvement
it is highly likely that the infection could be a cause of many symptoms that he has had
it is just great to have a good diagnosis and the proper treatment started
i think that he dodged a bullet on this one
we will look forward to seeing you and chris for thanksgiving
no big plans yet
i assume that everyone will be here by at least wednesday night
i have ordered a birthday cake from rj goodies to help celebrate all november birthdays that evening
am hoping that mom and dad may come over on tuesday so that we can do some fun things on wednesday during the day
always a great day to shop while everyone else is home getting ready for thanksgiving
i will have the whole week off from work
the kids are off starting on wednesday
it is possible that on friday
david
amanda and tyler may drive to longview to have a visit with his mom and family
if you can stay
we could really plan something fun if i an partially childless
it's late and i am out of paper
please print message and attachment for me for tuesday morning
thanks
i am so sorry about the fire
that must be awful
but i am so glad that no one was hurt
i had not heard about it until mo called me today
please let me know if there is anything that i can do
do you need me to get you anything over here and ship it to london
i can certainly understand that you will reconsider the trip to houston next week
i know that you must have hundreds of details to handle
my plan right now is to be off the week of thanksgiving
my nanny will be on vacation that whole week so that she can make a trip out of town
i may do some work early in the week
but likely from home
the week after thanksgiving i am supposed go to wellesley college
boston area
to interview for the analyst program
i am due at a reception on monday night
november 0
and i will interview on tuesday
november 0
assuming that i can get a flight back on tuesday night
i will be in the office here in houston wednesday through friday that week
would that work
sorry i am out so much in the next few weeks
just let me know
sally
this will work well
assuming steve and chris are available
hopefully
lexi will have their resumes for you tomorrow
thanks for your help
i will be in touch on details
thanks for your help
this should work well
assuming chris and steve are available
hopefully lexi will have resumes for you tomorrow
i will be in touch on details
thanks for your help
i will be in touch tomorrow on details
hopefully lexi will have resumes for you
if not
let me know
and some of us who interviewed on campus may have them still
sally
thanks for making this time change
i do know jana
she has worked in various positions within my group for years since she joined us in the analyst program
she has not been the strongest player
her level of accuracy has not been what we would have liked in many of the roles that she has played for us
confirmations and settlements
and despite feedback
she is one of those players that just has never quite viewed her performance level in the same light that we see it
she currently supports trading operations for south america
reporting to martha stevens under scott mills
let me check with scott on his thoughts about her current performance and on her in an hr role
i will let you know what he thinks
it may be to date that we just haven't had jana in the right role for her
if i remember correctly
she was originally a teacher who went back to school to get a business degree
very sweet
pleasant to work with and personable
i will get back with you after i have talked with scott
or i may have him leave you a message
thanks for your help on getting chris hanz lined up to talk with chris hoyle
if you don't get anyone to talk with john rodgers
don't worry about it
i may have someone that could talk with him from the enrononline team
_sally
i couldn't agree with you more
mike missed the point of our phone call this week
it was not to discuss the fine points of doorstep process or etiquette
the point was ownership of an integration process and deadlines that were missed
and how telling that when asked bluntly about his comfort level with controls for us operations that mike's response was a deferral to marcelo
i have a one-hour conference call set up with mike tomorrow
this is one of the things that we will discuss
sally
good memo
i will be curious to see if you get any comments or response from the commercial guys
sally
i know that there was a pretty serious set of audit findings from the tx rrcommission earlier this year
i suspect this is a result of that
brenda herod was involved in the download meeting with the rep from the trrc
if she hasn't already told you about that meeting
you may to visit with her on that
sally
i have only taken a quick look at the attachment
but thought that i would forward it to you
does it make sense
$0mm in equipment charges for us
does that include depreciation
which is not equipment
can you give me the detail again on everything that falls under the
consultant
line
what is it and which rc's and rc owners have items there
thanks
sally
you have the right sally beck
i grew up around the corner from your dad and used to eat thursday fried chicken lunches at tattie's house
now your house
with jim and the whole family
plus your mom and i used to spend the night at each other's houses when we were in elementary school
i had heard through my sister cara
who interviewed your grandad for a usta publication
that you were heading to enron upon graduation
i would love to visit with you about your experience so far at enron
call my assistant
patti thompson
at x0 and let's set up a time to get together
monday or tuesday next week would be good
i look forward to seeing you
by the way
our oldest daugher
age 0
is meagan worthing beck
sally
thanks for your comments on the standards
our approach in creating a global exception reporting mechanism is to start simply and build from there
our initial cut is to have effective exception reporting on a handful of critical standards by the end of this year
that will be a first
to on a daily basis have a view into the exceptions outside the global standards
many of the measurements that you mention are great management tools for accessing the level of excellence of the services that we are delivering and the competence of those that are managing these services
some of these may be more appropriately contained in a monthly operations report that i have instituted within ena and which we are working to proliferate across all of the wholesale merchant services companies
give me a call and we can set a time to get together for a few minutes and i can review this operating report with you
we spent some time at our offsite in late october with all operations controllers reviewing and discussing these standards
shona has taken a stab at the format of these exception reports
it is likely that we will have a rep from each of the operating companies participate in the final design of these reports
so that all feel as if they own the intended output from these reports
yes
we are gleaning this information from those that are responsible for these activities
my purpose is not to use this info to punish or prosecute
but instead to use this exception report as a tool to garner resources as needed to clear the exceptions
it is invariably the deals that are exceptions in some way that create the problems
for instance
small power deals that were done in calgary before they had a power book set up
these were
on the side
and not captured in total power exposure because they didn't have a book to put them in
a discovery during the doorstep review
if this goes on the exception report
then we can highjack someone in risk in houston to help calgary set up a new book
or get it resources focused quickly on any solution that may require their input to fix
by having a prescribed elevation of these exceptions
we should get the appropriate attention to correct them
the spur for making sure that all exceptions are appropriately noted
will be that if there is a problem with any deal that was an exception
not in the books
no confirm
etc
and was not included on the exception report
that this will be grounds for termination for the appropriate operations controller
i will make sure that as we start this reporting process that this is well understood
the other impetus will be that during doorstep reviews the operational activities will be gauged against these standards
the aa internal audits should also access adherence to these
thanks for the note
i will definitely look for you in san antonio
i would love to hear about your new role
we miss seeing you in ena
i guess that is now enron americas
sally
please print for me
thanks
i have tried but cannot get the attachment to open to look at the report produced by london
do you have a hard copy that i can see
i can get it from you during the risk forum luncheon today
thanks
thanks for the suggestions for richard
let me know if you think of other ideas
i need b'day and christmas ideas
probably the easiest thing to bring for thanksgiving could be a dessert
or something else that is a favorite of your family
i know that it is really kind of hard to travel with food
particularly since you will probably be working on wednesday morning
i have made thanksgiving dinner for so many years
one of the few times that i really like to cook
that i will be glad to cover it
your company will be the very best thing that you can bring
we are looking forward to having you all here
the sleeper sofa for the media room will arrive this friday
i am glad that the information that i sent was useful to you
i had originally planned to be at wellesley for the interviews on campus
i now have business commitments in houston that will keep me from making the trip
but i am certainly glad that you are included in the interviews
please feel free to call me if you have any questions either before or after the interview process
sally
please put this on my calendar
i can't get this to print and it is too small for me to read
pecan pie would be great
i have tried but do not do that very well
but i love it
i will probably make pumpkin chiffon and lemon/raspberry pie
so pecan would be a great addition
mom is going to do the rolls
we will put the reserved sign on the guest room for you
improvements in those quarters as well
i recently cleaned out the guest room closet
bought new towels and have ordered new luggage racks
we will use the old luggage racks in the media room
cool new blanket for the sofa bed in there
however
so cara and chris won't suffer too much
andrew parsons is currently leading a project to define and quantify the costs for several different alternatives for disaster recovery
we should get an update from him to see if there is anything applicable
there is sheer disaster that impacts many companies/locations
which may require one approach
and then there is nusance stuff
frozen freeways in houston
etc
that really requires an updated contact list and set of notification procedures
and then there is system failure and the requisite back up
please let brent know that i will be on vacation on monday
november 0th
i will actually be in the office for meetings from 0:0 to 0:0 that day
but i will be vacation that morning
thanks
sally
i will serve as your representative in the year end 0 associates prc meeting
ena management committee i represented some of you during the mid-year prc meeting
and some of you are new to my list of associates to represent
i have copied you on an e:mail message that i sent to your supervisor of record as of october 0
according to the records of the analysts and associates program
you will note that i have asked your supervisor to provide a list of your accomplishments for the second half of the year
as well as a description of your job responsibilities
you may want to take charge of creating this information
in addition to the input that i have requested from your supervisor
it would be helpful for me to have a copy of your resume
not necessary to repeat
if you gave me one at mid-year
while the prc process will focus on your accomplishments during the prescribed time period at enron
it enhances my ability to represent you in the process if i have some background information on you
my assistant will contact you during the next few days to set up a time for me to meet with each one of you
if you would like to do so before the prc meeting
these meetings will be scheduled during the weeks of november 0 and december 0
i will also meet or talk with your supervisor during those two weeks in preparation for the prc meeting
feel free to call me if you have any questions about the process
i will be out of the office the remainder of this week and most of next week
but i will check and respond to voice mail messages
my number is x0
you are right
we are all in the same boat
or plane
or not on a plane
i have tried to get the associates prc meeting date switched with the analyst prc meeting
scheduled for december 0th
this switch actually was arranged last week by working with jana g
in the aa program
however
charlene jackson has apparently taken exception to that and is reportedly talking with dave delainey about this
keep me posted
and i will let you know if i hear anything new
sally
please print and put this in my folder for prc
thanks
thanks for the note
the family is doing well
keeping us busy with a teenager driver
one in junior high and tyler who is almost three
hope that you and your family are doing well
i know that you must be busy at ees
enjoy this upcoming holiday season
sally
thanks for keeping me posted on the prc meeting
i will make travel plans for the afternoon of december 0th accordingly
sally
i will be out of the office tomorrow and i have asked mary solmonson to attend in my place
have a great thanksgiving
sally
could there be other counterparties that have the same concern as hess
you will have to explain to me what the issue was
thanks
sally
i am out of the office all day on wednesday
sally brenda flores-cuellar@enron
i will be out of the office on tuesday
so have a great time without me
have a great thanksgiving
sally brenda flores-cuellar@enron
thanks
definitely not too late
sally
thanks for the resume
she has had some good experience
do you know much about her performance here at enron
can i call and talk with her directly
i would certainly keep the conversation confidential at this point
sally
thanks for this info
i will call the students this week
with your notes
it looks as if we may be on target in terms of acceptances and the desired number of 0
keep me posted on what we hear from the students
sally enron north america corp
is this what you have from aa as a format/information that they are comfortable with
sally
the responsibility for granting access to the dpr and associated reports available through the executive viewer on line is being shifted from scott tholen's team to my operations team
this makes a lot of sense
since it is our group that prepares all of these reports
fernley dyson has requested access to this information via the executive viewer
in insuring a tight distribution list for these reports
please let me know via return e:mail or voice mail
x0
that you would like for fernley to have access to the enron-wide dpr
thanks
attached is the list of prc meetings that will cover operations for ena
eim and egm
location
times and attendees are listed for each meeting
there are five pre-review meetings that will take place starting today through december 0 in preparation for the energy operations prc meeting that will be held on friday
december 0
i invite you to sit in on any or all of these meetings if you would like to do so
the most meaningful meeting will be on december 0th
in that meeting
we will review the results from the pre-review meetings for senior specialists and below
i would anticipate that if at each pre-review meeting the preferred distribution is met as instructed
then this portion of the meeting will not take too long
we will then review in more detail the managers
who will have been pre-ranked in the pre-review meetings
we will also review and rank the directors and senior directors
i can also be prepared to review my suggested rankings for the three vp's who report to me
with you
wes colwell and david oxley in attendance
call me if you have any questions
sally
i have attached a listing of planned prc meetings for operations that will be held in houston
there will be a number of pre-review meetings that will be held over the next two weeks in preparation for an energy operations prc meeting to be held on friday
december 0th
the pre-meetings are necessary due to the sheer size of the groups
in addition to the meetings detailed in this schedule
brent's team in egm is having pre-meetings as well
the december 0th meeting will include all operations personnel from ena
egm and eim
we will review the results from the pre-review meetings for senior specialists and below
i have asked that the results from the pre-review meetings mirror the
preferred distribution
which as you probably know suggests that 0% of the population will not receive a bonus and should therefore be in the bottom two categories
assuming that appropriate work has been done at the pre-review meetings
this review on the 0th should not be too lengthy
we will take considerably more time as we review the managers
who will have been pre-ranked as well
this will give us a good jumping off point for the cross calibration discussions
we will then review and rank the directors and senior directors
we will also be discussing suggested promotions during this meeting as well
finally
assuming that i still have david oxley and wes colwell captive and attentive
i will discuss my suggested rankings for the three vp's who report to me
we will of course pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels that we are reviewing
initial make up of the december 0th prc is me and my direct reports within ena
brent and his direct reports within egm and brenda herod from eim
i have also extended an invitation to louise kitchen to attend the december 0th meeting
i do not know yet if she will attend
do you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this year
i think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the year to help facilitate this
would you like to attend the meeting here in houston on december 0th
is there a planned meeting in london that would make sense for me to attend
let me know your thoughts
sally
meant to copy you on this reply to mike
but forgot to do so before my initial send
here it is
thanks for sending the announcement to me
you will be a great asset to ebs
and you will probably be working with some of our old energy operations staff members
stay in touch and i wish you the best in your new role
sally
can you coordinate the scott tholen's team to do this asap
thanks
keep me updated on when fernley will have access
thanks
i have this on my calendar
i have jury duty on tuesday starting at 0:0 am
i hope to make that short and sweet and be back here as soon as i can
so i should be able to make the meeting at 0:0
i will call you if i get hung up at the court house
sally enron north america corp
she was superior
top of the table
her written review should be in the file
let me know if hr can not produce that for you and i can get you a copy
sally
thanks for the heads up
i get so many of these requests and never can tell what is being requested
your note made this one fast and easy to handle
thanks
i have been summoned for jury duty ontuesday
november 0 at 0:0 am
while wanting to fulfill my civic duty
i am also hoping to be an unlikely juror this time around so that i can be back in the office sometime on tuesday
i will call in and let patti know my status
i will be attending wes colwell's prc meeting on december 0th
it starts at 0:0 and may not take the entire day
i will talk with wes and see what he anticipates for timing to let you know if it makes sense to schedule me to interview
sally enron north america corp
i have completed preliminary rankings on the attached sheet
you had included my name
and i did not put in a preliminary rank
brent price's name is missing
i would put him in the excellent category at this time
let me know if you need anything else
it is possible that i may change a few of the preliminary rankings as i get more information from my direct reports who supervise certain directors
i will let you know
sally
i still agree that this is not the time for promotion to vp
kristin certainly did an outstanding job in her role within ena during the first half of the year
i would like to see her develop a broader view across the organization and be able to be more effective in working with others and sharing her knowledge and experience before she is promoted to vp
i guess that the one caveat that i would put out
is to wait and see if there are other names brought forth from other parts of the organization that would make it seem that kristin should be in that pack
sally
i think that it is a great idea to compare recommendations for promotions
our meeting will take place on december 0th
so we can be ready to discuss promotion recommendations as early as monday
december 0
when would be a good time for you
the invitation to attend our december 0th meeting still stands
i know that it is along way to come for a single meeting
although it will most likely be a fully day
but if there are other things that you could accomplish while here
it could be worth it
sally
i had to report for jury duty today
along with 0 others from harris county
and to my surprise i was selected to be a juror in a felony case
the case will continue on wednesday
so our scheduled time for a conference call may not work
i will try to reach you from my car while i am on my way in for jury duty
probably around 0:0 or 0:0 houston time
thanks for including me
unfortunately
i will be out of town at an offsite meeting with the ena management team from december 0
0
sally
fyi
is there anything that i can do to help you and jo
tyler has school on tuesdays and thursdays
but my nanny is at home with him on the other days
would it help for her to take albert
sally
flight times are good
please insure that my hotel reservation is for a non-smoking room
thanks
sally
to my surprise
i was chosen today to sit on a jury to hear a felony charge
the judge believes that we can conclude the trial by end of the day on wednesday or perhaps on thursday
i will be back here working after trial hours in the office and checking voice mail messages during breaks in the proceedings
i will be back full time as soon as my civic duty is fulfilled
enron is well presented in the court system over the next few days
i sat by mark koenig in the jury assembly room today
and he too was chosen to serve on another jury
sorry that i didn't get to call you on my way to the courthouse yesterday
i was conducting lots of business back and forth with the houston office during the drive and just ran out of time
we reconvene in court this morning
to have what i hope will be final deliberation on sentencing
having found the guy guilty on both counts
prior to the start of a trial
the defendant must choose either judge or jury to administer the sentence if the defendant is found guilty
he chose the jury
i am in the office now for an 0:0 meeting with jeff skilling regarding the upcoming associates prc meeting
to which i am a rep
if i don't get a chance to reach you today
i will call during my commute tomorrow
sally by the way
i thought that when i put
energy executive
as my occupation on the jury summons form
that i would be deemed to be too conservative and too corporate to be chosen for the jury
not the case
in fact
mark koenig
enron's evp of investor relations
was summoned for jury duty on tuesday as well
and he too was chosen to be on a different jury
the whole thing is actually very fascinating
just bad timing for me to be out so much this week
but then
there never is a good time
i understand that the return e:mail that i sent to kim rizzi on november 0th was not opened by hr
please note on my e:mail below that i had asked for clarification on brent price
this was the second e:mail that i had sent to kim regarding brent with no reply back
my first message had noted for kim that brent was left out of my list
and asked whether or not rick causey planned to supply a pre-ranking for brent or if i needed to do so
can you clarify this for me
brent reports to me as the head of operations for egm and to rick causey in his role as cao of egm
here are the appropriate pre-rankings for grouped by level
superior excellent strong satisfactory needs improv
issues hall sr
directors solmonson reeves herod scribner directors thomas mills superty henenberg perez wilson venturatos
i have been on jury duty since tuesday this week
i had patti call chris today and let him know that i would get back with him next week
i will keep you posted as i have time to focus on that next week
thanks for following up
sally enron north america corp
i'm glad to know that she is home
i can just imagine how much fun those oxygen treatments will be
i know that you will be thankful to have your whole family under the same roof
sally
i am resending this memo regarding the information that i need from you as cheryl ingstad's supervisor as i prepare to represent her in the associates prc meeting next week
i am tied up in other prc meetings on december 0
0 and 0
so i am doing my homework earlier rather than later this week
please note the bullet points in the memo below which outline the information that i need
i do have copies of the internal feedback forms and cheryl's self-evaluation
let me know if you have any questions
i know that things are very busy right now
but it is important to the associates that their reps in the prc process are well prepared
your input will help me with that
thanks
sally
please print this memo and attachments in color for me
thanks
sally
i am not available to interview on december 0th
i will be in a prc meeting
try me next time
sally enron north america corp
thanks for letting us know about blake
i just tried to reach him and left a congratulatory message on his answering machine
january 0th and february 0th sound good
meagan has a big dance on jan
0th
and i need to be here to help with prep and to take pictures
february 0th is our anniversary
0nd
so that is probably not a good date either
so if you can make one of the other two dates work
i would love to come
just keep me posted
well
she declined our kind offer
didn't she
as busy as life is between work and home for me right now
i can't say that it will bother me too much to attend a shower where someone else makes the finger sandwiched and punch
do be on the look out for the perfect pack of diaper pins
i noticed some at a rack at randall's the other day
just kidding
hope you all are doing fine
i was on jury duty three days last week
really interesting
but totally screwed up my schedule at work
i have been doing double-time to try to catch up
especially since i plan to be off the week of december 0th
as you know
exceeding this limit would require contacting the enron board of directors
jeff skilling is keenly interested in this measurement
in conversations with ted murphy today
jeff has asked that he receive a daily report from ted on component v@r
ted called me about 0:0 pm today
houston time
to let me know about this requirement
obviously
we want to meet skilling's request with information that is as timely
accurate and complete as possible
therefore
we were concerned about feeds from london that over the past several weeks have caused one london commodity or another to be excluded from the first run of component v@r
mike
i assume that you are very familiar with these feed problems from your representative that you send to the daily 0:0 meeting
i pulled steve stock out of a pre-prc meeting to meet with ted
shona
ramesh and me at 0:0 today
realizing that the time was very late in london
we tried to reach you both at home numbers and by cell phone to include you in the meeting
since we could not do so
we continued without you given that skilling will want to see this report daily starting tomorrow
here is the key fact to know
it takes 0 hours to run the component v@r calculations
once all inputs have been received and processed
the component v@r calculations are kicked off at 0:0 am houston time
producing an approximate completion time of 0:0 am houston time
with this timeframe
our goal would be to have the component v@r report to jeff by approximately 0:0 am houston time
given current calculation times
in order to consistently calc component v@r including all london feeds
london books
uk power
uk gas and nordic power
will have to be completed
calculated and officialized by 0:0 am houston time
0:0 am london time
if this time frame is not met
then component v@r reports for jeff will be incomplete
we had hoped to discuss this with you today so that you could work with your operations staff
systems support and traders to insure that you could consistently meet a 0:0 am london requirement for officialized books
the other immediate action to take is to ask mike to work with david hardy on what we understand to be an almost-completed task of including uk spread options in v@r calculations using the v@r engine
those v@r calculations that are done through excel calculations are not captured and included in the component v@r calculations
while there are other commodities that will currently be excluded from component v@r reports
they are deemed to be less material than the uk spread options
ramesh felt that it is only a matter of days before this is completed
mike
we would like for you to stay on top of this from an operations perspective to insure that this happens
i should note that the firm 0:0 am deadline for officializing books in the uk will only result in producing a report for jeff by 0:0 am houston time
we don't know what jeff's expectation will be regarding timing
it is probably safe to say that we should be actively looking at process and systems changes that could result in the ability to deliver such a report earlier in the morning
mike
i will call you during my morning commute on thursday to see whether or not you have any questions or if there are concerns about consistently meeting the 0:0 am deadline in london
whew
your schedule makes me tired
i am sure that brigeda is happy that you are involved in so many activities with her school
and then on the other hand
sometimes you wonder if they notice
work sounds crazy for you
but how nice that you will be off from december 0 until the 0nd
i hope that make it over the week before christmas
the week is kind of crazy for us
so i am trying to find a time that will work
sunday the 0th we are having a dessert party at our house
inviting neighbors
old huntwick friends
etc
it is for families
and meagan and amanda each included 0 of their friends in the invitiation list
along with their familities
it will be multi-generational
i hope fun
as it would be a nice tradition to continue
on monday
i think that david plans to take tyler and amanda to longview for a visit
a commitment that meagan and i have to sort toys at northwest assistance ministries from 0:0 to 0:0 that day has excused us from the trip
so it may be best for meagan and me to drive over to austin after 0:0 on monday
we could be back by the time david and company return to houston on tuesday afternoon
wednesday we have matinee tickets to see a christmas carol at the alley theater
sans tyler
thursday i am having all of my girls in ncl over to wrap gifts for the family that we have adopted for christmas and then we will deliver the presents
and friday is tyler's birthday
with a 0 dalmation theme planned
cake ordered from rj goodies
but nothing else done yet
so i really think that our only shot to make it to austin is for monday night
which would mean only meagan and me
i talked with mom last night and invited dad and her to houston for christmas
i don't really think that they will come
but if they do
i hope that doesn't mess up your christmas
they have only been here for one or two christmases with us since we have had kids
i think that tyler at 0 this year will be particularly enthralled
and next year they will have 0 grandchildren in austin
so it just seemed that this could be a good year for them to come
she said she would think about it
and i told her that i wanted her to know that we would love to have them
but that it was perfectly okay if they decided that they did not want to come
how about dad playing golf this week
what a difference
i am so glad that he is doing better
i hear you about mom
i think that a blow-up or some drama is highly predictable
unfortunately
she seems to do that a lot at special occassions for cara
doesn't she
i will certainly help in any way i can
and i will be very interested in the gosipy details
happy baking
i do have to make 0 batches of fudge tonight and tomorrow night so that i can attend a cookie exchange luncheon on saturday armed with 0 packages of fudge
this is hilarious
i am laughing outloud
good memo
let me know if you see results
enron north america corp
i had lunch with barry yesterday and suggested that they might benefit from attending these meetings
hope you don't mind my extending that invitation
sally
i hope that you got my reminder message that i was attending wes colwell's prc meeting today
which kept me from attending the enw staff meeting over lunch today
my remaining prc obligations are as follows
friday
dec
0 energy operations prc 0:0 am until
monday
dec
0 ` enron wholesale services prc 0:0
0:0 am wednesday
dec
0 associates 0:0 am until
the enron americas management team offsite scheduled for las vegas december 0-0 had been cancelled
so i will be in the office all of next week
did you get to check on lunch plans for thursday or friday next week with directs
this looks like it could conflict
in cleaning up e:mails
i ran across this one that i had not yet read
has james called and talke with you about enpower
are his concerns in the memo accurate
let me know
sally
what is the latest on this one
i gather that they are still using spreadsheets
which in and of itself is not necessarily a problem
are their positions not being captured and aggregated
what does scott mills have to say about this
sally
thanks for the heads up
very belated reply
i am cleaning up old e:mails today
and came across this one that i had not answered
commercial does not sign confirmations at this point
too many to make that practical these days
when i started the confirm desk in 0
traders were signing confirms at that time
once they knew that they had someone who would take responsibility to make sure they were right
they were very glad to pass that responsibility to me
in the early days of power
the traders once again were signing confirms
obviously interested in the details of every deal that was done
but as the business grew
that too changed
sally
yes
you are nuts
i can't believe that you already have so many gingerbread houses made
the cookie exchange was fun
fudge is definitely the easy route on that one
i will get the recipe from home tonight and will e:mail it to you tomorrow
sally
did debbie talk with the two of you before putting together her memo
is she raising this to me because she wasn't comfortable with the outcome of her conversations with you two
or did she skip that step
just curious
before i send any type of response
i would need details from you around the process for updates to entelligence and global counterparty
surely one feeds the other
sally
i will call you tonight
i certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database should flow to update gcp
i assume that you have talked with both mary solmonson and james scribner about this process to understand the details
they are the logical experts for that discussion
your memo is a little vague on that
so if you are getting information from someone else and have not taken the time to talk with the best sources
i would suggest spending time with james and mary so that you and they are appropriately informed
absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to gcp
i believe that these are pretty manual
as there are no systematic feeds from entelligence into gcp
james and mary
i refer to both because james has only recently assumed mary's duties within global databases
can best discuss how this process works
if you are aware of specific concerns around this
i know that james and mary will want to hear that from you
as is to be expected for any business that has experienced a 0% increase in the number of transactions year on year
there are challenges that we face daily in all of the tasks that we do
your input will help james in making sure that priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues that we have
i recognize the challenge that credit must be facing in aggregating exposures in our market environment today
with your input
we will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 0.0+ deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible
will it resources make a difference in what we need to deliver and how quickly we can do it
someone must be giving credit the idea that
if only we had it resources
and that those resources are active on entelligence but are not helping us on other business basics
sally
how about our resources
is there someone working on entelligence now for us that could at least temporarily be redirected to work on updating gcp appropriately
here it is
call or e:mail
either one is great
i do hope that you are working with james directly on these issues as they surface
it is still not clear to me whether or not you two have spent time together on these issues
i will always support whatever changes can be made to our processes or controls that will insure better information
because i can't personally do all of the work
i just want to be sure that you are plugged in to work directly with the right management team members on my team
i don't think that we are purposefully doing duplicate work
i believe that the manual process that moves information from the entelligence team to gcp has apparently not worked as well as was designed
while sorry that the results haven't been as expected
we are glad to have your input now to help address this
james has reassigned the resources from entelligence for now to work with mary gosnell on updates to gcp that i understand have been prioritized with you
thanks for following up on this
thanks for rounding up the tickets for the orange bowl
you can mail them to me
or just hold them until i see you after christmas
mike's wife decided not to make the trip
so he won't be using the tickets
jody crook will use the other two tickets
lunch during the week between christmas and new years sounds great to me
i will be working that week
but would be glad to meet you guys at champions for lunch if that is best
or if you are game for irma's
just let me know when you would like to come downtown
sally
i meant to blind copy you on this
here it is
thanks for looking into this and getting back to me
let me know the final resolution on this one
cathy
i plan to be on vacation next week and therefore will not be at the december 0th staff meeting
i left mike a message telling him that i was forwarding this to you and that someone on your team would verify this information and get back to him
his note asks for info back by friday the 0th
friday is the 0th and i assume that is the deadline that he intends
thanks
sally
i went by the store on my way home and saw a pillsbury mix with red and green confetti in it
decided that cupcakes would be simpler than cookies
since it was after 0:0 when i got started on this project
it turned out be a good decision
i would like your recipe so that when we are doing baking for the family next week that i can use it
thanks for the heads up
i will be here all day tomorrow
sally
i didn't get back from the meeting with causey and buy until just before 0:0 today
not that the meeting was long
rick causey was just running late so we cooled our heels outside his office for quite a while before getting started
i decided that midnight would be outside the bounds of office dedication
so i did not call
enjoy your time off tomorrow and on monday
my plans are to take off next week
and to be back in the office to work the week between christmas and new years
i wouldn't recommend taking your time during your day off to call
but if you finish your christmas shopping and do want to call
my calendar is free all afternoon after lunch tomorrow
wish i could send you with a shopping list for me
fyi
despite the fact that this an ou student
i thought that you would find this note interesting
since we compete with big 0 for talent at several schools
we should be aware of the make up of some of their job offers that lure students to join them
paying for a masters degree at uva ahead of time is certainly an interesting piece of this job offer
see note from lexi below
the analyst/associates program plans to send the prc reps a final listing of the prc results by tuesday
december 0th
they asked that we not communicate results until after that date
i did not write down all results from the meeting
so i would be glad to let you know
but would prefer to wait until i have written documentation of final results in front of me before doing so
both remi and don black were able to add to my discussion around erwin
so he was well respresented in the process
i am scheduled to be out on vacation next week
but i will check e:mail messages from home and will get back with you via e:mail next week to let you know final results
hope that you enjoy the holidays
i will be back at work right after christmas
sally
great to hear from you
i was thinking about you today
i will look forward to your starting on the 0th
certainly if anything comes up with the move or the family
feel free to shift that date as needed
i will be glad to have you as part of the team and think that we will have fun working together
i am on vacation next week
lots of shopping
wrapping
baking planned
plus tyler's birthday party
and i am really looking forward to that
i do feel as if i have been the prc queen recently
wes
prc last thursday
mine on friday
enron wholesale services
minus europe
with mark frevert on monday of this week and a full day
0:0 am to 0:0 pm on wednesday for the associates prc
i do need a break
i will be working the week after christmas
although we do have a holiday on december 0th
we will trading that day
lots of my logistics and risk guys will be in
so i will probably make an appearance that day
i will be in for full days on the 0th
0th
very few commitments on the calendar for those days
so just let me know when you would like to get together
hope that you
frank and lauren have a wonderful christmas holiday
sally
patti will send you on monday a draft of a memo regarding publishing the dpr during the holidays
please review it and make sure that the commitments we are making can be met by london
let me know if anything needs to be changed or if there is further clarification needed in the notes
keeping in mind that with the audience on the memo that i want it to be short and easy
your comments/suggestions are welcomed and needed before i send this out later next week
thanks
sally
i will be out of the office on vacation during the week of december 0
please refer to the contact names below as needed during that week
i can be reached at my home number
0-0-0
if necessary
dpr chris abel x0 mpr david maxwell x0 gas operations bob hall x0 leslie reeves x0 power operations stacey white x0 leslie reeves x0 canadian operations peggy hedstrom 0-0-0 i will be back in the office on wednesday
december 0 through friday
december 0
i will also be in for part of the day on tuesday
december 0
although that is an enron holiday
there will be appropriate logistics personnel and book administrators in the office to support trading activities that day
i understand from shona that you and she have discussed our plans for doorstep reviews in 0
i am asking via this note for my assistant to set up a meeting for the two of us to spend some time reviewing the timeline
methodology
andersen's involvement and the involvement of your team
i will be on vacation the week of december 0
i will be working the week between christmas and new year's
so if you are in the office we can plan on getting together that week
got your most recent message
your observation is correct that the enron americas staff member on shawn's team has not been involved to date with doorstep reviews or planning
although shawn made an offer to michelle some time ago
there was a long lead time for her arrival
she did not start with the company until after thanksgiving
since she started a couple of weeks ago
wes and i have asked her to look into several specific findings from the most aa internal audit projects and to work with our staffs to provide some solutions to issues that were raised
there simply has not been the time to date to expose her to doorstep
after shawn and i meet
see below
i will briefly summarize for you the roles that all groups will play in the doorstep review process
before we move forward i want to be sure that all parties agree on the purpose
methodology
participants and execution plan for this on-going project
the following schedule has been distributed as noted regarding publishing the dpr over the next two weeks
i know that books run in calgary
houston
and portland will be calculated and officialized on friday
december 0nd for trading that day
the current plan is not to publish the dpr for december 0nd on tuesday
december 0th
but to wait until the first enron official business day to do so
i.e
wednesday
december 0th
that will work as long as trading results for friday
december 0nd are not dramatic
please leave a voice mail message after calcing the books on friday
december 0nd for chris abel
x0
to give him trading results by commodity for december 0nd
if there are dramatic results
chris may produce a preliminary and rough dpr on tuesday
december 0th with the information that you provide
for locations that will not calc and officialize books on friday
december 0nd
you will still need to contact chris to give him your best estimate of trading results
thanks for your continuing help in providing timely and accurate information for the worldwide trading organization
i hope that all of you enjoy your holidays
we are making some progress with the timeliness of london information
more to come
thanks for including me in the invitation to slick willie's
unfortunately
i will not be able to attend
i will be at the orange bowl in miami and will not return until the morning of the 0th
unfortunately
i will miss your farewell at slick willie's on january 0rd
i am sorry that i won't be able to drink a beer with you as a send off
but perhaps we can have one in london later in january as your welcome to london
i will be in miami on january 0rd
hopefully celebrating an oklahoma win in the orange bowl earlier that day
david found us tickets to the game
not great seats
but they are in the stadium
hey
it's not ut
but it should still be fun to go
i will miss you and your wit and constructive cynisism in houston
but i know that i can count on you to be just as vocal from london
i plan to be there at least quarterly in 0
and will definitely welcome your first hand observations on operational areas that may need attention
hopefully between e:mail and voice mail we can definitely keep in touch
tell ann that i hope that this will be a great adventure for her and the whole family
i think that it is a wonderful time in your children's lives to give them this experience
have fun
and set them straight
good memo on contacts
thanks for copying me
have a wonderful vacation
i know that you will be glad to have jordan back with you
sally
i should have included you on this contact list
i will remember to do so next time
i will be in the office all of this week
so please call me directly on any information needs you or team may have this week
you should see this reply from mike
it is more positive than the response from james new
sounds as if they have not yet finished their document on required changes to processes
systems
commercial practices
etc
to move to a same day calculation of their books
mike and i have talked about this as a longer term goal for the london office and i knew that he was working with james and others to come up with a plan and a timeline
i expect to review that with mike when he has it in a draft form that warrants that discussion
that is why you haven't yet seen the document
sally
hope that christmas with your family was fun and that your days off for shopping were fruitful
i enjoyed my week off before christmas
but certainly felt as if i worked very hard
shopping
wrapping
baking
volunteering
birthday party for tyler on the 0nd
0 years old
not very good planning to throw that into the mix each christmas season
etc
it is nice to be back in the office this week
although i still have all of those christmas decorations to put away sometime soon
i have tentatively planned a trip to the london office during the week of january 0
i will fly over on sunday
so that i would have monday through thursday in the office there
i have blocked those days on my calendar and patti has made flight reservations for me just to hold that week open
how does that work with your schedule
will you be in the office that week and what is your schedule like
i certainly wouldn't occupy all of your time during that week
but i wouldn't want to make the trip that week if you don't have some time available
let me know
and then we can firm up discussions topics and agendas
my thought on that particular week is that it gets us past year end closing issues and that i could be back in the office during the week of january 0 and thereafter to communicate bonus information
i am in the office all of this week
sally
to continue to keep you in the loop
looks like mike is moving in the right direction on this
sally
the items noted look like a good start to earlier detection of issues that may require reruns of valuation
thanks for marshalling the right resources to make this happen
i will look forward to seeing your process timelines for current
iterim and target final state
if my trip to london in mid-january works for your schedule
maybe this is something that we could go over then
sally
can you put a referenced as of date on the spreadsheet itself
if you print the spreadsheet for reference after receiving the e:mail
there is no as of date that appears on the print out of the spreadsheet
your attachment includes the date as the name of the file
but this does not appear when you simply print our the attached spreadsheet
thanks
sally beck
i am meeting with shona tomorrow to review the scheduling of doorstep reviews for the first quarter
as long as the new york review isn't the week of january 0th
then i think i will still target that week for a london trip
don't feel as if you have to clear the whole week for me
i know that you are very busy
so i expect that we will work in time together around critical things that you need to handle
i will try to send you a list of topics that i would like to cover by the end of the day tomorrow to give us a starting point
you may have some suggestions on others that i should meet with while i am there
thanks
sally
thanks for letting me know
i am sure that you have communicated with the portland risk group regarding this slip up
what assurances have you gotten from them about their diligence in the future in officializing books
do you think that everyone there is on board and aware of how important this is
sally
kim
do you have an estimated completion date for the commodities where the notation is that information is being compiled
my guess would be that the one commodity that is up-to-date
financial power
is the one with the lowest number of transactions
that means that the lion's share of the work is still to be done
are we staffed to get this completed in a timely manner
as i mentioned to you before
i would not hesitate enlisting jeff sorenson to do much of catch up work if we are short on people to get this done promptly
let me know if you need his help
and i will visit with brent price
i know that brent would support jeff's involvement to get his caught up
who specifically will be responsible on an on-going basis to handle for the rmt confirmations
will we have some sort of report that we can send to stephen each month that will indicate the completion of this task so that he is comfortable on an on-going basis that this is being kept up-to-date
sally
i saw kim's response to stephen douglas
but it left me short of comfort on a completion timeline or enough details around assurance on an on-going basis that this will be kept up
i sent the note below to kim
i am sure that she manages well
but i think that we should encourage her to step into full responsibility and to be able to effectively communicate that within the organization
it is likely that when stephen reads her note
that he will call me and tell me that he still doesn't know when this task will be completed
that was his concern yesterday
and kim's note really doesn't address that
if she doesn't have an estimated completion date
then she should set a target date for having all of the info compiled and state that at that date she will be able to create a realistic timeline for completing the task
kim must own and communicate effectively the solutions
or i will be the one that gets the phone calls
the ena organization must develop confidence in others on our team
let's help kim earn that confidence by coaching her to imagine the info that the customers needs
stephen
and to clearly communicate information that addresses his needs
thanks
i have always worked right up until my due date
there is a lot of waiting and somehow i thought that the time passed more quickly if i was in the office in my normal routine
meagan was due on wednesday
may0
i set my last date of work for friday
may 0
mom came in that weekend for mothers
day
you were with her
right
and then we did stuff the next couple of days until meagan was born
with amanda
i owned the shop at the time and i was probably in the shop the morning of the day she was born
she was a week late
so we just didn't know what to expect
tyler's due date was december 0
and i set my last day of work for the friday before that date
of course
then he was late
but we were in the throws of remodeling
so i was out picking out carpet and paint in those final days
a lot of this probably depends on how tired you are and whether or not you feel like you have everything at the house ready
i still had a lot of energy at the end of my pregnancies and i had also managed to get rooms ready early
so i enjoyed working as long as i could
definitely make a point of you and chris going to some movies at the theater before the baby comes
you won't be able to do that for quite a while afterwards
i have completed internal feedback forms through the pep system for brent price
bob hall and peggy hedstrom
those appeared to be the only names that you included for which you wanted my input
somehow
from andrea's voice mail message last week
i had anticipated responding to more requests
i thought perhaps input in working with wes within ena or melissa on sap
those weren't on my list within the pep system
so i just wanted you to know that i have responded to the three that were there
if there was intent for me to respond to any others
they weren't accessible in the system
believe me
i am not asking for more
just wanted to be sure that what i saw in pep as a request matched your expectations in terms of my response
sally
patti delivered to sharron's desk this week a copy of my 0 accomplishments
you should find that when you return to the office
let me know if for some reason you do not have that copy
and i will have another delivered
have a happy new year
i will be at the cotton bowl watching meagan's drill team perform
and also watching some of the game
thankfully
no emotional attachment to either team in that game
i just hope that we don't freeze
sally
we will also have both of our cell phones with us
david 0-0-0 sally 0-0-0 we will hope for a little warmer weather in fort lauderdale
the game is on wednesday evening
we will do some sightseeing during the day on wednesday
i will be back in the office on thursday afternoon
love
sally
i will be out of the office on wednesday
january 0
i am married to an ou graduate
so we are headed to the orange bowl to hopefully see oklahoma hang onto their number 0 ranking
i will be back in the office after lunch on thursday
january 0
my assistant
patti thompson
x0
has phone numbers where i can be reached
please contact bob hall at x0 with any questions while i am out
i have been out of the office at the orange bowl game and have just returned within the last hour
that probably would make next week better for me than this week
give me a call and we will set something up
my number is x0
if you don't reach me
call my temp assistant
camella
x0
and she will be able to set up a meeting
thanks
i will be there at 0:0 on monday
not a word until then
i passed this information along to some of my direct reports for their thoughts
and truthfully didn't hear back from anyone and didn't follow up
two years ago
we agreed to be part of a benchmarking study that was done by aa's houston office
interestingly enough
wes colwell was the aa partner who led this effort
and we had mixed results
the study was designed to cover gas and power
despite our involvement in the steering committee
the study itself was very
very detailed
such that it was troublesome to complete
jim fallon at the time refused to submit information on the majority of the questions surrounding power
so our survey data for power was not very useful
i would agree that at this time we will pass on this request
thanks for passing it along
however
i would be happy to convey this directly to the person that has contacted you
just let me know his/her name and number and i will follow through on that if you would like
hope that your holidays was enjoyable and that the new year will be a good one for you
sally
i have a standing staff meeting that i attend on monday mornings
so i will not be available when you and james meet on the 0th
i will look forward to getting with james after your meeting for an update
i was just thinking about the anniversary thing
too
i bought a book at barnes
noble
0 best family resorts in north america
i found the name of one place that i have seen in the past in magazines that i always thought looked good
high hampton inn and country club in north carolina
another place that i have seen is something like blackberry farm in tennessee
both meet the criteria of mountains in the carolina/tennessee range
i will get info on both and we can look at it
i worry a little bit about having such a range of ages that i want to make sure that we go someplace where there is plenty to do for all
just sitting for some
shopping
eating
golf
etc
these two places may be on the smaller side and may or may not offer enough variety
i thought that i would also get some info on some other places that may not have popped up on mom and dad's list but that might be good for the whole family
one of those might catch their interest as well
i can understand that with prolonged holiday exposure to mom and dad that the thought of this trip could wear thin
i would like the opportunity to be together with everyone
maybe we could send them on a nice dinner just the two of them and the rest of us could have fun one night
even though dad is doing so much better
you never know when you will have the chance to get everyone together on a trip like this
memory-maker or nightmare
could be a toss up
but maybe worth the try
let's share some research and see if there is any place that we could get excited about going
i would like to invite each of you to participate in a brainstorming session with me on friday
january 0 from 0:0 am through lunch
the purpose of this meeting will be to surface and capture ideas around the potential commercialization of mid and back office services that we provide
i know that many of you have ideas about services and/or products that could be marketed and some of you have been involved in arrangements where we have or are currently providing services to outside parties
while there are efforts underway with certain modules under commoditylogic
i want this session to be used to take a broader look at how we might market mid and back office services
i hope that you will be able to attend
details on location of the meeting and more exact timing will be sent to you on monday when patti returns from vacation
absolutely
clara should have been included
i asked for a list of managers and above within egm from chantelle
and used that for the distribution list
her list omitted clara
all lists that i requested from egm
ena and eim were to have also included those being promoted to manager as a result of our year-end prc process
i don't think that i got consistent info from everyone
so i am rechecking names right now and will send clara a message about the meeting as i also clean up any others that were left off of lists
thanks for catching this
sally
i am so sorry to hear about your dad
i did not know that he had passed away
i know that he has been very ill
my thoughts are with you and your family
i know that it must hard to say goodbye to someone that has been such a part of your life for so long
we will miss you on the 0th
but certainly understand your absence
sally
i hope that you are enjoying your break from school
and am sure that it is even more enjoyable with that number 0 ranking decided
my husband
an ou grad
and i were at orange bowl
and it was really exciting to be there and see the team absolutely stop fsu
if you have any questions regarding your job offer from enron while you are on vacation
please give me a call
0 was a banner year for us at enron
and we were excited about what we will accomplish in 0
i hope that you will join us and be a part of that
my office number is 0-0-0
if it is more convenient for you
feel free to call me at home as well
that number is 0-0-0
boomer sooners
sally beck
i am sure that you are enjoying your break from school
it is always great to have finals behind you and several weeks of vacation stretching in front of you
no doubt you are spending time thinking about your next step after graduation
i would be glad to answer any questions that you may have about your offer while you are going through that process
enron had a fantastic year in 0
and we are excited about what we will accomplish in 0
we hope that you will be a part of that
my number at work is 0-0-0
please feel free to call me any time
if it is more convenient for you to talk during the evening or on the weekend
my home number is 0-0-0
don't hesitate to call
sally beck
i will ask patti to set up a meeting for us this week
your name has been on my list to call
a trip to the orange bowl last week cut my week short
so i will look forward to getting with you this week
sally
sounds good to me
sheri has told me that you made an announcement recently
congratulations on the baby
i hope that you are feeling well
i am so happy for you and your husband
my how your lives will change
but how enriched they will be
our three are so much fun
i will also always be honest with expectant moms and say that a new baby is an incredible amount of work as well and that it sometimes takes a while to really enjoy the experience
if you ever want some funny stories about adjusting to being a first-time mom
just let me know
i would be glad to share my experience with you
sally
i know that you left a message with patti about contacting david eastlake
i have sent e:mail messages to him that must have been delivered
as i did not get a message about undeliverable e:mail
i haven't heard back from him
the phone numbers on the contact sheet are the students
numbers at school
i have left a voice mail both for daniel jenkins and david during the week between christmas and new year's
knowing that it was unlikely that they would be in austin
it would be great to have their home numbers as better contact numbers during school breaks
i was on vacation the week before christmas and for two days last week
and i admit that i did not contact any students while i was on vacation
i will try their austin numbers this week again
although classes don't start until next week
they may come back to austin early
similar situation with my ou students
i have conversed by e:mail since i did not have home numbers
do you know when classes resume at ou
i will try my students there this week again by phone in case they are returning to school early
i had lunch with ted jacobs the week between christmas and new years
it was a thank you for finding some orange bowl tickets that david and i purchased
yes
we were at the game and saw ou win the national championship
i have an update from him on our list of ou candidates
according to his understanding of some of the decisions they have made
if you have a few minutes today
give me a call and i can go over that with you
since full-time offers were changed
did we appropriately change summer intern offers as well
i didn't see anything in your e:mails about that
let me know
sally
i just composed a somewhat lengthy e:mail about the anniversary trip
and then closed out lotus notes and checked discard changes
so it is gone
but not sent
can you e:mail me back your office phone number and if it is convenient for you
i will give you call and use old fashioned technology
great
i will add her name to the distribution list so that she will get our upcoming note on the location for this meeting
thanks
enron north america corp
i will be out of town on january 0
so brenda herod has agreed to make the presentation for rick causey
please replace my name with hers for all communication regarding this analyst orientation
thanks
congratulations on the birth of your daughter
meagan called this afternoon to tell me the news
i will perhaps get more details when i get home tonight
i hope that laura and the baby are doing well
let us know what we can do to help
i am sure that jackson is a proud brother
we will be anxious to meet our newest neighbor
sally
i knew that you would still be in london
just thought that i would start to copy you on some things so that you could begin to get a feel for what's going on
yes
i will be in london next week
plan to fly over on sunday night and will be in the office around noon on monday
i will be there through thursday
and will plan to fly back to houston on friday
let's definitely plan to get together
i am in the throws of bonus reviews at this moment
i am cooling my heels waiting for hr to get me info on people that were left off of my sheet
so a little later today i will focus on my schedule for next week
i will send an e:mail later in the day to see when we can get together
looking forward to it
sally
jeff
thanks for taking care of this for fred
sally
i will attend the meeting on thursday
but will have to leave around 0:0 to make it to a meeting at the doubletree where i am speaking at 0:0
thanks
right now
i am booked at 0 park for next week
i would love to be closer to the office
but i don't know if there is anything that makes sense
any suggestions
if not something close to the office
would you suggest another spot besides 0 park
i am committed to working on my agenda for next week before i leave the office tonight
i will e:mail you tomorrow to see if we can schedule a time to meet and hopefully a lunch or dinner
too
sally
i love it
i think that is perfect
much easier for my family and probably for everyone else
that way we can probably do this on their anniversary
assuming that works for everyone
removing some of the travel hassels should mean that everyone would have a better time
too
hyatt hill country is one obvious choice
i was there in november and it is still very nice
there is a newer resort in the area also
i can't think of the name of it offhand
but david knows and i will get the name from him tonight and call you
sally
the other place in san antonio is westin's la canterra
i will contact both and get info
then we should make reservations soon
i'll call cindy tonight and fill her in
sally
this one is pretty funny
well
i didn't get this out to you before i left the office last night
i was still pouring over bonus info until 0:0
and decided to call it quits at that point
here are some of the things that i would like to do next week
review your action plan to move the close and officialization of london books to same day
to replicate
if appropriate
an operational risk information session for london counterparts
you and i can review early in the week what we are doing here in houston today and modify the info for europe
discuss the doorstep process with you and
if you deem appropriate
your business controllers in the london office who will participate in doorstep reviews this year
clear up and questions and get your input on how to continually improve the process
discuss with mark pickering the technology dependencies of the london office related to speeding up london's information for the corporate dpr do some planning with you for the february 0
0 ase discuss the feasibility of utilizing our operational pricing model in london discuss your ideas and thoughts on commoditylogic and other ideas around potential commercialization of mid and back office services in addition
i would like to meet with anyone in the london office that you think would be beneficial
through nicki scott
i understand that michael brown would like to meet with me so we are setting that up
i will also spend some time with beth apollo and ted murphy while i am there
and i plan to meet with fernley as well
any other suggestions on topics or people to see
i think that we have lunch already on the calendar for wednesday
thanks
i understand that congratulations are in order for you
too
we should definitely do dinner and celebrate
i think that niki has arranged that for thursday night
i will look forward to it
sally
let's plan on monday night for dinner
someone included me on the distribution list for your going away bash
so i have put that on my calendar for wednesday night as well
sally
i am glad that you asked
i will be happy to bring your things back for you
niki is finding a spot for me to occupy while i am there next week and she is coordinating my schedule
so we see one another quite a bit
it will be easy to do this
sally
thanks for the responses
all look great
i like coming over knowing that my calendar will be pretty full
dinner sounds great
too
i am having dinner with beth apollo on monday evening to talk more about her assignment
i received a note from fernley asking about dinner on thursday evening also
hope that the new york trip was worthwhile and that the trip back was smooth
sally
yes
we will definitely host you and the students to a tour of enron field and dinner on the evening of january 0
if that is still the best night for your schedule
i talked with lexie earlier this week and told her that i was going to cover this
and she thought that she could find some dollars in her budget so that we can perhaps split the cost
either way
consider it done
i am glad that you are including the names of the students to attend
however
checking the attachment on your second e:mail message
i can not bring up the attachment
can you try that again and check with patti to make sure she has it in readable form
i will be in london all of next week
and i would like to send invitations to the students about the tour and dinner
i will need their e:mail addresses to do so
i don't know whether or not you included that on your list
jody said that ruggles for game watching was really cold
i wonder if that could be a problem on the 0st
you never know with houston weather
what do you think
we could do the tour and then go to irma's southwest grill
0 blocks from the stadium
same great food with a more sleek atmosphere
owned by irma's son
luis
i will be in touch with patti while i am in london next week to make sure that plans are progressing on this
we will include our recent ou grads as well
i will save your championship game souvenirs and give them to you when i see at the end of january
sally
your note has made my day
thanks for taking the time to send it
your thoughts and support mean a lot to me
how lucky i am to have you for a sister and friend
sally
thanks for the note
i certainly know by responses that i am getting tonight who is in the office late
i was told that the memo would come out today
you just had to be here at dinner time to see it
i am really pleased about how we have been able to improve the perception of what our group does and its importance to the organization
and yes
we need more female names on these lists
sally
there isn't much to the memo
but this is it
it came out well after the eof the work day for most folks
i believe that patti has sent you my traveplans for next week
have a great weekend
please put this on your calendars
i would like for both of you to attend
should jeff and stacey be there
too
this will be a meeting that we should have regularly with wes and team so that can jointly review any exposures and make timely decisions on how to handle those
i am sure that there is some prep work that needs to be done for this meeting
i would assume that we should cover a/r
ua0
imbalances
weird or over/undervalued deals in risk books
oa
etc
can you work with greg and georgeanne ahead of time on content and have necessary back up to discuss highlights
i would love for us take charge and lead this meeting
sally
please put details of this meeting on my calendar
thanks
i will be in london the week of january 0th
i understand from beth that you and frank will be in spain on monday night
beth and i plan to have dinner that night
will you be back in town later in the week
i have business plans for dinner on tuesday and thursday
could you make dinner on wednesday night
the 0th
there is an enron happy hour for beth that i will stop by at 0:0 that night
but i expect to be free after that
i have a belated christmas gift for you
hope we can get together
sally ps am staying at 0 park
it will be good to use your knowledge of the business in helping eim to grow
i hope that you enjoy your new rotation
sally
i will be thinking about you and brenda over the weekend and know that you will both be glad for her to return home
i have mentioned to you before
hector
that an enron friend has dealt with a brain tumor successfully
that is barbara gray
an attorney in ena's legal department
barbara counsels patients and their families who are facing situations similar to hers
if you feel like you would like to talk with someone who can understand on a more firsthand basis what you and brenda are facing
i would encourage you to contact barbara
in addition to having been through her own battle with a brain tumor
she is simply a wonderful person whom i know you would enjoy meeting
i have mentioned your situation to her
and she would certainly welcome a conversation with you
i will be in the london office next week
so we will have to coordinate on merit increases from there
i will be back in the office on monday
january 0
sally enron north america corp
yes
just call wanda and let her know that rick has asked that we add ees houston to the doorstep review schedule
in keeping with other reviews
i would not necessarily give wanda the dates
we should also send a short memo to kevin and marty to fill them in on the process and purpose of the reviews
i should probably send that to them
can you remind me when i am back in town the week of january 0
thanks
enron north america corp
leslie
can you attend this meeting for me
i will be in london
patti
can you get time and location for leslie and let them know that she will be there instead of me
thanks
please print attachment and make sure that e:mail addresses are included for the students
call ted if any problems
thanks
we will need this to send invitations to students and ted
plus some enron folks
to a tour of enron field and dinner on january 0
let's talk about arranging details
thanks
i don't think that the doorstep reviews are the right venue for this
i believe that to address what seems to be david's concerns would be better handled with an appropriate person deemed to lead a special project in a directed timeframe with a well defined scope
we purposefully utilize differing personal on the doorstep reviews and it would seem that concerns over proper valuation should be addresses in a timeframe that is not dependent on the schedule of doorstep reviews around the world
cathy
i will be working in the london office during the week of january 0

i will arrive just after lunch on monday and plan to be there through thursday
much of my time will be spent with fernley and mike jordan
if you have a few minutes while i am in town
it would be great to get with you to hear if there is anything that is of particular concern or interest to you in supporting the continuing growth of your business in 0
i will stop by while i am in the office
sally
congratulations on your promotion to managing director
i have the dubious honor of being here late enough on friday night to have seen the arrival of the promotional memo via e:mail
i will be in the london office next week and i believe that we have some time scheduled together
i look forward to the chance to visit with you then
sally
the promotional memo came out a couple of hours too late for me to be able to mention it to you on the phone this afternoon
congratulations on your promotion to managing director
sally
the promotional memo came out a few hours too late today for me to be able to mention it when we talked this afternoon
congratulations on your promotion to managing director
sally

tom

thanks for your nice note
i am pleased for all of us at the increased recognition of the roles that we play within the organizaiton
my ability to do my job well is very dependent on those of you who play key roles in operations
thanks for your part in that and for your continued support
sally enron north america corp
thanks for your nice note
i hope that you are having fun in your new role
we will have to schedule lunch so that i can catch up on what you are doing now
sally
i can access the global compensation system from london
today i have been able to log on and to review as read only the info that i submitted on friday for bonus and lti
i assume that i will be able to access the screens for merits as well
please get back with me via e:mail and let me know our instructions and time deadlines for merit increases
i will want to give my direct reports access to the system so that they can input their recommendations
i will also want to send them an e:mail with instructions and expectations
having asked for more funds for the bonus pool
i would like for us to be within the guidelines for merit increases
outside this process
we can address any increases that may be warranted given the market data gathered by todd burke
we can process those agreed upon requests
but will not include those dollars within our merit totals
that way
won't have to request additional dollars for these worksheets
better not to ask for exceptions on everything
what is the word on bonus dollars
is everything finalized as i submitted
let me know
if we need to talk directly
contact patti for a number where you can reach me
thanks
had trouble finding your e:mail address the first time around for this memo
congratulations on your promotion to vice president
what a nice recognition of your contributions to the success of enrononline
sally
thanks for your note
i hope that things are going well for you at ebs
i know that it must be busy
sally
thanks for your nice note
haven't seen you in a while
hope that all is going well for you
sally
thanks for your nice note
i hope that within my team that they see the promotion as an indication that the work that we do is recognized as meaningful
all of that helps me in recruiting and retaining talented people that make my job easier and more fun
thanks for your nice note
sally
thanks for your nice note
i do hope that everyone on my team sees the promotion as recognition of the value of the roles that we perform
all that should make it easier to attract and retain talented people that make my job easier and more fun
i will ask patti to schedule some time for us to get together when i am back in the office next monday
have a good week
sally
thanks for you nice note
i miss seeing you on 0
hope that all is going well for you
sally
michelle
this is a stab at something to include in the newsletter
will you or someone on your team rewrite as necessary
i am in the london office this week
so e:mail is probably the best way to get in touch with me
thanks
sally beck operational risk management was the topic of an information session held last week for all managers
directors
senior directors and vice presidents in enw supporting trading operations for ea
eim and egm in houston
portland and calgary
operations professionals who manage risk book reporting and anaylsis
confirmations
physical product scheduling and cash management reaffirmed their roles in effectively accessing
managing and mitigating operational risk
this focus on operational risk management will ensure the quality of ews

thanks for your note on the promotion
patti is beginning to work on details for the 0/0 tour of enron field and dinner for ted and his students from ou
she should contact you for a list of recent ou grads so that we can get the invitation list together
i hope that you have that date on your calendar
i will ask mike mcconnell if he would like to join us
too
let's try the last row window seat
thanks
enron north america corp
thanks for your note on the promotion
this was definitely a goal and is very rewarding to get there
i would love to talk with you about your second rotation
in fact
i mentioned you to jesus melendrez just last week
he works with john thompson and scott josey in the upstream capital markets group
producer finance
i filled him in on the energy management degree and told him that i thought that his group should talk with you about a possible rotation
i am in the london office this week
call patti and ask her to schedule a time for us to get together next week when i am back in the office to talk about rotations
i will look forward to it
definitely put january 0 on your calendar for a tour of enron field and dinner
someplace downtown with heat
any suggestions
patti is working on some of the details this week for us to host ted jacobs and about 0 of his students while they are in town for nape
sally
thanks for your nice note
i certainly follow your career with interest
i have been meaning to call to tell you how much we enjoyed getting the wedding picture with your christmas card
what a great picture
you look beautiful and happy
meagan and amanda particularly enjoyed seeing it
my best laid plans for christmas cards became a limited vision this year
only managed to get them in the mail to people outside of houston
maybe next year
i am in your old stomping grounds this week
london
i will see mo tomorrow night for dinner and to catch up on her life
see you next week
sally
thanks
a nice start to the year
sally
thanks for doing this
i plan to come to london once a quarter
i will have to choose my dates well in advance since these flights seem to be so full
sally enron north america corp
please check on those marked below enron north america corp
thanks for your nice note
i have fun being here
which makes all of this even better
sally
i have reviewed my section of causey's presentation
to be given by brenda
and all looks fine except for page with world map
can we add portland to the map
that is the true trading location that is missing
if it is tough to do
don't worry about it
thanks
sally
thanks for your nice note
i hope that everyone in the group sees this as a recognition of the value of the role that we play within enron
that will help us in attracting and retaining talented people
which makes my job easier and more fun
sally
thanks for your e:mail message and your voice mail at home
i appreciate your nice thoughts
i am in london all week
is there anything that you or jo need that i could bring back for you
just let me know
i will be back in the office next monday
the 0nd
sally
any room at the inn
i am looking for a spot for beth apollo
she will be working with me
starting on january 0th in houston
sally i am in london this week
but if you have any ideas patti can follow through while i am out
for now
have her boxes delivered to the spot behind your desk
i sent wes a message and copied you on that
i can't remember the name of the person who works for wes that handles moves
lisa filled in for her while she was out on medical leave
she is back
can you get with her right away and see what you can come up with
best situation would be for beth to sit near me
also
bob hall has someone who is coordinating space needs for us now that lisa is gone
can you check with her
too
also
jeff shankman called me last week to ask how we could speed up our
energy ops
move off of 0
i don't know who is left on 0
can you get the person that reports to bob hall to give me an update on our moves from 0 so that i can get back with jeff this week
thanks
sally enron north america corp
hopefully
those guys would stand out in the woodlands like a sore thumb and would choose to go elsewhere
would be nice to have them behind bars
however
doesn't make george w.'s record on executions look like such a bad idea
does it
i left houston on sunday afternoon
any new news on those 0
sally
congratulations on the baby
august seems like a long time away
but given how quickly time passes at enron
you will be there before you know it
i would be glad to visit with you about other opportunities at enron sometime
i am in the london office this week
but will be back in the office the week of the 0nd
give patti a call if you would like to get together and visit about options
sally
i am in the london office this week
so i won't be able to attend
brenda flores-cuellar@enron
i assume that this request relates to corporate functions under rick
as of this moment
my team and i have not yet been granted access to merit information in the comp system
i am in london this week
but have been in touch with my hr rep each day
latest word is that he aniticipates that we will be able to access merit worksheets sometime today
our deadline to submit merit increases is monday
january 0
since it is already after lunch on wednesday here in london and we do not yet have access to the system
it is likely that my direct reports will work on merits over the next two days
since i will be in the air on friday
it will be monday before i have the opportunity to review all inputs from my direct reports and finalize merits
sally
the flight was uneventful
although i didn't sleep very much
weather here is cold but clear
so i am enjoying it
very useful trip
they have my schedule very full
including dinners every night
i will be in the office through end of day thursday
and then dinner with fernley thursday night
i will be in route to houston on friday
catching a 0:0am flight
told the kids that i would be at the airport at 0:0 am houston time to start back home
we are not going to follow the kean/olson memo on communicating ratings
we will only communicate needs improvement and issues
there will be differing messages for needs improvement which fit the situation
some need to hear that they are not performing at a high enough level relative to peers to help us achieve business goals or for them to considered for a bonus
may need to find another role within or outside enron which is a better fit
message to someone new to enron in that category should be different
glad they are here
believe that as they learn the organization and their job that they will be able to make significant contributions
doing the right thing to learn the business
but that contributions to date are not significant enough to warrant payment of a bonus
thanks for getting everyone on the same page on this
sally
thanks for your nice note
it is always interesting to scan the list and do a count of other females names
were not too many on this latest list
we will have to work on changing that
sally
technology is wonderful
i can log on here in the london office just as i do in houston
i feel very in touch
sounds like you have been busy
i think that the variety of items for the sunday meeting sounds good
thanks for taking care of all of this
london is cold but sunny
so very nice
i do love coming here
hope to make the trip once a quarter this year
i will be back at home by friday evening
so let me know if there is anything that i can do before the meeting
otherwise i will see you on sunday
too bad that nancy doesn't want the input from the girls on presentation
i think that taking likes and dislikes would be good
no commitment to make changes that the girls
might suggest
but i think that it would be wonderful to have their input
they are the honorees
oh
well
as you say
this is volunteer work and probably not worth getting too worked up over the whole thing
sally
thanks for your note
i will copy patti on this reply and ask her to set us up for lunch when i am back from london
sally
haven't had the chance to look at the ut presentation yet
that will make good airplane material tomorrow
if i make any changes i will try to fax pages to you after david picks me up at the airport tomorrow
if i don't make chanages
i will call you friday afternoon after landing and let you know that
my schedule has been really full here
but very productive
thanks for your comments
i must admit
i am really excited about the promotion
we can talk next week about what i hope to accomplish during this next year and where my major focus will be
it will be helpful for you to know and understand that as we work together to make that happen
i am certainly glad that you are here
my flight to london reminded me of your arrival about this time last year as i was heading to london
luckily a different reason for the trip this year
but still hectic
i expect it to be a busy year
you will notice that i have blocked some times on my calendar to get reviews written and delivered
target is to be finished by the end of january
i will talk with you on friday afternoon and see you on monday
sally enron north america corp
silly as it may seem
have brian heinrich dig up a copy of the form that we used last year for headcount addtions
let's complete those for these positions and have fred and scott neal sign them
they need to understand the addtional cost associated with these requests
they will forget later in the year if they aren't making much money
do you agree that these positions are needed and will add value
sally
thanks
this will definitely help me
sally enron north america corp
please check the dates for that oprisk seminar in new york and put those on my calendar tentatively
i got a message from shona trying to schedule a trip to mexico and she thought that the week of february 0th looked good
i assume that she checked with you and that my calendar looked clear
while i have not yet made a decision on attending the ny seminar
i do need to hold those dates
i left shona a message telling her that the week of february 0 would be better
sally
the name of the restaurant that i liked for lunch was christophers
it is at victoria station
or in the lobby of what was or is a hotel at victoria station
quick walk from the office
apparently
there is another location at covent gardens
dinner last night was fun
it is always great to see you either in houston or london
sorry that our goodbye was so abrupt
i think that the taxi driver was afraid that we would get him killed
i called home last night and told amanda about our discussion on a day in paris
she is ready
let us know when you will next be in houston
i should be here quarterly
probably head back in march or april
sally
thanks
sarah
i was so focused on getting that in the mail that i obviously didn't proof the content very well
thanks for looking out for me
sally
thanks for your note
can you get me info on the options with dell
i won't make it by to speak with them myself today
thanks
this is some of the data that we need
thanks for your nice note
sally
audience for the report
is it you and philippe
or will the report be distributed to all on your memo distribution list
may make a difference in information provided
we can update you on progress toward commercialization of mid and back office operations in the report
would you also like some operating data
# of deals
bcf scheduled
etc
we can come up with a format and suggested content this week
sally
during the budgeting process for 0 i gave dave delainey an estimated cost savings for energy operations assuming the sale of hpl
since this is clearly on the horizon
we need to take a close look at opportunities for cost savings and our estimated timing on those savings
i will ask james by copy of this memo to set up a meeting late this week to cover this
i want to be able to get back with dave with more detailed estimates of cost savings
if my full e:mail address is not used
steve beck gets my e:mails
he has forwarded this one
does it make sense to you
sally
thanks for the congratulations
david of course is pleased about the promotion but is most anxious to see what dollars come along with it
thanks
too
for your comments on the oprisk session
it is always a risk to pull together an audience of 0 and deliver something worthwhile
sally enron north america corp
thanks for your nice note
sally
thanks for your note
sorry that all we managed last week was a wave
my last trip to london was march of 0
so i certainly had a very full agenda
mike jordan kept my schedule very full
but productive
and even lunches and dinners were filled with business meetings
do stop by when you are in the office next week
i should be in town all week
sally
please put attendees on my calendar
thanks
on january 0
i hosted a brainstorming session at the four seasons hotel idowntown houston in which we assembled a number of ideas regarding mid andback office services we could offer to the commodity industry
to complete a plan for launching this strategic commercial venture

cgey
attheir accelerated solutions environment in dallas
texas
i am personally extending an invitation to you to participate in this desigsession

it is a very focused
activity-driven event that is composed of various modules and exercises performed in small and large groups
if youhave not attended one of the designshops related to sap
you will likely regard this session as different from any working session you have previousexperienced
the prior designshops held in conjunction with sap have provento be very successful
therefore
we have elected to utilize this same methodology on this very critical and strategic venture
a limited number of representatives from enron will be attending
you wereselected to be one of approximately 0 key individuals to participate in thdesignshop
you are being asked to participate in the full two days with aslittle distraction or interruption as possible
the quality of our resultsdepends on each participant being fully engaged and participative for theentire event
additionally
you will be relied on in the future to supporand communicate our commercial strategy as it is defined at this session
this date was specifically selected to avoid critical operational periods sthat your participation can be maximized
therefore
please make all necessary arrangements at the office to minimize your distractions duringthese two days
please review the attached information regarding hotel
flight information,and transportation
preliminary information as to schedule and environmenthas also been included
you may direct any additional questions concerningthe event to mary solmonson at
0
0-0
i hope that you will be able to participate
please confirm your attendancfor the two days with marvia jefferson at 0-0-0 by january 0th 0:0p.m
if you are unable to attend
it may be appropriate to select someoneelse to participate
please do not extend an invitation to anyone else totake your place until you and i have discussed this
i thank you in advance for your participation and look forward to seeing yoin dallas
fyi
forgot to cc
you on this
pt
and you and your bride haven't set dallas as a honeymoon destination
your excuse seems to be a good one
we will miss your presence and participation
however
enjoy the wedding
sally
thanks for your note and welcome back to enron
i am so pleased that you have returned
i
too
look forward to working with you
sally
fyi on vng
melissa allen
formerly with arthur andersen and assigned to the enron account
has taken over beth apollo's role for eel
she reports to fernley dyson
as did beth
i was in the london office last week
as a result of some of my discussions
mike jordan asked that james scribner make a visit to cover the operations pricing model and to discuss some issues around global counterparty database
mike has suggested that james come to london during the first week in february
which sounds as if it will coincide with your trip
please coordinate with james so that your agendas are in sync
in case of potential overlap
so that we don't convey a right hand/left hand lack of coordination
since your agenda mentions gcp
there may some meetings that you are planning that would be appropriate for james to join
by copy of this memo
i am asking james to do the same with you
thanks
congratulations to you and lanettte on the birth of nicole mackenzie
what a pretty name
i was in london last week and got the news while i was there
i hope that everyone in your household is doing well
although i know that you are probably a bit sleep deprived
that will pass
although with your first one that is really hard to believe
please stop by as soon as you have pictures
i would love to see them
sally
i hear that dad was in the emergency room for some hours earlier this week
glad to hear that it just seemed to be a virus
mom does seem to like that heart hospital
check out the website for the place in asheville
nc that i mentioned to you
address is richmondhillinn.com
if i knew how to hotlink for you i would
but i am not the techie
we had dinner there one night while in asheville and had a great meal and though that the place was pretty
a lot better than the overpriced
under-delivered grove park inn
our friends the tylers spent several nights at the richmond inn that same summer
it looks pretty good in the photos
and you can see the mountains
only airlines that fly from here into asheville are delta and us air
continental flies to greenville/spartanville
sc which is about 0 to 0 miles from asheville
not impossible
given that we would want some cars
i will get info on prices and stuff for lodging and airfare
then we can decide if we want to show this to mom and dad as a possibility
hope all is well with the three of you
are you making the trip to halletsville on saturday
assuming no rain out
i am not going to make it
need a little r&r at home and to wash some clothes
love
sally
just checked with richmond hill inn in asheville and they are open over thanksgiving
not filled yet for that time period
they are sending me a brochure
only potential draw back there is that most of their rooms have only king size beds and sleep two persons
there are 0 rooms that have two beds
and two cottages that have sleeper sofas
they do have baby beds
families of 0 or 0 can be accomodated fine
i would probably take two rooms
one for the girls and one for tyler
david and me
but we would probably do that in new york or san francisco
too
as we all know
five is almost too many in one room and bathroom
i think that dinner in austin on june 0 and a trip at thanksgiving sounds like a good plan
do you guys want to cover that with mom and dad and ask about the san antonio/sun city crowd
not sure that this reached you the first time
my address was flawed
fyi
check my voice mail message that i left for you and call me when you can
she will check with dad and let you know
i don't quite get all of this either
do you think that she might have been hoping that dad would come up with a plan
despite her comment that they were not
celebratory
about the occassion
who knows
keep me posted
and please do me the favor of shaking me if i get like that too
sally
thanks for your note
i do believe that this indicates a recognition within the organization of the importance of the work of the whole group
that is nice to see
sally
glad to hear that we are getting there
josephine's house
jeffery's annex
is really good
they do a great job of serving
at past enron dinners
they have printed menus specific for the occassion
really nice looking and a nice keepsake
maybe we can do this
sally
fyi
the details below take care of the hess
sharing arrangement
that we discussed yesterday
sally
this looks great
do you need me for either of those two dates
how was dinner last night
sorry that i couldn't stay
but i know that the students were in good hands
who else attended from enron
sally enron north america corp
can you upgrade me to first class
i will look forward to talking with norma
thanks for suggesting that she contact me
sally
watch for her call
ask her to send me a resume to review and set up a meeting when convenient
thanks
please put the dates referenced below on my calendar
you may need to get more details from lexi
thanks
i agree
he does look like a good candidate
please do go ahead with a phone screen and let me know if we should then interview him
thanks
enron north america corp
here is the info on the meeting in dallas
i am glad that you will be ableto join us
sally
just a quick note to see how you are doing
i mentioned your name today to kristin albrecht
she is a senior director over risk management for enron broadband services
ebs
kristin and i used to work together in enron americas
and we had lunch today to catch up
she grew up in wharton and is an a&m graduate
so it occurred to me that you two have at least two things in common
i wanted you to know that i have given kristin your name
she can be another contact for you here at enron
if you are interested in what is going on at ebs or want to get kristin's impressions on rotations within or outside ebs
she would be great for you to visit with
drop by soon to give me an update on life at enron for you
sally
enjoy a well-deserved afternoon off
i appreciate your notes when you are out on who to contact
have a great weekend
sally
i asked mike this week if your baby was here
and he said that you had just returned to the office
congratulations on the birth of your little girl
i hope that all three of you are surviving those first few weeks of adjustment and that sleep is not too short a commodity in your house
i will look forward to seeing pictures of lauren when i am next in london
you do know that now that you are a dad that it is a requirement to be armed with adorable pictures at all times
sally
julie called me immediately after getting my e:mail message about you
her role has changed once again at enron
she is running more of a fundamentals group at present
wanted to know if you would be interested in that
told her that i couldn't speak for you
i'd suggest that you contact her and talk with her even if at first blush that may not be your first interest
can't hurt to hear about what she is doing and spend some time with her
you may not then be interested in her rotation
but you'll know more and she will know you
fyi
she is a university of nebraska graduate
sally
in my new role as social secretary for james
i wanted to let you know that he will be in london next week on business
he will arrive on monday morning
february 0
and should be in the enron office most of the day on monday
tuesday and wednesday
he will fly back to houston on thursday
he has dinner plans for wednesday evening
but would love to get together with you for dinner on monday or tuesday
if you are in town and available
he will be staying at the sheraton belgravia hotel
walking distance to enron house
best way to contact him at enron's london office would be through mike jordan or his assistant
mike's number
don't know how many of these digits you actually need to call from there
is 0-0-0-0-0
hope you guys get to see each other
have a great weekend
sally
seattle sounds nice
haven't made it there myself
enjoy the trip
if you have time
i would love to get with you late next week to discuss my thoughts about next steps for joel's team
sally also
when you are back
i would love to set up a meeting with you and some of my direct reports so that we can get an update on it priorities
we are addressing some issues that create operational risk that may require some system enhancements to help us mitigate those risks
and we would like the opportunity to share those with you in the context of priorities for systems work
i will be in the calgary office with peggy hedstrom and her team next week on wednesday and thursday
february 0 and 0
do either one of you have a specific issue that needs to be addressed that i could handle while i am in calgary
my agenda with peggy and her team is pretty full
but i can add to that anything that you know of that we need to address
just let me know
that puts me in calgary for the staff meeting on wednesday
i will sit in with rob milnthorp on the video conference for the first hour of the meeting
i already had a meeting scheduled with all of peggy's team during the second hour of your staff meeting
due to location constraints
we will have to keep that meeting as scheduled
so i will have to step out of the staff meeting for the second hour
brent price
bob hall
leslie reeves and i would like to invite you to lunch on friday
february 0 in recognition of your promotions to director and senior director
we appreciate your contributions to the continuing success of enron's wholesale services business and feel that these promotions are worthy of celebration
please rsvp to patti thompson
x0
details on time and location will follow
sally
congratulations on your promotion to manager
brent price
bob hall
leslie reeves
brenda herod and i would like to invite you to a luncheon in recognition of your promotion on tuesday
february 0
we appreciate your contributions to the continuing success of enron's wholesale services business
we would like the opportunity to help you celebrate your promotion
please rsvp to patti thompson
x0
details on time and location will follow
sally
fyi
i had the same reaction
we didn't get much of a break between the january and february meeting
was it car care and car safety that we had planned for feb
and do we have a volunteer to host the meeting
i could certainly host if needed
did you have a constable or someone in mind to talk with the girls about car safety
i would be glad to call them and make arrangements if you let me know
any ideas on car care
seems like joy martin mentioned her husband as a possible
expert
there
or should we try to call firestone or jiffy lube or one of those spots to get a speaker
i am headed to calgary for wednesday and thursday this week
but can make plenty of phone calls before i leave
on nominating committee
i have a list of offices held over the years by the girls that will be needed by the nominating committee
i would be glad to meet with the girls on the committee either thursday night
i land from calgary around 0:0 pm
friday night or saturday
i can get you this list if you need to meet with the committee before then
it may be tough to get the girls together
but am i correct in assuming that they need to present a slate at our feb meeting and then they vote in march
the symphony open rehearsal sounds good
0:0 am on saturday
march 0
buy tickets at the door
$0
problem is that sat's are given that day
meagan is signed up to take them
i wonder how many others may be taking the sat that day
if there are only a few conflicts
we could go ahead and it's okay if meagan misses
if we have a lot of conflicts
then this may not work
maybe we could get merritt to e:mail this question to the girls when she contacts them about this weekend's meeting
they could check their schedules and then we could get a count
i will also look into other possible dates and get availability and prices on tickets just in case
i will try to call you after a lunch time meeting today
sally
i will be in calgary wednesday and thursday this week
tuesday is tough
because i am trying to finish giving performance reviews
i can make time on tuesday
but would prefer that we hold this to an hour
sally
have you seen the training tools that avril uses for such things
sally
please print the attachment at end of e:mail in color for me
thanks
sally
please print wellesley schedule
i think that i have a conflict with the date that they need me
let's discuss
thanks for the weather report
i bought a good coat a couple of months ago with london and calgary in mind
worked well in london two weeks ago
so i will come equipped with coat
gloves
scarf
etc
i can go either way on dinner for wednesday night
if it would be good for you to get home at a reasonable hour
then we can all three have an early supper
if i get in bed early my body would probably be in shock
but would adjust
or if we don't want to feel rushed
then a drink with laura sounds great
ask if her pronunciation in spanish class is improved or impaired by alcohol
i will let you all decide based on your commitments both inside and outside work
either way will work well for me
sally
thanks for the info
i am going to have to miss the luncheon tomorrow
despite what seems to be a definite scheduling challenge
i am trying to do two lunches this week
one with operations personnel promoted to manager
about 0 of those
and one with operations personnel promoted to director or senior director
smaller group
to make this work while the promotion announcements are still timely
we have had to schedule on tuesday this week for one of the lunches
i will get an update from shona
i will not be able to attend
sally
no memo out yet on the doorstep process
i am still in the throws of completing the 0 reviews that i have to give
should be finished by 0:0
i will send the memo on doorstep process to you
fernley and michael brown before i leave for the day
i will be in the calgary office wednesday and thursday with peggy hedstrom and her team
back in the houston office on friday
hope that james
visit is going well
thanks for getting appointments organized for him
i look forward to seeing you in dallas next week
i am glad that you
richard and steve will be able to participate
are you still planning to come back to houston after the meeting in dallas
i fly from dallas to austin on tuesday night
so that i can do a full day of interviews at ut for summer interns on wednesday
i will be back in the office on thursday and friday that week
let me know if we can help in setting up any appointments
we can do lunch on thursday or friday
if your schedule allows
i can also set some time aside to perhaps download from our dallas meeting and to follow up on some other issues
i would offer dinner on thursday night
but that is my birthday and i think
hope
that my family will have dinner plans for me that evening
is there someone else in houston that you would like to have dinner with while you are here
sally
please put mike on my calendar for thursday lunch next week
steve and richard are coming as well
you might tell mike that we can provide the two of them with desk space as well
but that we will reserve the spot with the computer and phone for mike
and schedule some time for me to meet with him on thursday as well
i will deal with louise's meeting in another way
you might e:mail mike and let him know that we have a spot for him with computer
network connection and phone on 0
you might also offer to set up any appointments for him while is here
thanks
please print memo and attachment for me to review on the plane tomorrow
thanks
sally
fyi
i will meet with james on friday when he is back from london to go over the change in reporting for him
i gave his review the end of last week
but didn't get to review the reporting change
i will ask patti to let you know when i am meeting with james on friday
wanted you to be in the loop on this
particularly when we are getting in front of commercial guys
i want this to be well done
the training may be great
i just wanted to make sure that james knew about avril's trip and that he was aware of the content and delivery on the training
looks like he still has some homework to do
sally
yes
let's plan on my house on sunday
i have to leave for the airport after the meeting
off to exotic dallas
and that will just make it that much easier for me if the meeting is at my house
sarah would be great if the dads are not available for car care
hearing it from a woman's point of view would be interesting
i agree that it is too close to plan a dad's event for this weekend
another thought
continuing the baseball theme from last year
is to get tickets to an astro's game
i have season tickets through enron and can buy blocks of tickets for games
i have the schedule at home and i will check tonight to see if there is perhaps a pre-season game in march that would work
we could discuss that and other suggestions at the meeting on sunday
i will also bring info on other symphony dates
in case we have a large number of girls who will take the sat on march 0
if not too many are tied up
we could go ahead with the open rehearsal at 0:0
and then the girls who take the sat could join us for lunch if they would like
thanks for making the calls
i am making up this quarter for only a little travelling at the end of the year
report from the calgary office today is that it has snowed at that it is about 0 degrees
that is a daytime tempurature reading
i will call you on thursday night when i am back in town
i will leave with david the spreadsheet on offices held by the girls in past years in case that is needed while i am out of town
sally
kathryn corbally
senior director currently in investor relations
is moving to connecticut soon to join her husband
he has been working up there for the last six or eight months
he was one of the group that defected from our weather derivatives team about a year ago
she hopes to continue to work for enron
has been talking with investor relations and some other groups that i can't remember
and to do so either out of her home or in enron's new york office
it struck me that depending upon needs at mg's new york office
that kathryn could be someone for you to consider
she came originally from the london office
you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some feedback on her
in london
she ran mid and back office
that was in very early days for eel
so most of the job was probably accounting
she came to houston and has done a number of different things
i think that she is well organized and control minded
understands enron's business
managing a group of people is probably not her strongest attribute
i am not sure that people enjoy working under her
that could be old news
however
there are a number of people here in houston that could probably give you a read on her based on very recent experience
do you know of her
just thought that i would mention her as a potential resource in new york
don't know what your short and longer term needs are there
she would definitely represent an enron point of view
they have two small daughters
she might be interested in something part time even
could mean lower cost that way
this idea may not have any merit or you may not have a need around metals
if you do want to consider this
i will be glad to help identify who you could go to for some fact finding around her
let me know
sally
entelligence is being used in houston
so they must have done training here
patti is setting up my meeting with james for friday
i just left her a message and asked her to let you know the time that is scheduled for
plus i will leave you a message after i have talked with him
i hope to have that meeting with james at 0:0
interruptions have been rampant
and i am still not finished with reviews
shona will actually be in calgary at the same time that i will be
so we will do her review on the plane
in the airport or at the hotel
and i will tell her about the reorg
again
i will leave you a message to let you know that we have had that conversation
that's great to have dinner with lou
i think that it would be good to find out from him what sort of interaction he has with the london office
what's working
what's not working
in an informal way
are they on an enron network
do they get enron e:mails
how often does lou go to london or someone from london mid office come to new york
i still suspect that new york is somewhat neglected just because of the distance between london and new york and the fact that there seems to be plenty for mike and his team to chew on in london
particularly now with a renewed focus on the scrap metal business
enrjoy the oprisk conference
they tend to be heavily attended by bankers and there focus is that direction as well
but there is a lot that we can glean from what they are doing
it snowed there a lot yesterday
of course
according to peggy hedstrom
it is 0 degrees
daytime temp reading
and snowy in calgary
i look forward to seeing you in dallas
sally
please change this on my calendar
thanks
i will be working in the calgary office wednesday and thursday
february 0 and 0
my assistant
patti thompson
x0
has numbers where i can be reached
i will be back in the houston office on friday
february 0
key contacts in houston over the next two days are
dpr chris abel x0 mpr david maxwell x0 gas operations bob hall x0 power leslie reeves x0 operations stacey white x0
wouldn't it be the four of us
you
me
cara and baby to be named
good idea
i'll call you this weekend
sorry didn't reply earlier
was in calgary
sally
thanks for your vote of confidence
i don't think that it is out of the realm of possibility
as we know with all enron reorg's
what we can count on is that this will change
we'll miss delainey in enron americas
but as a shareholder i am glad that he will be at ees
have already had some discussions with him about some involvement there
i will keep you posted
sally
i will be at a meeting in dallas next monday and will be unable to attend
sally
please print attachment for me
thanks
please process this request asap
thanks
sally beck
thanks for lining this up
i am glad that they were available on the 0nd
sally
i think that this looks pretty good
and don't know if we could better the cost too much by looking around
cara
would you like for me to hold the reservation on my credit card
don't know how much baby stuff may be hitting yours
so i would be glad to do so
i am real comfortable with sharing the costs of this dinner
but don't necessarily feel that we have to split it in thirds
this is a good year for me to cover a large portion of the cost
when we did the 0th anniversary party
david and i were not in such good shape and i think that cindy and richard covered a lot of the costs
things ebb and flow
0 was a good year at enron and this would be a good time for me to put some of my reward to good use
sally
save the date note would be great if you can do that
sally
don't i know
they are smart and loving
but a little short on the details sometimes
aren't they
sally
you and frank can best decide how to organize this
i am comfortable with your decisions
so feel free to go ahead with this
sally enron north america corp
please change location of this meeting for this week only
i would also change the notation for this recurring meeting to enw staff meeting with philippe with peggy mccurley as the contact
thanks
i am looking forward to involvement with the naba and the prospect of hiring some strong candidates
if you want me for the photo shoot
february 0 looks good
i will be out of the office on march 0nd
two days of vacation on march 0 and 0 to chaperone meagan's drill team to state competition in dallas
with 0 girls on the team
that should be fun but exhausting
it was great to see you and grady last night at the rodeo
let's definitely plan on a ball game in april as a chance to catch up
i just checked the calendar
and it looks like we are on for lunch on march 0
a few weeks away
but at least it is on the calendar
if your schedule were to free up suddenly
just give me a call and i can see if i could change mine to have lunch sooner
sally
depending on others
schedules
feb
0 is good for me
i will be out of the office on march 0
sally
just remember that the dpr is used as an accounting tool as well
despite my constant reminders that it is a tool for reporting daily trading results and positions against board approved limits
so do approach this as fact-finding
and then i would suggest reviewing any recommendations that you may have with wes colwell and the rac group before any changes are made
looks like a good group
i hope that all will attend and participate
did pam do some due diligence for you before sending this e:mail so that you know this date and time works for everyone
keep me posted on progress
sally
e:mail messages says to check website to determine whether or not dsl is available at my home
however
i don't see a spot on the website to check that information
can you provide more details
thanks for your note
it has been a nice way to start the year
sally
thanks for your note
i am glad that you and kristin are getting together
sally
thanks
marc
i would like to get together with you
mary solmonson and james scribner to begin work on the model for scoping high
low and expected cases around the commercialization opportunities for mid and back office services
mary has just returned today from a week's vacation
i will work on schedules and call you later this afternoon to see if we can have a kick-off meeting
sally
looks like a permanent cancellation to me
at least for now
we can work with wes on the best ways to stay abreast of developing deals that impact enron americas
brenda herod is in charge of energy operations for eim and should be included in the invitation list
brent price fulfills two roles for egm
cao and head of operations
so he is appropriately included covering both fronts
also
i had added bob hall to the previous hot list meeting
he is a vp in energy operations for enron americas
i would like for him to be on the list for this meeting as well
he and i will cover for each other on this wholesale deal meeting
you may get both of us in attendance on occassion
but usually it will be one or the other of us to cover operations for ea
thanks
sally enron north america corp
this is the replacement meeting for the hot list meeting
i have asked that you be included on the list of attendees
sally
thanks for much for your nice note
where are you working now
i hate to say that i have lost track
sally
thanks for your nice note
the promotion did get the year off to a nice start
i am glad that you were pleased with the year end prc process
while time-consuming
i have appreciated the opportunity to get to know associates like you whom i would perhaps otherwise not know
keep me posted on what you are doing
sally
thanks for your note
as a result of the reorg announcement a couple of weeks ago
this report should now go to philippe bibi
or his assistant
peggy mccurley
louise is now in the office of the chair of enron americas
philippe has assumed the role as chairman of enron net works
since this report is a net works report
please remove louise from the distribution list and add philippe and peggy effective immediately
also
i would like to review and perhaps edit the principal projects/deals section each week before distribution
what would be the most efficient way to get this done and into your hands in a timely way
sally
saturday was fun
it was nice i think for all of us to go to the shower together
that was a nice group of women
and fun
cara did tell me about the scrapbook idea and i think that it sounds good
tell me what i can do to help you
but i am probably shorter on time than anything
but if i can get you get addresses or whatever
let me know
payment plan sounds fine
i am not worried about the timing on that
so don't start this until you feel that it makes sense for you and your family
with the viviance thing
you may prefer to defer the start of this until a little more certainty is on the horizon
i can't think of a better place for the money to be invested than in you and your family
austin would be fun
but i am glad that houston is a reasonable distance for a day or weekend trip
not quite the same as being in town
though
maybe someday we will be there
sally
as part of the modelling process
marc is going to meet with james scribner on tuesday morning at 0:0 am to review our operations pricing model
if you can join them
you might find it interesting
they plan to meet in james
office

sally
i have a stretch goal for the operations budget under enron americas to reduce costs by the end of the year
to this end
i have recently studied possible options for reaching the targeted savings
to make the best decision on this
i have reviewed functions within my team on the basis of core versus non-core functions
and the inherent cost versus value proposition
as a result
i made the decision last week to disband joel henenberg's team
to fulfill the role of joel and his team in leading it initiatives
we will lean on the appropriate it project managers and the business sponsors/end users
joel and his team were told of this decision on friday afternoon last week
our hr rep spent some time with the team explaining the corporate re-deployment service that they all will be working through over the next few weeks
let me know if you have any questions regarding this
while it was a tough decision
i feel comfortable having made it
certainly if we are able to generate revenue
that will be a great offset to our expenses
at this point
we are working on a best
worst and most likely case for a revenue model
plus getting some teeth behind our up front costs
with this info
we can size the potential and then decide how to proceed
my first note to you around disbanding joel's group was the best overall summary of reasons to disband the team
in addition
joel and his team had recently spent a couple of hours updating my direct report team on the projects in which they were involved
the update had the exact opposite effect that joel wanted
i am sure
after the two hour session
it appeared to me that the team was probably overstaffed and still adding to its girth
fulfilling it's roles in some cases
not communicating with the rest of my direct report team
if your role is be a liaison
then communication is a necessary component of the role
struggling to create a role for themselves
etc
if my reaction had been to say
what a talented group
we have to figure out how to best utilize them
then the outcome might have been different
but i also had concerns over quality of staff as well
that two hour exposure created so much concern on my part that we were incurring costs for the team without commensurate value
that i couldn't in good conscious make any other decision after further investigation
sally
i made the decision last week to disband the strategic initiatives team which reported to mary solmonson within my organization
the group was led by a director
and consisted of 0 managers
0 senior specialist and 0 specialists
the employees were made aware of this decision last friday afternoon
my hr rep was on hand to explain the help that all will receive in finding new assignments within enron through the enron corp
re-deployment team
mary solmonson continues as one of my direct reports
focused on commoditylogic and our business development efforts regarding the commercialization of mid and back office services
as part of my on-going effort to deliver both the best value and quality of service within energy operations
i reviewed core versus non-core activities within my team
i am committed to investing appropriately in people resources to support core activities
and i believe that we can become even more effective if investments in non-core activities are eliminated
the role played by the strategic intiatives team in coordinating systems projects will be more appropriately shouldered by the it project leads and the respective business sponsors/end users
the
middle-man
role played by the strategic initiatives team had ceased to deliver appropriate value
i wanted you to be aware of my decision in case you hear anything about the re-deployment effort
i will be out of the office on vacation on friday
march 0 and monday
march 0
i will check messages at the end of both business days
my assistant
patti thompson
x0
will have contact numbers for me
since i will be a chaperone for my daughter and 0 other girls from the high school drill team at state competition in dallas
it is unlikely that i will be easily reachable during the day
i will be back in the office on tuesday
march 0
shona and mike jordan had talked last week about pushing back the doorstep review on the metals business in london and had agreed to take that out of the plan for q0
as of last week
we have redirected shona's reporting line to beth apollo
i have asked beth to review the doorstep review plan for all of 0 and to recommend any changes in timing and approach
beth is in fact in monterrey
mexico today and tomorrow
completing a review of that office
soon after she returns
she will review and update the suggested doorstep review schedule
after that has been updated
she will review the revised schedule with rick causey for any additional input and concurrence on the selection of key offices/businesses to review and the timing of such
with beth's knowledge of the businesses in london
i am sure we will benefit from her eye towards effective scheduling of the reviews
tried you this morning from the car and missed you
do you want to talk thursday morning during my commute
i will be out of the office friday
march 0 and monday
march 0
i will be a chaperone for my daughter's high school drill team to state competition in dallas
really a texas experience
a great time to support her and be around her friends
and nicely enough
she asked me to be a chaperone
with 0 girls on the team
it will be loud
but fun
sally
an update on two of the items that we discussed before you went out of town
due diligence teams for acquisitions identified i have worked with my operations controllers in ews and have identified a short list of individuals that we could use in the due diligence efforts on potential acquisitions
we have identified our target teams for due diligence efforts around commodities
while each person on the list has other duties currently
all have back ups that would allow them to be devoted to projects as they arise
i will review this list continually and update it as i identify other qualified operations personnel who could do an excellent job as part of a due diligence team
i mentioned that kristin albrecht had created a due diligence check list while she was in london on the mg acquisition
we will hold a session in the next 0 days to review this checklist so that all are prepared
let me know if you are interested in the names on my list
also let me know if there is a pending due diligence effort
dedicated support named for transportation business i met with dan reck and chris kravas week before last and have reviewed the executive summary from the consulting team
i followed up with brent price
my operations controller for egm
to review his plan for creating an appropriate infrastructure to support that business
currently
todd hall and mike perun on brent's team are assessing what needs to be done
todd has other responsibilities and dan reck was concerned about the amount of time that todd would have
brent has since recruited shelley stubbs to play the lead role over operations integration for webmodal
she will be returning to houston from the london office by the end of march
she will be able to split her time starting next week to focus on webmodal
todd will stay involved until shelley is devoted fulltime at the end of march
we will also keep mike perun on the assignment working for shelley
shelley is expected to be in houston next week
and i will sit in on meetings with her next week regarding our plans
i will keep you posted

thanks for the update
good to know that the current due date still looks likely
always give or take a week or so
i have just returned from drill team contest in dallas
lots of fun and the bearkadettes did great
first place in their division
super sized schools
best in category for all four team dances
first place solo
first place duet
first place officers dance
and two special judges awards
one for a perfect score of 0 from all three judges on one team routine
which meagan was in
and one for creativity and presentation
keep me posted on baby news
sally
we got back from dallas yesterday about 0:0 and it was a fun and very fruitful trip for the team
schools are categorized by size
small
medium
large and super
klein is super-sized
the bearkadettes won first place and the grand champion trophy in the super category
best in category awards are given for each category of team dance entered
regardless of school size
klein won best in category for all four team dances entered
kick
pom
military and jazz
a clean sweep
klein also had the first place winner in the solo category and first place in the duet category
also won first place in officer dances for super sized schools
they also won two special judges awards
not given out every time
but only when the judges want to especially recognize achievements
they got a special judges award for creativity and originality
commentary on both our fabulous costumes made by a group of bearkadette moms and the choreography
and a special judges award for perfect score
a score of 0 awarded by all 0 judges for a particular routine
apparently very rare
the perfect score award was for their pom routine
where they are dressed like penguins
one of the ones that meagan was in
the girls were pretty excited and the moms were cheering a lot
too
they all work so hard and spend so many hours practicing that it is nice to see that pay off
i am ordering the video from competition
so we can show you the routines sometime
i had a lot of fun
the girls are cute and i enjoyed getting to know some of the moms who were chaperoning as well
but it was nice to get back to houston yesterday
any feedback or interest
please let me know
sally
was this memo just to inform me of this meeting
or did you cc me to invite me to the meeting
i am not available on march 0th from 0:0 to 0:0
does this meeting pertain only to it personnel
if so
i will ignore this
if you did want someone from my group to attend

thanks
sally
thanks for your message
i thought that john did have responsibility for risk
and i am glad to have that clarified
kristin worked for me for several years as the risk lead for ena power and joined barry at ebs last august
so i knew that you all had a great resource there
i will look forward to a follow-up conversation to explore where we may have potential solutions for ebs that can be borrowed or modified from ews
just give me a call when you are ready to get back together
sally
please get with tina and work out how we will handle expense reimbursements for greg's approval
if tina and greg are not yet using the online format
then simply sending him original receipts probably won't do anything for him
thanks
sally
unfortunately
these new dates don't work for me
my children's spring break is next week
march 0-0
i will be out of the office that week on vacation
taking my own daughter to look at colleges
sally
i suspect that you meant to include bob hall
the vp that reports to me
on this mailing list
his assistant
heather choate
is included in your mailing list
the
robert l hall at et&s
to whom this is addressed is not bob hall in networks who reports to me
you should address this to
bob hall
if you do this the e:mail address should pop us as bob m hall/na/enron
thanks
sally
still checking kids schedules at home for the 0th
i will let you know tomorrow
sally
thanks for sending me your thoughts from the meeting you attended
these are interesting
and definitely can relate to some of the things that we discussed in dallas
please continue to send me any thoughts you have on the subject
i will organize a recap of the recent work we have done in trying to
size
the market for our services and get that out to all attendees within the next week or so
sally
i took the executive influence and impact program in may 0 and also took the follow up communications program in 0

i received my bba from ut-austin in 0 and my mba in 0
my maiden name while attending school was sally white
i think that this sounds like a good plan

clay and nadege are still pending on their fulltime offers
this should help us in the cultivation effort
sally enron north america corp
thought you might like to see this note from max on the doorstep review in monterrey
beth is a great addition and has made a very positive impact already
sally
fyi
beth apollo led the doorstep review in monterrey last week
no problems discovered
but beth did find some communications and system access issues that could be improved to make it easier for max's team to do their jobs
she has quickly identified a point person within operations in houston who is bi-lingual
gordon
max's note addresses his pleasure over beth's responsiveness and the doorstep process in general
just wanted to pass this along
sally
buried somewhere in these e:mail messages is a resume

i will either see you on thursday next week
or on monday the 0th
sally
i got the message that you couldn't meet this afternoon
thought i would do a quick note to bring you up to date on some things
commercialization efforts
services
delayed by several days due to the unexpected absence of mary solmonson for health reasons
i learned about this when i returned to the office on tuesday
and have worked to replace her as best we can during this market sizing phase
jennifer denney
who was in dallas with us and works under sheri thomas in the eol product control group
will partner with james scribner in mary's absence to help us run down additional data on potential customers
beth apollo will be working closely with james and jennifer
they will welcome rahil's help and will continue to work with jennifer on developing the revenue model
commercialization efforts
consulting
bjorn hagelman in the rac group made a presentation at the risk forum luncheon last week outlining a plan for providing risk consulting services to external customers
some of his ideas overlap the ideas around consulting that we fleshed out in our dallas meeting
some of his ideas included providing services from my risk operations team
i want this to be a concerted and not disjointed effort
bjorn's vision is to create an enron sub that will be the consulting company
our team in dallas saw wisdom in partnering with an accounting/consulting firm
established marketing arm
existing customer contacts
proven consulting skills
depth of resources
etc
there could be a play to get a hefty sum up front from a consulting firm to partner with us
we impart our risk knowledge
they get the edge in the marketplace from pairing with us
we take our upfront payment
they do most of the grinding work
not necessarily a bad model
bjorn seems to be in a hurry
as he has identified a shipping company in europe that is in need of risk consulting and is ready to pay
probably okay for him to start this effort in that way
prove concept
and then we can consider the wisdom of partnering with someone else
i spent some time with him today
i want to be sure that he doesn't commit my team to provide a service without our understanding and being in agreement with the fee structure
we are okay for right now
i will be following what bjorn is doing and looking for ways to work together if there is a good upside
i will keep you posted
commercialization efforts
internal marketing
we have to change some business practices within enron and create a mind shift when originators are selling operational services to their customers
we must price those and we must have a mechanism for granting the appropriate income to operations
deal is in the works through power origination team
they priced our services to customer without our involvement
pricing may not even be sufficient to cover our costs
we are researching
to do's here are to create an internal marketing document to review with lead originators and to change dash process so that operations has a sign-off
i met with louise today on this
i will plan meetings with origination teams during the week of march 0
would love to get your input on our presentation to the orig teams
i will get you a draft for your comments
operational risk
key focus this week has been on rebuilding a risk team in portland
have worked with stacey white
my power risk director
and tim belden to make sure we have a short term and long term plan that will work
i am comfortable that we have devised a good plan
we lost the manager of that group last week
a planned move to london to follow her husband to an enron job there
our unexpected change this week was the resignation monday of another risk book administrator from portland
operational risk
another key area that we are focusing on is the hpl sale
end of day today we will know which employees are going to aep
we are working on a smooth transition plan and how we will handle trailing issues with customers after the sale effective date
we expect to eliminate 0 positions with the sale
this number was much larger earlier in the year
around 0
but have had a lot of attrition with the news of the sale
bob hall is focused on the details around this issue
operational risk
we completed a doorstep review on the monterrey office last week
this is the review of operational controls and procedures
went well
max was skeptical about the process at first
but pleased in the end
i will forward and e:mail to you from max proclaiming his support of these reviews
we overhauled this week the doorstep review schedule for the remainder of the year and reviewed that today with rick causey
he likes the revisions that we have made
beth apollo on my team is leading this effort
spring break plans
my children are on spring break the week of march 0 and the nanny has the week off
we will be out of town through wednesday
march 0 with the whole family looking at colleges for meagan
patti has contact numbers for me if needed
i may decide to come back into the office on thursday and friday
i will let patti know when we get back in town
i will either see you the end of next week
or back on monday
march 0
see separate e:mail for contact names and numbers in operations while i am out
fyi per my longer e:mail update message
have you heard any more about this
i didn't see it on my calendar
this does conflict with philippe's thursday staff meeting i believe
maybe philippe will cancel that
let me know
thanks
sally
i didn't search this long list of addressees to see if you were included
in case this is going only to peggy
i thought that i would forward this since she is still on vacation
sally
did you get the changes that we discussed yesterday included before the response to the rfp went to cms
also
please send me a copy of the complete response to the rfp
assuming you have that
you mentioned yesterday that the document we were reviewing was only part of the package
i would like to see the whole thing
thanks
fyi
i will be in new york on business on march 0th
sorry that i will not be able to attend
the other person that i would send in my place is beth apollo
however
she will be on vacation next week
can you give me any info that may be made available
thanks
thanks for your note
i really enjoyed visiting with you over dinner
i am so glad to hear that you will be joining us at enron this summer
i know that you will find it to be an exciting place
please let me know what your start date will be
i would love to schedule a lunch with you soon after you arrive
i hope that you will consider me a ready resource for any questions that you have both before you arrive and once you are in the door at enron
sally
i am so glad that you will be able to interview
i will look forward to seeing you in austin on wednesday
sally
fyi i will be out of the office on wednesday
march 0
i will be in austin interviewing 0st year mba students for the enron scholarships
this will be the third year that enron will give two to three $0,0 scholarships to top mba students for use in their second year in business school
it's great pr for enron on campus
largest mba scholarships given
and it has helped in our recruiting efforts as well
we hired one of the first scholarship winners and he now works as an associate in generation investments in enron americas
gene humphrey was the senior member of the four-person interview team
now that is me
this is just a day trip
and i will check messages during breaks and will be back in houston late wednesday afternoon
i will also be in new york on friday
march 0
steve kean asked that i be the enron participant at a women in business panel discussion at columbia school of business
i think that the list of female md's with their mba is a short one
thanks for your list
i will add these to our hot list
let me know about the a/r
thanks
would love to hear about your trip in more detail
sally
fyi
sounds as if michelle is accepting
do you have anything firm from her
sally
all eight students that we interviewed for the enron scholarship were great and we should actively be sure that we get them on our interview schedules next year when they are in the second year of the mba program
i don't want to simply leave that to chance by encouraging them to consider us
karen's letter
noted below
is a good idea
but we should augment that by getting these students names on our radar screen for next year
i will find out who the recruiter is for ut mba's and i will get copies of the students
resumes and my notes on where they could be a good fit to that recruiter
sally
are we going to do anything for the students before fall semester
the dinner with dean may and others from the university is great in the fall
but last year
we had thought about just a small lunch with the students and a few from enron
this can be simple and we don't have to coordinate around the schedule of any ut faculty or staff
but it does allow enron to have a more immediate follow up with the scholarship recepients to celebrate their being chosen
sally
fyi
see attachment for latest attempt at satisfying the
ill-defined
if this is not on target
we will keep working until it is
sally
good response
bob
thanks for leading the way on the format for that meeting
sally
big ticket item on here is the group dinner in dallas for the ase
i can view the entry and can click on attendees
but only see a list of 0 or 0 attendees
there were 0 or so
plus greg piper and lisa petruska
i am missing a second page of attendees
or were only a few listed
if i am not missing a page
please ask heather to include the complete list of attendees
all who were at the ase plus greg and lisa
a $0,0 meal for 0 attendees looks funny
there were many more in attendance
the cost of the meal makes more sense with a complete list of attendees
thanks
please approve
we will get you back on the official distribution list
for now
i am forwarding our weekly report to you
sally
please approve
fyi
people tend to forget that we have some parts of the business that run 0 hours a day
we often get notices like the one sent on march 0 below without much lead time and without regard to potential business impact
bob superty has done a good job in scrambling to provide business solutions for us in gas scheduling
this is a good team that knows how to react quickly
sally
thanks for your note and resume
i have sent a copy to our managing director of global financial trading
he is in our london office this week
with a pretty demanding schedule
so it may be early next week before i hear back from him with regard to his interest
i look forward to talking with you tomorrow
best time to reach me would be around 0:0 pm
sally
to
all egm and eim employees affected from
sally beck
managing director of enw-global risk management operations last fall
the enron wholesale services organization was created and announced in an organizational memo from jeff skilling
all wholesale companies
enron americas
enron europe
enron global markets and enron industrial markets
plus enron net works and enron global assets were included in the enron wholesale services umbrella
in that organizational memo
the energy operations team
now global risk management operations
was moved into enron net works to align our operational services
information technology and e:commerce platforms in order to offer the best quality services to enron wholesale customers
this alignment also positions us to evaluate the prospect of packaging these services for other customers as well
with this reorganization
we continue to maintain dedicated operations teams that support each of the wholesale businesses
since this reorganization occurred so close to year end
i suggested that we wait until january 0
0 to move employees under enron net works
senior management
accounting and hr agreed with this date for effecting the move to enron networks
unfortunately
however
the january conversion to networks did not get fully executed
to correct this
effective april 0
0
all egm and eim employees and non-employees who provide risk management operations services and ultimately report in to brent price and brenda herod
respectively
will be transferred to enw
global risk management operations under company 0e
starting april 0st
you should start using new cost centers for coding and timekeeping purposes
this will formalize the enw-global risk management operations
structure
there are some direct effects that surround the conversion to enron net works
because you are transferring between enron payroll companies
irs requirements state that fica withholding must start over
this applies only to the oasdi
0.0%
which has a maximum wage base withholding of $0,0.0 for 0
medicare tax withholding of 0.0% has no cap and therefore does not start over but continues as usual
the excess oasdi withholding that you incur for the year will credit to you on your 0 tax return as withholding
therefore
to alleviate the burden of starting over
you can adjust your federal income tax withholding down by filing a new form w-0 and claim additional allowances which will reduce the withholding to adjust for the excess oasdi withholding
be sure to ask your tax advisor what additional steps you can take to balance out these changes
you may also contact the payroll department @ 0/0-0 to assist you with any questions
we will continue to have dedicated hr reps who will work directly with you and your team and who will coordinate among themselves to share best practices that can positively impact all teams
if you have questions
please call the hr representative who supports your organization
as identified below relative to the business unit to which your team is dedicated
business unit hr contact phone# egm david hill 0/0-0 eim kathy neal 0/0-0 ea/global services frank de jesus 0/0-0 thanks for your continued hard work and dedication to the success of enron wholesale services
resume attached per my voice mail to you
this guy is currently at compaq
but wants to do something else
any interest
as i said in my voice mail
i will be glad to call my friend dave schempf to get more info on this guy if you would like
sally
looks like this is back in the right spot for discussion
exactly
mom sent me the pictures from the hospital with anna
i could easily be mistaken for her grandmother
i'm afraid
i see pictures of myself and wonder who that older person is
sally
can you print this for me
thanks
thanks for putting this together
i will look forward to reading the details later today
sally
i was at the pre-seasoner opener at enron field last friday night and saw you throw the first pitch
it was a nice one
never a chance of it hitting the dirt
sally
looks like this is back in the right spot for discussion
you are kind
and that's one of the things that i love about you
i suppose that we should get serious about the dinner for mom and dad
since it is two months away
i will be glad to handle invitations
i will look for some this week and coordinate with mom on final names and addresses
cara had sent an e:mail a few weeks ago with some detailed questions to answer
i still have a copy of it
but haven't focused on it to date
i will call you tonight and we can go through it and offer to cara to follow up with josephine's house if that would help her given her current charge at home
sally
can you print this for me
thanks
please put these dates on my calendar and let lexi know that at this point the calendar is open and that i will be happy to participate in both the information session and the interviews
thanks
please ask sheri thomas if this person needs access to eol applications
i don't recognize the names
the name noted as manager is loyd will
who is a commercial employee reporting to kevin presto
thanks
sally has arranged brian wood with avistar to demo a desktop video conferencing product tomorrow
wednesday
april 0
0:0
0:0 pm
brian will meet at sally's office and take whoever is interested to another office location in the enron building for demonstration
if you are interested in attending
please call me at x0 so i can give brian a headcount
thanks
patti x0
i will be in the office the whole week of april 0
i will ask my assistant to call yours to set up a 0 minute meeting for us next week to discuss the candidates that we saw during the scholarship interviews
sally
fyi
let's discuss
sally
got your note
it's a little premature to forecast now
we will have a better idea by april 0
our timeline for completing our look at a revenue model
can we delay until then
we do have a monthly fee of $0,0 that we are receiving from bridgeline that
while small
you could include in our revenue line to date
i am not sure why it is not showing up as income
probably because we have been considered a cost center to date
i suspect that the income is simply being recorded as an offset to one of our cost centers
by copy of this memo to brian heinrich
could you and he figure out where that income is and classify it appropriately so that it shows as revenue
since our costs are fully allocated to business units
this should be pure margin
hey
you have to start somewhere
i have a lunch meeting scheduled with greg piper on friday this week
one of the items that i want to discuss with him is how we want to treat expenses that we are incurring while researching the feasibility of this business
i don't have an answer for you today on what if any costs will not be allocated to the business units
next week i can give you more info on that
is this on vanessa's update list
are users happy with the results
per my memo below
please enroll brenda herod
james scribner
thresa allenand shona wilson for the may session
thanks for the reminder and for yourhelp
sally
great idea to run this by louise
she ususally has some good ideas on how things should look and feel online
i would love to see it
too
thanks
sally
does vanessa know anything about this
i know that we had a definite interest several years ago in a system from siebel
we shelved it at the time due to it resource constraints and philippe's concern over costs
in the meantime
ees bought a license and uses this system
i know that mary was resurrecting this with someone on her team
she had recently reviewed it with brenda herod
i believe
this is one of the items that we listed in dallas as a need if we were to get heavily into providing services for others
sally
i am following up with someone that was on mary's team that now works for beth apollo
we will get back with you on this shortly
sally
rahil is working with me on a presentation that covers what our services are
the creation of a pricing desk
how that will work
process and revenue sharing
selling of services for others
our operations pricing model
the dash process
key contacts in operations
etc
i expect to review a draft by this friday
tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting
we are checking travel schedules for laura luce and max y
to see if we can catch both in houston sometime next week
greg piper suggests a meeting with all origination heads at once
a mini offsite
we will do that if we can set a date that works for a majority
if that doesn't work
we will simply do one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone
targeted attendees are
gas frank vickers
east
laura luce
central
barry tycholiz
west
derivatives fred lagrasta power dave duran ozzie pagan ed baughman bruce shuckley portland chris calger calgary ladain mexico max y
when you and i met we discussed most of these names
i added the calgary guy and max
i also want to share this info with bob shults and his eol marketing team
they talk with a lot of customers and may have the opportunity to bring up our services as well
we have spent some time with jean mrha and john grass
and will share the presentation with them as well
do you want to add any names
if we do wind up with one date that will work for most
i will let you know that tomorrow so that you can attend if you would like
sally
it didn't occur to me until seeing richard's message that we might have a hole in communications with mary being out on an extended basis
we should probably create a message on mary's phone that refers callers to someone else
ditto on e:mail messages
beth
does it make sense for that referral to be james
or you
or vanessa
others within our organization that may try to reach mary could have questions about global databases
projects that joel's group had been handling
etc
i am not trying to put this off on you if you don't think it is appropriate
but james and/or vanessa came to mind as possible contacts
by copy to hector
i also wonder if we should review incoming e:mails that have come to mary over the last several weeks to see if there are some internal requests to which we need to respond
let me know what you think
sally
tight time frame for mike
co
on metals deliverables
raises the question around the timing of next week's visit on metal
will we divert critical resources from these efforts
sally
fyi
let's discuss
sally
is this on vanessa's update list
are users happy with the results
per my memo below
please enroll brenda herod
james scribner
thresa allen and shona wilson for the may session
thanks for the reminder and for your help
sally
thanks for the update
i am forwarding your message to beth apollo
she is the vp on my team that manages our global services
and this executive report viewer falls in that arena
she will be closer to this than i
you may want to get her feedback as well
sally
please print in color for me
thanks
in a meeting with louise kitchen today
she mentioned that bob superty was very impressive in a presentation that he made to the peoples energy board of directors on wednesday
she was very complimentary
i have let bob know about louise's praise
thought that you would like to know as well
sally
imagining that for myself
it would not be a pretty site
was it just a lot of movement
or was there noise as well
sally
please print in color for me
do we have a file set up for these
thanks
sally
is this going to be a shower
if so
i would like to get my own gift for them
if that is okay
or would you prefer that everyone simply contribute to the gift basket
what time on the 0th
i'd like to put that on my calendar
does louise know if it is a boy or girl
thanks
sally
rahil will have a draft to me this afternoon
then he
beth apollo and i will meet tomorrow morning at 0:0 to discuss and revise
i don't want to
mass mail
this on friday
none of these guys will read it on friday afternoon or over the weekend anyway
instead
i want to meet with frank vickers and ed baughman
i have known both for years and we get both gas and power covered
either friday afternoon or monday to go over the presentation in person and get their thoughts and input
rahil included
they will likely come up with questions that we have not thought of or where our presentation could be tweaked
with revisions from this session
then it makes sense to set up one on one meetings with each orgination team
we spread the word to the whole team
rather than just hitting the origination lead
we can start those next week and finish most next week
i think that the logistics of any offsite would be difficult with schedules and i don't really think that we need one
calgary will need a special message
and we may have to go to calgary to deliver it
you and i can discuss that in more detail
max will be in from mexico on april 0
and beth apollo has already booked some time with him on that day for us to cover this information
laura luce is here today and will be back in houston next wednesday
april 0
i have booked time with her that afternoon to cover the presentation
that will leave portland as the other
out of towner
to schedule
i am planning a trip there the next time that stacey white heads up there
right now we are looking at april 0
0 or 0
we can send chris info before that and plan to meet with him perhaps in conjunction with that trip that i need to make around our west power risk team
i would welcome your participation in any of the meetings here in houston or on the trips that we will need to make
you and i can discuss the appropriate make-up of the team for each of these presentations at lunch tomorrow
i think that this plan will be effective and will give us the best coverage and input
are you comfortable with this plan of attack
sally
please print in color for me
thanks
this is a copy of the presentation that bob superty made to the peoples energy board this week
lousie kitchen told me that he was very impressive in the presentation
not a surprise to me
but it is nice when others recognize the talent that is in the operations organization
we may be able to incorporate some of this into our presentation to originators for internal purposes
and there may be parts of this that could be used in external marketing tools
sally
what does
completed
mean
my first request was to give me access to review all e-mail messages that mary has received since march 0 through yesterday's date
i asked if they could be transferred to my mail box to simplify my review process
has this been done
i don't see any new messages that have been transferred from mary's mail box to mine
sally
is it lunch or dinner on may 0
would you like to be included
we will try to start this next week
i will ask patti to get with you on the details
sally
i am hosting drinks at my home and dinner at champions golf club on saturday
may 0 for my operations team and their spouses
greg and i talked about this today
he asked me to e-mail you so that you could put this on his calendar and said that you would e-mail his wife to check the date as well
if he and his wife are available
i will let you know details as it gets closer
thanks for your help
sally
i have talked with jeff gossett
leslie reeves and stacey white to let them know about the saturday effort and the sunday meeting
they all will be in town this weekend and will be on call
their contact numbers are listed below
home phone cell phone may be long distance leslie reeves 0-0-0 0-0-0 stacey white 0-0-0 0-0-0 sally beck 0-0-0 0-0-0 or
kim theriot reports to leslie
so she will talk with kim
i don't have contact numbers for kim
we'll see you the next time
thanks
is it lunch or dinner on may 0
i was really looking for the list of attendees to see we wanted to share rides to neiman's
can you get that list form vanessa
thanks
expect patti to contact you about setting aside 0 minutes each monday to meet in my office as a team to quickly prioritize tasks for the week regarding the commercialization of our services
while we will certainly draw upon the knowledge of others within operations
we will consider this to be the core resource team
we want to continue to build momentum for this effort
knowing that we are all stretched in managing the day-to-day business
this quick focus each week on the key tasks will keep all of us informed and in alignment
thanks
we'll see you the next time
thanks
please put the 0th meeting on my calendar
i may or may not attend
but want to have that on the calendar just in case
thanks
the floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the it teams
between my operations teams dedicated to ea
egm and eim
i have roughly 0 employees in the enron building
do you want all of them to choose one of the floors noted in your e-mail message
or would it be better to schedule one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this segment of net works
i have noted below the approximate number of employees per floor
including only those floors with a significant number of operations employees
0th floor
trading
0 employees egm risk
vol
mgmt
confirms
settlements and eim risk 0th floor
trading
0 employees egm risk
confirms
settlements
various products
0st floor
trading
0 employees power risk
confirms
vol
mgnt
settlements and dpr and mpr teams 0nd floor
trading
0 employees gas risk
logistics
all regions
operational analysis 0th floor 0 employees gas vol
mgmt
settlements
and global services also
given the fact that operations is a relative
newcomer
to enron networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group
i would be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions
sally
i won't bury you with constant examples
but am copying you on this note regarding floor meetings
while operations is now a part of enron net works
i believe that the only meaningful piece of that to philippe and greg is our commercialization effort
they are not in the habit of considering the 0 people who provide critical services to ea
egm and eim daily
floor meetings set by greg and philippe were apparently aimed at the it teams
and yet my group has added over 0 employees to net works in houston alone with our reorganization late last fall
i will diligently work with philippe and greg on this on an on-going basis
while not fully embraced as part of net works
my operations team now is organizationally separated from the key enron businesses that we support
i suspect that motivating and managing in this environment will become increasingly challenging
this is an fyi more than anything else
sally
your recent voice mail message to me indicated that you maintain a list of board positions held by vp's and above
i thought that it might be helpful to have this in writing to add to your list
beginning with a fiscal year that starts april 0
i am now a member of the board and president-elect of national charity league
a mother-daughter community volunteer organization
we have over 0 members
including mothers and their daughters in grades 0 through 0
in the spring/champions area
we run bingo games in local nursing homes
provide
coaching
during practices for special olympics volleyball
tennis
track and bowling
stock local food pantries
work with children in after-school programs in the local elementary schools
etc
it is a great way to create common goals for mother and daughter teams with a focus on others
at a time when girls would otherwise tend to be focused only on themselves
the hope is that this early introduction to volunteerism will remain with the girls as a lifelong commitment
patti
i left cindy a message last week about attending the ncl convention later in april
she says that ken and jeff encourage board membership in community activities and that taking time during the business week is part of that
so according to cindy
the days at convention will not be counted as vacation days
i guess i would view this as if i were in la on business
so no notation on time out of the office
thanks
patti will be distributing astros tickets to you for the 0 season
we used a process that gives you tickets for games in proportion to the number of employees on your team
i hope that you will enjoy the games and that you will also be able to use some of the tickets to reward employees for a job well done
we have improved our tickets this year
thanks to patti
who scoped out options for new tickets
and to my husband
who studied advantages and disadvantages of each option
we have some good seats for the year
the new tickets
0 together
are dugout tickets
located between home and third base
about 0 rows up from the field
not aisle tickets this year
but i sat in the seats for the pre-season opener
and they are a big improvement over last year
we will work on the aisle for next year
we also still have the two terrace level tickets as we did last year
for some games you will get all 0 tickets
and for others you may get either the dugout tickets or the terrace tickets
not a bad start to the season so far
so hopefully the new ballpark jinx is history
sally
beth apollo has recently joined the team and brenda herod has recently married
february and march were gone before i could get organized enough to try to celebrate both of these occasions
in honor of beth's arrival and brenda's marriage
i hope that you can join david and me for drinks and appetizers at our house on saturday
may 0
followed by dinner at champions golf club
please include your spouse or a guest
and know that we will also be happy to just have you attend
let me know if that date will work for you
this date change means that i won't be able to make it to the open house
i will be out of town on april 0
i would recommend floor meetings on 0
we occupy almost the entire floor
and on the operations end of floor 0
that would cover everyone pretty well
thanks
sally
i chose not to circulate a copy last friday
reality was that i didn't think that any of the originators would read it over the weekend anyway
we had hoped to have a final draft ready on monday
april 0
with plans to review that with andy zipper for his input and then two
test runs
with ed baughman and frank vickers on tuesday
with any suggested changes from those test runs
my plan was to circulate copies to you and john lavorato on tuesday as well so that you would be aware of the approach with the origination teams
we scraped the idea of an offsite
and instead are setting up individual meetings with lead originators and their teams
unfortunately
i got food poisoning monday night and was out of the office on tuesday
so we are behind schedule by a day
i am in the office today
but at about half speed
and we will try to make up for time lost yesterday
good idea
is there a way to monitor usage of this folder is insure that everyone has read and complied with your message
in re-reading this
i noticed that todd hall was included in the distribution list
he is the only one from brent's team included
do you want to copy brent as well
or was todd's inclusion due to his previous responsibility over the mpr
which now is managed by susie ayala
either way
you may want to include brent on the message just so that he and his team know about the creation of this common drive
what about georgeanne hodges
should she be notified as well
you may also want to copy wes as an fyi
thanks
here is another one
memo on floor meetings
plus my reply to greg and philippe
according to tammy shepperd who is very involved in space allocation for the new building
a location for sheri thomas
product control group remains up in the air
sheri
andy zipper
john cummings
and surresh have met to discuss space
and all agree that sheri's group needs to be located with their groups
my understanding is that you have designated a certain number of spaces for enw on the trading floors
but that sheri's group is not included in that count
can we get together when you return to the office next week and discuss floor space
thanks
sally
back on the calendar this afternoon with andy zipper to get his comments on the presentation
should be able to get you and john a copy following that meeting
here is another one
this is the note that i mentioned that i sent to philippe today about space in the new building
you can take up the cause with philippe when he returns
i am meeting with tammy shepperd at 0:0 tomorrow on some space planning details
i will tell her that sheri's group should be located with yours
and by that time i should be able to tell her that sheri's group will be reporting to you
i will call you tomorrow after i talk with sheri
should be by 0:0 am
sally
this will be an important meeting for me to attend
let me know when this gets scheduled
thanks
memo on floor meetings
plus my reply to greg and philippe
i am taking good friday as my discretionary holiday for the year
i will be in austin with my daughter for her official tour and info session at ut
plus a look at dorms
patti will have numbers where i can be reached in austin
we are making final changes to the orig presentation today
i will be reviewing those tomorrow in austin
i am e:mailing you a current draft version
although it does not yet reflect all of the changes needed
i am still trying to eliminate some pages to make it more a more manageable size
i have taken the work that rahil and fred have done on the services and have made that into an appendix
nice work
but way too much detail for a presentation
thanks for following up on this
we will incorporate you numbers for offices and spots in the tower
here is final presentation
i worked with fred and stephen this morning to make final changes
sally
keep me posted on the impact of losing that day
thanks
sally
i will meet with kim this afternoon on her comments on confirmlogic
bottom line
no sign off from kim at this point
thought you might want to know
sally
i assume that kathryn has communicated this to you
i have only read kim's e-mail
i will talk with her later today
sally
keep me posted on the impact of losing that day
thanks
sally
i will need a rental car in oklahoma
looks like national is the one to use
thanks
sally
hadn't talked with you in a while and thought that i would send a quick note to say hello
saying it is busy here sounds a bit like a broken record
but it is busy here
big challege currently is juggling our huge day-to-day business for enron americas
starting the absorption of some pieces of ees
my part alone looks like an additional 0 employees
with the intent to find ways to assimilate that business and ultimately reduce overall support costs for enron
the sale of houston pipeline to aep that should conclude in june or july and the commercialization of mid and back office services
all of these of course with top priority
i am really enjoying having beth apollo on the team
she has already made a very positive impact
while she is learning the details of the operations side
how is life treating you
i know that their is a lot going on in the london office
as well
how has ted murphy's assimilation into the london office been
do you have plans to be in houston any time soon
keep me posted tomorrow on any news that you hear from mike jordan regarding their baby
hope that all is well with you
sally
i have my list at home
but i know that we need dad's sister jane and her husband
homer and karen
sarah in austin
whose kids are independently dell-wealthy
and i can't remember who else
i know that there were ten invitations needed
including mom and dad
the list below plus those in this paragraph total 0
so we must be missing 0
i will try to catch david and have him look at the list that i copied from mom
thanks for these
i will do invitations this weekend
do you have the address for josephine's house
and do we have a time
sally
thought you'd like to know
sally
thought you'd like to know
sally
congratulations on the birth of emma
i hope that everyone is doing well
enjoy your time off and the opportunity to hold and hug that new baby
i will look forward to seeing pictures the next time that we get together
sally
as a follow up to our discussion earlier this week on commercialization of mid and back office services and managing those responsibilities for ews
i will have a timeline for your review on monday that will pinpoint key dates
unify conversion
ees absorption
hpl sale
commercialization
todd busby's arrival
etc
i will also have details of resource needs
we can use this to set internal expectations on the timing of successfully handling all of these initiatives
i will welcome your comments on the timeline
sally
latest update
fyi
i will be out of town on thursday
i think that it would be great if you could attend this info session on commoditylogic
it would be good to hear how this project is being described to a wider audience within enron
if you can make it
please try to attend
and i would love to have a voice mail message afterwards with your feedback from the info session
thanks
the attachment below recaps our meeting from this morning
highlights from last week are noted and commitments for this week are detailed as well
let me know if anything has been left off the list
sally
i have asked bob superty
kim theriot and mechelle stevens to attend
i don't have confirmation yet on whether or not all three will be able to attend
i thought that if asked three
that this should work on one of their schedules
i will let you know later who will attend
i will be out of the office that day
sally
focusing the right people on the right issues is always a good idea
i would like to visit with you to understand what you mean by
operational issues
my team has a meeting every other monday focused on operational risk and we have various working groups that focus on key projects or initiatives that vary with need
a daily meeting on operational issues would need to have the appropriate team members there
and i hesitate to add an additional meeting to any key folks on my team if operational projects/initiatives are being covered either in our monday operational risk meeting or in another forum
sally
fyi
i need to talk with shona tomorrow to get a read on what rick wants here
do you have any ideas given your on-going conversations with david port
sally
latest update
fyi
i have put this meeting on my calendar
you don't need to forward to anyone else
chantelle should handle that for brent's egm team
thanks
i will have that to you by the end of the afternoon
i have set aside my afternoon to complete the timeline and resource needs
rewrite the presentation to originators
recap our monday morning meeting on commercialization efforts for this week
work on my game plan for ees and get with bob hall to do an update for brian redmond on the hpl sale before his tueday meeting with louise
i will share these items with you as i get them checked off my list this afternoon
sally
three weeks ago i started a 0 minute meeting in my office on monday mornings for a key group working on the commercialization effort of mid and back office services
attendees are my key operations personnel involved
todd busby
for a preview of what's to come
rahil and fred philipson
the purpose of the meeting is to review progress on items agreed to for the previous week and to establish priorities for the current week
i have been capturing all of this on the white board in my office to date
today i decided to recap in writing for everyone
thought that you might be interested
open the attachment to the e-mail below
this way you will know more of the details of our efforts each week
sally
here is rick's response
sounds more like a concern on his part on losing people and some of their reasons cited for leaving
do you know who has left
leslie reeves and i met today with mark taylor and mark haedicke to discuss the eliminination of confirmations for transacations executed on enrononline
mark taylor has been supportive of the elimination of confirmations
and in the meeting today mark haedicke agreed
this elimination of confirmations will have to be reviewed on a counterparty by counterparty basis
and for each counterparty
commodity by commodity
next steps
document eol process and records that can evidence the execution of a transaction
ease of availability
type of record available
retention schedule for records
etc
sheri thomas
create a priortized list of counterparties to be approached for elimination of confirmations
large number of transactions
those that have asked for paper-relief
etc
leslie reeves/kim theriot
set up meeting with andy zipper
jay webb
tom gros
mark taylor
jeff hodge
legal-physical gas
elizabeth saeger
legal-power
and leslie reeves to review game plan for elimination of confirmations and impact on confirmlogic
my assistant will set up meeting
fyi
i enjoyed lunch
too
glad you included kristin
when do jo and the kids leave for england
we should try to have lunch with our gangs before then
let me know
sally
thanks for the invitation
i will be out of town april 0 through 0
so unfortunately i will have to miss the game
sally
please put this on my calendar
thanks
glad you followed up
i don't know why you would have been deleted
but i am glad that is straightened out
i will look for the feedback form via e-mail
thanks
thanks for your note
i am glad that you liked the pictures
we would love to have you here for the recital and to spend the night
if you thought it would work
you could come over on monday night and we could enjoy dinner together
i could take the day off from work on tuesday and we could do some fun things
before what would probably be a more rushed dinner tuesday night before heading to amanda's recital
then you could make your drive back on wednesday after breakfast
whatever works for you will be great
though
i am heading to los angeles tomorrow for the national charity league national meeting
patti is sending you my flight and hotel info
my thursday night is open
and i will be getting with sue that night
she lives in whittier
so not too far for her to come and pick me up
i know that we will have a good time catching up
we have set monday
june 0 for the date of our operations prc that will include employees that are supporting ena
egm and eim
you mentioned that your functional prc will be set for sometime between june 0 and june 0
it would certainly be best from my point of view if my prc occurs prior to your functional prc
while a number of prc meetings will be held within operations during the week of june 0 in preparation for our june 0th meeting
that will be the first date where we will cross calibrate directors
senior directors and vp's across ena
egm and eim operations
i thought that it might be helpful to know the date of my operations prc meeting in setting the date for your meeting
please let me know as soon as a date has been set for your prc
thanks
monday
june 0 has been set as the date for my operations prc meeting
at this meeting we will briefly review the results from numerous smaller prc meetings that will have been held by my team during the week of june 0
on june 0
we will give a cursory review to the results from the smaller prc meetings from analysts through manager
our primary goal will be to make sure that the appropriate distribution has been met
and that we are aware of the individuals that are 0's and 0's
the main focus of the meeting will be to cross calibrate directors
senior directors and vp's across the operations organization and the teams that support ea
egm and eim
we are still debating if and how we cross calibrate with the london operations team
you mentioned today that you might like to attend this meeting
i wanted you to have the date so that you could put this on your calendar
my team is also included in a funtional prc meeting that is held by rick causey
in that meeting we review director level and above
rick has not set the date for that meeting
i always like to heart good news
i can't say that i have been deluged with examples since that meeting in january
i will ask patti to set up a meeting sometime this week for us to get together
sally
i can't say that this will make me sad to lose this job
enjoy it
sally
i don't recall making this request
who did you hear this from
maybe that person could shed light on this for both of us
there was some confusion among the hr groups a couple of weeks ago with the name that was assigned to your cost center for accounting purposes
didn't match the organizational name that is used for your group
i wonder if that is where this is coming from
norma
whose last name i don't know
who works for robert jones in hr was in the midst of the confusion
the rc name that was used had
ibs
in it and was rather long
but didn't obviously seem to relate to your team
question was whether or not this rc reported in through operations
when i asked norma to read me the names of employees in that rc
it included kathy reeves and her team
i told her that we had not used the term
ibs
in a while
norma asked if the rc name should be consistent with the organizational name of the group
i said that makes sense and she said she would follow up on that
but that should have been a name change
not the opening of a new cost center
see if any of this info gets us back on the right track
sally
i will keep you posted on time and location for the meeting on the 0th
if you join us for discussions on vp's
we will review brent price
bob hall
peggy hedstrom and beth apollo
if you want to sit in on review of senior directors
that would pick up leslie reeves
james scribner
brenda herod
kevin sweeney and sheila glover
sally
enron made most offers to summer interns as a result of campus interviews several months ago
at that time
i had surveyed my direct reports to determine the number of summer interns that we thought we could effectively accomodate and i provided that number to the recruiting staff
i understand from ted bland that the recruiting team is in the process of assigning summer interns to job opportunities and needs
you might check with lexi elliot
one of the campus recruiters
to see if the number of incoming interns has matched the business needs
if we have more jobs than interns
then lexi could help in the process of interviewing debbie for a position
my last conversation with ted bland led me to believe that we had a sufficient number of incoming interns
but it wouldn't hurt to check with lexi
sally
on prc
in the next few days
i will be able to give tina an idea on the time when we will start senior directors in the june 0th meeting and we will keep you posted that day on timing
contracts
i met this morning with robert jones and ryan seleznov on contracts for brent and bob
they were going to get with michelle cash today with the goal of having contract drafts for me by the end of the day
legal has their offsite starting wednesday
so we will be out of luck for legal help after today
i will keep you posted
i believe that these new contracts will be well received
q0 goals
patti has the meeting on my calendar with you and philippe for next monday at 0:0
sally
fyi
thanks for copying me on michael brown's note
brenda herod flew to london last night and should be in the london office today
i am sure that she will be spending some time with you on this
she and i visited briefly yesterday about an effective model for support in london for the pulp and paper effort
so as to not steal her thunder
it will suffice to say that i am comfortable that the two of you can hit upon a good solution and that it will feel much more cooperative than the existing egm model
sally
please approve this request
brent price is my direct report and is responsible for the rc's included in this request
thanks
sally beck
i have put the staff meeting referenced at the bottom of john's message on my calendar
please check with kim on the location and as to whether or not future dates are set
also
please check to see if date for offsite has been set
we are trying to schedule a vacation
and it would help to know the dates of the offsite
thanks
fyi
please see if you can get this to print so that i get all of the info
i tried it 0 times on friday and could only one page to print
which did not include all of the information
thanks
need this today
you are welcome to attend any of these
in fact
it is helpful for cross calibration purposes if there is some cross over in the meetings
do get with jeff and stacey before the meetings to give them ffeedback on those book administrators who are problematic
patti
please add beth to the attendee list for the risk and settlements prc meetings
thanks
we are planning a meeting with the teams lead by meredith
mark evans and mary lynne ruffner this afternoon
you should be getting information from meredith shortly with time and location
during that meeting we will clarify this memo for everyone
sally
at the end of my 0:0 meeting with philippe and greg today i will get clarification about the international travel
it is hard for me to believe that philippe or beth perlman or greg piper will fly coach to london
i will keep you posted
sally
fyi
you may want to review the process for managing stacks on eol and be certain that those to whom access is granted is in compliance with the list of authorized traders maintained by rac
i don't think that rac needs to have approval
but we should be cross referencing requests to manage stacks on eol with the approved trader list
this may be part of your process
if not
it probably should be incorporated
then you may want to educate the rac team on your approval process
let me know if you need and help or support from me
hope that all is well
sally
thanks for copying me on this note
i have sent a suggestion to sheri and asked her to respond to frank hayden
sally
good solution
and you are right
this falls under our normal educational assistance program
thanks for the update
sally
the name that i couldn't remember when we spoke yesterday if geoffrey mann
americas ceo
accompanying him will be jim martino from the austin office
they will be here at 0:0 and i will have them come to the 0rd floor and i will meet with them for a few minutes
then i can call you and walk them to wherever you are going to meet with them
again
thanks for making this work for your schedule
business decisions about what viviance can provide for you are clearly yours
i do appreciate your willingness to give them your time and a fair
audience
i know that my sister is very bullish on the quality of the product that they deliver
i look forward to seeing you again on thursday morning and to meeting mr
mann
you will need to check in at the front desk in the lobby
usually
the process is that they will call to let me know that you are here
my extention is 0
you will get a visitors badge and then you will go to the 0rd floor
there is a reception area on 0
i will meet you there
sally beck
your list looked good and i approved all as reviewers
we can talk about how the vp prc process works
there will be an opportunity there to provide info to various commercial md's that will be in attendance at the meeting
we will make sure that we prepare the attendees well
sally
thanks for joining us for dinner last week
it was good to see you again as well
i hope that your temporary move to houston goes smoothly
please call me with a contact number for you this summer
we can get together while you are in town for your summer internship
sally
i know that the timing on choosing these interns was short
thanks for responding back to jana so quickly
and now most of them will be here next monday
please be certain that you and your assistant are actively working on a location
phone and computer
with necessary access granted
for these interns
i want to be certain that all interns have a very positive introduction to working at enron
this list excludes those that will assigned to egm under brent price and his team
as soon as i get an updated list from jana
i will schedule a meeting for this week so that we can discuss how we will make the internships a success this summer
all ideas will be welcome
so get creative before coming to the meeting
thanks
sally
i want to keep track of summer interns
please make me a desk file
this list is missing summer interns under brent
i have asked jana to send me an updated list
i have also sent her a message letting her know that sheri thomas now reports into andy zipper and that she needs to communicate with sheri and andy directly regarding greg carlson's internship
also
did you keep copies of resumes of the analysts
can you pull resumes for the interns that will be assigned to us
i would like to review them
i also want to hold a meeting later this week with all supervisors who will have interns reporting to them
please check with the listed supervisor on jana's list
if one of their direct reports will actually be the primary supervisor
please get that name
thanks
sally
fyi
could i be included in these update meetings
rather than read the material after the fact and have you review it with me separately
it seems that it would make sense for me to be included in the update meeting that you hold with rick
assuming that rick is comfortable with that
can we do that going forward
if all agree
please ask your assistant to let me know if a date has already been set for the next update
thanks
please print atttachment for me
thanks
here are the two for brent
please get copies of resumes from jana
please set up a meeting for later this week with all who will be supervisors of interns
include brent as well
thanks
thirty minutes will be fine
let's talk about this one
_sally
thanks for your note
i have sent a message to beth apollo
who is james
supervisor
beth is out for the next two days
and will return to the office on wednesday
i will make sure that beth and james make a point of talking with you about this opportunity
sally
you may want to consider her
we can discuss
sally
i regret that i will miss the first global accounting steering committee meeting on tuesday
may 0
i am taking that day as a vacation day while my parents are in houston for amanda's piano recital
i will be in attendance at the next two meetings in may
the 0nd cao meeting and the 0th steering committee meeting
i will be out of the office on tuesday
may 0
i am taking a vacation day while my parents will be in town for my daughter's piano recital
patti
x0
has cell and home numbers where i can be reached
i will be back in the office on wednesday
may 0
please print attachment in color
also print all other recent e:mails from mechelle
thanks
it was a pleasure to meet you last week when you were in houston
you arrived with a some good advance
press
from cindy
all of which was well founded
i am glad that your meeting with tom was fruitful and i am pleased that there may be a fit between enron's needs and vivance's offerings
i know that cindy is very enthusiastic about the quality product that viviance delivers
so creating a win-win situation for both companies would be great
i have e-mailed jim martino to keep me posted to the extent there is anything that i can do to help move along the process
while i won't make the business decision here
i can certainly help to focus attention when needed
let me know when you will be back in houston
if you like mexican food
i can introduce you to the best place in the state for a great meal
sally
here is agenda for causey's offsite next week
i told sharron that you would be in town and she said that you
and anna
would certainly be welcome for all or part of the day
fyi
the location for this meeting is at the adams mark hotel
this is not very close to downtown
would require a car or cab
i would be glad to have you ride with me
just let me know which things you would like to attend
my thoughts are that i will not attend for the entire day
through lunch looks like a good point at which to break and head back to the office
let me know what you want to do so that we can schedule meetings around your choices for wednesday
sally
june 0 works well for me
it is likely that we will be on vacation on friday
june 0
my husband is finalizing airline reservations today
and to use our frequent flyer miles it looks as if we will have to fly on friday
june 0 rather than saturday
june 0
sally
i remember you well
christine
from the recruiting process
i would love to visit with you to catch up on what you have done at enron to date and to talk with you about a rotation in my group
by copy of this memo
i will ask my assistant to set up a time for us to get together
i look forward to seeing you
sally
peggy
i will be at the meeting at 0:0
but will need to leave around 0:0 for a meeting with someone from london
our schedules wouldn't allow for any other time for us to get together
and i have some critical things to review regarding london
sally
thanks for the details on the flowers
that should be enough for us to produce something pretty and nostalgic for a coursage and boutineer
david must have had a brain lapse
he forgot to mention that you had called
meagan and i were probably at the bearkadette officers meeting at the time
we really enjoyed your visit as well
thanks for supporting amanda in her musical efforts
sally
we need to talk
do you want my help in preparing something for paul
would you like me to go with you when you meet with paul
can you print the attachment for me
thanks
the decision was made last friday that june 0 would be the closing date for the sale of hpl to aep
there had been some discussion about moving the close date to july 0
brian redmond has compiled a list of action items to be completed before the close
bob hall is leading this effort for operations and we do not anticipate any problems meeting the june 0 date
as i explained earlier
our involvement will continue with hpl through june
as invoicing and cash collection for the production month of may will be handled in june
after the end of june
their may be some involvement on our part in following up on any unpaid invoices or answering customer questions regarding activity prior to june 0
the effort on our part should diminish substantially after june 0
what do we do with this
i logged in
but couldn't tell what to do
sally
i left you a couple of messages with two different assistants today for you to call
am sure that it is a busy monday
i will send this note so that i don't forget the purpose
with savita assuming the role previously played by sheri with regard to the product control group
i wanted to underscore the importance of a free flow of information between the eol team and my operations team
one of the roles that sheri's team fulfilled was keeping my risk and operations teams apprised of any changes within eol that can have an impact on bridging to our legacy systems
i may have met savita once in passing
i checked with jeff gossett and stacey white
risk leads over gas and power
respectively
and neither one has heard of or met savita
although jennifer denney will play an active role
i know that she will be out on maternity leave soon
so it is important for savita to know the right players on the operations team and for them to know her
i will contact savita directly to make the appropriate introductions
i just wanted your support and encouragement for savita in making the right connections within operations
sally
can you print attachment for me
thanks
the deadline has been extended by hr until tuesday
so that many of us can work on these reviews over the weekend
you should see more responses early next week
sally
informational for me
or do you want me to attend
if you don't want me to attend
would you like for me to review the presentation that you plan to give
sally
my first and second choices on speaking engagements are listed below
0st choice mg0 wed
july 0 who moved my cheese
0nd choice mg0 fri
july 0 leading your firm through change frank and hector have been on point for further participation in the conference and would be best to visit with about use of other passes to the conference
wes colwell has co-sponsored our involvement in this conference
are the four passes intended to cover his group
too
sally
glad that the two of you could make the trip to houston this week
hopefully
your the time spent here was worthwhile in terms of sharing ideas and further developing contacts
i anna
i will look forward to continue dialoge as we explore commercialization opportunities
mike
i will get back with you next week on potential dates for the annual global risk management operations offsite
late oct
and on likely dates for my next trip to london
i enjoyed the shopping and dinner
sally
patti is sending you my slides for the offsite
i finally got out of meetings long enough to review them
there will be four parts to the mid/back office hour and a half on the agenda
global risk management operations
overview of services
beck providing slides
it systems
overview and organization
perlman providing slides
commoditylogic modules
gros providing slides
commercialization effort
the three of us are working on a few slides
to come later today
change in plans
patti will send slides for both me and beth
she is formating info from beth's assistant into format that i used for my slides
so you will get these as one presentation
patti has already sent my slides so that you can begin the process of making copies for the binders
i think that you already have slides from tom on commoditylogic
we are working on a few slides for the commercialization effort
will have those ready as soon as we can
thanks
tina
sally
there is another senior director in london in operations
anna mcandrew
she was just joined enron in april
and i was unsure of her title
confirmed that this morning
what is lily of the valley
i don't know
would it add anything special to the coursage
if so
i would be glad to spring for it
i just don't know enough about flowers to make an educated call
could the florist tell you how wonderful it is for $0
meagan and michael often have coursages and boutineers that coordinate
maybe only key for the
young set
and not those who buy pens to commemorate a 0th anniversary
white rose will be great if the florist feels like the coordinated thing would be weird
we will be upgrading dad from a carnation
anyway
you know in the end
whatever you arrange will be terrific
i don't mean for these comments to sound picky or ungrateful
i am saving that in full force for later life
only kidding
sally
please put this date on my calendar and let lexi know that i will be glad to attend
thanks
please print
evan has close to 0 people reporting to him
the largest segment is the service management team
my understanding is that there are only a handful of people who are involved in managing the invoicing efforts through the outsource providers
we will know this week exactly which positions would come under wholesale
and we will evaluate whether or not the people will move with those functions
i don't think we are in danger of getting mark back
sally
kristin
i know that we would like to get together with you to discuss ut recruiting
the easiest way to get this set up is probably for you to coordinate with our two assistants on a time that will work
my assistant is patti thompson
x0
and rick's assistant is sharron westbrook
by copy of this note
i will ask patti to coordinate with sharron and one of the two will get back with you to let you know available dates and times that rick and i could get with you
sally
please coordinate with sharron on rick's schedule and get back with kristin to set up a meeting
thanks
sally
please print color versions of attachments
along with black and white of anna's cover note
thanks
please print attachment for me
thanks
fyi
i printed copies of this resume the day that i received it from you
i met with beth perlman that day and gave her the resume in person
i also called philippe bibi and sent him a copy of the resume
i am also by way of this e:mail message going to copy robert jones on this resume
robert heads up hr for enron net works
feel free to give beth
philippe and robert a call to add your personal comments about the candidate
sally
what do you think
i have never been crazy about the commercial support tag myself
do you like professional services
or do you have another suggestion
please send me your comments within the next day or so
i would like to get back to david oxley soon
thanks
sally
got your note
i am not incredibly attached to commercial support and i agree that overall it probably sounds second class
professional services sounds fine to me
i have forwarded your message to a handful of my direct reports to get their comments
bob hall
brent price
beth apollo and peggy hedstrom
i should hear back from them today
and i will pass along any pertinent comments
thanks
sally
greg piper and robert jones are aware that i will be on vacation on the date of the prc meeting
sally
thanks
we will add greg to the list and will get back with him on details
sally
sorry to hear about your grandmother
funerals
oddly enough
seem to create opportunities to catch up with other family members
nice to see everyone
you are just sorry about the catalyst for bringing you together
i will talk with you soon
sally
we may have a few more transfers given the final decision on the management of the settlements function
we had a lunch meeting with john lavorato
dave delainey
wes
etc
on thursday last week
and will have fleshed out a the details of a proposal later this week that would move the management of the settlements function under ews and leave the service management component
evan hughes
under ees
final decision expected this week
sally
bob hall says professional services is fine
change is good
as he said
brent's other suggestions are below
i agree with you
simply changing the label doesn't do a whole lot
actions will speak louder than words
sally
thanks for the follow up
sally
we will be in telluride the last week in june for vacation
any suggestions on where we should eat
think 0
0 and 0
children's ages
thanks
sally
fyi
as we get closer to quarter end
it may help your dpr team to know about any pending deals that could be done close to quarter end
sally
as a follow up to last thursday's lunch meeting
scott mills and mary lynn ruffer are working with evan hughes to further define option 0 that we discussed regarding the settlements function
to recap
with that option
ews would assume internal management of the settlements function
including managing data requirements to and from the outsource providers
and ees would retain the service management function
defining service levels and pricing
plus serving as the interface with ees customers
we will review with tim
kevin
don and rogers the more detailed recommendations from this team by mid week
then we should have a final proposal of roles and responsibilities for ews and ees around the settlements function before the end of this week
please call me in the interim if you have any questions or suggestions
sally

i understand from greg that he got a little more direction from paul about the calpine meeting that has been moved to thursday morning
please send beth perlman and me a copy of the revised draft of the meeting document that you are preparing
in addition to tom
thanks
another opinion
i read barry's response from ebs
not a lot of overwhelming sentiment for professional services
since this in only a term used in the prc process
i don't know that a name change at this point would make much of a difference
let me know is decided
sally
i didn't have an opening that looked quite right for dan's experiece
i have
however
given has resume to tom gros who has been leading commoditylogic and is also paired with beth perlman and me on evaluating the potential for commercializing our mid and back office services
in this effort
it is likely that tom will to put together a marketing team
i suggested that he consider dan for one of those positions
fyi
i will fill you in on the meeting this afternoon and will get you a copy of whatever we review
sally
fyi
thanks so much for your note
i have assumed my new role as coo right at budget time
so in addition to being on top of the budget for my operations team of about 0
i have picked up responsibility for the other budgets under enron net works
another 0 people that deliver our it infrastructure
our system maintenance and development projects and our e-commerce platforms
the learning curve is steep right now
but fun
your association with vanderbilt sounds interesting
cindy is keeping me abreast of your project
i sincerely hope that this proves to be a great fit for you
while everyone in the country has been profoundly impacted by the terrorist attacks
i can only imagine that the feeling is heightened for those of you that live in new york
my thoughts are with you and your family
sally
wes and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in each
the outline that i sent you with the changes for the remainder of this week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around people availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set
the schedule that we have been working with that wes provided did not allocate two hours for the friday meeting
if you had set aside two hours
that had not been communicated to us
there were only two one-hour meeting slots on that schedule
one for enw from 0-0 and one for research from 0-0
i have a major conflict on friday
i committed months ago to attend a meeting that ken lay asked to be involved in that is in the woodlands that runs through the evening hours
only because beth perlman is out on thursday for a religious holiday
i decided to
skip out
from this meeting to be here on friday afternoon to discuss the operations and it development budgets together
in order to minimize my time away from the woodlands meeting
i orchestrated the time swap with vince kaminiski so that we could have our enw meeting at 0:0
i will talk with you later today and fill you in on the commitment for ken lay
maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution that works for both of us
i would appreciate your help on that
louise.scheduling issues aside
wes suggested that we also review with you the ees budget that enw has prepared
our approach so far has been to determine the appropriate and necessary spend for 0 for expense and capital for all of the services that enw provides to support the ees business
we have done this without regard to who will cover which expenses
ees or ea
that is a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provided and our best estimate at costs
we are prepared
however
with a suggested split on the costs for discussion purposes
i have assumed that the decision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of the chair for ees and enw
if you would like to cover all of enw's budgets together
both for ees and ea
then it would make more sense to set a longer block of time
maybe 0 hours
i will bring my schedule to our meeting at 0:0 today to cover the canadian budget and we can work out a schedule that works for both of us
we will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction
but will hold that until the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the components of costs and the detail of capital projects
our review of costs and projects in effect will serve as our
scope of engagement
discussion
a service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had been reached on the scope of the engagement
we will have a straw man for discussion on that
sally
this in in response to your offer that you had a few spots on the trading floor when we could locate people that won't move to the new builiding until april
all of these would be it applications support
i would feel comfortable naming names
so if you think you have 0 temporary spots for these people and need names
i will get them to you
thanks
sally
anthony
it's after 0:0 today and apparently the break out by project for enw it development capital is still outstanding from rob
although we have missed our commitment to get restated
and fully footing
info back to dan leff and wade stubblefield today
i think that we need to be able to follow through on this tomorrow
this is just one of a number of budget meetings that we are having to prepare for as net works
and it would be great to get one of these packages finished
jenny
can ken get this wrapped up today so that we can finalize all of this tomorrow
we will just move today's plans
restated pages to you
beth apollo
and anthony by noon and
with your sign off
distribution of revised packet by afternoon
to thursday
thanks
sally
realistically
only the trading support provided for straight-forward gas and power trading makes sense to consider in a cost per transaction mode
i would say that the only part of it development costs that could be considered in that would be the system maintenance costs and maybe the licensing fees
capital projects don't make sense on a cost per transaction basis
should be looked at as individual discreet costs that the business unit sponsor and enw agree upon
while we could come up with a methodology for cost per transaction
i still have concerns about this on a lot of levels
frankly
the relationship between the book administrators and traders is just as collaborative as the eol relationship
if we are boxed into a cost per transaction
then whenever john lavorato or the traders ask for a different view of data or an ad hoc analysis of p&l
we would need to discuss this as a change order and price accordingly
practically speaking
there is not one of the ad hoc trader requests that isn't needed yesterday
and stopping to negotiate whether the request is in or out of scope and additional pricing would probably get me and my risk team fired
i also have a big concern over pushing the envelope on an arms length service arrangement
i will have trouble recruiting and retaining the best people
the guys on my operations team honestly work every day with the business goals of ea in mind
they work hard to insure success for ea
that is what john and louise should want
push us back too far and no one will like the results if we don't have people fully dedicated to and feeling a part of the business to which they provide support
it is kind of ironic
i think that enron is pleased with how i've managed operations
and one of my goals when i took the role a few years back was to create a true team between commerical and my operations team to make sure that this works for enron
i have some really good people who are very motivated
and a big part of that is my commitment to have operations viewed as an integral part of the team at ea
egm
eim
etc
we had to work hard to achieve that
but we've gotten there for the most part
so how odd it is to me that now some people want to undo what has been a major contributor to the success that we have had
ees is reeling right now partly because they have never recognized the value of creating a good operations team
nor did they approach operations as an integral part of managing their business in full
and now i have been asked to help correct that
makes you kind of wonder
i am fully supportive of running operations
and enw
like a business
with a critical eye toward delivering value effectively
when i first took this role i told my team that at that time we were the service provider of circumstance and that the goal was to move to a feeling that we were the service provider of choice
a component of this is definitely striving for lower costs and higher value delivered
we can continue to improve on this
but going too far may produce the wrong answer for enron
sally
i may have zapped some of these updates from john since he has started this
may be good in our budget review meeting on monday with louise to have all of these updates in hand
and any documentation that you all may have kept on performance issues prior to john starting this update process
as back up for maintenance and capital dollars to be spent on unify in 0 to improve performance and reliability
can one of you get all of these updates
thanks
sally
thanks for the updates
when we had the problem with the server resynchronization
did someone from the infrastructure team alert you ahead of time that they were going to do this during normal business hours
or did you have to be the detective to determine the cause once the problem was at hand
let me know
thanks
sally
if i were you
i would talk to wanda and let her know that ken is the point person as it relates to currently handling this matter and that we will trust that she will keep him fully informed and involved
we are glad that she is there to provide some continuity on historical data
but all historical data and forward actions must be confirmed with ken
let me know if you would like me to underscore this with wanda
and i will be glad to
might be a good idea to send a note to dave
janet and dan stating that legal has named wanda as the point person
but that for appropriate continuity and execution that ken must be fully involved
and that you have asked wanda to make that part of her responsibility
copy wanda on the note
sally
these are monday dates
with the original date being october 0
a tuesday
i just wanted to double check the dates with you
unfortunately
neither date works for me
i am taking the day off on the 0th
meagan has a school holiday and we will be in dallas for mustang monday at smu
the program there ends at 0:0 or 0:0 in the afternoon
and we will have driven to dallas
so i can't make it work to be in austin that evening
and on the 0th
i have a monthly national charity league meeting
as president-elect
i am trying to make all of the meetings
if it turns out that the intent was a tuesday night meeting
the 0th or the 0th would work
0th being the best because we will be in austin for interviews
sally
always nice to see positive things
thought i'd share this with you
sally
thanks for the note and your words of encouragement
it is exciting to work on something that helps build a strong franchise for enron
i appreciate the opportunity of being a part of that
sally
please put on my calendar
thanks
wednesday is out for me
but thursday
october 0 and friday
october 0 both work
i will tentatively hold both days until i hear back from you
thanks
sally also
great job on organizing the chf event
i thoroughly enjoyed it
and the people i met and the discussion that we had have certainly created a lot of food for thought
i am in the midst of budgets this week
but will check with you next week on getting our boys together
thanks
sorry
we had to cut one hour down to 0 minutes
lots of time on budgets
still continuing this week
what i would really like is a 0 minute download from an appropriate member of the doorstep team within a few days of their return from each review
my goal is to stay informed on an on-going basis
not quarterly or by bunching several of these together
if there are some concerns
i need to know right away
executive management will assume that i am staying informed on a timely basis
and that should be the reality
the
i's
don't have to be dotted nor the
t's
crossed on the report in order to have this download meeting
it is also highly likely that someone from the business location that has been doorstepped
will engage in a conversation with me
i want to be prepared so that i am knowledgeable about the key points from each review
so that i can respond appropriately
thanks
sally
thought i'd pass this comment along from beverly
sally
john is keeping us updated on unify production problems
which unfortunately occur rather frequently
when he cited the reason for performance issues in his orginal e-mail message below
i asked him whether or not the unify team was aware ahead of time that the server resynchronization was being handled during normal business hours
here is his response
i bring this to your attention not to create an issue
but rather to solve one
i know that everyone is incredibly busy
but with so many interdepencies here we have to stay closely coordinated
i know that eol has a dedicated member of your team who is always on point and knowledgeable about infrastructure issues that could or do touch eol
is there anyone assigned from your team for a similar role with our critical operating systems
because of nomination deadlines and the exchange of information with external parties for unify
it can create real exposure
dollar exposure and pr exposure
if unify's performance is impaired
let me know if you can assign someone from the infrastructure team that can wear the responsiblity of staying in step with unify
thanks
sally
fyi
sally
thanks for keeping me posted
sally
rick
thanks for the information on the task at hand regarding operational risk
we will certainly name an appropriate person from operations to be involved in this project
and will work with you to help in achieving your objectives
there doesn't appear to be anyone from ets on your distribution list
operational risk is broad and would seem to be present in all of enron's businesses
is the initial focus simply on the
wholesale businesses
or is there an intent to make this enterprise-wide
i suspect that it would be helpful for all of us on the distribution list to have a context for the way in which you see this rac initiative complementing
replacing
overlapping
or perhaps duplicating the work of eas
aa's internal audit engagement
the critical self assessment process being piloted in london this year by the operations team in conjuction with the aa audits
doorstep reviews
current operational risk reporting done by the various operations teams
and our major initiatives for ees tracked every other thursday with you and rick causey
before we each choose our appropriate representatives from our respective areas
it might be constructive to cover this in a kick-off meeting with the addressees on your memo
i might also suggest that we work to clearly define roles and responsibilities at the beginning of this project
the creation of a framework for quantifying enterprise-wide operational risk is perhaps different from the implementation of daily processes or systems that are used at the business unit levels
as on other policies devised by rac
it would seem that implementation of anything new to meet reporting requirements against the to-be-developed operational risk policy should rest with the appropriate business unit/functional area outside rac
the cross-functional team that will be formed is probably best used to give input to rac in creating the policy
but may not necessarily be the right body for implementation of specific initiatfinally
the second bullet point in wanda's list below is already being addressed through the project that you and i agreed upon in august to insure that information from all source systems to risktrac is complete
accurate and efficiently handled
as you and i discussed
this is a global effort spanning all commodities/all locations/all source systems
we have formed a steering committee with appropriate project managers and have worked closely with debbie brackett in defining the scope
approach
key milestones
resource requirements and projected timeline
project greenlight
a team of stakeholders from operations
it and debbie brackett will meet tomorrow in order to review the project plan with david port and bill bradford for final input
my assistant is working with yours to set up a meeting then for debbie and me to review the work done to date and to review the proposed plan and timeline
assuming that you are comfortable with project greenlight when we review the details with you
i think that it would be appropriate to take this item off of the wanda's list
we can certainly update the cross-functional team on efforts underway
but there is no need for a new team to focus on this bullet point
sally
thanks
rosalee
i have forwarded the information to jenny rub with our it infrastructure group
sally
my hot buttons for operations would be recruiting
career development and resource planning
before i simply make assignments
let me canvas my direct reports to be certain that we are assigning those with passion around these areas
my staff meeting will be tomorrow at 0:0
i will get back with you on volunteers and also to either reaffirm or alter the hot buttons that i mentioned
sally

i am wearing my longhorn shirt in the office today so that my affiliation for tomorrow's game is clear
let's hope for reveral of last year's score
hope that 0nd year is going well
i will be in touch in the next few days on details for a dinner with dean may and the enron scholarship winners later in october
sally
can you get me a color copy of this document
thanks
can i get a color copy printed
thanks
sally
please check to see which reports will be reviewed in this meeting
i have forwarded a few to you today to have printed in color
if there are some reports to be reviewed that we don't have
can you get copies of those for me
i want to take a look at them before the oct
0th meeting
thanks
sally
i have had my head buried in budgets and am just now coming up for air

the 0 enron net works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services
enron online
it infrastructure
risk management operations and it maintenance and development
we are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years
and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive
we are meeting with individual business unit offices of the chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through enron net works
some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and october 0
please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget
enron networks today is very different from this time last year
additions to the 0 enw budget are operations for ea
eim and egm
operations
it maintenance and development
and it infrastructure for ees and ebs have been included under the enw umbrella for the first time in the 0 budget as well
the 0 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year
any comparison of enw's 0 versus 0 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant
for further detail for each business unit
enw's 0 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business
products or commodities
in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business
the detail that is being provided to business units for it costs delineates licensing fees
system maintenance costs and new development costs
detail on each it development project identifies the purpose

planned
designation
expense and capital spend

greg piper sally beck mark pickering
i participated last weekend in the leadership forum for fall 0 of the center for houston's future
i wanted to thank you for recommending me as a member of the forum
i thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to meet so many interesting
talented members of the houston community
i know that i will enjoy working with the group during our second session
november 0-0
as well as collaborating on some
homework
assignments that we will complete between now and then
i especially am excited about the possibilities of making an impact on houston's future through developing both relationships and action steps through my association with the center
thanks again for making this opportunity available to me
sally beck
thanks

for getting my name in front of ken

a backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you
please read this communication in detail
purpose
net works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building
a wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year
location
large areas of the 0th and 0st floors of the current building
enron center north
will be set aside for recovery purposes
your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized
locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 0th and 0st floors
timing
through november
backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building
the backup seats will be available at least to january 0st
testing
test times to try the backup pc and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the it team as the locations are finished
telephones
only regular phones will be available
for those with speed dial phones
the it team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment
because the numbers change frequently
we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort
other supplies
the it team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs
if you rely on hard copy forms
address books
etc
you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer
or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat
limited access
the backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment
to keep the equipment functioning and secure
we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage
escalation procedures
the plan will be as follows
i
during regular business hours a
announcement
you will be notified via the pa system if you need to move to the backup location
or
b
no announcement
if an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs
for example
all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification
ii
after hours for after hours issues
greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work
e-mails and voice mails will also be distributed
since you unfortunately made an unnecessary trip into the office yesterday during your vacation
i assume that you are perhaps out of the office today finishing that vacation
i am certainly looking for your list of additional items/projects that you believe need to be added to or made more explicit in the draft document for project greenlight
i have rescheduled a meeting with rick buy for next friday
october 0 at 0:0
i hope that you will be able to attend
i want to be certain that we have enough time to review your comments and concerns
reconvene the appropriate group of steering committee members and/or project managers
and make any necessary changes or additions to the document before that meeting
i will be out of the office on monday
taking meagan to smu for mustang monday
it's her one day off this fall for a teacher in-service day and nicely enough coincides with a scheduled day at smu for high school seniors to visit
i will be checking my e-mails when i get home that night
however
sally
in a word
no
enw budgets have already been submitted to corp as well
there are allocations from enw to corp for it infrastructure
primarily headcount driven
and it maintenance and development
and i will be reviewing these with rick causey
the largest portion of our enw costs are allocated to ea
egm
eim
and ees
it is these business units primarily with whom we are meeting to share the level of detail discussed in my memo
these business units already have in hand an allocation billing for 0 from enw
our meetings at a greater level of detail may result in some changes to the enw budget
as business units understand more detail around the cost structures for supporting certain lines of business and certain it development costs
when i explained our budgeting process to rick causey
he had suggested that i share that with everyone on the management committee
some members are more directly impacted the the enw budget than others
sally
kevin
thanks for getting back to me with names so promptly
everyone on the list will be an asset on this effort
sally
best day is october 0
could make october 0 work
october 0 and november 0 will not work for me
sally beck
thanks to those of you who attended the enw all-employee meeting today
it was great to see brent
bob and kevin upfront and center
all of you must have done a great job in reminding
encouraging
arm-twisting or forcing your teams to attend
because the ballroom was full
a morning meeting means that our logistics schedulers can't attend
so we have reserved ebn 0c0 for friday
october 0 from 0:0 to 0:0 so that we can show the videos and walk through the slides with the schedulers
if a few others who missed today's meeting want to join
there should be room
thanks for the feedback so far on staff members to participate with melissa becker on one of the follow-ups from causey's offsite
attracting and retaining good people
if you still have someone from your staff that would like to participate
please send me their names by tueday next week
golf on monday
november 0
let me know early next week if you would like for a foursome from your team
could certainly include you
to play in the afternoon tournament at raveneaux country club
if you have some team members who have worked hard on a project or put in some unusually long hours for you
this could be a nice reward
did i mention that david is in charge of this tournament
i will be out of the office on monday
october 0
meagan and i will be in dallas for mustang monday at smu
i hope that the streets will be orange when i get there
i will have my cell phone with me
if anything critical comes up
i will be back in the office on tuesday
have a great weekend
sally
thanks for owning the question and sending me your ideas
i agree that some sort of planned rotation for experienced hires could be beneficial to the company and to the employees
i have another week or so of living the 0 budgets
and then i will be able to do other things
i am saving your note
and will get in touch with you after that to talk about your ideas in more detail
i am copying my assistant on this note so that she can schedule a time for us to get together
sally

please call me with any questions regarding the dinner
sally white beck chief operating officer enron net works llc
dinner is still on for tuesday
october 0 with dean may and the three scholarship recipients
one student
holland brown
will join us a little late
as she has class until 0:0 pm
i sent a note to dean may reconfirming the dinner and the time
0:0 cocktails and 0:0 dinner
seven other faculty/staff members are included on the invitation list
although i am awaiting a response from dean may on any changes or additions to that list of ut attendees
i have booked the josephine house again
yes
third year in a row
but it has worked well and hopefully those of us who are yearly attendees don't mind the repeat
you
brent and i took the the scholarship winners to sullivan's late in the spring
planned invitees from enron are you
me
and brent
plus the two others who interviewed candidates for the scholarships
loftis fitzwater
one of the first year winners
and andrea reed
roger ondrecko was the fourth interviewer
but is obviously not included
others that we could include are billy lemmons
as aa program head
ben glissan
as the mba executive lead for ut
and christy patrick from university affairs
frankly
though
i haven't been able to get university affairs remotely interested in this event
even though karen marshall on their staff last year planned the dinner
per your note
we could certainly include anyone else who may be helping us with interviews at ut
lexi says she will be busy that night making phone calls for 0nd round interviews
and she plans to have our analysts go to dinner with our summer interns who are back on campus
checking the list of
more senior
interviewers who could be included for dinner
it looks like beth apollo
randy petersen
hunter shively
and greg piper
lexi has checked with wes about interviewing
he can't do it
she is waiting for calls back from mike deville and mark lindsey
who would you like to include from enron at the dinner from the names in bold above
sally
i am glad that you will be able to join us
yes
we are planning on cocktails first and then dinner
i am waiting for a response back from dean may to confirm the time
tentatively set for 0:0 cocktails and 0:0 dinner
we can probably either officially slip this schedule back by a half hour to 0:0 and 0:0
or unofficially stretch this to work with your schedule
we would be happy to have your husband join us as well
let me know whether to expect one or both of you
sally
mckinsey
i read their letter
pretty good recap of where we are today
todd busby and i would like to meet with you regarding his assessment of market potential and internal trade-offs relative to that
would make most sense for the three of us to do that before having any further conversations with mckinsey
what i know is that mckinsey can be very expensive to work with
we would have to feel revenue opportunities would be very strong in order to commit to spend dollars with mckinsey
staff meeting attendees
will alan sommers now attend the thursday net works staff meeting
does he know about it for this week
have we made any decisions on the purpose and make-up of that meeting
we are including mark's directs on it
but not their counter parts in operations
including operations would make that meeting too big
so i am not necessarily suggesting that
just trying to rationalize the meetings that we want to have
fyi
in causey's staff meeting today
alan mentioned that the move of the isc under net works was announced within net works
and spread
before causey or alan announced this to the people in the isc
creates a bit of a bumpy start
causey is still very much in favor of this move
he did share with me last week 0 things that he will be looking for to insure that this move is smooth and yields the results desired
i can share those with you
causey has explicitly covered the 0 items with mark in agreeing to the transition
budgets
after meeting with whalley last week
should we consider coming to the table as net works with a reduction in budgeted dollars
expense and capital
of 0% or so
that has not been our goal to date
but maybe it should be
given the stretch that greg is trying to make
might also bode well with all of the business units to which we are allocating if we could say that we took a hard look and made those reductions ourselves
i have some ideas on how we might get there
let me know
we would need to get that done this week
sally
i realize that the timing of the enron net works all employee meeting last friday made it difficult for the gas logistics team to attend
for future all-employee events within enw
we will try to schedule times that work best for all employees
i didn't want you to be left out in this case
so i have worked with bob superty to set up another meeting for the logistics team so that we can share with you the information that was covered last friday
i hope that you will be able to join me for this second meeting
we have two videos that were made for the all-employee meeting that i think you will enjoy seeing
we will also review the slides that were used in the discussions and have time for questions and answers
friday
october 0 0:0 to 0:0 pm sally w
beck chief operating officer enron net works
llc
that would be great if you have time
if you run out of time
we can wing it in lavendar
thanks
sally
i have an enw budget review meeting with egm
mcconnell and shankman
set for 0:0 to 0:0 on october 0th
my intent had been to join rick's meeting at the halfway point at 0:0 under the original schedule
with the time change of rick's meeting to a 0:0 start
i will now miss his meeting
please let him know that i will be in the budget review meeting with egm during that time period
thanks
sally
can the travel agency send these things to you
sally
can you keep a running list of attendees and rsvp's
thanks
absolutely
we would enjoy having angela dorsey join us for dinner
i am glad that you made the suggestion
please extend the invitation to her now so that she can reserve the date on her calendar
and if you will send me her e-mail address we will send her an invitation as well
thanks for the congratulations
yes
the title is an new one
announced just a few weeks ago
i look forward to seeing you next tuesday evening
sally
attached is an invitation to attend a dinner hosted by enron to honor this year's recipients of the enron mba excellence fund scholarships
this is enron's third year to award scholarships to three outstanding students in their second year of the mba program
one of the highlights to those of us involved from enron is the dinner that we host to recognize the students
dean may will be in attendance
as well as other faculty members from the business school
including ehud ronn
director of ut's center for energy finance and research
since each of you will be in austin to interview on campus on tuesday
or will be arriving tuesday to interview on wednesday
i hope that you will be able to join us at the josephine house on tuesday
october 0 for cocktails at 0:0pm and dinner at 0:0pm
please rsvp to me by friday
i will send you a complete list of attendees on monday
call me if you have any questions
sally
through friday
october 0 at 0:0 pm i will be in ecn 0
i will move to ecs over the weekend
so if you do not get my packet to me before 0:0 on friday
please call my assistant
christina valdez x0
to get my new location for monday
what is it that oxley is looking for in the enw prc report that you mentioned
is this the staff meeting for next thursday
october 0th
i will be here that day
sally
per my voice mail
wanda is still the lead on this initiative
from our conversation in your office
i had assumed that this would change
apparently has not to date
rick buy and i are scheduled to get together tomorrow for an hour
my intent had been to review operational risk reports and information with him and to suggest an approach for meeting his objectives
he has added wanda
debbie brackett
bill bradford and david port to the tomorrow's meeting since our first point of discussion will be a joint project that rick and i are sponsoring
unless he pairs down the group in tomorrow's meeting after our first topic
i doubt that we will be able to discuss follow up on our conversation in your office regarding operational risk
sally
the last message in this trail is mcmahon's note to the management committee members regarding allocations and an attached spreadsheet with his proposed acceptance of allocations
just fyi
i met with kent castleman yesterday to get a feel for the areas where mcmahon has questions regarding our net works budget
i will pass those along to brad
jenny
and beth today
and will copy you two on that note
bowen has already reviewed kevin sweeney's budget for operations
kevin reduced his direct costs by $0mm relative to the original budget submitted
and kent says that jeff and ray are fine with that one now
i don't anticipate much conversation around that on monday
sally
our meeting with eim is set for monday
october 0th from 0:0 to 0:0
ray bowen has already reviewed the operations budget with kevin sweeney
ray just initiated that meeting himself with kevin one day last week
spur of the moment
but that is the only meeting regarding enw budgets that has taken place
i have been working with kent castleman
eim's cao
since last week to arrange our meeting now set for monday
i think that by
agreed plan
mcmahon just means that is the amount that at this point eim is saying they are willing to take
sally
what's the story on this one
who can best answer the four questions posed by wanda
how soon can we have answers
interestingly
i have a 0:0 pm meeting today with rick buy
david port
wanda curry
bill bradford and debbie brackett
rescheduled from last friday re
project greenlight
due to buy's schedule
i would like to be more informed than they are at 0:0
thanks
sally
thanks for forwarding the note to me
i have asked shona and brent to get back with me on answers to your questions
shona's team did move this weekend to ecs
as did i
and i am not sure how much additional chaos this has added to her life for today
i will follow up with her mid
afternoon on details
i agree with you that this serves as a good case study
underscores indeed that we need to start some of the projects under project greenlight instead of continuing to document problems
by definition
to arrive at complete and accurate transfer daily of information from all source systems to risktrac
we must know the universe of all books and spreadsheets
sally
probably should have sent this to you as well as brent
sally

let me know
another option is that anthony and i could cover those costs
with the option to contact jenny if more detail is required
sally
thanks for taking the lead on this
let me know if i can help
sally
tuesday
0:0 to 0:0
is the all-employee meeting at the hyatt
given negative publicity over the last several days and the dramatic market reaction
stock price today down to $0
the meeting tomorrow should be well attended and i would expect that the questions will be quite candid
md's had a meeting this morning with lay
whalley and frevert
and we made suggestions on what should be covered in the all-employee meeting
i have dropped out of my recruiting trip to oklahoma tomorrow so that i can be present at the hyatt meeting
since mark and greg are both travelling
i think that it is important to both ken lay and employees for us to have a visible prescence at the meeting
as a follow up
i am pulling together a group of senior leaders within enw at noon for an informal lunch
in the conference room without door handles
we will discuss what we heard at the all-employee meeting and how to anticipate employee questions and deal with the possibililty of low morale
i will stress the importance of visible
consistant leadership at this time
and will ask all to do their part on this
i discussed this with greg piper this morning
and he suppports this effort
who do you want to have attend the lunch folllow-up meeting
i need to send a note asap today to get this on everyone's calendar
beth perlman suggested that we included senior directors and above
are you two okay with this
sally
this is mid-day info from eol trades today
compared to a full day recap for the same time last month
we can recap for you at end of day
if you would like
we chose counterparties that execute energy derivative transactions via eol who have debt ratings that are higher than those of enron
we can give you a complete recap at end of day
bill bradford in credit would be the likely party to be fielding questions from counterparties on credit questions
if you have not talked with him
i would suggest that you do so
sally w
beck chief operating officer enron net works llc
i will be at the hyatt tomorrow for the all-employee meeting and i hope that each one of you will plan to attend as well
certainly with current press coverage and market reaction last week and today
there will be many questions for ken
greg and mark to address tomorrow
it will be important for all of us as members of the senior leadership team of enw to be familiar with tomorrow's discussion at the all-employee meeting
to provide a follow-up opportunity to discuss what we hear in tomorrow's all-employee meeting
i invite you to attend an informal lunch meeting with me in ecs 0 beginning at 0:0 noon
this will give us the chance to clarify what we have heard and to collectively anticipate the reactions and additional questions that employees may have
it will be important particularly now to be visible and accessible to our teams
sally please let christina valdez know today
x0 or e-mail
if you will be at lunch on tuesday so that we can place an order
it's about 0:0 pm right now

eim's budget meeting with lay/whalley/frevert has been moved from wednesday
october 0 to monday
november 0
kerry roper sent you an e-mail message today with revised dates for budget reviews
mcmahon is out of town today
and ray bowen's preference is to push the review of our revised enw budget for eim back to wednesday
tomorrow
i am coordinating with kent castleman on this meeting with ray and will give you an update tomorrow after the meeting with ray
kent believes that our current allocations are now acceptable to eim
they will okay the current eol allocation
but are also very interested in the revised allocation methodology
brent has had to unexpectedly drive to austin this afternoon to lecture to a class at ut
a rick causey commitment that rick asked brent to fill today
when brent is back tomorrow we will regroup on the egm budget with the intent of sign-off from mike and jeff by end of day tomorrow or thursday
whalley budget update
i reviewed this with kerry today
i suggested that on the whalley recap sheet that we footnote that numbers were as of 0/0/0
and represented final agreement on ea charges
and revised charges
subject to final sign-off
for eim
the footnote should also say final reviews with ees and egm are expected this week
so enw charges to those business units are still preliminary
i also suggested to kerry that we footnote for whalley the break-out and total
expense and capital
of budget reductions since our review with whalley 0 days ago
sally
i am so glad that you joined us for dinner
as well
i noticed that the dean jokingly said that the scholarship checks were
in the mail
the university does send those checks to the students
so please let me know if you have not received that
it was a pleasure again to visit with you over dinner
please keep me posted on your plans after graduation
sally beck chief operating officer enron net works llc
didn't notice this e-mail yesterday
sally
i got frustrated in trying to put together yesterday's lunch
our list of senior directors and above in net works seemed incomplete
i thought that murray was a senior director
and realized that his name was not on the list
i asked christina to verify his title and to find out if he was in houston this week so that he could be included
i didn't understand why he wasn't on the list
does he report to you
hope that i didn't start a series of events that is wrong
i thought that he did report to you and that that had been the case for several months
so i didn't understand why hr's records were not correct
sally
i am forwarding this message to you sent to me by bob superty
bob is the director of gas logistics for enron americas
and attended the lunch meeting that i held yesterday
i asked all in attendance to let me know if they had ideas on things that could be done to improve employee morale
i can always count on bob to give thoughtful consideration to this type of request
here are his ideas
some of these i can orchestrate for my operations team and the broader enron net works employee base
some of these suggestions could impact a broader base of employees
i would be happy to lead any or all of these efforts on an enron-wide basis is you think that would be appropriate
i could certainly use some help
however
you may already have a venue for this
but maybe it would be a good idea to put together a small team of interested individuals
like bob superty
who could make suggestions in the short run on ideas that could improve employee morale
not a formalized committee
and not even one that would have to be announced or publicized
just an ad hoc group to make a difference now
maybe this doesn't have to be corporate wide
maybe each business unit could put together an ad hoc group
if they feel that it is appropriate for their business unit
and maybe these various ad hoc groups could just share ideas
this might be even more effective with buy-in and initiative from the business units
rather than the feel of a corporate overlay
as i am typing
i am thinking that maybe we will pilot this in enron net works and simply share what we are doing with others
your thoughts
sally
in the lunch meeting that i held yesterday
i asked all in attendance to let me know if they had ideas on ways to improve employee morale at present
i can always count on bob superty to give thoughtful consideration to this type of request
and to act
here are his ideas
my thought is to get together an informal team
doesn't even have to be announced or publicized
to continue to generate ideas that could make a difference to employee morale right now and to make some of these things happen
any thoughts
sally
data only
enron board met this morning
afternoon management committee meeting had been planned for today beginning at 0:0
that afternoon session postponed
short meeting with management committee was held an hour ago
call me later if you want details
sally
major budget focus for today beginning in a few minutes is to have our act together for the delainey/dietrich ees review tomorrow
anthony dayao
beth apollo and kerry roper will join me for a walk through
finalizing eim budget will likely not get done today
can give you the details on why later today
will become obvious
just meet with shankman and mcconnell
not ready to finalize egm budget yet
they say that their commercial guys are waiting for jeff johnson to get with them on details of it development projects
i think that jeff has been out for a few days
but i did see him on the 0rd floor when i was down there with shankman and mcconnell
i will leave him a voice mail message to get an update on outstanding issues from his point of view
jeff and mike want to have their stuff finalized by friday
i will convey that timeline to jeff johnson
after ees budget prep meeting this afternoon
next tall order of business is expanding our receivables monetization beyond ea to other commodities
high priorty and very short time fuse on this one
for reasons that should be obvious
i will have all of the operations leads and settlements leads together this afternoon
along with ramesh rao and others in it who may be required to help us extract necessary info
nice way of telling you
greg
that i understand your desire for a page of footnotes with budget explanations for whalley
and that in my opinion that falls at the end of the list behind some of these other things today
i will work with kerry on this
i can tell you
however
that updates on budgets are not top on anyone's lists today
including whalley's
we will honor your commitment to get him updated information
and will provide as much detail as possible
best approach given the state of business today may be to provide him with the high level overview
that one page of expense and capital
state where we are in the review process with each business unit
and highlight reductions in expense and capital to date
we can continue to provide updates to whalley as the ees
eim
egm and ebs
yes
i need to coordinate with mark p
when he is back on some changes here
confidential at this point
don't know how useful detailed footnotes will be for whalley before we truly finalize the various business unit budgets
sally
please print message and attachment for me
thanks
sally
then message can be deleted
please print attachement on cashflows for me
then delete my e-mail
thanks
let's talk tomorrow about how we get everyone on the ball and thinking
thanks for letting me know about this
i have copied bob hall
since he manages daily operations for ea i know that he would want to be aware of critical issues
particularly at this time
i will also use this as an illustration with the rest of my team during a staff meeting tomorrow morning so that my direct reports who manage operations across all commodities will be aware of the potential risks created with manual wires
sally
i won't sent this to you daily
but this is what we are providing to treasury each day
fyi
sally
in an october 0 update meeting with rick buy and rick causey on doorstep reviews
both were very supportive of the efforts to date this year
since we were in the midst of the budgeting process
we wanted their view on the continuation of doorstep reviews
and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues
in reviewing the plans for 0th quarter
one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the september 0th terrorists attacks
we were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 0th quarter reviews until early 0
planned reviews for the metals business and certain other eel lines of business were reaffirmed by buy and causey for completion in the 0th quarter
certainly life on october 0 feels different today at enron than it did on october 0
i understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process
and in your case
the voluntary redundancy program
in the next few days i will again review the 0th quarter plans for doorstep reviews with buy and causey
sharing with them your concerns
i will let you know the outcome of those conversations
if there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year
we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the eas process and minimize both travel and time involved
sally
please see exchange below
can you send me current plans
who
when
where and what
for london reviews
i would put a several day moratorium on contacting london regarding upcoming doorstep review plans until i get back with you
thanks
sally i know that in our meeting with rick and rick we talked about being creative on london reviews and leveraging what is being done by eas
maybe directing them on additional activities and doing some leg work by video conference
what happened to that effort
sounds as if from the london e-mails that we stepped right back to flying people around the world
i know you are both busy
lots of push back from london on doorstep reviews
i recognize that our world is pretty crazy right now
however
it is london's normal stance to push back on the reviews and work to the change the timing
i think that they view being a subject of a doorstep review as an elective procedure on their part
next week i will follow up with you to get your thoughts on doorstep efforts during the 0th quarter
wanted you to see my reply to fernley below
sally
attached is a contact list for operations

sally beck chief operating officer enron net works llc
thanks for finding this
i have printed it on a color copier
so i will have it with me as an example
am actually pretty close to being finished
had a fun visit with cara and anna
what a cutie anna is
and what a good baby
still haven't heard a cry
or at least not one like my kids could produce
they left after breakfast this morning
while most of us were at church
meagan stayed home to work on essays for college applications
so sorry to hear about the car wreck
glad that you two are okay
but what an inconvenience
hope that the other guys insurance covers everything
sally
yes
at 0:0 pm
will try to leave by 0:0 or so
sally
cleaning out e-mails
does this still need approval
sally
let's save this in case i have to send out something to all management committee members
thanks
sally
in case you missed this
just wanted you to see that this enron net works publication that to date has focused only on the it organization has now been broadened in scope
the hot link to the site should work
and if you click on features and then energy operations you will see the article referred to below
the editor has spoken to a couple of you also
her plan is to get with each one of you and to run a series of articles about operations
sally
yes
it has only taken me 0 days to respond
but yes i would like to get this report
thanks
sally
approval still required
please let me know
thanks
sally
i do want to see all of these right now
i am just a little tardy in working my way through e-mails
i understand that you will be joining beth apollo's risk team in ees soon
a win-win situation for everyone involved
i believe
please let me know when you will next be in town
would love to see you
sally
approval still needed
need to use this in contact list that i believe tina put together for enw
do we have this new one
only a week and a half to reply to you
i apologize
the artickale was great
in fact
today i have resent the notice with the hot link to my direct reports
since we all get so many e-mails
i wanted to be certain that this wasn't overlooked
i pointed out to them that enn had broadened its cover to include operations as well as technology
and that they should look for upcoming articles
sounds as if your son had a strong start at kleb as well
this second six weeks is proving to be a little more challenging for amanda
or her effort may have gotten diverted
i am copying my assistant on this note so that we can get lunch on the calendar
sally
approval still needed
i do want to review anything at this point
sally
i forwarded to you most of the ibuyit stuff still in my e-mail
please check all to see if they have been approved
from this point forward
i don't want to automatically approve anything without my seeing it
please scan the rest of my e-mails to see if there is an ibuyit request that i failed to forward to you for you to check
please be sure that anything that has already been approved is deleted
thanks
please go through my e-mails and print everything from melissa becker
put it in a folder
all should relate to follow up on the accounting offsite in galveston
for me
i need to review that stuff and figure out when the next follow up meeting is going to be with either rick and/or melissa
they have asked me to chair one of the follow up issues
some of the e-mails from melissa relate to volunteers for my team
i think there is also one saved voice mail with a volunteer's name
can you create a list
with contact numbers
of all volunteers from e-mails and voice mails to date
thanks
then please delete all e-mails from melissa
also
please go through my e-mails and print everything that relates to center for houston's future
i need to review these
most is from marilyn schoppe
but a few are from others
but reference chf
then delete all of these e-mails
e-mails from lexi elliott regarding recruiting
please print all so that i can review them
please delete all e-mails after printing
thanks
this effort plus my clean up today should help shrink the e-mails that remain
thanks
sally
please do the same thing with e-mails from mike jordan
thanks
operator error
i misspelled your name
probably too late to include
sorry
i didn't see the failed delivery attempt until today
been kind of hectic at enron
sally
can you please provide the following information on invitees to the series of breakfast meetings
example noted below from today's meeting
name title group direct supervisor jeff gossett director operations
gas risk
ea
bob hall la metrice dopson sr
director it infrastructure jenny rub mark
greg and i need to have this information the day before the scheduled breakfast meeting
the group description may be the most difficult to get
but you can look at this as a good way for you to get to know the leadership team within enw and what they do
i will be glad to help you with the details
just let me know
noting each employee's direct supervisor will just make it that much easier for us to understand where everyone fits into the organization
i would also like to have this information for the breakfast meeting that was held this morning
thanks
sally can i also take a look at the total list of employees that will be invited to the breakfast meetings
the list that i used last week for senior directors and above for the tuesday lunch meeting was not completely up-to-date
i just want to be sure that we are not leaving anyone out
thanks
since you are the lead
i assume that you have an idea from dave on what he is looking for
since dave referenced enw
i assume that we will include roles with regard to it development projects
do you think that he also wants to pick up definition of infrastructure roles as well
sally
will do the best we can
as enw
we utilize the analyst pool much more heavily than the associates pool
several of us from enw nterviewed analyst candidates for fastastic friday on october 0
including me
i believe that we have a number of enw managers committed to the november 0 fantastic friday interviews for analysts
most associates rotations are commercial rotations
so it would seem to make sense to have commercial teams heavily involved in the november 0 and december 0 super saturdays
what would be the time commitment on saturday
sally
trading activity on enrononline continues be at or above trade count levels for the same period last month
jim donnell
president and ceo of duke energy north america
stated at an industry conference on friday
october 0 that for duke it is
business as ususal
with enron
enron remains an active counterparty trading with duke
at the same independent petroleum association of amercia industry event
joe bob perkins
group president for reliant energy's wholesale businesses
stated that reliant continues to actively trade with enron as well
i left individual voice mail messages for chris
johnny
john
tom
keith
susan and susie tonight
thanking them for spending part of their saturday in the office
i appreciate your personal organization and leadership of the team so that the dpr could be completed saturday morning and delivered to rac for their further analysis over the weekend
thanks
too
for spending part of your weekend in the office
your willingness to pitch in and your constructive suggestions on leading and motivating employees is very much appreciated
sounds good
i can be flexible
i will let christina know to expect a call from your assistant on this
sally
causey concurs with postponing doorstep reviews
haven't heard back from buy
but i will find him in person this afternoon and will get back with you as soon as i do
i agree
no need to prepare anything at this point while we are waiting for buy's response
sally
fyi
thought that my e-mail message to you last week asked for a moratorium on contacting london re
doorstep reviews until i circled back with you after conversations with buy and causey
sounds as if that moratorium either wasn't communicated or wasn't observed
causey left me a voice mail message on sunday night saying he is okay with postponing all eel reviews at present
still waiting on buy
i will find him today
just heard from buy
he is in agreement with postponing doorstep reviews for now
he has asked me to create a tickler for this in january
sally
some interesting thoughts
many do hit home
thought that i would pass this along so that we can discuss it when we get together for lunch tomorrow
sally
yes
this was to be the review with corp
lay
whalley and frevert
i am working with mark lindsey on the revised schedule
still don't have one

the november newsletter looked great
this message was sent by beverly gibson for the december newsletter
at monday's board meeting
lori ewalt gave me an article about senior presentation for the december newsletter
she doesn't have an electronic copy
i will try this weekend to retype it as a word document and e-mail it to you
lori also said that she had given janet petrak a hard copy of a permission slip to be printed in the december newsletter
this is for parents to sign for under 0's to be out after midnight as they return from senior presentation
do you have that
if not
you might contact janet and ask her for that
sally

exciting news on the house

when we moved to champion forest
we did the same thing
called the real estate agent to list our house on a monday
got a contract on our house on tuesday
and put a contract on our new house on wednesday that week
you and your husband must be into quick decision making as well
yes
life at enron is interesting these days
kind of like a soap opera
difficult for everyone to stay focused
we are ready for some good news here
with your move
let me know how i can help more with this december newsletter
it is on my list for the weekend to recreate lori ewalt's article as a word attachment and get that to you
i am glad that you have the permission slip in hand

sally
we are prepared to get with you as soon as you would like after your return from new york to review projected cost savings from enw
for each business unit that we support
ea
egm
eim
ees
ebs
we have prepared cost savings on expense and capital based on the three scenarios below
scenario 0
enron exits the line of business
with immediate headcount reductions and cost savings quantified
skeleton staff remains for orderly exit of business
then final headcount reductions and cost savings quantified
lights out
scenario 0
enron retains and maintains line of business
but does not invest for growth
assumes no further systems enhancements
support is scaled back from current level and is minimal
lights on
but dim
scenario 0
enron retains line of business and invests modestly to accommodate known market changes
service levels are scaled back from current level and are a step above minimal
lights on
brighter
cost savings in all three scenarios have been quantified at the following level of detail by commodity for egm and eim
egm
freight markets eim
forest products fx/ir/equity steel domestic crude
products international crude
products domestic coal international coal cost savings have been identified for enw's unallocated expense and capital as well
we have worked with hr to adjust cost savings for anticipated severance costs
sally cell 0-0-0 home 0-0-0
up to you and anthony
we have already done a meeting in 0ac
today at 0:0
we had not been provided info that anthony had anyone in 0ac
we had a meeting this morning during which we reviewed floor meeting plans
i don't think that anthony was able to attend
your options are to bring them over to ecn 0 at 0:0
or to have them attend a meeting at 0:0 in 0 allen center
0 th floor in the forum
a meeting room on that floor
i will be conducting that floor meeting at 0:0 for enw employees in 0 allen center
it is allan sommers
isc group
sally
can you update me today on status
issues and resolution
we need to get back with bill bradford today
sally
this problem is a result of the lack an automated interface between gcp and rps and rgs
my understanding is that todd taylor on your team is working on this interface
what is the expected completion of this interface
and if is later than today
what can be done to deliver this asap
with the large number of mass market deals being done
it is imperative to have an automated solution to this problem
can you call me today with an update
thanks
sally
james responded and filled me in on the issue
sounds like we need the automated link to solve future problems
how are we going to clean up the existing backlog
did you know that this had grown so large
james says that this sits in shelly stubbs
lap to solve and that he has offered up resources to help
sounds as if the offer has not been taken by shelly
bill is obviously out of his crisis mode on counterparty credit issues and has lifted his head to look at other things
i hate getting these e-mails from him
he always has more info than i do on issues and for some reason his confidence level in operations is not incredibly strong because he always contacts me
i would love for someone else on the operations team to gain his confidence and i am sure that you would like for him to come to you with issues instead of always contacting me first
don't worry
you are not alone in this
applies to ea
egm and eim as well
let's talk about how we can manage this better
these counterparties are set up in gcp
however
they have not been set up in rps and rgs
two things are needed
first
we need an automated link from gcp to rps and rgs
someone on anthony dayao's team is assigned to this
but the project has not been completed
i have asked anthony to update me today on how we can get this completed asap
this will solve the problem on a go-forward basis
the second need is a clean up effort on this backlog
i have asked beth apollo for an update on her plan
and i will have her review this with you later today
sally
since your name was not on the original list
i am forwarding this to you
molly's comment that
many lack the clear understanding
in the third paragraph below
to whom does this apply and do you agree with her
sally
tom
thanks for the list of questions
i am always glad when someone takes me up on that type of offer
because i genuinely want the input from others
i have taken a quick glance at the list of questions and will take the time to read them thoroughly over a sandwich today
after reading them
i will get back to you on an effective way to answer them
as i may not be able to personnally address all
sally
as discussed yesterday
we will have a 0:0 pm meeting daily to update you on details regarding the merger
we will begin this meeting today
novmeber 0
and will continue this as long as you find it useful
the meeting will be held each day in ecs 0
same conference room that we were in on monday morning
mark taylor will join us from legal this afternoon
he will discuss terms of the merger agreement and will answer questions that you may have
we will also discuss our enw plans for a prc
lite
there is no need to rsvp to this meeting each day
the meeting will be held daily for all of those who can attend
sally
in case you have your blackberry with you while in line with the masses
just learned from brent price
via mike mcconnell
that there is a daily meeting led by jim fallon with ceo's at 0:0 that reviews cash usage within the businesses and where a list
although not final
is being reviewed relative to lines of business and locations
i.e
tokyo
singapore
etc
that may be exited
it is key for enw to anticipate these changes and seems that we could add something to the discussions from time to time
did you know about this meeting
seems like you should be there
can you nose in with jim
sally
carol
would you enlarge the attachment so i can print for sally
thanks
christina
who was this who replied
good question
all cash outflows have an impact
so it is probably best just to emphasize not spending unnecessary dollars
we have asked our direct reports to carefully consider travel
is it really necessary
and if so
can only 0 person make the trip instead of earlier times when we might have sent two or three persons
off-site meetings
can an enron conference room work just fine
happy hours
should get approved by mark
greg or me ahead of time
and we need to be comfortable with business purpose
outside services and hiring
i think that you could share this with the assistants
it is very important
especially now
to have updated contact information for employees
all assistants should make sure that cell and home phone numbers are up-to-date
please thank everyone for their focus and dedication during these tough times
i will let you know if i think of anything else regarding spending
sally just thought of this
we should have all approvers within the
ibuyit
and
ibuyit-payables
systems look closely at and approve all purchases and payments
assistants in the past may have accessed requests on line for their bosses and automatically approved things to keep them going in the system
we should be actively reviewing and approving or disapproving all expenditures
as discussed during yesterday's 0:0 pm meeting
the enw direct reports to the office of the chair
vp level only
will meet on thursday afternoon to discuss employee talent
the meeting will be in conference room # 0 on the 0th floor of ecs from 0:0 to 0:0 pm
please respond only if you are unable to attend
information to be discussed in this meeting should be submitted to marla barnard today
thanks for you time and attention to this
sally
yes
fully prepared
thanks
sally have a great time on vacation
relax and enjoy the family
say hello to jo for me
employees
performance will be evaluated at year end and feedback will be given to employees
but the prc process itself and all of the many meetings that normally take place will be pared down significantly
we want to give constructive feedback to employees while making sure that the majority of our time is focused on managing enron's business
hr should be sending information out soon to all employees on the details
the year-end bonus process is on track at this point
and it is the company's intent to pay bonuses
it is also the company's intent to follow the process that we go through annually to review compensation levels relative to individual performance and to market data
that process is slated for february
and at this point i am not aware of any anticipated changes to that
i am happy to answer your questions
feel free to send me others as the come up
sally
attached is list of questions
how soon could we have answers to these
i would appreciate any help that you could give me on this
sally
i will be in the office on tuesday next week
november 0
but hope to take the day off on wednesday
the kids will be out of school on wednesday and we are going to austin to be with my family for thanksgiving
so we hope to be on the road on wednesday morning to beat some of the traffic
with that
sounds as if it would be better for us to get together on monday
november 0
if you want to try and talk before then
a good time to get me is in car during my morning commute
number is 0-0-0
and some range between 0:0 am and 0:0 am might work
these are certainly trying times
you have been in my thoughts
and you have my commitment that it is certainly not out of sight
out of mind
sally
sorry those didn't get to you yesterday
it was 0:0 pm before i had time to get that together for you
only to discover that all that i had were hard copies
our enw cao had summarized the data for us into the single page format
and he had never e-mailed me the file
he was gone for the day
and i tried his cell phone
but didn't get an anwer
let me know how the meeting with beth and evan went today
lavorato and i have been working on something regarding gas logistics
and a follow up meeting was called on that this morning at 0:0
the outcome of the meeting required a visit with david oxley
so i could tell that making a meeting with you at 0:0 probably wasn't going to happen
how are your 0:0 pm meetings
i will catch up tomorrow
sally hope that you made it to the soccer play-off game tonight
it's 0:0 am on sunday
have tried your cell phone
but did not get an answer
left you a message that beth
jeff
and brent are all here and working on their respective pieces
we will convene as a group about 0:0 here in my office
if you can join us at 0:0
we can give you an update
sally
great work again from your team
thanks
sally
from our work weekend before last
our third scenario
staying in the business
but making improvements more slowly and reducing some service levels
our estimated savings for operations and it development were
annualized savings
in millions
headcount reductions
enron employees
direct costs bonus subtotal net cap total ops it accural savings severance savings ex savings this work was not done at the level of identifying individuals
but rather positions
identify indiour work today will be to further refine this estimate and to individuals
names
we have already identified our lower performers across operations and it as well
we had to get through our work this weekend in identifying higher performers supporting eim and egm who could potentially support ea and ees in an effort to provide an even stronger team for those two business units
the above estimates of cost savings did not include savings from jenny rub
which she can calculate for us based on detail of headcount reductions and any systems work that is discontinued
i.e
server savings
the estimate also did not include any potential reductions in the eol charges for ea that may result from cost reductions that greg piper is having with brad richter
your desire to cut costs for ea but not reduce work force seem to be incompatible
we will do our work and then see how we can reconcile this with you
sally
are we having some fun now
thought about you today
in fact
ran across a business card of yours that i had in a file from phibro energy
i know that i have missed your insight and opinions into enron's roller-coaster
is this ride better with eyes open or closed
sally
tough times
and lots of work
i know that you must be swamped
and that you had already been immersed in what was believed to be a tough budget process
i am sure it is even tougher now
got a call from melissa becker today regarding retention
on rick's behalf
she was asking about london operations
i assume that you have covered that
her specific question related to mike
i told her that you and i hadn't talked
and that my assumption was that you had this one covered
accurate
take care
sally
our current plan on ea operations would be to eliminate any planned headcount addtions and to reduce the current staff levels by 0%
i will get with you on tuesday morning to review the names
but i feel confident that few if any would be recognized by your commerical guys
as we only engage our best in interfacing with the traders
our current estimate on cost reductions for ea operations is less than the $0.0mm estimated 0 weeks ago
beth perlman and team are continuing to work tonight and will have details available tomorrow
we are in agreement
as bob hall has worked with beth's team to eliminate 0 main projects on the production support systems
mkm enhancements
unify production tuning
decaf strategic rewrite
and one other that escapes me at the moment
beth and her team are also working on the cost savings that will result from potentially halting or slowing down other commercially-driven it projects
the headcount impact and dollar savings from these project eliminations are what beth's team is focused on tonight
sally
fyi
yes
fyi
response after my call to brian
agreement refers to employees of enron americas or its subsidiaries
and those employees involved in natural gas specifically
enron networks is not named
but is definitely an oversight because so much of the support for gas comes from enron networks
close date on the sale was may 0
0
0 month non-solicit period starts from that point
sally
thanks
anne did call me this morning with the details
sally
i think that your phibro card is from our original meeting in new york
a lifetime or two ago
sounds as if your rollercoaster experience with teddy was perhaps a preview of the subsequent weeks at enron
thank goodness for those little guys to go home to every night
my little guys aren't so little any more
meagan is a senior this year
had all of her college applications submitted by november 0
and feels pretty good just knowing that her part is done
she has gotten one acceptance
university of oklahoma
she also applied to ut
smu and tcu and is waiting to hear from them
she may hear from smu and tcu before christmas
ut probably after the first of the year
by the way
david and i are strongly talking up the state school thing
given the current enron share price
or diminished portion thereof
this senior year is going by all too quickly
especially since the last month or so i seem to be hearing about it second-hand having spent way too many hours in the enron building
and mentioning the building
i moved to enron center south
the new building
in mid september
i'm on the 0th floor
one of the trading floors
kinneman is on this floor
too
kind of a cool building
but weird because it is not really finished
our floor is fine
but you have to walk through a maze of temporary walls on the second floor to get to the elevator
and some elevators are
panelled
with rough plywood inside
the sky ring thing is cool
too
but half of the circle is closed on a daily basis as they continue to finish out the space
we walk under open ceilings with wires hanging down
not exactly sure how we were able to swing an occupancy certificate
but we are here
do let me know if you are going to be in houston anytime soon
i would love to get together with you
between 0/0 and our current cash constraints
my previously planned november london visit is not happening
enjoy your thanksgiving in london
sally
have updated spreadsheet for known data tonight
these things need to be reviewed and possibly changed
had perlman's total numbers from today
which she did no subdivide into ea
eim and egm numbers
made assumption that numbers from sunday's spreadsheet for beth's egm and eim totals stood
and backed into ea numbers by simply taking her total minus sunday's egm and eim numbers
you will want to gut check this with beth
had jenny's current total headcount
0
and her reductions to contractors and fte's
didn't have detail on her contractor versus fte numbers after reductions
just assumed 0 contractors
remaining fte's
you will need to get that detail from jenny to correctly reflect her revised headcount
there was a bust in numbers that i had for commodity logic development
gros gave me the starting number of 0
contractors and fte's
but without current breakdown
his reductions were 0 contractors and 0 fte's
which should have left a revised total headcount of 0
but i wrote down a revised total headcount of 0 for this group
off by 0
so i increased the number of contractor cuts to 0 to make the math work
please go over details with tom and make corrections as needed
didn't have confirmed starting total headcount for isc
spreadsheet with his fte names gives a count of 0
so i assumed that he has 0 contractors to come up to the spreadsheet starting number of 0
allan only reduced by 0 fte's and if he plans to reduce contractors i did not have that info
so all other numbers for the isc are simply forced
please review with allan and make corrections as needed
have a nice thanksgiving with your families
you can reach my by cell phone tommorrow
mine
0-0-0 or david's
0-0-0
or at my parents
home starting about mid-afternoon
0-0-0
we will drive back from austin sometime on friday
could come in on saturday or sunday
as needed
sally
thanks for your nice note
did you get the job
i certainly hope so
i appreciate your thoughts and prayers
both are very much needed
we are all still somewhat in a state of shock over the state of the company
i find myself working lots of hours on things that several months ago we wouldn't have thought about
life is always interesting
it may take a while to see where this twist is leading us
but i do know that it will be interesting
sally
thanks for the note
i wish you well as you continue to build your business outside enron
unfortunate circumstances here have caused us to make some tough business decisions that impact contractors such as yourself
i appreciate your hard work over the last several years and the contributions that you made in helping to manage various businesses within enron
i am saving your e-mail address and phone number
there may be an occasion for us to work together again
best wishes for you and your family
sally
can you hold on this until after mid-week this week
we haven't gotten much communication from
above
on spending
but everyone is doing the obvious things to be prudent right now
i can tell you that even over this thanksgiving weekend
with banks open on friday
that there is still tremendous concern and focus on cash
i got calls at home on friday afternoon to provide data on ea
egm and eim payables
data deemed critical that day
i know that company-wide
we will want to be certain that the cancellation of the company-wide holiday party does not result in just as much money being spent by hundreds of groups across the company
if waiting until after mid-week makes the timing diffcult for planning purposes
i might suggest a less costly version
one idea is to tell your directs that you want to bring them together as a group to thank them for their hard work and offer your home for the occassion on the 0th
you could submit for expense reimbursement the cost of something like wine and beer
and ask everyone to bring a snack to contribute to the party
i think that everyone would understand not having the entire event underwritten by enron
especially following the events that will occur this week
over the years we have all gotten used to enron footing the bill for so many things
at the bank where i was before
we occassionally had get-togethers where we all brought something to the party
it is not really unusual outside enron
sally
let's get together tomorrow
my calendar is pretty open
understand your request
and you have my assurance that i will be very up-front with you
no breaking news to share with you
however
would love to get your input on the organization going forward
if you have time tomorrow
yes
kind of of bleak
sally
since this is my work e-mail address
i enjoyed a much overdue break from enron wednesday through sunday
so i did not read your e-mail message until today
i tried to open the attachment
our network operations require that the file be saved first before opening
did that
and what comes up looks like it is in tongues
unfortunately
i can't read anything
but hopefully nancy was able to review it
i realized today that the article that lori ewalt gave me in hard copy at the board meeting is still in my ncl folder
i meant to retype and get this to you in a word attachment
but frankly the hours at enron have been horrific
i worked the weekends of november 0 and 0
sat and sun
and have had very long hours during the week
latest one on record to date was 0:0 am last tuesday
unless lori got that article to you in another way
we are missing that from the newsletter
i will call you and if indeed lori's article is not in there
not the permission form
but another article
i will contact sally and i will simply make copies of the article to be inserted in the newsletter prior to mailing
sorry about this
sounds as if you had a busy thanksgiving on top of a move as well
hope that you are enjoying the new place
too bad about the sooners on saturday
david had thought about driving to dallas next weekend for the big 0 championship game
but obviously won't be doing that now
sally
yes
i think that it makes sense to keep the system available over the weekend for the foreseeable future
i had operations teams accessing critical data
available only in sap
on friday evening and sunday this past weekend
it is very likely that our need to do so will continue
unlimited to weekdays
thanks
sally
our curve validation process is one of the key items that arthur andersen will be reviewing at year end
aa has looked for us to strengthen this process
and tom bauer stated about 0 weeks ago that he would be looking closely at this
his focus may now have been diverted
but i would also anticipate that aa's reviews will have a new intensity about them
in preparation for this
i have called a meeting today with the risk leads across all commodities
i want to hear from them in a protected environment today what they are and are not doing regarding curve validation
we will review the recent changes recommended regarding curve validation
from the task force lead by shona wilson
and discuss specific action steps to insure that we demonstrate an improved curve validation process
i have a meeting with shawn kilcrest and tom bauer later this week and
following today's meeting
i hope to give them assurances about progress that has or will be made
you are welcome to join us in this meeting
if you do not attend
please get with your respective risk leads later today or tomorrow so that you are aware of the current status of curve validation in your area and any improvements that may need to be made quickly
the meeting will be held as follows

jeff gossett stacey white sam leuschen scott mills john swinney frank prejean michelle bruce ebs tbd
is kathy the right contact
or should it be brian
let's talk about changing the canadian reporting relationships
especially risk
i think that i will propose that to lavorato today
but let's talk first
sally
any ideas on why canadian numbers wouldn't have made it into v@r calc today
sally
bradford called last night
some problem with so0 marks
bill thought that our curves were way off
sounds as if that is not the problem but instead that the book in which these deals were put had previously housed only intercompany deals and not third party deals
book wasn't picked up in credit's exposure
making it look as if we were off on our mark versus barclay's mark by $0mm
i have gotten one story from brent
what do you know about this
sally
we need your help in completing the following today
per sally beck's voice mail message
review your tab in this e-mail to verify the list of retained employees
your name should be in the list as well
where applicable
if you have employees designated to go to newco
please indicate that on your list
we are striving for a list of employees who will remain with the estate
return a hard copy of your list to marla barnard by 0:0 pm today
with your signature that the list is accurate and complete
or with appropriate changes/updates noted
complete a summary template being sent to you by either kerry roper or mike galvan that will give us your total number of employees
with subtotals for those going to newco and those remaining with the estate
and your total number of employees
please complete this by 0:0 pm also

sally
can you have someone send me the list that you said you have provided to suitors of the ena business
i haven't seen it yet since we talked this morning
bob hall and i thought that list would be the best one for us to reconcile to for reporting to you and john on resignations
since you have submitted that list
we should also decide on a process for updating that with new names that we would substitute for someone who leaves
since i haven't received the list yet
please send it to both bob hall and me
i will be out of the office on thursday
so bob will handle the details of a daily report starting tomorrow

happy new year
sally
enw submitted our preliminary revised budget two weeks ago
in our meeting in the board room
we did acknowledge that the enw budget is very dependent upon the business plans of the business units that we support
since our budget meeting was the first that you conducted
we agreed that the enw revised 0 budget would need to be reviewed again once the business plans and associated budgets for other enron business units were completed
has that process been completed such that we can now re-evaluate the 0 budget for enw
i will follow up with you or someone on your staff on january 0 so that we can complete this budget process
i hope that you and your family enjoyed the holidays
sally
the list of proposed netco employees that amy fitzpatrick provided to me at your request included tabs for weather and crude
do you contemplate that netco would trade those commodities/products
bob hall's team that he has assembled for netco does not include anyone with either weather or crude operations experience
we retained two top-notch operations individuals
todd hall and kevin sweeney
who at this time are not on the list for netco
both have extensive risk management experience and both have also managed all aspects of trading operations
documentation
risk books and settlements
todd and kevin each are good managers and they are working managers who know how to execute the details
todd has most recently been in charge of all aspects of operations for weather
prior to has role in egm
todd created the mpr and supported all daily activities around valuing the assets in that portfolio
he also has had extensive experience in gas risk management
sweeney's most recent assignment has been to manage operations for eim
the bulk of his enron experience has been in crude and crude products
he was part of the original team that opened the singapore trading office and has experience in the uk as well
if you anticipate dealing in commodities outside gas and power
todd and kevin would both be great players to have on the netco team
let's discuss
sally
there are 0 excellent players whom i would draft onto any team that have not been picked up on the netco list
two of the three are todd hall and kevin sweeney
details below in my e-mail to louise
another excellent player is shona wilson
she currently leads the group that produces the dpr and the mpr
she had excellent experience with pwc before joining enron
auditing trading companies in europe
i have some thoughts on the value that she could bring in working with a new owner of the business
she could be instrumental in blending our risk reporting process with another entity
i am not sure about the extent of your involvement with the creation of netco
if you do anticipate being involved
i would like to talk with you about these individuals and the roles that they could play in creating the best team for netco
sally
do you have a few minutes to get with me this week
you seem to be the
in charge
person for the estate
i wanted to visit with you about the needs that you see for the estate and the role that i might play
i am focused currently on aiding in the due diligence work around the formation of netco
from an operations perspective
although i am not on the list to go with netco
i am also working with jim fallon on supporting the business plans for the remaining wholesale businesses within enron
greg piper and i also still share the ooc responsibilities for enron net works as well
i am committed to enron
but would appreciate a frank discussion about the timeline you see for me at enron
i need to have a job
and want to be appropriately prepared if the timeframe for me at enron is limited
thanks
sally
rick
do you feel that the revised budgets that your team has received are
baked enough
so that it makes sense for us to relook at the enw budget in light of revised plans for the various business units
my understanding is that the business plans that jim fallon had asked the various wholesale business units to complete by december 0 have not yet been submitted to jim
which would lead me to ask whether or not the revised 0 budgets that you have are far enough along in the process for us to use in re-evaluating the enw budget
let me know your thoughts on your degree of comfort with the revised budgets and who on your staff we could work with to get the necessary information to rework the enw budget
if necessary
thanks
sally
louise
who in hr is providing you with a list and what is the purpose of the list
we can verify that they are still with the company and that they are still getting paid
but knowing the source of the list you refer to from hr and the purpose of the list will allow us to get to the heart of the communication problem
sally
fyi
sorry
i read the first e-mail before seeing this one
thanks for not asking me where my head was when we talked
sally
what are our communications with terminated employees and are there administrative obstacles impacting them as the note below would indicate
if there is a backlog of info regarding employee status
i will be happy to key punch to get caught up
i am trainable and very willing
sally
mike
do you have time to get together on thursday to review the budget data that you have in hand
assumptions regarding number of employees within business units and the timing of the sale or shut-down of certain lines of business have a direct impact on the enw revised budget for 0
sally
mark received a payment in late november that stated that it would have to be repaid in full if he leaves enron before the end of february 0
how do we handle this
has mark mentioned this repayment
sally
big pig
met with them today and gave an overview of operations
all went well
the cfo asked about performance measurements regarding costs per transaction
i described the operations pricing model that i implemented several years ago
they were also interested in our ability to handle increased transaction flow
and i mentioned that through the opm we were able to track the increased operational efficiencies that we experienced with the increase in transaction flow
the cfo asked to get some information regarding opm
i have a summary report that reflects the decrease in cost per transaction plotted against the increase in transaction counts
this is not currently included in the data room
do you want to review this before i pass it along to andy zipper to provide to the cfo
eddie pittarelli
head of operations for ubs
called today to reconfirm the numbers of operations personnel slated for newco
the spreadsheets that you had forwarded to me louise
through amy fitzpatrick on december 0
totaled 0 for operations
which included 0 for gas logistics
eddie said that he was going into a meeting tonight where ubs would again discuss their level of interest
he wanted to know if the operations staff was still primarily in tact
and i confirmed that is the case
told him that the leads on gas risk
gas logistics
power risk
settlements and documentation were all here in place
he said that depending on the outcome of the meeting tonight that he plans to be in houston within the next few days
fyi
i will include kerry in this meeting with mike
do you want to attend as well
let me know
and we will schedule it so that it works for you
too
sally
please schedule a meeting for thurday afternoon
0 minutes
with mike deville
kerry roper
greg piper and me to review the operating budgets for 0
and the impact on the enw operating budget
thanks
bob is out with the flu and may be out through tomorrow
i will coordinate with him on org charts
where do you want to have gas logistics
under bob in operations or under trading
given your answer
we just need to be consistent with commercial on this for the org charts
also
i talked with bob hall today and would expect to hear definitively from him tomorrow regarding his commitment to netco
i had an interesting conversation with barry pearce this morning
and sounds as if you already have an alternative plan under way
sally
yes
these functions are covered in the netco list put together by bob
under the tab labeled
documentation
in the electronic list sent to me by amy fitzpatrick
there are certain employees whose job titles include the phrase
global management
meaning global databases
including counterparty
bill hare is on the netco list
and is the most knowledgeable person in the company regarding the global counterparty database
contract administration for gas and power has been handled by kim theriot's group
and kim has accounted for that activity in her listing of employees for netco
sally
kristin was there
i had to cut it short by a few minutes to meet with delainey in the other building
kristin stayed for a few more minutes to talk with jeff and stacey
i can give you a more detailed download of all meetings tomorrowl
sally
was jim asking questions about the number of employees in enw who would remain with the estate
summary looks good
our meeting with mike deville on 0 budgets is scheduled for tomorrow
sally
barry would be good and i do believe that he is an asset
i will talk with wes and see what we can suggest
with regard to your comment that i am
in
in my conversation with greg whalley a couple of weeks ago he said that he does need me to accomplish some things for the estate and that like mark haedicke
and perhaps himself
there could be some issues with the estate and creditors committee if we were to go to netco immediately
what i agreed to with greg is that i will be focused on the estate and that i would be interested in talking about netco in 0 to 0 days
in the meantime
i will participate as much as you would like for me to on the due diligence process around the auction
i will gladly meet with any and all prospective buyers to make them comfortable with our processes
systems
staff expertise and operational controls
and you can also count on me if i can play a role in assuring that the staff destined for netco is in tact and is motivated and excited about the opportunities there
leslie reeves will be getting the org charts to tammie this afternoon before she leaves
gas logistics is not included in the operations org charts
as our understanding is that logistics is being included in the commerical org charts
sally
just to keep you up-to-date with the saga
mike shanker called today and wants to spend tuesday through thursday next week in our office reviewing at a more detailed level the functional responsibilities within operations and accounting
his goal
on behalf of frank bisignano
which i am sure that i have misspelled
is to map the job functions that we have into the job functions as they are organized within solomon smith barney
i told him that we would be glad to work with him
we will involve bob hall
jeff gossett
stacey white
leslie reeves and others as needed in these more detailed discussions
mike says that wes is sending him a functional org chart for his team today
i will touch base with wes to make sure we are coordinated on our efforts
is this the entity that had requested org charts that you asked for
sally
fyi
as discussed
happy reading on the plane
sally w
beck chief operating officer enron net works llc
beth perlman has fleshed out an idea for maximizing value for creditors of the enron estate that i believe has a lot of merit
as you may know
one of our business goals within enron net works in 0 was to commercialize mid and back office services
with the money and talent that has been poured into enron's trading operations systems and processes
we believed that there could be market demand for these services
ironically enough
we had secured our first services customer and were to begin providing these services on december 0
understandably
the customer became concerned during november and the deal was shelved
our experience was that there was much interest in mid and back office services
coupling our systems and our people
but that the major drawback in the marketplace was that it was indeed enron that was offering these services
the market place didn't want us to
win again
as enron
obviously
the world has changed
while effort is currently focused on the formation of netco and how to realize value from remaining contracts within egm
eim
ea
ees
etc
i think that we would short-change the estate if we did not bring the idea of a services company to at least the proposal stage in order to evaluate its potential value for the estate
the idea would be to form this services company with a consulting firm
which could provide some capital
additional resource pool and a ready sales channel
with the potential of spin-off companies from enron and with former enron employees taking jobs with other firms
many doors would be opened for this
independent
services company to provide services
servicing the enron estate could be the first engagement for this services company
depending upon the structure of the deal
benefits to the enron estate could be reduced costs for systems and services
perhaps a cash inflow from the purchase of the commoditylogic tools
the possibility of some revenue stream from other services engagements
etc
another important aspect of this idea is that for the systems and operations professionals
this would create a true career opportunity
a service bureau offering through an established consulting firm
making it much more likely that these people could be retained
beth and i met with a consulting firm today to explore the concept
there is definite interest
so we discussed the idea with greg piper today
we asked him for clarification around the netco agreement regarding systems
and i believe that he has copied you on a note to anne koehler regarding this
our ability to process transactions is one of enron's assets
and our hope would be that we are not limiting the full realization of value around that asset in the way that the netco agreement has been drafted
the next step would be to have the consulting firm conduct a short due diligence process so that a proposal could be presented for the estate's consideration
beth and i would like to move forward with the proposal stage
it would be helpful to know your view on the process which would have to be followed to consider the proposal
if we as enron felt that there is merit to the proposal
would there simply be an approval process with the creditor's committee and the court
would there have to be some sort of open bidding process on the proposal
to set expectations within the consulting firm
it would be good to be able to give them a feel for the process
your thoughts on this idea in general would be welcomed as well
sally
i have almost completely lost my voice today and am also running a fever
i have coordinated with bob hall this morning and he will attend the 0:0 meeting in ecn 0c0
he will be able to give a good overview of operations and will be able to coordinate any other information needs they may have
all that i could do at this point is cough and nod
i could certainly answer any questions for the euros via e-mail
if needed
over the weekend
call me at home
0-0-0
and i will be glad to do so
i do expect to be in the office on monday
hopefully with a voice
sally
sorry to cut the conversation short last night
but frankly i was in tears and it didn't make sense to continue the conversation
certainly if you feel more comfortable staying at a hotel
you should do what you think is best for you
we will just be happy to have you with us for whatever time you feel is right for you
my reaction last night was simply shock
because we had never discussed your staying at a hotel during this visit
and your lead in to the conversation with
you know we are staying at a hotel
was such a surprise
yes
you stayed at a hotel when you were here for thanksgiving
but that was with cindy
richard
brigeda
chris and cara staying in our home as well
with just the two of you
and since you had said nothing to the contrary
i assumed that you would be in our home
what you couldn't know
of course
is the caring time that i have taken over the last several weeks to complete a refresh of the guest room
all with the timing based on having it ready for the two you for this weekend
but it was this special effort for your visit that made it particularly surprising and then disappointing to me that you will stay at a hotel
i had it down to the details of new hangers for the closet
a real bed instead of just a frame
i ironed sheets on sunday night
something that i never do for us
and have my framer on a tight turn-around on reframing some family pictures to complete a wall in the guest room
certainly other guests can enjoy these things
too
but my timing on everything was to make the room even more comfortable and complete for you by the time of your visit
i have certainly gotten comfortable today with the idea that you will stay in the hotel
and again
whatever is best for you
sounds as if we should make that the
norm
from this point forward
and then expectations will be set ahead of time for everyone
i do hope that you can come in time for lunch on friday
i am planning to take the day off from work
and the plan was that david would join us so that the four of us could have lunch at champions
david has taken some office space near champions
and we had planned to show you that as well
then we can rest
you can to do that at the hotel
if that is better for you
before having our nails done at 0:0
but again
whatever works best for you
just let us know
sally
i won't be able to attend the meeting on friday
i have an eye doctor's appointment at 0:0
so it is also unlikely that i will be able to call in
unless i am pleasantly surprised and he is running on time
i will take the dial in number with me to the appointment in the event that i am somewhere in the process that allows me to dial in
sally
i worlked with jeff gosset
stacey white and bob hall today on their input for proposed promotions for operations
tana cashion has the recommended names and salary increases
do you need anything else
description of their respoinsibilities
rationale for promotion recommendation
etc
let me know
i mentioned to tana that letters had been given to both jeff gossett and bob superty in late november or december stating that they would be promoted from director to senior director at the first of the year
we have jeff covered
but with the change in bob superty's reporting relationship
i want to be certain that his promotion doesn't fall through the cracks
tana was somehow unaware of these letters
although they were prepared by hr
as you review the entire list of proposed promotions
please be check to make sure that bob superty's name was submitted by scott neal for a promotion
thanks
sally
doing fine
still in the boat
at what is truly the eleventh hour
i seem to be getting calls about taking the netco operations role
despite my statement of disinterest
there are those who would like to have one more conversation when the purchaser is known and a real role could be discussed
i have met with fallon several times over the last several days
but each meeting has specifically focused on information needs for e&y relative to the estate or conference calls related to the transition services agreement with netco
jim seems busy with these issues
i am meeting with janet d
tomorrow morning at 0:0 to give her an update on an infrastructure plan
i have bob hall researching the details and status of the peoples jv
bridgeline and wholesale and retail power positions in california
he is coordinating with beth apollo and team on the retail side
these details will help us flesh out the right support if these are some of the first assets that will be managed to create a go-forward company
i enjoyed the dinner tuesday night and had the opportunity to visit over dinner with a couple of people that i had not known before
seems like a good group
sally
anything we can do on this
thanks
sally
where are we on decisions on promotions
last time i asked
it was under consideration
kevin has a good idea here
can you give us an update
thanks
sally
you have mentioned several times that we would talk about the organization to support wholesale
but the opportuntity to do so hasn't materialized
we have had meetings about specific issues
but have not generally discussed how we will manage the estate going forward
what role do you envision that i will play
can you make time to discuss that on monday
i have talked with delainey about providing infrastructure for newco
and had independently come to the conclusion that we must manage mid and back office for all estate activities
liquidating activities and building activities
in one group to provide the best coverage and flexibility for resources
with the still anticipated spin-off of netco
i have created a plan to reorganize the operations teams
efforts
i will be glad to share that with you as we work jointly on the infrastructure to service all estate needs
sally
john
i got the e-mail last night with the tabs for the breakdown of the current 0 for operations
inclusive of power and gas logistics
the tabs total 0 with one associate noted on a separate line in power logistics
and 0 without that associate
so i don't know whether you are using 0 or 0 currently for the operations total
taking this number to 0 in total is obviously a big change
0.0% reduction
at this moment
i don't know how feasible that is
but i will work with jeff
stacey and leslie to find out
we need some questions answered first to go through this
0
who is coordinating the look at headcount reductions for gas and power logistics
together
those groups represent 0% of the 0 headcount
going in
i would asssume that they would take their proportionate share of reductions
should be 0 reductions
we need to know who we should work with to coordinate this
need names and weekend contact numbers
0
what will the overall headcount be for netco
what we need to know is how many gas and power traders there will be and whether or not their anticipated business scope changes
if commercial numbers don't change and the business scope doesn't change
a 0.0% reduction is probably out of the question
0
is the 0 number for operations only a start-up number
could we anticipate adding staff as business ramps up
approval is obtained for physical gas business
etc
or is the 0 number intended to be the total headcount for all of 0
0
what are ubs
expectations for mid and back office
what are the views from legal and ubs on creating confirmations for eol transactions
there were some discussions with leslie reeves about not confirming certain types of transactions
one firm
and i don't remember whether it was ubs or not
mentioned that we might not be the confirming agent on transactions
and that instead we would review third party paper prepared for confirmations
that is a completely different activity than we normally engage in
and would make a difference in staffing
perhaps requiring more people
we need to know those things from ubs to take a real stab at a revised number
should we just pool our knowledge from various discussions that have been had with ubs
or is there someone with ubs that we should be talking with this weekend to get there view of what is required
0
does the internal rac group go forward under a headcount reduction
i.e
will we be coordinating and providing information to them
or will ubs assume some of their functions
this may impact our staffing needs
what about consolidated risk reporting
will stacey and jeff simply transmit data to ubs
or netco have to provide some consolidated risk reporting before sending info to ubs
we may have more questions
but these are key now to get at a feasible number
sally
i have left john a message about the e-mail
no response yet
will call leslie
stacey and jeff as soon as i finish breakfast
happy for hector and laura to attend
sally
congratulations on a job done well in a short period of time
your note of thanks to everyone was a nice one
i am sure that the team appreciates your leadership
sally
did the numbers that we gave you yesterday on operations hold up after your meeting with ubs
amy fitzpatrick is calling me to get names
our primary focus yesterday was on number of positions
we identified names in most cases
but not all
before that is finalized and i pass names along to amy
i wanted to know if we were okay with the numbers
please let me know
names can be finalized this afternoonis we are set on numbers
sally cell
0-0-0
thanks

i believe that tom martin is talking with chris germany about taking the logistics role for the texas region with daren's planned departure
please coordinate with tom and bob superty on where they are in this process of replacing daren
0
i am not sure that i know what database you are referencing
he is on the current proposed org chart for netco energy operations under operational databases
part of the documentation team
it is correct that his name is on the list that i provided to you yesterday
let me know if you have any other questions
sally
0
did you add to the numbers that jeff and i reviewed with you on sunday
you had mentioned folding in some analysts and associates
did you do that
ubs was asking me about numbers today
and i wanted to be consistent with the answers
0
what about calgary
you were going to ask rob m
to have peggy hedstrom coordinate over the weekend
didn't hear from her
are you handling this through rob
or do you want me to include calgary operations in the final org chart for netco operations
sally
that was my third or fourth time at ibeza
i have enjoyed it each time
it is a great place for outside dining when the weather works for that
sally
fyi
lemetrice is either a director or senior director under jenny
kind of a second in command
she worked extensively on the original 0 budget for infrastructure and put together some data on functions within the infrastructure group that gave a somewhat layman's explanation of the various services provided
we have already gone through the process of rebudgeting dollars and headcount for 0
post bankruptcy and december 0 lay offs
and with the projected netco spin off
it is likely that lemetrice has all of those details
so despite a somewhat short answer from jenny
she was actually on target to refer you to her
sally
thanks for your nice note
while the journey has been interesting
to say the least
i am very excited about what we can do and committed to the effort
i am glad that we will be able to continue working together
sally
your info is right
although i do hope that all is not dark
wouldn't have imagined this outcome two weeks ago
but when bob hall removed his name from the netco list
timing was critical in working with potential purchasers in the auction process
there wasn't anyone else to step in
so i did so just to help coordinate the due diligence effort and the transition
i spent many hours with the ubs operations team last week
and they are the ones who decided that they wanted me to take the role
it was the time that i spent with the ubs team that changed my mind about considering the role
my reporting relationship will be to the head of american operations in stamford
ct
i am quite impressed with him
the further negative news here was a factor as well
should be interesting
sally
the best list of operations employees involved in ubs warburg energy is the executed offer letters and employment agreements that have been turned in
i also have an up-to-date org chart
can we reconcile your distribution list with this org chart
i would like to get his right
sally
don't know what works best with your schedule
ernie pitterelli
head of operatins for ubs americas
will be here on monday and tuesday and one of the things that we will discuss is the risk roles
position rerporting and calculation of p&l
ernie is targeting tuesday to discuss canadian operations
so it could be helpful for you to be here
what was wes
response
sally
today was parent/teacher conference day at tyler's preschool and i had signed up for the 0:0 am slot
sorry that i couldn't make the meeting
i had asked bob hall to attend in my place
i know that he also had an 0:0 am meeting related to retention
so i don't know whether or not he made it to your meeting
what is your calendar like for drinks next week
sally
great
i will look forward to seeing you next week
sally
fbi agents have parked in my reserved parking spot in the new enron garage wednesday through friday this week
#0
the spot is clearly marked reserved
and as you know it is money out of my pocket for that reserved space
i have left a polite note on the intruding car on thursday and friday
asking that the reserved status be observed
as there are many unused
non-reserved parking spaces in the garage
i have put up with this for 0 days
if the fbi will be back here next week
however
i will grow tired of this
is there some way to communicate with them so that they observe the reserved parking spaces
i know that you have bigger issues at hand
but my concern is that if their visits to the building are extended
that i will be paying for a reserved parking space that i never get to use
thanks
sally

i will have copies of the floor plans for 0 and 0 sometime this morning
we should determine best placement for these
sally

unfortunately
i do not know anything about ecoelectrica
i contacted michelle blaine at the former ei
thinking that there was some confusion between blaine and cash
her assistant contacted me and said that
apparently
coralina rivera at the former ei has information about eco electrica in puerto rico
i have left coralina a message indicating that you are looking for information about ecoelectrica and requesting that she contact you directly
let me know if i can do anything further on this matter
michelle
thanks for the consideration
i did not expect much
also
i have faxed you my comments on response to malme's motion to extend time to designate experts
the comments should be self-explanatory
call me with any questions
or have tim call me
thanks

as we discussed
mark haedicke and i discussed the possibility of providing kevin mcconville with some sort of indemnity in order to make sure that he remains available and cooperative during the pendency of the nsm case and other litigation matters
we could agree to enter into a consulting services agreement with kevin
the terms of that agreement would include
0

he will agree to meet with counsel
prepare for testimony
review documents
testify
and provide other assistance
as needed
0
through february 0

kevin would not be directly compensated for this cooperation/testimony
because he is to be receiving his salary pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement
after feb.0
0
he will be paid a rate of $0 per hour for his services in this regard
0
enron would agree to indemnify kevin for his conduct taken in the ordinary course and scope of his employment with enron
up to the last date of his employment with enron
excluded from this indemnity would be allegations or claims based upon the following
any conduct that is outside the course and scope of kevin's employment
any conduct violating policies of enron or ena
kevin's intentional acts
kevin's gross negligence
kevin's reckless conduct
conduct that is in violation of any law

the commission of an unlawful or illegal act
0
kevin would invoice enron for time spent in performing the services after 0/0/0
the invoice would be paid within 0 days of receipt
in addition
all related expenses would be reimbursed throughout the term of the agreement
let me know if you have any questions or require additional information
i am available to participate in your call with him

michelle
gene and susan
here is the draft award agreement for the plan
let me know if you have comments
i will be getting with brian bloom this week with our comments to the plan document
michelle
twanda
we need an amendment to this agreement
would you please do the form
thanks
michelle
john
would you confirm
via a new email that i can print for my files
you have had the conversations with dan bruce
etc
about entelligence that i scripted for you in a prior email
thanks a lot
michelle
fyi
michelle
ok
you told me nothing
so i am clueless as to what is creating the distress
maybe we can chat later
we will not be in austin in the next few months
we are going to san antonio the first weekend in march
as well as the first week in april
the first trip is for a wedding between two friends of trey from rice mba who are marrying each other
the other is for the enron law conference
which is wed.-friday
we are not taking cameron on either of those trips
party time
so we will be rushing back to houston right afterwards
i am working with butch hayes at f&j
i haven't been too involved in the matter because it is not an enron subsidiary
but from what i can tell
i like him
any additional insight
if necessary
would be great
too bad you weren't in houston a couple of weeks ago
but
it probably would have been a sad time for all of you
and it sounds like you don't really need that right now
if you visit us
we promise to be cheerful and frivolous if you need it
not that acting that way is too much of a chore for me
plus
cameron acts like a 0-year-old
which is a delight
he started at a new school a few weeks ago
the post oak school
a montessori school about a block from our house
and he is really coming into his own
it is amazing how much my world has both grown and shrunk since he was born
little things like seeing a squirrel in the back yard have become major events
don't even get me started on helicopters
on the other hand
i feel this enormous responsibility and desire to make sure that all is right with the world
quite an awesome sense of obligation and discovery combined
enough waxing philosophical
i've got to get out of here at some point
so i'd better get back to work
later
m
kate and felicia
that org chart was from me
i thought there was an enclosure note
sorry
michelle
twanda
would you please make this a form entitled

david
fyi
let me know if you have any comments
which i will give to dawn
i'll review it and get back with dawn
yikes
i can understand your preoccupation with those issues out there
i am sure that you are all
talked out
about it
but if you need an empathetic ear
give me a buzz
talk to you later
michelle ps i saw julie parraguirre last night
and she told me to say hello
she is going to be teaching at the same school that cameron attends
great
our only plans are that we have tickets to the ballet on saturday night
if you want to attend
let me know
and we will get tickets
it is cleopatra
a world premier
and it should be entertaining
i understand if you don't want to join us
though
ballet isn't for everyone
let me know
michelle
twanda
please print this out and also print out the consulting services agreement form for my review with this
thanks
mhc
hello
do you think this should be included in our consulting agreement form
michelle
twanda
would you please make this change to all forms
thank you
michelle
twanda
please print all these
thanks
michelle
thanks for the draft
delaware is the proper state
i thought the deferral information was sent to you already
there is no
plan
document per se
instead
there is a description of the program
i will re-send that to you today if you don't already have it
please contact my assistant
twanda sweet
for a time to have a conference call on the other question
my morning today is wild
tomorrow probably is better
thanks
michelle
tony
the lawyer's name is gary herrmanns at orrick
his number is 0-0-0
thanks for the message about trey
michelle
just when you thought it was safe
i have received a question from nepco about project 0
apparently
they have temporary employees who work on projects and then leave the company
these are hourly employees who do not work regularly
originally
these employees were thought to be included in the scope of project 0 by corp
mike indivero called me and said that these people should not receive the 0 options because they are not
regular
full-time or regular part-time employees
as described in the memo from the office of the chairman
what are your thoughts on that
should they be included or not
my reading of the email to all employees is that it does not include temporary employees
do you know how other temporary employees were treated
let me know what you think
thanks
as always
michelle
drew
at one point
we had mentioned the idea of having services agreements among corp
and the various business units that are using shared services
i think that these agreements should be put into place sooner rather than later as we begin to move towards shared services across the organization
let me know if you would like me to prepare the drafts of these agreements or revise agreements that currently are in existence
if there are none
then we really need to put some in place
thanks
michelle
twanda
please save this as a form
thanks
mhc
please print the email and the attachments

mhc
pat
here are the draft plan documents
any comments would be appreciated

thanks a lot
mhc
i spoke with corporate compensation yesterday
kim bolton
about the option of paying for stock options/phantom stock with proceeds from the eip incentive plan
she is working on obtaining approval for that provision
otherwise
i believe that we are ready to review a final version of the plan
jeanne
could you please circulate one
i'll be in san antonio for the law conference the rest of the week
but this process should not wait for me
once corporate comp gives it the ok
we should be ready to finalize it
michelle cash
tara
you are right
those changes were not included
for vice president level employees
corporate comp.does not promote guaranteed performance bonuses
the request that he be able to
get out
of his employment contract if he is not promoted also is not something that we can do
otherwise
it will undermine the enforceability of our non-competes across the board
i spoke with david oxley on both of those points
and he concurred that these changes could not be made
michelle
call me if you have any questions
i hope this is better late than never
michelle
elspeth
do we want to do a new agreement
or simply assume the obligations in the old one
if the former
i'd do a new agreement
if the latter
i believe i simply can do an assignment agreement
once i receive a copy of the current agreement
it also depends on the language in the old one
and whether we believe it protects ena
so
we'd have to look at it
sharon
do you have the file on this person
if so
let me know
and i will have someone come and pick it up
thanks
michelle
fyi re
fmla policy
jeff
what is the status of the document
i expect that jon will be calling me any day
thanks
michelle
twanda
please save this in whatever power point directory you have
then
print for me to revise for a presentation to energy operations for norma
save this one
though
because the one i am going to use for energy ops will be much shorter
and this one has good stuff in it
thanks
michelle
kerry
thanks for this
wow
is it long
michelle
fyi
how is the research going on whether we can set up the plan the way we want to
my understanding is that you were going to do some research for us
thanks
michelle
please keep your file open
we still are talking with her
and probably will need additional revisions to the document
as well as your advice and counsel
thanks
michelle
felicia
in general
you are correct that the salary basis test must be met before someone can be classified as exempt
however
because there are certain exceptions to the salary basis test
for example
licensed attorneys do not have to meet that test
it depends on what the employees are doing as to whether this situation creates a problem under the flsa
my recommendation would be to obtain information about the jobs performed by these 0 employees so that we can determine whether there is an issue
if they do not fit within one of the exceptions
we probably should have them affirmatively report time so that hours worked over 0 can be paid at the overtime rate
you would use the hourly rate they are paid to determine the overtime rate
if they are not working over 0 hours in a week
it will not be an issue
let me know if you have questions
michelle
sylvia/sharon
i assume that copies will be provided to me and kriste as well
i would appreciate the opportunity to review them
thanks
michelle
rick
are you on this
or should i get on it
michelle
twanda
please print for me
thanks
michelle
fyi
michelle
hi
charla
i have reviewed the additional fields you described
most of them look fine with me
i do have some concerns with the questions about birthplace
citizenship
personal travel
and reason for return from prior assignment
the questions about birthplace/citizenship are the most risky
as i have discussed with others
such questions could create issues of national origin discrimination
particularly if one's birthplace country is not evident from any other source
it also could create a privacy issue if we are asking questions that are not job-related and consistent with business necessity
what is the purpose of this inquiry
are we trying to determine whether a person is eligible to work in a particular country
if so
it appears that birthplace and citizenship are not the answers that we need
we already have a field on where a person is eligible to work
which would cover the situation where a person has citizenship in one country
but is on a work visa to another
any other information may not be necessary
the question about reasons for returning from leave also could unearth information that we really don't want to keep on a system
for example
if a person left because of health reasons
or the birth of a child
it really is not a job-related issue
what is the purpose of this question
is there a less intrusive way to ask it
finally
the question about countries visited for personal reasons also is asking information that is not job-related
what is the purpose of that inquiry
is there another way to gather that information
let me stress that none of these inquiries is unlawful
some of them may be unwise for the reasons i cited above
if you would like to discuss this further
please give me a call
michelle
i inadvertently forgot to
reply to all
when i sent this response to michelle
t
would you please set up a meeting with shanna
thanks
mhc
twanda
would you please print for my review

which i will resend to you right now
mhc
any idea why they did this
michelle
david
on point 0
that type of arrangement has to be approved by the enron executive committee
let me know if you want a copy of the note describing that process
which was sent by cindy olson a few weeks ago
michelle
we are in the process of promulgating a data protection policy
it should be out in the next few weeks
it addresses all of those privacy
etc
issues
let me know if you would like a copy of the draft policy
michelle enron north america corp
we should get it today
i'll messenger it over when it arrives
mhc
fyi
i have sent them a copy of the draft policy
i think it will address their concerns
michelle
that was sent to you by messenger
getting it notarized may take a long time
is it necessary
michelle
cindy
fyi regarding the labor/employment lawyer for ebs
according to sharon
she was asked to be point person for ebs
i'll let you know when i talk with mark
which should be early next week upon his return from london
have a great weekend
is chelsea giving you a mother's day gift
michelle
twanda
would you please print this for me
thanks
mhc--my printer is not working
or maybe i haven't selected my local printer correctly
fyi
here is most of the information
michelle
twanda
could you please start consulting services agreements for these entities
i have asked norma to get the rest of the information
thanks
mhc
mark
do we need to say something about the fact that v&e is representing ecogas and not the plan to ensure protection of the privilege
mhc
please print for me
thanks
mhc
linda
great job
i am happy with that result
it makes things much easier
have a great weekend
michelle please respond to lbroocks
i sent milnthorp and lemmons to you
i sent brown to tara rozen in london
clemmons final will go today
do we need to talk about josey and thompson
michelle
tara
perhaps the brown contract should have gone to melissa instead of you
sorry
could you please let me know if i need to re-route or do anything else on that agreement
oxley is anxious for it to get to him
thanks
michelle
john
thanks for including me on the distribution of this
i received your voice mail and was glad to be in the loop
in general
we try to avoid any type of personality/psych testing because of issues relating to the americans with disabilities act
which prohibits pre-employment medical testing
it does apply to us citizens working for enron in foreign locations
i.e
extraterritorially
before we go forward and do this type of testing
it is useful to ascertain the purpose/goal of the tests
why do they want this information
is there another
less intrusive
way to obtain that information
e.g
references from prior employers
etc
as noted below
there may be japanese labor/employment law issues that address this type of activity as well
i suggest that we obtain the information above as well as the opinion requested below and then determine how to proceed
michelle
welcome to the heat
if you would re-send your resume to me
i'll re-send it to my contacts here in town and let them know that you now are available
i think i may have a firm that could use your skills
michelle

i just called our counsel on this matter this morning to find out the status
i believe that cline has different counsel now
and i will find out about this asap
michelle
i don't know anything about this

do you know anything about this for ecogas
michelle cash
kerry
what are your thoughts on this issue
michelle michelle
we have had a couple of interpretations as to how to calculate the overtime for employees who receive a shift differential and wanted to ask for assistance from you
the problem we are having deals with employees who rotate shift
please review the following scenario
for a simple example with an ee at $0/hour and shift of $0/hour for the night
n
shift
interpretation 0 the shift differential would be added to his pay to determine the regular rate of pay and his pay would be calculated as follows
reg $0 shift 0 interpretation 0 since his overtime was during a day shift
his pay would be calculated as follows
reg $0 shift 0 can you please let us know which interpretation is correct or if we have totally missed the boat on both of them
thanks for your help
diane
david
i am with you
in fact
i sent this issue to outside counsel earlier this week because i simply wasn't able to get to it due to the issues surrounding the latest reorg/redeployment efforts
i expect an answer by monday or tuesday

michelle
kerry
this is the second of two messages
do you have any thoughts
michelle michelle
can you review the following examples as well

please let me know
thanks
diane
i am with you

thanks for the email
cameron is great
he loves his new school
even though it is not as
working parent friendly
as cathedral house was
cameron also loves fire engines
and ambulances
and tow trucks
and bulldozers and
we took cameron to the bellaire ems open house a few weeks ago
he got to climb all over the fire engines and even get into the driver's seat and
drive
they also handed out plastic fireman's hats
he had a blast
i look forward to having you back on 0
i'm moving there as soon as they get my phone/computer set up
i'll spend half days there
see you later
michelle
the questions are as follows
0
has enron provided ecogas with such coverage for its non-enron board members so far
0
what is the general scope of such coverage
ecogas is a stand-alone company
enron owns about 0 percent of its stock and has three people on its board
i hope that helps
michelle
shelly
because he should have received this much sooner
we should hand deliver the check as soon as we get it from ap if it is not done through direct deposit
if it is
then mailing the pay advice is ok
thanks
michelle

we can make the salary retroactive as part of the contract
have we already sent you executables
if so
we can re-run with a provision that states
effective 0/0/0
employee's monthly base salary shall be $xxxx
the effective date still can be 0/0

we are planning to stay at the doubletree suites in/near georgetown
apparently
it is close to the watergate
it was way less expensive than the embassy suites we discussed the other day
approx
$0 per night
we are renting a car

so we can get around wherever we need to
or
of course
we can take the metro
talk to you later
michelle
privileged and confidential
advice covered by the attorney-client privilege k0
i have copied this email to sharon
kriste
who are supporting the calme region
my recommendation is to exclude contractors/consultants because their inclusion would increase the risk that they would be deemed to be employees
and that a court could determine that they are owed employee compensation and benefits
a la microsoft
this exposure could be high
depending on the other indicators of independent contractor status
rating them along side our employees could be a factor to tilt the balance
let me know if you have any questions
michelle
dear gretchen
wow
you are thinking ahead
what is a leap pad
is it something computer related
i have never heard of it
on our end
we have planned a trip to dc to visit madison in august
nice and hot by then
we just got word that we have tix to the orioles game while we are there
so that is good
we got new furniture in the living room
a chocolate brown suede/leather sofa and chair/ottoman
it amplified the need for bright art in that room
to the galleries and starving artists sales we go
stay cool

i think that bracewell may be looking for people
as might littler
mendelson
i hope that helps
michelle
matt
thanks for your email
i believe that there is an agreement in place between ena and enron expat services
in general
the contract is between ena and the employee
if the person is an expat
the assignment letter covers the employee's transfer to expat services
we haven't usually amended/assigned the agreement over to expat services
because the payroll/benefits
etc
are through ena
if there are changes to his ena agreement
it is very easy for me to do them
and i am happy to handle it
if mr
slovenski is a vp level or above employee
i simply cannot remember right now
then executive compensation needs to be involved
i hope this answers your questions
i have copied sharon butcher on this email because she has been involved with assignments/expats for several years
if you have further questions
please reply to both of us so that we can be aware of questions
thanks a lot
michelle
brian
would you or someone in your group please investigate the allegations raised by janeth rodriguez-philhower
based upon her voice mail message
there is a strong possibility of litigation
your investigation into her allegations thus would be conducted in anticipation of litigation
once you have conducted the investigation
please provide me with the results
thank you

i asked trey about it
and we went onto amazon.com to look at it
it looks like a cool toy that cameron would enjoy
fyi
the price at amazon was way less than the price at etoys
as a matter of fact
i told trey that it would be great to have it for our trip to dc in august
but
we can wait til christmas
so go ahead with your plans
congrats on the furniture
i am sure that you will be happy with it and will love the new look

i left you a voice mail yesterday
but i wasn't sure if you were in
there is a new deal
project e0/endeavor
it is in the preliminary stages
but the deal team
led by don miller
would like to have data regarding the average cost of enron employee benefits
broken down by type of benefit
if possible
i assume that you would have that type of data and could forward it to don and me
let me know if i should be contacting someone else

enron north america had some summer clerks this summer
generally
we do not hire lawyers without significant legal experience
i.e
more than 0 years

someone with lots of enron experience

have a great holiday

how do we get emma paid
michelle
hello
here is the latest draft on garden state/project barbed wire
as i mentioned to dee
the agreement is due to be signed on tuesday
0/0
dee/rick
i just learned that there are multi-employer plans for the unionized employees
i'll provide details as i learn them
i guess you can forward your comments to me
with a copy to stuart zisman
thanks
michelle
pat
here is additional information about the transaction we have been working on
of course
they are going to finalize tomorrow
i agree with your concerns about the tortious interference situation
do you have any suggestions on mitigating that risk
my thought would be to request an indemnity for the t.i
claim if it is received
alternatively
we can ask for a waiver for all persons who are terminated and ask that the buyer be a beneficiary/waived party
any ideas
michelle
dee/pat/rick
here is the diligence memo
michelle
amy
is patrick chris mallory located in portland or in california
if california
then he needs a slightly different agreement because non-competes are not enforceable in california
let me know
i hope he is in oregon
thanks
michelle
pat
i am going to forward you a draft of an amendment to the employment agreement for greg whalley
i would appreciate your thoughts on the language
particularly the language in amended section 0.0b regarding the calculation of value for options/restricted stock
for some reason
i cannot attach it to this email
so i will have my assistant send it under separate email cover
thanks a lot
michelle
pat
thanks for your comments on the agreement
as an fyi
the stock awards already have been made
so we had to soften the language in the agreement to address that situation
i appreciate your other thoughts
mary
could you or someone in your group help me in putting together an example as suggested by pat
thanks
michelle
here's the latest
michelle
i agree with brian
i recently learned that someone can
hack
into the emeet site and pretend to be jeff skilling
as i discussed with you
brian
this morning
so
we probably should start with that group to see if there are any gaps in the email system
i would suggest that someone from net works
roberto deleon or his crew
would be the appropriate technical support for this endeavor
i agree with brian that the focus should be on the impersonation of the office of the chairman and not the content of the email itself
i am happy to assist in any way you would like
michelle
privileged and confidential this email contains legal advice and confidentiality should be maintained the attached memo describes a recent decision from the national labor relations board regarding an employee's right to be
represented
by a co-worker or other person during a disciplinary meeting
employees in unionized settings always have had this right
but it now has been extended by the nlrb's ruling
the ruling was contentious
there were dissents
and i expect it to be appealed quickly
nonetheless
if an enron employee wants to have someone sit in on a disciplinary meeting
please call me to discuss how to proceed before responding to that request
we want to be careful to avoid a finding of an unfair labor practice
thanks
michelle
kristina
attached is the letter we give to all persons who terminate from ena voluntarily
although i don't really know why we limit it to voluntary terminations
i have to look into that
i also will send you by messenger the draft letter to a company
which i don't have on the system
and the letter i sent to the individual we discussed
i hope these help
let me know if you would like additional information

it looks like my presence in portland is iffy at this point
there are other ways to do the training if you still want it asap
otherwise
i can schedule it a few weeks from now
i'll give you the details as i confirm my situation with the portland trip
michelle
privileged and confidential attorney-client communication this e-mail contains legal advice in the barbed wire purchase agreement is the provision that the purchaser has 0 days to identify those employees of company whom it would like the company to terminate from employment prior to closing
the seller is providing a limited indemnity for purchaser's actions in selecting those employees
the indemnity expressly excludes claims against ena for the selection of those employees
this indemnity thus excludes claims for discrimination on the basis of age
sex
race
religion
etc
the indemnity exclusion also could be interpreted to exclude claims for tortious interference
thus
if ena is going to exercise its right to select company employees under that provision
ena will assume the risk of claims by affected employees
i can assist you in identifying legal risks in the selection process and determining methods to manage the risks of those claims
let me know if you would like to discuss this issue

here are the details about the gpg prc meeting
please note that these people have not been involved in the process for very long and thus
this may not be the best example of how the process works

i am following up on the status of the research involving section 0.0 of the spa
specifically
what are the potential liabilities of enron selecting persons for termination and providing those names to the seller
i would like to have this research asap because our time table is very short
do you have any information on that
thanks
michelle cash
i will look closely at the sample letters to see whether there is any way to avoid the conclusion you have reached
which appears to be the correct one
i have a meeting right now
and will focus on it right after that
i'll send another email once i've completed that review early this afternoon
michelle

we do put people under contract with a definite term
however
at the end of that term
the employee converts to an employee at will
we also hire consultants for a fixed term
but a year-long period for an individual is pretty long for a consultng position
what is the situation
maybe we can find an alternative
michelle
i agree with your approach
mhc ps
i am out next week on vacation
call twanda to arrange for assistance while i am out
and she will refer you on
agreements will be done during my absence
again
work with twanda
thanks
michelle
here is the note that went out
i'm giving a speech this morning and will be out all afternoon
but i will try to catch you in between
also
i am in tomorrow
but then am out all next week on vacation
while i am out
you can work with emma caplan
thanks
michelle
debi
your plan sounds good to me
you all have done a good job of researching this data
and i believe we are in a strong position
my one question is whether it is worth it to tell them we are not accepting resumes from them
what is the harm in accepting them
are we obligated to interview the candidate
given this situation
it is possible that telling them not to send resumes will fan the flames for no good reason
especially since their
proven track record
is only for one placement
it does not appear as if they are flooding us with resumes
let me know if my assumption is not correct
also
i am not sure your apology is necessary
it certainly is well-intentioned
but i wouldn't want it to be construed as some sort of admission of wrongdoing
so
unless you feel compelled
thanks
michelle
thanks for handling that
we are looking forward to our trip
i'll call you when we get in and let you know our details
i look forward to seeing you
mary lou
and peter
if available
see you soon
michelle
privileged and confidential this email contains legal advice hoyt and melissa
i am assuming that we are discussing contract personnel who provide some sort of services for mg/rw
it looks like there may be some key personnel we want to employ
but that there are many whom we don't want to hire
i am not really familiar with the specific facts here
the question of a joint employer arises when a company treats its contract personnel like its own
by setting compensation
controlling their activities
engaging in promotion/discipline/termination
etc
decisions
and other ways in which an employer treats its own employees
so
if the plan is to have workers doing the same thing
with one as a contractor
and one as an employee
there could be some issues
particularly if they share a supervisor
unfortunately
that often is the case with contract personnel
if there are distinctions among the various responsibilities of these workers
and like workers are treated similarly
the risk may be reduced
it is cleanest
however
to use all of these workers through the contracting agency for a while
assume we don't want to hire them all
which is the other alternative
then
the company may want to make selected offers to people who may be in a managerial role or have some other distinction from the bulk of the contract workers
i would like additional information on this situation before reaching a definitive conclusion
so
let's try to discuss it
i am booked until about 0 this morning
but am available after that
michelle

i received the schedule and itinerary for diligence on project crane and have forwarded it to rick johnson
fran mayes
pat mackin
and dee lenfest
we have preliminarily decided that rick johnson will go to both sites to cover labor
union
issues and support in the general hr diligence that fran mayes of ena hr will conduct
either pat or dee will travel to washington to address benefits issues
including obtaining information for subsequent modeling of benefit costs
we would like to have our outside counsel in canada conduct the benefits diligence in the quebec city location and to support rick to the extent that there may be any special issues of canadian or quebec law
i will continue to coordinate these activities and provide whatever other assistance may be needed
let me know if you need any other information about this diligence plan for employment/labor matters
i will work with peter del vecchio to identify our outside counsel designee
michelle
would you please print this and attachments and put a sticky note on them that it is for anonymous letters project
so that i focus on it
thanks
debi
i will defer to your expertise on whether we should actively accept resumes from cs at this time
i think the way to couch it is that we do not want to receive them at this time
but that they are free to check with us in a couple of months to see whether that has changed
that way
we aren't making it an absolute ban
thanks for the information
michelle
i certainly agree with the concept
it sounds like it gives us more flexibility
debi
your response should go as follows
i suggest doing it in writing
rather than an email that could be manipulated
if you have theri fax number
that probably would be best
also
i suggest that we ask cs not to identify us as a reference or to use our name in any type of advertising or publicity materials
we prefer to keep our vendor list private
dear ms
poss
thank you for your written request for a reference on contracting solutions
it is not our practice to provide references for contracting agencies
i would suggest that you contact another company that does business with contracting solutions to obtain the information you seek
i am sure that contracting solutions can provide you with alternatives
by the way
i spoke with jennifer cronin
who had referred your call to me
she indicated that you had identified contracting solutions as the subject matter of your request
sincerely yours
debi vanwey
hoyt
i have reviewed the attached
i think it looks good
it strikes the balance of welcoming and also letting them know that changes will occur in the future
kriste
any other thoughts
michelle
i have not prepared one and am not aware of one in place
that is why i prefaced my comments with that
randy's email made it sound like there was one
sorry i'm not more help on this
michelle
patrick
do you have any comments to this
michelle
i'd suggest finding otu more information
my inclination would be not to accept the contractor
gina
have we figured out what happened here
i haven't heard anything in a while
michelle
as you know
we have another power plant project
if i haven't forwarded information to you yet
i will be doing so in the next day or so
the schedule is for preliminary diligence to be completed by 0/0
data room is open 0/0
attached to the email i will be sending you is a list of the current information we have here
lots of documents are here
please review the data list and forward to me which ones you want copied
and i will coordinate that process
the stock purchase agreement draft will be circulated next week
michelle
sure
dick is an outside consultant
his name is dick jeanerette
his number is 0-0-0
thanks
and have fun in ma
michelle
fyi
it sounds like they now are organized about the process in new york
michelle
andrea
you are right
i remember that you wanted to be included
but somehow
as i was trying to get away for vacation
i failed to remember to tell twanda
who was setting up the meeting
i apologize for the oversight
it was not intentional
i will make sure that you are included in any subsequent meetings
i am sorry about this one
basically
the discussion revolved around the purpose of the prc
is it a compensation system or a feedback system
because the process tries to address both
there is a tension between the organization's interests
comp
promotion
etc
and that of the employee
feedback
development
etc
this tension is really reflected by the current categories and descriptors and the fact that we have a comparative rating system
this tension has given people lots of heartburn
to address this tension and to provide an immediate tweak that doesn't create too much change
gina is going to draft new descriptors that reflect that comparative nature and also that reflect a more consistent view of how we evaluate employees
the preference was to go to numbered categories instead of a descriptor because of the possible disconnect between the descriptor and the comparative rating
for example
a
strong
performer really could be excellent
but compared to others in the group
ended up in the third category
for this reason
the descriptor identifiers were found to be problematic
also
there will be a revamping of the explanations of the categories to get away from the old
hr
language
for example
a category 0 performer would have a descriptor that said something like
always raises the bar
franchise player
etc
rather than a
hr
definition relating to demonstrating criteria
also
people had the view that needs improvement and issues probably should be collapsed because there wasn't much difference between the two
there was a general discussion about whether going to numbers made it seem more competitive
also
there was discussion about the fact that the prc appeared to be a
black box
and the desire to explain and communicate more about the process
this was only the first meeting
i will make sure that you are invited to attend any subsequent ones
and i apologize for the first one
let me know if you have any questions
michelle
fyi
michelle
david
hello
i hope all is well with you
i was out last week on holiday and am just now getting back into the swing of things
alan and i have spoken about your contract
and i am getting in touch with the cu lawyers to work on an appropriate form for australia
i will be keep you apprised of the status
have a good weekend
michelle
privileged and confidential felicia
would you please run a disparate impact analysis for the proposed stock options to be granted within enron net works
i would like this data for the purpose of giving legal advice
thank you
michelle
i think that gathering this information at interview makes the most sense
obviously
new hire orientation is too late
i prefer an original
signed document
but a fax is an ok substitute
provided that the applicant mails us the originals after faxing
thanks
mhc
i agree
thanks for letting them know about my contact
i emailed them the form
so we should be on our way
michelle
gina
i will leave this to your discretion
i agree that the od&t people could help us in the communication/training side of any changes that are made
comp
probably will not be affected much
since needs improvement and issues both are no bonus/no merit categories
thanks
michelle
hoyt
under the older workers benefits protection act
we must provide demographic information to persons over the age of 0 who are offered severance packages in exchange for a release
we need the title/position and the age of the persons holding those positions for the persons who were offered a package as well as the persons who were not offered a package
we will provide this data to persons over 0 to validate their releases
thanks
michelle
brian
pat mackin requested that i forward this on to you
i think he has a good idea here to look at a process for rif selection
currently
it is done on an ad-hoc basis
with plans being prepared for each situation
pat
do you still have a copy of the one you prepared a while back
it would be an excellent start
thanks
michelle
sheryl
sorry
i had the wrong email address
here is the resend
michelle
i hadn't heard about alex's offer
that is great
he is such a nice guy
i'll send details on hen night later
michelle
please print this and attachment for me
thanks
mhc
here are the latest
michelle
fyi re
lutz
mhc
rick
it sounds like this may satisfy cure
but i question whether this is an appropriate payment
i would want to touch base with the lawyers working on the deal to find out if there are any implications
any other feedback
michelle
hoyt
actually
we need only the new york office
other locations should not be included
thanks
michelle
fyi re
crane
michelle
fyi re
crane
pat
thanks for the update
by the way
did you talk with fran mayes
who went to the management presentations last week
she may have some of the missing information
dee
you might want to check with her for data
thanks
michelle
hello
girls
if stacey can do it
so can i
here are the latest pictures of cameron
these were taken right before the baptism of my sister's third
can you believe it
child
so he is all dressed up
i hope all is well with everyone
love
michelle
andrea
brian and i were talking about the dissemination of this policy
it seems as if it should come from your group and go out globally
what do you think
michelle
hoyt
here is a privileged and confidential legal memorandum regarding the garden state modification of operations
let's discuss these issues tomorrow or friday
michelle
please see the note below
which was forwarded to me by richard sanders
on triple lutz
michelle
cpage
would you please forward this directly to pat
pat
for your information
chris tomko has resigned from gsp
gsp has hired a consultant
hoyt thomas
who has been working as an enron hr consultant for a few weeks
to handle interim hr responsibilities until gsp hires a new hr person
i suspect that you will be involved in a lot of advice/counselling in the next few weeks as this transition occurs
if you are available on friday
i would like to have a phone introduction of you and hoyt
would you please call my assistant
twanda sweet
at 0-0-0
to let her know your availability so that she can set up a conference call
thanks a lot
twanda
would you please set this up when pat calls
michelle
great
andrea
shall we discuss rollout asap
thanks
michelle
roberto
these are good questions
and
in fact
are ones to which i am not certain of the answer
at least for #0
let's get together next week to discuss the specifics of how this program works and then determine the issues
twanda
would you please set up this meeting for me
thanks
michelle
bob
there also are legal issues to address
so i appreciate your keeping me in the loop as this evolves
thanks
michelle
chuck
do we have a rescheduled date for the deposition of the plaintiff
given the correspondence i've been receiving about rescheduling other depositions
we probably should set forth a date in nov/dec and get a protective order from the court stating that it cannot be rescheduled
otherwise
even if we do
agree
on dates
there likely would be additional delays
i am ready to hear what this guy has to say about my client
let me know your thoughts
thanks
michelle
drew
you are right on
i do have the concerns raised in your prior email
but i did not want to commit those to writing
i have asked to be kept in the loop
and will provide that input as needed in a meeting setting
thanks
michelle
ginger
i cannot attend that meeting
as i am in another
i will be out of the office the rest of the week
so check with twanda sweet
my assistant
for rescheduling options
thanks
michelle
mary
yes
it merely is a form issue
sharon and kriste have consolidated those paragraphs in their form
i will follow suit in mine to minimize confusion and to keep the
one template
concept intact
michelle
i also want to be included in this discussion
but i do not want to commit my thoughts to writing
so
count me in
michelle enron north america corp
andrea
i am supposed to follow up and work on our action plan for data integrity
however
i know that you are going to meet with david/robert on the whole concept and that you proposed a work around for the near term after our sessions
it appears as if our action plans will depend on the results of that meeting
i will be out of the office on wed-friday on business
it looks like our action plan revisions are due on friday
but
if necessary
i'll ask for an extension because of my travel
in the meantime
you can meet with david/robert and begin to look at revamping our prior efforts
alternatively
you can reconvene the group and work on revising action plans without me
i am not sure how helpful i am in any event
what do you think
michelle ps
do we need to include don in our group
twanda
please print for me
including attachments
thanks
michelle
sharon
kriste
and i discussed this
and agreed that simple was better
we also thought that a reference to the enron employee data protection policy and the code of ethics provisions on data should be referenced
with a link
if possible
thanks
michelle
mary
i won't be able to call her until next week because i'm going to be out/tied up the rest of this week
i am fine if you want to call her
my only caution would be that you give her data only about our structure
not why we set it up the way we did or anything else that would be privileged and confidential
the structure itself would not be privileged
only our strategies and basis for setting it up that way would be
if you don't mind a delay in the return call
i'll do it next week
just let me know
thanks
michelle
i would suggest working through sheila knudsen and the compensation council to get this done enron-wide
let me know if that isn't successful
thanks
michelle enron north america corp
no
just hold on
we're waiting for final settlement documents from reliant
with the ajello release
michelle
please print for me as well as attachemnts
thanks
mhc
tweanda
please print this and save as a form
then
put the print out in the merger
acquisition
and divestitures notebook on myu credenza
just stick it inside there
thanks
mhc
amy
this looks fine
except i would delete the provision about exceptions
because there really are none
thanks
michelle
here are comments from tom moore regarding the proposed services agreement
i will circulate the draft ssd this week
as always
i welcome additional feedback from the user groups
michelle
kay
0/0 works for me at 0:0
if that date doesn't work
would you please include my assistant
twanda sweet
on the distribution
given that i will be out at the law conference for the rest of the day and tomorrow
thanks
michelle
gerry
this is too cryptic for me
what was decided
i'd like to go to the next meeting
thanks
michelle
david
i will have this re-reviewed by oregon counsel
but it was scrubbed about 0-0 months ago as being enforceable
thanks
michelle
bill
i had asked twanda to get a conference call with you and dana davis on williams
i hope that happened
i would like to have a petition ready early next week
it will be lawsuit only
not injunctive relief
i believe ajello will be finalized this week
i sent our signed version to reliant last week
and i hope to have it signed by ajello soon
once that happens
we can dismiss
thanks
michelle
gina
i am not sure that the
satisfactory
descriptor is accurate
met
expectations probably does not fit the average person's view of a person in satisfactory
perhaps
met most
but not all
or something like that would be more accurate
where are we on the total revamp
has that been postponed until next year
thanks
michelle enron north america corp
davie
meets many
but may have some developmen needs works just fine
i just don't want people to say someone is satisfactory and meets requirements when
in fact
there are developmental needs that are obvious when compared to persons in strong
so
i am happy with your proposal
although i suggest that your second proposal does not meet the
fairly up
goal
cheers
mich
i have sent a mark-up of this to dave
let's talk tomorrow around 0:0
michelle
fyi
michelle
here are the schedules
mhc
do we have a rule against heaters
if not
that seems to be the easiest solution
as well as the
dress warm
advice
i think that moving him would not be good
his isolation could work against our goals here
your thoughts
michelle
thanks
i look forward to your thoughts and comments
michelle
steve
i hope that i did not educate her too well
it was great to see you
and be sure to let me know if you can use my help in the future
michelle
i'm here til 0:0
when meetings begin
thanks
mhc enron north america corp
kay
i will be out attending a seminar
but
don't hold it up for me
thanks
michelle
all is fine
no disparate impact in the selection
but
i still would like to see data about why certain persons were selected
thanks
michelle
ben
there should be a standard form for this
check with candace
if not
let me know
michelle
cathy
what do we want to do with regard to paskoff
remember
we were waiting until this week to respond to his requests for additional consideration
please let me know
thanks
michelle
cathy
also
for persons over 0 who are signing waivers
we must provide them with the census data about persons under 0/over 0 who were offered a package
as well as their title and age
please make sure that happens
or our waivers will not be valid
thanks
michelle
fyi
also
i never heard back from ilya's lawyer
did he sign
thanks
michelle
jim
fyi
the second link here is about workers
comp insurance in california
michelle
clark
thank you
i received this and will look over your comments
if i have any questions
i'll give you a call
i appreciate being included
michelle
cathy
let's talk about the outstanding issues on monday so that we can wrap these up
thanks
michelle enron north america corp
dave
is this the proposed
revised policy that oler is working on
the reason i ask is that oler is revising all enron policies right now
and i think that the harassment prevention policy is being revised as well
i'd just as soon we use the latest and greatest instead of the one that is soon to be replaced
check with valeria hope or susan tosoni about the status
thanks
michelle enron north america corp
no
i have not sent any information
i doubt that hoyt has
either
you send them the information before they sign
i would just do a cover memo and references the agreement
where there is a specific provision about receipt of information
thanks
mhc enron north america corp
what about paskoff
his lawyer is calling me
michelle enron north america corp
twanda
would you please schedule a meeting with me
hector
sheila w
and brian schaffer re
follow up to the bashen information
i would like to have this group discuss how to close the loop with sally's employees and implement any recommendations for follow-up
i think the meeting with last approximately 0 0/0 hours
thanks
michelle
please print this and save it to my document list
thanks
michelle
i agree with your assessment
thanks
michelle
sounds fine to me
michelle
those look good
has sheng already signed
let me know
also
we need an answer on paskoff
his lawyer called again
thanks
mhc enron north america corp
i suggest contacting peggy banzak for a contact in mexico
michelle
dave
why don't you send it to steve for review
the consultant doing the training will be working from this
when do we want to set up the training
our lawyers are ready to go
thanks
michelle
anne
i have reviewed the p&s agreement for triple lutz
from my perspective
it generally looks fine
i have a few comments
and invite pat mackin to add any he may have
in particular based on his review of section 0.0
in section 0.0
c
iv
there is a reference to any contract obligations
i believe this would include employment contracts
which do not appear to be identified specifically on any schedule unless the annual amount exceeds $0k
we may want to clarify that the disclosures are consistent with the provisions of section 0.0
iii
section 0.0 provides that we will not enter into any employee benefits not required by law
however
given that closing is pushed out so far in the future
we may want the flexibility to provide incentive bonuses for key personnel to stay with the company through closing
this may be done with the buyer's consent
but we may be tying our hands
section 0.0
e
contains a similar restriction on making payments to officers/directors
in addition
section 0.0 states that we won't enter into or amend any employment contracts
we do not renew employment contracts at a single time
and the contracts of key personnel may expire
do we want to tie our hands and be prohibited from amending/extending the agreements
section 0.0
l
also prohibits the modification/amendment of contracts with employees
in section 0.0
the wording
other than environmental laws
suggests that we are not in compliance with environmental laws
rephrasing that sentence to refer to the provision of the agreement may be preferable
in section 0.0
d
we promise that we haven't provided any gift of any kind to customers
i don't think we can say that
given that we regularly host client development outings
e.g
rodeo bbq tickets
golf tourneys
etc
and provide enron goodies to people all the time
perhaps a limitation on de minimus gifts would be more accurate
also
a reference to our code of ethics may work here
in section 0.0
a
iii
does the $0k threshhold include only cash value
or does it include equity grants that vest over time
a reference to
cash
payments would clarify
given that people here are compensated by stock options/restricted stock that vest over time
in section 0.0
d
i am not sure whether this transaction accelerates vesting
pat
do you know
should section 0.0 be italicized
i have not seen the latest of the employee matters agreement
have the parties discussed arbitration in lieu of litigation in texas for the purposes of dispute resolution
anne
let me know if these comments need clarification or if you have any other questions
michelle
pat
i have reviewed this agreement and provided my comments under a separate email
i would appreciate your review of section 0.0 in particular
given your familiarity with the compensation plans and benefit plans
in terms of timing
your comments probably can go into the next draft
but if you have a chance to look at 0.0 today
it would be great
thanks a lot
michelle
here is a set of comments by pat mackin on the triple lutz agreement
cynthia/mary
do you have anything to add
michelle
please excuse the delay on this
if possible
i would like the following documents copied from the data room
woodland
tab no.'s 0-0
and 0 brunswick
tab no.'s 0-0
and 0 thanks
michelle cash
one other item
could you please request all employment contracts and change of control agreements
if any
thank you
michelle
karen
does sean have his art on a web site anywhere
i have someone who wants to look at it
michelle
andrea
this looks good
i have two nits
first
the street value of our phone book is $0k
not $0
also
loosing
people should be
losing
people
one other risk is that the descriptions of what people are doing could reveal confidential business strategies to our competitors because there is no filter on what employees can/can't put
in other words
if an employee is working on developing something within enron that our competitors do not know about
expertfinder could provide them with that data/strategy
one other recommendation
by scott
was to allow access only from an enron facility
not remotely
this would manage risk of a person taking a laptop to a competitor and also would protect against hackers
given that employee talent is a major asset
we should find ways to move that talent around while also protecting it from being picked off from the outside
thanks
michelle
drew
louise and robert have brought me into the loop on the employee in london who has had some issues
i would appreciate it if you would fax me a copy of his agreement
i will be out of the office tomorrow
so
if possible
could you fax it to my house first thing in the morning
0-0-0 is the fax number
if you send it around 0:0 am houston time
then i can have time to review it and incorporate its provisions into the draft correspondence that i will prepare on this topic
i am going to be attending a seminar out of the office starting around 0:0 am houston time
i will prepare draft correspondence and circulate it to you
robert
and louise for comment and dart-throwing
i can be reached via my cell phone during the day at 0-0-0
thanks
drew
michelle
here is the attachment
thanks for the update on delainey
michelle
drew
thanks
i got it
i'll be sending out an email on this in the next couple of hours
i'll send it to you and robert first
you can run it by chapman and/or outside counsel in london today
if everyone is in agreement as to the approach
we can send it to louise asap
more to come
michelle
fyi
michelle
hector
we need to check with kriste sullivan on this
i have a vague recollection about a group of employees going to dynegy
and we had to send a demand letter to prohibit the improper use of enron information
she was involved
so could you please send her the email you sent to me
then
we can discuss a strategy
thanks
michelle
david
i believe the agreement was signed
it would have been a corporate services agreement
i believe that shonnie daniel or steve van hooser worked on this
i have cc'd this email to them so that they can provide you with a copy
forward it on to the appropriate person
or let me know if one never was signed
in which case i can prepare a new version
thanks
michelle enron capital management
here is the latest
michelle
fyi
particularly the part about the performance management system
let's see what kind of data we can get about the microsoft evaluation system to find the differences
thanks
michelle
would you let me know which you choose
i may need some of them as a backup
michelle
i have a copy of the signed employee services agreement between bridgeline and ena
would you like a copy of it
michelle enron capital management
sure
i'll send letters
the one for paskoff will go out today
michelle enron north america corp
amy
this is way late
so sorry
i suggest running it by the hr leadership team
the email list can be obtained from gerry gibson at corp
if there are hr openings
and she would be interested
they would most probably be the best people to assess her skills
thanks
michelle enron north america corp
nathan
ted bland is the enron wholesale person responsible for all recruiting for one of the business units i support
i actually spoke with ted today about you
he is working on scheduling you for a meeting
but he has had some difficulty in finalizing schedules
so
there is no need to follow up
because he will get with you in a few days
hope all is well
michelle
please print this and attachments
thanks
mhc
dee
i assume that you will go through these documents for benefits/plan issues and then send relevant ones to pat this week
if that is not your plan
let me know
thanks
michelle
craig
i spoke with fran mayes about being the hr person for the leaf river site visit
and she is planning to go
michelle
anne
would you please re-send me the employee matters agreement for lutz
i have deleted my electronic copy and need to send it on to the hr people
thanks
michelle
my understanding now on this is that we are talking about the bridgeline deal
in that deal
enron and texaco both assigned employees to work for the bridgeline entity
it is done under a secundment arrangement
and the employees are sent there via an assignment letter
pat
you may recall that we visited about this process a while back
although i may not have given you the transaction name at the time
so
currently
all enron personnel assigned to bridgeline actually are enron employees
i am not aware of any change to that structure
fran
do you know of any changes
are we now going to transfer all of those employees to the bridgeline entity
those answers would help
michelle
here is the agreement for lutz
michelle
andrea
would it be possible to update our list to show the current progress on the
0 days
items
i think you have a better handle on the timelines than i would
thanks
michelle
marty
gracie presas is asking about training for ena for harassment
as we discussed
i think it would be a good idea to offer several sessions to enron global wholesale and enw
to maximize efficiency
so
i told her to call you
the lawyer contact on this is kerry notestine at littler mendelson
his number is 0-0-0
thanks
michelle
i am not at all surprised
michelle
here is pricing information about harassment prevention training
feel free to call kerry directly about his availability
michelle
david
i am in agreement with you on this
this week
we lost an agreement that had options to be granted
it did not make it to the administrative committee until 0 months after signing
and only because the employee came forward and asked about her grant
luckily for us
the strike price was better/lower
if it had been the other way around
we may have had a much bigger issue
michelle
yes
thanks
i was aware of that joyous news
i am going to see if i can get a copy of the petition to review all the allegations in detail
thanks
michelle enron north america corp
how about this
any future grant/payment described on this worksheet is subject to appropriate committee approvals and previously-defined performance standards
the use of the term
guaranteed
on this worksheet does not modify the terms and conditions of any such payment/grant
too wordy
michelle
thanks
what about the cobra amounts
are they correct
i will be glad to close this one out
too
michelle enron north america corp
hi
trang
i would like to have a little more information about this
who is she sending emails to
when were they sent
have all the bills been paid
etc
thanks
michelle
please save as a form and print for me
i'll revise then
thanks
michelle
pat
here is the latest psa draft for a we've agreed to pay $0mm of the severance
we also have agreed to pay the cost of 0 bonuses
on options
there is a proposal for enron to supervest the employees
options at closing
can we agree to that
i didn't think so
your comments would be appreciated
michelle
pat
hello
i am sending to you a memo from stuart zisman here at enron
he has a question that i am forwarding to you
since i don't know the answer
would you please give him an answer today
if possible
thanks a lot
michelle
fran
i think we should get together tomorrow to discuss the issues around this deal
could you get with twanda to do that
thanks
michelle
fyi
michelle
dave
i left you a voice mail that i am available to assist in this process at your convenience
let me know how you want to proceed
michelle enron capital management
sorry about the earlier email
the following contains a summary of high-level employment/labor issues based upon the review of the documents in the data room here in houston
we still need to have a conference call with the hr team at gp to ascertain the climate of labor relations and other employment issues
woodland 0
employment claims
in the list of insurance matters
there are several employment-related claims
those include sexual harassment allegations
disability discrimination
retaliation
and mistreatment
it is unclear whether those are ongoing claims or not
i would question whether the mill has had harassment prevention training
and if so
when
also
are there other employment claims that are not identified in the documents
0
labor union matters
rick johnson is going to review the collective bargaining agreements
i am waiting on a list of union grievances
which is supposed to be forwarded to me today
0
i saw nothing about employment contracts
change of control agreements
or other documents that may require a buyer to provide benefits after closing for either woodland
leaf river 0
litigation summary
the company provided a summary of litigation
three of the four are personal injury claims
one is a fall down stairs by a delivery person
settled on 0/0/0
another is a contract employee who was injured when a propane truck on a forklift exploded in his face
and the third is another contract employee who fell down some stairs
settled 0/0/0
the fourth is a race discrimination claim from 0
which has been on hold due to the plaintiff's bankruptcy
the summary states that the corporate law department has more details about the personal injury claims
we may want to obtain more detailed information as we proceed in this transaction
are there other litigation matters or pending claims
e.g
eeoc
0
no employment contracts
i saw nothing about change of control agreements or other documents that may require a buyer to provide post-closing payments
0
workers comp
there are several workers comp claims for 0 and 0
i would suggest that our risk/insurance groups review these claims to make sure that they are not unusual
dee lenfest is going to review the material on employee benefits and should provide a separate analysis on that topic
michelle
laura
do you need any more information from me on this point
michelle
david
the
gardening leave provision would apply beyond the term
i will make your tweak to 0.0
i checked the 0-months with clayton utz
and they thought it was ok
i'll forward a new draft in the next day or so
hope you had a good trip back
should that be 0 months or 0 months
we haven't done less than three
and i don't think it is a good idea to go below that
mhc
felicia
does this sound right to you
just wanted to confirm
thanks
michelle
pat
thanks for your comments
i agree 0%
michelle ps
my friend who is a photographer is doing a show in dallas this week
i suspect that we'll see info on his web site pretty soon
tim
i just got your letter about the january trial setting
when did we learn of that setting
how do we accomplish the goal of keeping our business people free from depositions at year-end
can that be done

could you please forward to steve van hooser our usual checklist on employee matters for diligence purposes
that would be helpful
thanks

anne
i got you an invitation to the preview party for wednesday
eden sholeen is going to call you with the details
michelle
felicia
this is a merchant asset
which we currently own 0%
but plan to sell down in the coming months
it absolutely has separate hr functions from enron
they do not participate in enron benefits
and we are working hard to prevent any claims that we could be a joint employer with it
thoughts
michelle enron north america corp
kathy
i think we should do some sort of an assignment agreement
it does not have to be as long and involved as our current ones
but we should paper it up
michelle
cheryl
i am taking 0/0 off as a vacation day
so
let's play
i have a hair appointment saturday
which i cannot really change this late in the year
so
do you want to get a haircut
manicure
or anything else beautifying while you are here
if so
i'll book something for you
there is no way we would have you babysit
in fact
we have a sitter for saturday night
so we can go somewhere fun for dinner and maybe even see a movie or do anything else you may want to do
i can't wait for your visit
michelle
dear gerald
i received and reviewed your email
and i will check with my clients on your proposal
i expect that i will have an answer later this week
i understand that my assistant has sent you the documents by email
let me know if you did not receive them
feel free to give me a call to discuss
michelle cash
cindy
tim
marly
pam
and neil
i will make my house available for you do do the first week of laundry this weekend
how about 0:0 am on saturday
after that
you can schedule it at your convenience for the rest of the 0 weeks
i am prepared for you
i bought tide
downey
and bounce
as well as spray starch for all the ironing that needs to be done
don't worry
i only have 0-0 full-sized tablecloths and about 0 of trey's shirts to be ironed
that shouldn't take too long
see you then
michelle
go ahead and file it
thanks
michelle
on lunch
i've asked twanda to reschedule
thanks
mhc
for your entertainment
mhc
hector
i met with david baumbaugh today about bridgeline
apparently
we have sent trey logan over there to replace o'neal winfree
we thus need to do an assignment letter for logan
could you please provide me and twanda with the particulars so that we can paper it up
thanks
michelle
here is the latest piece of information
michelle
looks good to me
mhc
yes
we will reword it
in fact
we are looking at a review of the entire application
michelle
any interest in either of these candidates
they are presented by a headhunter
let me know
michelle
janie
has peggy been hired yet
if not
would you please forward me her resume again
thanks
michelle
fran
any word from nancy
thanks
michelle
bill
i'll be in tomorrow
let's discuss this matter
thanks
michelle
for amps
here are the hr questions for diligence
michelle
hector
we do not know the details of how this will work
it has not been finally decided
i would suggest that we remain vague about the whole thing until the deal
if it happens
is signed
michelle enron north america corp
you should have it
i sent it yesterday
michelle twanda
could you confirm
thanks
mhc
fyi
does this give you enough information
mhc
dan
here is info on amps
some of these points should be included in deal documents
michelle
dorie
i think this looks good
i have two tweaks
on the
let me be clear
sentence
i'd delete the
let me be clear
introduction
i think the last sentence speaks for itself
in the last sentence
why not conclude by saying that if they don't pay
we will have no choice but to take further action on this matter
and delete the reference to attorneys
let me know if you have any questions
otherwise
it is good to go
good luck
michelle
this is great
can you believe all that is going on in sunny florida
i called nat/laura to get their take on the mayhem
but i haven't been able to talk with them
i got a voice mail from laura that jesse jackson was leading a demonstration up the street from their house
they are right in the thick of it
later
mhc
i thought you might get a kick out of this
michelle
i'll call you tomorrow
michelle
i'll take care of it today
michelle
tim
do you think these depositions will take a day apiece
or
can we schedule more than one in a day
let me know
so that i can arrange schedules
thanks for the update
good work
michelle
fyi re
california law
michelle
hoyt
if gsp llc would assume the liability at the time of return
why would it risk bringing them back for light duty work
why not wait until they are fully released
particularly if one of them is going to sue under workers comp scheme
also
hoyt
you need to be careful about revealing conversations with gsp counsel to mg
i noticed you had cc'd someone from media general in the prior email
we don't want to waive any privileges

attached is the resume of dominic carolan
who currently is working at global e&p
he is looking to move elsewhere within enron
given that the assets in global e&p are going to be sold
i understand that you are looking for a lawyer with oil and gas experience
he might be a good candidate
i met him today
and he is pleasant and professional
if you are interested in interviewing him
let me know
and i will get it scheduled
thanks
michelle
david
i think this point is moot for the time being because
as of last tuesday
we are not dealing with bidder d
i think it is ok legally to go this way
although there is potential liability under the warn act
the plant closing law
we probably can schedule around that exposure
though
by giving everyone who possibly may be affected 0 days
notice
practically
however
this would not be my favorite approach
i'd prefer it if we could have the ability to compete for top performers
but we should be able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and present for possible hiring by the buyer
i would like more information about what is meant by
ena does not interfere with
the offers made by the buyer
does that mean no counteroffers
to answer the question of whether we can bind all of enron
i would say that it is unlikely
unless we want to ask
it is easier to commit only the wholesale group
rather than ask corp
ees
broadband
etc
whether they will abide by the agreement
so i would recommend limiting it to that group
if possible
we may be able to include the pipelines
given that they have been involved in this transaction
let me know if you have any questions
michelle
julia
on garden state matters
how do you want to handle the signing of documents
currently
i have been receiving documents from outside counsel and initialling them before signature
based upon hoyt's email below
there may be a desire to have a more expeditious process
i would suppose the answer would depend on how heavily our legal department is going to be involved in gsp work
given our discussion last week
i would not think that there would be a desire to deviate significantly from the standard enron process
but it is not my call
i would appreciate your thoughts
michelle
charles
if this is for london
then we generally ask jon chapman
attorney over there
to review things
let me know if that is the case
michelle
gracie
based upon my brief review of her comments
many are not acceptable
without a convincing explanation
i am not going to delete entire sections of our agreement
particularly when those sections protect enron
please get with her
not by copy of this privileged email
and ask for reasons why she wants the changes
thanks
michelle
i wasn't sure you'd know who sent it
but good guess
trey was quite pleased with himself
later
michelle
felicia
i am going to take a vacation day on friday
how about thursday or monday
twanda
ignore my earlier email
michelle
thanks
i frequently pick up my first job after i complete my second shift at home

i hadn't heard anything for a few days
and i knew we were on a tight time frame
thanks

please ask kristen walsh if they can find him in dallas
then
let's re-send it
thanks
michelle enron north america corp
was clonch deposed
what did he say
michelle
hello
everyone
please let me know which of these dates works best for you
it would be most helpful if you give me a range of available dates for both preparation and the deposition itself
that way
i can find overlapping dates on which you all are available
thanks a lot
michelle
thanks
dan
we will work to accommodate your schedule
thanks
felicia
the same information appeared in today's dlr
michelle enron north america corp
peter
i learned yesterday for the first time about project canary
which involves the purchase of an asset that employs 0 employees and also has a unionized workforce
i understand that we are in the second round
and that there is a deadline of 0/0
peter
we have discussed on numerous occasions the need for you to get me involved early whenever there are transactions involving personnel issues
you haven't involved me in this deal
i learned about the fact that there are employees and unions from my clients in hr
that makes me and the legal department look bad and also does not allow me to provide the best service for enron
please provide me with information about this deal asap
and
i repeat my request to get me involved earlier on future deals
thank you
michelle
thanks for the info
i just need simple
basic frames
no decorations or anything
that way
they can go anywhere
and aren't specific to a decor
theme
time of year
etc
so
painted wood or black resin probably are the best
i could use 0x0
the most
trey is going to get playstation 0 once they become available
so you may want to find a game for the new machine
also
since it has a dvd player attached
he will need dvds to play on it
i already got him being john malkovich and the grinch
but he has no others
we are looking forward to your visit
trey
cameron and i are going to the nutcracker ballet on the 0th
do you and marianne want to go
i am sure that kay would love to watch madison
and i would think that we still could get tickets if you are interested
let me know
see you later
michelle

0/0 is ok
not the 0th
i am available at 0:0 wednesday
i agree that we should convene and discuss
i would be surprised if we have grounds to challenge
but we can keep our fingers crossed
if we don't
then we could discuss strategy for negotiations

thanks so much for extending your business trip to visit us in houston
i had a blast with you being here
i hope that you didn't get sick
i'd feel awful if you did
i still have the sniffles
but managed to avoid the worst of it
so far
cameron perked right up after the antibiotics kicked in
he is his usual self today
happily
he was kind of a pest this weekend
you really saw him at his worst
unfortunately
we watched how the grinch stole christmas today on the cartoon network
and he was happy as can be
i hope you can manage the february trip and weren't frightened off by the rough time here last weekend
when we're not sick
we're really much more fun
besides
the pig races await
gotta go

michelle enron north america corp
dee
what do you think
i suggest that we let them handle that
but defer to your opinion
thanks
michelle
here are others who want to interview carlos
i tell you what
before you schedule any of these
let me talk with carlos first to see where his interests lie
keep these names
and i'll keep you posted on who to schedule with him
thanks
michelle
alan
he's out of town until friday
so i will schedule early next week with you and dan
others are interested as well

michelle
cathy
do we have an answer on cirino
thanks
michelle
finley
can we schedule a conference call with the hr folks at celgar
thanks
michelle
i haven't heard anything from alice yet
mhc
what about payrolling through an agency so that he is on a contract-to-hire basis
that way
we can say that the intent is to hire
but that we are evaluating the situation before making a regular
full-time offer
customers understand contract-to-hire concept
so it may not raise
lack of commitment
jitters
what do you think
michelle
more re canary
more
i've forwarded this issue to dee
mhc
fyi re
outside counsel in b.c
who are handling diligence
i spoke with dean today
and he appeared to be asking all the right questions
mhc
molly
could you please forward the
thanks
but no thanks
template letter to me
i will send it to her since she interviewed
for persons who don't interview
i think the
no thanks

thanks for all your work for the travel club
i never make a meeting

etc
one question i have is whether enron has any special relationships with disney
are we a corporate client of disney
my old law firm had some sort of relationship with disney that let us get great deals
early entry into the parks
etc
so it may be worth looking into
thanks again
michelle cash
please print this and attached and put in the project canary due diligence file
thanks
michelle
fyi
michelle
maybe
he was in today and met with mark taylor
travis

to positive results
i certainly could ask him if he's interested in trading
leslie hansen thinks highly of him
michelle
looks good to me
thanks
michelle
hello
an ena employee wrote a book that was published in russia
there have been three editions
and the publisher wants her to do a 0th
the topic is technical analysis
which is what she does here at enron
in this 0th edition
she will be using public data
her own pc
and working on her own time
however
given that she has been at enron for 0 months
she obviously would apply some of the knowledge she has gained here in the revision of the book
she would not divulge any enron confidential or proprietary information
however
what are your thoughts on whether she could be able to do this
she is willing to let enron be a co-author
although as a practical matter
i do not think that would be worthwhile
my opinion at this point is that she can do it
so long as it is on her own time and using her own resources
and
of course
provided that she reveals no enron-specific information
i welcome your perspective
however
given that this is a new one to me
thanks for your thoughts
michelle
sure
twanda
would you please forward
thanks
michelle
thank you
michelle
sounds fabulous
see you friday
is a place/time confirmed yet
please calendar
thanks
mhc
sure
you could ask
i think that kriste's draft was prepared before my draft
which i sent to rosen in executable form
britt
by copy of this email
i'll ask twanda to send you the copies from my file here
thanks for the update
michelle
shanna
we certainly can hire and manage him out if the performance is not there
do we not think he'll be a good performer
michelle
peter
here are preliminary comments from pat mackin on the psa
michelle
mark
the pay equity issue sounds like the reviews we do every year to ensure that people are being paid equitably
given that the company has until november of next year to get in compliance and to report out on the compliance issue
it should be no big deal
unless there currently are pay inequities
a list of persons in each job
with salary and gender
could allow us to determine whether an issue even exists
michelle
please calendar for me
thanks
you also should attend if you are interested
michelle

michelle
richard
my thought is that the first sentence is ok
but not the second
and bonnie is conveying that to mcconville's lawyer
mhc
hello
everyone
no need to work on canary any more
it is off
i would suggest that you save your work in the event that it is revived
but it doesn't look like it is going to happen any time soon
michelle
my understanding is that the deal is dead
stop the presses
thanks for all of your help on this
i appreciated your efforts and explanations
perhaps we will work together again in the future
michelle
go ahead and initial it
i assume that there are no changes
michelle
candace
you are right
there is no need to send a second letter since we didn't base our decision on the background check results
michelle
i don't do ebs
but i have asked kriste sullivan to send me the info you requested
you also may want to check with shelly pierce in ebs compensation to see what she knows
michelle
roberto
if a person is accessing inappropriate web sites in the course of investigations
it does not violate the policies
however
it may be useful to set up protocols or logs to confirm when a person is accessing it for investigative purposes to remove all confusion on the matter

hi
felicia
as i told cindy
there is no easy way for me to determine which contracts i have done in the past are for corporate versus other business units
i simply don't organize my documents that way
instead
i do a numeric list of documents
and the documents are identified by employee name
as opposed to business unit
as of now
i have over 0 documents on that list
so
i can't easily pull out corporate agreements
i can say that most of the corporate agreements i have done have been for rac or finance
so sheila walton probably has kept track of them somehow
the others most likely were at vp or above level
so i think they have been captured by corporate comp
i hope that gives you information
even if it doesn't provide exactly what you are looking for
let me know if you have questions

employment contracts in my new roll in compensation
i am trying to get comfortable that we have all the employment agreements up-to-date in the corporate compensation database so that we can ensure that payments are made in a timely matter and contracts are looked at for renewal in the same timely manner
what would help us tremendously is if we could get copies of all the contracts you produce for corporate employees both vp and above and below vp so we can make sure they are entered into the compensation database
mary joyce's group enters the vps and above but cindy ward and i are responsible for making their payments under the contracts
because of this
i want to make sure we have copies and do not miss anyone
as always
your help is very much appreciated
thanks

gina/david
i think we need to have some guidelines for these types of questions
my view is that we should encourage people to be contacted while out on leave to identify reviewers and submit a self-evaluation
presumably
if they have a click at home pc
they can do it from there
if not
we should be able to facilitate it manually
your thoughts
are you working on this

vicente
what is the status of our litigation in puerto rico
has there been a motion to remand
is anything scheduled in the next few weeks
have we received a scheduling order or a notice of rule 0 hearing
thanks for the update
michelle
thanks
kerry
that's what i thought
michelle ben
as we discussed
the regulations from the department of labor specifically allow the employment of 0 to 0 year olds in non-hazardous employment
the regulations
however
restrict employment to 0 hours in a week
0 hours in a day
and between the hours of 0:0 am to 0:0 pm
0 c.f.r
0.0
thus
don't take the interns to a power plant and don't work them past 0:0 or the hours indicated and you should be ok
let me know if you have any follow up questions

hi
kerry and rick
hope you are enjoying the employer
here

what are your thoughts

additional information on midwest power
your detective abilities would be appreciated
michelle

hi
janel
i thought that i initialed those already
if i didn't
i'll do it when i get back after my vacation next week
in the meantime
go ahead and forward them to the counterparty for signatures on both originals and then have someone at vp level sign for corp
if i didn't initial
you should get them initialed before giving them to the corporate officer
because company policy requires attorney initials on all legal documents before signature
once signed
the original goes to the vault
we can take care of that for you
i'll be out next week
but if you have questions
please call diane goode
who works in my group
she can either assist you or find someone else who can

consulting services agreement hi michelle
i received the two executable copies of the csa between enron and kds communications
i'm not sure what the next step is
should i overnight these to ken to sign and then receive them back and sign on this end and he gets one and we get one
and i'm assuming that no one else in legal has to sign off at this point
i thought linda glynn mentioned something about richard or someone else providing initials
just let me know
thanks
also does legal keep a copy or do we keep the contract with us
diane
would you please track this down and let cathy know that we'll respond asap when i return
or
you could have kriste respond
i do not remember seeing a letter from counsel
but it is possible that it fell through the cracks
thanks
michelle
please note and put in a file for me regarding enron aaps
that obviously will be of significance to me in my new role
thanks
mhc
as described in my prior email
here is a list of ludwin's transactions
let me know if you have any interest
michelle
kerry
we drove by your house
which looked like it took on some water
i hope all is ok
and that you didn't have too much damage
bellaire was hit pretty hard
on another note
if you are able to gather any more info on this midwest generation issue
would you please call jeff hodge in our legal department
twanda can connect you
i'll be on vacation this week and will return the 0th
thanks
michelle
diane
not a high priority
but would you please get with kim melodick and find out what the client group wants to do with the alonzo williams lawsuit
he never answered
and currently is in default
thanks
michelle
bummer about the flood insurance
of course
we had it and didn't need it
we also pulled up our rugs
moved furniture

had we not
the house surely would have flooded

re
midwest generation thanks for the message
we had about 0 inches of water in the house and we lost most of our flooring on the first floor
most everything else is ok
no flood insurance because we are not in the 0 year flood plain as you know
regarding midwest generation
i asked around with our chicago lawyers and did not find out anything
i have made some other contacts and will let you and jeff hodge
whom i have met
know if i hear about anything
littler mendelson
pc 0 chevron tower 0 mckinney street houston
texas 0 0.0.0
fax
yes
i should be involved
have you sent noel prior information
that is a close call
has he already called on the acquiring company
if so
then i would think it would be ok
if not
i don't think that he could contact his friends who used to be at novarco simply because they were acquired
that
to me
would violate the spirit of the affidavit language
particularly if richardson still will do business with the acquiring company through novarco
we could revisit this once the dust has settled after the acquisition to see if that approach still is warranted
michelle
would you please send rob cole here at enron a copy of our letter to eeoc for april
he doesn't need any of the attachments
thanks
michelle
twanda
would you please print
thanks
mhc
for my forms files
thanks
mhc
why does this person need expertfinder
i didn't get a specific reason from prior emails
if he needs to locate people
shouldn't peoplefinder do it for him
more information would be helpful in making the determination of whether to allow him access
thanks
michelle
would you please send janice priddy the blank short form
thanks
michelle
twanda
will you please handle this
add the inserts for the various items
michelle
i think we should call it a project bonus
not an incentive bonus
because our annual bonus plan is called the annual incentive plan
also
we usually use some other language
i'll ask twanda to send you our standard retention letter
michelle
no
it should remain the top 0 percent
because it is the top percentage of the criteria
not the peer group
thanks
michelle
do you know this person
please send her our standard confidentiality agreement that we attach to the consulting services agreement
ok to send it by email
thanks
mark
attached is a signed version of the consulting services agreement between enron and andersen consulting
now accenture
yevgeny frolov in hr is working on a project whereby accenture is developing software for enron
enron will own the content of the programs
and ultimately
licenses will be sold for the software
with enron and accenture sharing the royalty interest
i think that your expertise is needed on this agreement
i will send you a copy of the latest term letter
along with my handwritten comments on the draft
would it be possible to get your comments/thoughts on these
yevgeny will contact you directly
thanks
michelle
pursuant to my prior email
here is the draft term letter
i will forward my handwritten comments
thanks
michelle

i spoke with her and got this information

why don't we wait and share our revised policies with them

do you want to talk with this guy while he's in town

would you please find a copy of this and send to felicia

michelle
i think this is in your ballpark
not mine
i am happy to assist
although i think that this is kriste's world
i've passed this email on to her
and will assume that she has it covered
unless i hear otherwise
michelle
thanks
pat
it is only temporary
at least
that's what i keep insisting
i just learned about a new deal involving coal mines in wyoming or montana
i can't remember now
data room to be opened in denver on monday
i'll send you details asap and let you know if we may need to invite you along
would you be available
thanks
michelle
looks good to me
who will get them
i am happy to sit down with him in a privileged conversation and discuss those statistics
which i think is the best way to protect the privilege
otherwise
if it goes to him at his request
then there is no protection if we find undesirable results
hello
all
attached is an invitation from seyfarth shaw to attend their labor and employment seminar
it is scheduled for tuesday
0/0
and lasts only a half-day
generally
their seminars are high quality
plus
the cost is only $0
let me know if you plan to attend
michelle
i don't think that is a good idea
i like that better
when is that meeting
or
do we want to do that separately outside of the prc evaluation meeting
i'd check with oxley first
i kind of think they are separate issues
and i am not sure that the whole group needs to see the areas where we may have issues
mhc
absolutely
unless kerry plans to be nice to him
i can't attend
as i'll be out of the office in austin at a mediation
michelle
twanda
please send them hard copies of the invitation for seyfarth's seminar
thanks
mhc
how are we answering this type of question
oops
too efficient
please put in curran's files
i guess that i would look at this a bit differently
we are not penalizing a person for the cost of obtaining a visa
rather
it is the fact that he did not come through on his accepted offer and start to work for us that is the issue
does that matter
yes
it is redundant
no
but we have been meeting on this topic
we met early this week and are having a follow-up meeting next week
i will ask diane goode to include you by phone
if you want to attend
michelle
they are done and should be in your email today
mhc
congratulations
i know you are happy to have that wrapped up
michelle
great
let me know your feedback
also
say hi to ted meyer
who is my

bellaire neighbor

please use the non-vp form and not the form on which i have made the revisions
thanks
michelle
robin
diomedes was not eligible for severance because of outstanding expense reports
approximately $0k
i know that mary was involved in this to great detail
once the expense report issue is clarified
then he would be eligible for regular severance
mary and tim callahan have been coordinating those issues
michelle
lance
kim was here on friday
i have asked mark taylor for his thoughts
michelle
will do
i've asked diane to send you the legal advice we received
i've finalized the template today
and should have a draft out tomorrow
monday
michelle
no
this is not
i am curious as to how this got to you
i will give it a review and get back with you
freudian slip
i'm sure
see you tomorrow
michelle
fyi
see what you can find out about this
perfect opportunity to market oler's services
thanks mhc
fran
would you mind pulling the data for gsp on this
it is strange that we should be paying unemployment rates for gsp
since it is its own entity
separate and apart from enron
do you know anything about the other transactions
sure
sounds like a good plan to put the flag in personic to discuss the time limitations
other than the specific gas-related folks
i am not aware of a non-solicit of aep employees
i'll double check to confirm
though
mhc
alan
i understand that you have approved the request below
is this because they are wra personnel
thanks
michelle
fyi
with apologies if i already sent this to ya'll
the consent form should be kept in ph file
the background check results should be maintained separately
mhc
not a problem if the employee does not date it
the issue of signature by the company that the agreement is not fully executed until it is signed by company
mhc
kathy
we should go ahead and remove these people
they are employed by wra
which is in a transition process on a confidential matter
please remove them
thanks
michelle
looks fine with me
twanda
please handle
mhc
i've sent this to litigation unit
mhc
cathy
i have been getting this question a lot
it has been communicated to every employee that if they are in category 0
they will get a pip
therefore
i recommend putting one in place
if you are more comfortable
you can re-name it to reflect goals and objectives for the next review period
something like
performance objectives
or something to that effect
because it has been communicated that everyone will get a plan
we really should follow through
michelle
i believe that these involve issues of intellectual property and thus are more appropriately decided by you
in principle
i have no issue with enron indemnifying accenture for intellectual property litigation relating to content ownership
on the logo issue
i would have to defer to you and the pr/branding folks
michelle
who knows
i can't imagine that a customer would somehow owe insurance to the provider's employees
michelle
so
would we have an issue
please arrange as many of these as you can
michelle
this looks fine with me
michelle
please save as a mhc document
i think that some of this will be used for powerpoint for nepco trip next week
thanks
mhc
mike
would you please provide me information on which attorney is handling the nepco charge
i would like to obtain information from him and be
in the loop

i suggest that we ask valeria hope to investigate the fact situation here and report back to us jointly
what do you think

sounds great
i've asked twanda to set something up
mhc
valeria is looking into it
michelle
fyi
he tried to call me today
but missed me
i have returned his call and left a voice mail for him
i'll let you know if we have a chance to visit
michelle
thanks
but we got it from the vault late yesterday
michelle
thanks
i'll do an assignment letter formalizing the relationship
michelle
fyi
it looks like you are on the way to approval
until that time
if you have any excess capacity in terms of time
get with valeria on hr employee relations efforts
thanks

wayne perry has issues with the consulting agreement i drafted for him and wants to use a form that you drafted some time in the past
do you want to pick it up
by copy of this
i am asking twanda to send you a copy of the agreement we submitted for him
michelle
i'll be there
do we have a meeting with shankman for tomorrow
teresa
the employment lawyer at littler
mendelson is named kerry notestine
he is in the loop on this and has copies of the relevant agreements
i also will have emailed him my summary of the bob henderson agreement
so he is up to speed on where we are going from the employment arena
his number
in case you need an immediate response while i am at nepco next week
is 0-0-0
michelle
hi
david
i look forward to meeting with you this week when i visit nepco
i wanted to alert you to an osha investigation that was served on us here in houston
specifically
an employee named jason davis claims that he was fired from his job in jenks because he complained about unsafe conditions there
osha has sent a request for information
as it is going to conduct an investigation
have you heard of this
how would you like to handle it
we can discuss in more detail on thursday
michelle
pat
would you please give this a look and provide comments
thanks
michelle
diane
would you please send valeria the recent
positive
article on prc
thanks
michelle
pat
i think this isolates the employment-related comments for the brooklyn navy yard transaction
your comments would be appreciated
thanks
mhc
i don't know if you heard
but kim and i spoke with him
and he is ok with everything
i guess you can consider this one closed
except that i would appreciate it if you would complete a performance review on him and forward it to kim and me for review and placement in the file
thanks
sounds good to me
cameron sleeps in a real bed
but would be happy on the floor as well
no more cribs
yea
great news about the tix
we easily can have cam sit on our laps
so no need to get any great seats
if we can buy bleacher tickets to get him in the door
that works for us
we are so excited
will do
no
i know about that one and agree with you that it is critical
i just wanted to know when we were meeting with shankman
i'd like to have access
but i don't have access to
o
drive
can that be rectified
or is that beyond your role
i have not
i'll send a follow-up email today
absolutely
i agree that it would be great for you
i know we had some sensitivity in the past
let me check on it and get back with you
mhc
rick
i believe that this probably is a duplication of efforts
almost everyone has emailed me with that information already
pursuant to my prior request
i'll forward those to you for your information
i would like to institute some limitations on training for the group
due to costs and out-of-office considerations
but i have not finalized those recommendations yet
stay tuned
mhc
pat
i am keeping you busy these days
any comments on below
michelle
neither did i
i just got the comments yesterday
i'll review the issues on the plane today and provide comments
michelle
i'm handling the afternoon
i think that harry has this morning
mhc
here is the overview of bob henderson's employment agreement
what do you think
mhc
please send david lund copies of our standard corporate services agreement and the standard assignment letter
use bridgeline example
with and without non-compete
michelle
we're formatting one this week
and we'll send it when it's done
michelle
i agree also
but i don't know all the parties or complications involved
should there be a
groan
meeting on this
please calendar and print for my files on this meeting

let's talk tomorrow
thanks
michelle
let's discuss exactly what is involved here
confidentiality
etc

we just go by the terms in the agreement and attach a brief position description
let's meet with her and anyone else she would like to have attend

could you forward me the invitation or details
thanks
mhc
thanks
misha
how many are at a table
i've already got some folks who are interested
michelle
in my dealings with accenture
they have acted as if this is the agreement that governs them
i don't know which accenture group is involved
however
either way
i believe that it is time for an updated agreement
with better rates
have you been working with global strategic sourcing on this
i'll get it set up
michelle
indeed i will
mhc
david

also

good to see you this week

i enjoyed meeting you when i was in bothell last week
during our meeting
you indicated that you were going to put together a draft of the response to the osha charge and circulate a draft on wednesday
i haven't seen a draft
and i understand that the response deadline is today
perhaps you were able to obtain an extension
but i hadn't heard of that if you were
would you please let me know the status
thanks a lot
michelle
twanda is out today and monday
i'll do the best i can
please save these to a mhc document
i've got edits

dear grandmother
so sorry we didn't make it yesterday
we went shopping
and cameron hurt his finger while he was riding on the shopping cart
nothing major
but it distracted me so much that all other things left my mind
oops
he had to have a special kind of bandage
but it doesn't hurt him any more
so i think all is going to be ok
so
i apologize for not making it yesterday
hope all is well with you
ryan
i think we should have some draft answers for these
get with the mad team to see what kinds of answers we have given in the past on these types of questions

thanks for the good words
i appreciate your input
michelle
valeria
fyi
here are kudos from one of your clients
keep up the good work

i don't know
i think we've categorized them as severance
but maybe we should get with mackin
mhc
diane
i've left a message for brian bloom about this
would you please follow up
as he either didn't get my message or has not returned my call
basically
we did an incentive plan for enron investment partners
and now we want to dissolve it
would you ask him to provide a brief overview via email as to what it would entail
thanks
michelle
donna
i think this falls in your court
let me know if it should be handled elsewhere
thanks
michelle
please calendar
i'd like to go
let's discuss when we both can talk
mhc
here is the first part of kerry's email
mhc
i've received advice from vinson
elkins on this
which i will send your way
it looks like we can
mhc
pat
do you have any insight as to the question below
bridgeline is a jv between enron and texaco
currently
enron and texaco have been assigning employees to work for bridgeline
with no change in employment status
most employees rotate back to their
home
company within a few months
now
we are considering spinning off the entire arrangement and creating a separate entity
the assigned employees would be part of the transaction and would become employees of newco
how does that impact the question below
thanks
michelle
you are invited to sit at the enron table for the father of the year luncheon on august 0 at 0:0 at the hyatt regency
this event is a delightful one
where there are tributes paid to several
outstanding
fathers in the community
please let me know if you would be able to attend
pat
i hope you are feeling well
kidney stones sound painful
take care of yourself
michelle
twanda
please pull all emails on this subject matter out of my in box and print for the file

i believe that the answer will be to destroy the materials
but i am double-checking the research on that this afternoon
thanks

fyi
the attached article and story is disturbing and surprising about southern company
it also raises an issue that we could face if we are not careful
the article discusses internal diversity studies
which the plaintiffs are using as evidence to support their claims
the company claims that the studies were done by people who did not know how to conduct the appropriate analyses under the relevant legal standards
i have this concern here
as well
when we have people running analyses that do not factor in the legal standards and instead try to interpret data themselves
i would like to talk about how to manage that
let me know who you think should be included in such a meeting
and i'll set something up
thanks
michelle
so
my question goes to the highest bidder
of course
i was just giving you grief
hard to offend me
please print these for me
thanks
mhc
thanks
fyi
i've left him a message that it is
no problem
in this instance
but
i know that you were interested in having it reviewed before it went out
so i wanted to let you know what was happening
mhc
today
i received a demand from art bieser's attorney
he basically wants a year's pay
plus supervesting of options
which i told him was impossible
i have given fran a more detailed email with the specifics of his demand
let me know if you want to know the details
i suggest that fran and i get together monday with a proposed response
which we will run by you before responding to the demand
in any event
art will not be returning to the office at all
michelle
i have had some research done on the issue of what was found on the computers in the ecoelectrica offices
it looks like the best course of action is to destroy all of the identified materials
mere possession of these materials is a violation of law
our outside counsel called the fbi
which said that if the company does not know who put the materials out there
it does not have a duty to report it
we also received advice that the puerto rico office of the fbi might be able to assist in narrowing down the possible users to determine who actually was involved
our outside counsel suggested that we might want to call the local fbi office and talk with a duty agent
the number is 0-0-0
given the situation of the possible sale
however
we may choose not to take that route
in any event
if we don't report it
all illegal materials must be destroyed and removed from our systems as soon as possible
michelle

at your convenience
please give me a call about walter coffer's review
thanks
michelle
michelle cash assistant general counsel enron wholesale services legal department
tara
thanks so much for sending me your friend's resume
he certainly has a strong academic and work history
unfortunately
it is not enron's practice to hire attorneys right out of law school
we prefer that our candidates have at least 0-0 years
minimum
experience at a big law firm or substantial corporate law department before they are eligible for consideration here
the rationale is that we have so much to do that we really cannot provide adequate training
which is critical for new lawyers
nor can we take the time necessary to supervise and review work of lawyers who don't have the requisite experience
so
please thank your friend for his interest
if you would like
i would be happy to visit with him about other types of opportunities in the legal profession
from law firms to some corporate legal departments that do hire straight out of law school
alternatively
he may be a candidate for the associate and analyst program
if he doesn't want to practice law
call me with any questions
michelle

would you mind getting on the transition of hrrm functions to the staffing and service center groups
i think that you have the most familiarity with the processes and perhaps could facilitate that taking place next week
let's discuss
michelle

this may be of assistance

this person's background won't work for us
we need more transactional work experience for them to be successful here
particularly m&a
major real estate
financing
etc
thanks
michelle
yes
we still own the ip
sarah
at this time
i do not believe that this is a legal issue
mary joyce
in executive compensation
approves all terms and conditions of vp employment agreements
before we agree to modify any non-compete
there must be buy-in from mary first
only then would we consider the request from the legal perspective
even then
i am not sure that it is a precedent we would want to set for someone under a us agreement
i got this
i assume this is 0:0 central time

the business agents will try to get out early and visit with the site manager to get a pre-hire agreement
if possible
the business managers will take notes/keep diaries of their conversations with site managers and supervisors
so be aware of that possibility when you are approached by unions
we should keep our own notes of conversations as they occur
should we designate one person to handle union relations
we should have a very small group of people to have such a discussions
perhaps the hr site lead or the construction site manager would be the appropriate liaisons
that way
we don't have the unions approaching our employees
we have no obligation to have such conversations
but it is a good idea not to be antagonistic with them
better to be polite
let them know that we are mobilizing the project
but that we bid this work as a merit shop project and will not sign a pre-hire agreement
we should not give them any information about our hiring process or plans
we should tell them that we will be glad to consider their people at the time we are hiring
but that we are not taking applications at this time
we should inform them about how to apply for positions at the site
which will be at an off-site human resources office
we also are going to use the state employment offices for clerical personnel
but not for other types because we have not had much success in receiving qualified candidates
there is a need for hr to look at the off-site office before the lease is signed
other issues surround gating at the facility
how will it be gated
who will control entry and exits
what about the other ways into the site
how do we prevent persons from using an alternative entrance and then getting into our site to talk with our people
parking area will be on the other side of the plant
there are roads between the parking gate and the building site
because of all these issues
we should look at a plat for the site and then look at the gating situation
back to mark's suggestions
be careful of calls coming into the project
make sure that the receptionist or office manager knows what to say to callers
those calls should be directed to that site hr lead
also
should inform those people how to answer questions about hiring plans
e.g
are you hiring electricians out there
those should be referred to hr's off site office
also
those people should know how to answer questions as to whether we hire union employees
they should refer such questions to hr and not answer them
we will have a script for the receptionist for such inquiries
be sure to follow the 0-day rule
also
follow our hiring practices consistently
ultimately
there will be training for others at the site after more employees are on site
perhaps the last week of october
on union avoidance and other issues
one more follow up item is to make sure that our subcontracts have union harmony provisions
galen
millie
is going to send those to david lund
david lund
michelle cash
and mark stubley will discuss the issue of which local counsel to get lined up in the event that we need someone locally
please note that we do not agree with the terms of the letter attached to the resume
we have provided a contract for review by your company
and that agreement should govern
with that
thanks for the resume
michelle cash
what do you mean by backdating
i think our policy has been to make those current or close to current at the time of signing
rick
nice kudos from robert
would you mind keeping diane goode in the loop on this
as you may recall
she had done a summary of the legal requirements and sent it on to the generalists
they now are calling her for help
so her knowing what you are doing is essential
thanks
michelle
i agree with your take
plus
how will those employees be hired
is it part of the deal
if so
then we will need to figure out how to document it
michelle
fyi
i forgot to forward this to you earlier
mhc
please print this plus attachment and file under corporate american express cards
thanks
please print this plus attachment and file corporate american express cards
thanks
please print this and file corporate american express cards
thanks
we're meeting now
near my office
can you come
george
i spoke with fran about the leaf river contracts
she indicated that we are waiting for details
names
etc
from eric connor
once we get those
we can generate a draft for review and comment
i understand that fran has asked eric for this data
let me know if you have any questions
michelle
mike
i have reviewed the nepco agreement to separation pay and release of claims
i believe that there are significant issues with this because it does not comply with the requirements of the older worker benefit protection act
i will send you a new waiver form to use
the one you are using is not valid under the adea
michelle
sandra
we need the password
here are some referrals for hr consultants
michelle
sounds good
no risk to non-compete
the payment obligation is one that is independent of non-compete
mhc
i agree
involve valeria
you also should invite my new lawyer
lizzette palmer
twanda is her assistant
also
thanks
michelle
fyi
i would say that the background check issue is a business call
they are the ones who require the background checks and the type of background checks
same with the guarantee language
if there is a change
however
i would make it to the ssd instead of the main agreement
that way
we won't have to live with it for every placement
michelle
what about the change in control agreement for the other person you discussed
i don't think we have seen that
thanks
michelle by the way
fran mayes and i both will be at the office tomorrow
please contact us at my office
0-0-0
thanks
you sent this to me
dan
i have since clarified this with the gp attorneys
michelle
great result
i have looked at the policy and have no major issue with it
except to the extent that it may be either duplicative or different from policies that corp
is looking to implement
i agree with paul's approach on the practice aspect as well as the statement that management will take reasonable steps to look for their unaccounted-for personnel
paul
it might make sense for you to talk with robert jones and david oxley
who are looking at overall security issues in the wake of the terrorist attacks
michelle
the osha complaint was dismissed
michelle
please get with him
michelle
aaron
does this apply to companies in which we have a large ownership interest
but that may not be a
subsidiary
thanks
michelle
please revise accordingly
thanks
michelle
carol
i spoke with lara robinson this morning
she indicated that the indemnities in the contribution agmt covered the matters addressed in this draft and that she was told no more indemnities were to be made
she also wants us to hire everyone who is out on leave immediately instead of having them show up when released
even if the person never returns due to a conversion to ltd she wants us to pick up responsibility for those employees
seems unusual to me
would you please give me a call at your earliest convenience
my number is 0-0-0
thanks
michelle
dan
i spoke with gp benefits counsel this morning
there are several business issues outstanding
fran is trying to get with mcmahon to get his take on tham
he is at eb where she is doing a super saturday
fyi
michelle
this will just be rome and enron
although we believe that most of his claims really are against hms
his lawyer is claiming that enron used hms to defraud rome
his lawsuit will be against only enron
therefore
it makes no sense to drag hms into this at this point
although they probably will have to be involved in some fashion after suit is filed
this is great
thanks for the info
michelle
claudia
would you please arrange to have these collected
thanks
michelle
great idea to put this out there
fyi
i have arranged for jack wisdom to provide some training on wage and hour law issues in the next few weeks
i'll keep you posted on the status of that
michelle
under the enron corp
severance plan
can we provide employees with the opportunity to take voluntary termination in lieu of future involuntary term
one of our offices wants to offer employees that opportunity
with some sort of enhanced benefit if they take it
your quick thoughts on this would be appreciated
michelle
we are working on this issue this week by meeting with joe dilg and putting forth a summary memo of the history of the situation
the pay requirements under the contract
and recommendations of how to move forward
that will be done this week
and everyone on this email will be copied on it
michelle
i know
but that doesn't change the fact that we should articulate the standards that we are using
i know that they use some criteria that are based on solid business reasons
so let's capture them
that way
we at least can explain why we did things
michelle
who are they
fran
the latest on gp closing is nov
0 as a target
but the 0th is more likely
michelle
great
would youplease get this to janette
thanks
please put this into the last faq for the metals stuff
michelle
fyi
please let me know if you have any comments
michelle
here is a draft of the plan document we prepared for the metals situation
michelle
happy to talk with you about the ada
i've actually written two papers on the topic and edited an article in the houston lawyer on your very topic
albeit several years ago
which was before the supremes spoke on the issue
on the senior specialist position
i am happy to discuss that with you as well
please get with my assistant
twanda sweet
at 0 to schedule a time next week to talk
michelle
this guy is going to call to schedule
give him 0 minutes
mhc
fyi
michelle
the 0 weeks is the amount of years of service
or the amount of 0k increments in salary
the 0 weeks is a premium on top of that amount
that's the plan
stan
try this
thanks for getting me this info
michelle
linda
i can't make 0 tomorrow
so go ahead and meet without me
lunch this week would be difficult
as i'm out thursday and friday attending the sw legal foundation labor seminar in dallas
would you like to try something next week with me and lizzette palmer
my new attorney
if so
have your assistant get with twanda at 0-0 to schedule
as twanda works for both me and lizzette
thanks
michelle
when is this scheduled
please calendar
thanks
i haven't specifically referenced nutech in my questions to them
i also probably need to ask the comp committee about these
tolerable
conflicts of interest
particularly in light of recent press coverage of enron
we'll discuss that this afternoon
nancy
but i am not feeling like we should agree to any of those types of provisions
yikes
rescinding is what you meant to say
i believe that this was not meant for public distribution
but it is a sentiment that i thought you should hear
michelle
do we want them to be under employment agreements
david
you asked me to provide my opinion about the employment agreement provisions relating to target bonus amounts that are based on performance
the bonus language contained in the majority of the agreements with a target bonus is as follows
provided that enron meets its earnings targets and provided that employee is rated within the top 0% of the performance criteria under enron's annual performance rating system or its equivalent for the calendar year in question
employee's annual bonus amounts under the plan for calendar years 0
0
and 0
payable in 0
0
and 0
respectively
shall be based on an annual bonus target of $_____________
this language does not address a person's performance as compared to one's peers
but instead looks at the number of performance criteria and requires that a person be in the top 0% of those criteria
thus
if there are only 0 rating categories
i.e
0
0
0
distributed as 0-0-0
then only the people in the top category would be within the top 0/0% of the rating criteria
given the huge change in our process
however
there is an argument that the above language cannot be applied to the current scheme and that instead
we should look at the top 0% of the peer group
instead of performance criteria
even though that was not the intent of the provision when it was drafted
as a result
i would suggest that the middle category be divided further into either 0 or 0 subcategories
i.e
0a
0b
or 0c
that way
persons who fall out in categories 0 or 0a would be eligible for the target bonus
if there is a decision not to break down the middle 0 further
then it would be useful to look at those employees with a bonus target that we think is too high
for those employees
a more conservative approach may be to evaluate them on a scale that is more subdivided than the 0-0-0 breakdown and to document that they fell out in the bottom 0% of the categories under that process
of course
it goes without saying that we should ensure consistent treatment based on race
sex
national origin
age
etc
in this process
please let me know if you have any questions
should we wait on this
given the possibilities we discussed earlier today
michelle
i can't find it on my blackberry
i can't remember who sent it
and the ones i've reviewed don't have the info
why don't you ask shanna funkhouser for the details
sorry about that
michelle
i woke up and couldn't get back to sleep
bummer
dear maaico
congratulations on the birth of daughter laura
she looks great
very healthy and all
it also is great to see how little bart is growing up
he is a beautiful boy
you must be so happy and proud to have two healthy children
i will send you some fun pictures of my son
cameron
who has learned to stand on his head
he is very proud
congratulations again
and take care
love
michelle
was this adopted
those were fine
no changes
i just didn't want to fax them from the hotel due to cost
mhc
hi there
from whom
am i getting a good package
i think you should be there
so it can wait until later in the week
other priorities obviously govern
thanks
michelle
i would not want any of our policies to address what is
unlawful
as i believe that is a matter for a court
instead
our policies should state what we want to have in them
and leave the issue of legality to others
plus
i wouldn't want any admission of unlawful conduct in our policies
michelle
yes
i have contacts there
if you want
michelle
if it is same as mid-year
then i won't need to look at it
thanks
michelle
sorry
i don't
michelle
jeff couldn't make it
we'll reschedule at his availability
mhc
thanks
but no headhunters
i can't afford a fee
michelle
kelly
do you have members of gss on this list
i can't tell based on names
i'll have my assistant get with you on calendaring
michelle
unbelievable
i guess he has sour grapes
we only paid him not to apply for a job
unfortunately
insults were not contemplated in our agreement
ignore him
michelle
fyi michelle
here is a list of ews labor agreements
from rick johnson
let me know if you require more information
michelle
thanks
mhc
here is what we are hearing
it sounds like it is out of millie's hands and is up the ins
we'll keep you posted
michelle
yea
great work
valeria
michelle
what will the success fee look like
michelle
i think it would be best to get those terms in this agreement
fyi
in case you don't already have this
michelle
hello
john
i am forwarding this to you at the request of rob walls
let me know if you also would like to have the litigation summary for employment matters
michelle
done
do you also want me to send him the list of litigation
i think we have had our release reviewed by ny counsel already
but it might be a belts and suspenders idea to have drew look at it quickly
i agree with lizzette's view of the persons who don't sign the release
i believe that they probably have quit
if
however
they rescind their application before termination
it is not a voluntary term
if the situation arises
however
i think we should reevaluate at that time
michelle
perfect
i hope that we can make it
michelle
did you have a chance to respond
please do an assignment
michelle
thanks for the thoughts
we are getting through it
cameron actually wore his yellow rain slicker
his yellow rain shoes
and his red fireman's hat
so
instead of rain boy
he was a fireman
i must admit that he looked absolutely adorable
your bash sounds like it was a lot of fun
i wish i could get trey to dress up
but he really isn't into that type of thing
we went to the opera sat
night
tanenhouser
wagner really is uptight
isn't he
still
i enjoyed it quite a bit
escaped into the music
i went to a gala last week for md anderson cancer center
it was amazing
joan lunden mc'd
the houston symphony provided music
video from george w
bush
speech by ghw bush
entertainment by one of the irish tenors
lyle lovett
dhianne carroll
who had a costume change even though she sang only for 0 minutes
a 0-person chior
all accompanied by the houston symphony
it was quite the event
persons there included the former president bush and barbara
james baker
alan simpson
lots of local celebs
and me and my brother
one of these things is not like the other
still
we had a great time
so
not all gloom and doom around here
well
i'd better get back to it
michelle
i have seen this
but i don't think it should go out
david/mary/cindy
please correct me if i'm wrong
michelle
would you please handle
thanks
michelle
neil
why not put them under an agreement
that would cover all of these aspects
as well as info re
fees
etc
michelle
sounds good
i'll send you a standard confidentiality agreement
which also contains a non-solicitation of employees
michelle twanda
would you please do a standard confidentiality agreement for this company for my review
thanks
michelle
wouldn't you want them not to solicit the employees they meet when they talk with you and your team
do you want me to allow them to solicit you
just say the word
fyi
michelle
let's get with tommy to expedite it
if you want
l
m
who says they would want him
any officer can sign for enron
generally speaking
we like to have the bu head sign
michelle
i don't think that this is a good idea for her process or any other general process
jon is the perfect choice if he is an officer of that entity
michelle
sure
we could set up an llc entity to employ those people
they would have issues around payroll and benefits
but those can be handled
michelle
we need to talk about that meeting with me
mike
and john
i do not think it went well at all
but i would like to discuss it with you
michelle
great
thanks
please calendar
thanks
michelle
what a delightful and welcome change of pace in my email today
definitely count us in
we'd love to join you
by the way
do you have mata kroger's new phone number
or
is she still with comsys
thanks
michelle
please draft
thanks
michelle
go ahead and ask her to have the attorney call me
michelle
sheila
could you please provide me with ph files and also complete the charts on the following people
some of them may have left the company
and others may never have been employed
will you have access to all current/former employees
information
if not
who would
thanks tons
michelle
it might help if i gave you the names
amy flores michael hinds chris loehr michelle stroud joyce tang ben thomason rudy de la paz frank felicia thanks
jo ann
can you provide the answers for me
then i can decide how to proceed with arthur
thanks
michelle
john and louise
i hope that the sample agreements sent to john earlier were what you had in mind
i have completed all of the amendment and assignment agreements for those persons with the guaranteed bonus
i will hold on to them until you are ready to fill in the blanks
a few of those employees work for enron canada corp
i am not sure if i can transfer them to the other company in light of tax issues
nonetheless
those are ready
and we can change the new company name if we set up a canadian entity in the next few days
let me know if you would like any more information
you can reach me at 0-0 or on my cell at 0-0-0
michelle
for your information
here is some severance language i received from littler
michelle
not needed
we have ogletree on it
michelle
we need to do assignments for these folks
thanks
michelle
good day
diomedes
first
let me say that i am sorry about the delay in responding to your earlier email
i am writing to let you know that the processing of your eci payments has begun
because of the significant amount of activity here at enron over the past few days
it may take a few days to finalize the processing
however
if you have questions about timing
please feel free to call me at 0-0-0 or pam butler at 0-0-0
feel free to give me a call if you would like to discuss this matter further
michelle
i do not have any of this information
cathy
is the metals plan the same as enron domestic
if so
then i would suggest that chris rahaim participate in this process
feel free to work with me on it
but i just don't have any data
thanks
michelle
i am not aware of any
i am happy for us to paper the deal
i am not sure that we will be able to guarantee anything special for scarth in the event of a purchase of the assets
it will be a deal team decision as to whether they want to impose that requirement on the sale of the asset
michelle
we have confirmed the amounts of the contracts
when i speak of processing
it relates to the processing of the checks/wire transfers
thanks
lynn
for the update
if they have no interest in putting a settlement offer out there
then i suggest that we schedule the plaintiff's deposition
let's turn up the heat
michelle
vicki
as mentioned in my voice mail on friday
we have received a lawsuit filed by michael lindert against enron corp
eeso
and ees
inc
in which he basically claims that he is due unpaid commissions
he seeks damages of $0 million
jim derrick passed this lawsuit to me
but let me know if you want me to manage it on behalf of ees
i have contacted chicago counsel
for information
not retention
purposes
to determine the answer date
which is 0 days
i do not believe that we have been properly served
however
so we appear to have additional time
the suit was filed 0/0
and we received it sometime last week
via cover letter to ken lay from lindert
rather bizzarre
if you ask me
the law firm representing the plaintiff is not some hack plaintiff's firm
it actually is a blue chip family law firm with a good reputation in cook county
the case probably should be removed to federal court due to diversity of citizenship
according to the seyfarth
shaw lawyers i contacted on friday
the circuit court of cook county
law division is not a place where we would want to be
and federal court is preferable
we have 0 days to remove to federal court
let me know how you want me to proceed
michelle
twanda
could you please detach this attachment and send it to the following email address from my email
i just don't want all the other communications enclosed
we need to cc
julia murray
thanks
michelle
david
i guess i think that it is not worth the fight these days
i suppose would approve this training
but i think we need to have an understanding w
ogletree about travel time
travel expenses
billing rates
etc
they need to understand who holds the purse strings
and i do not think it would be appropriate for them to bill their full hourly rate for time spent on travel given that we could find someone local to do the same training
or could send me or lizzette to do it for the cost of travel only
for your information
david
there is nothing magic about the training they are doing
it is standard training that i used to deliver frequently when i was in private practice
ogletree does not have a monopoly on it
i'll try to call you early this week
now that the other work i have been focusing on may slow down a bit
michelle
this looks fine
have we released us from any and all obligations that may have arisen before the date the agreement is signed
i don't want there to be any other surprises
so i'd like to include
known and unknown
type language here
also
does the definition of ect include all parents
shareholders
affiliates
employees
attorneys
etc
let's be very clear
i'd also like a covenant not to sue signed by both clonch and his attorneys
leslie
i have just learned that the holland club event will overlap with this event by about 0 minutes
st
nicholas arrives at 0:0
so cameron probably wouldn't get his gift until 0:0 at the earliest
also
since it is out in the boonies
it would take a while to get back inside the loop
would it be possible for us to arrive late
i'd hate to create a disturbance
but i think cameron would like to attend both things
thanks
michelle
please print and put in diomedes christodolou file
thanks
please print and file in diomedes christodolou's file
thanks
mhc
pam
i guess a separate line of inquiry is whether we owe him payments under his employment contract
we probably should get with castleman this week
michelle
please print and file in diomedes christodolou file
thanks
mhc
jo ann
what is the answer
michelle
fyi
i talked this morning with a guy who took the mexico cruise the week of thanksgiving last year
he gave me some scoop on the trip
the weather is nice
but wind causes things to be chilly
lots of good food
one thing
the cruise ship apparently can be quite rocky and rolly
which can cause some folks to have horrible nausea
you may want to call your pediatrician to get some meds for the kids
and probably call your doc for some meds for you--as i recall
you got awfully seasick on the deep sea fishing boat
although it was when you were having all that trouble with your thyroid
later
michelle
who would see or use this
add to your question list
michelle
i'll be out also
on the cruise
baby
your thoughts
we are planning to attend
although i am going to a networking happy hour at my old firm
i have got to get out there
as you can appreciate
but i hope to see you at kari's house
i know trey and cam will be there
michelle
not yet
michelle
if he wants it
but i would like a waiver
so i think we should consider some sort of payment
michelle
t
would you please send runner to get this
thanks mhc
that is fine
but i do have to get cameron today
so let shanna know
thanks
mich
how are we handling others in that group
we must be consistent
let's discuss
michelle
how much
they're fine
michelle
i would suggest that we require a waiver before we pay the money
please review and let me know what the traders want to do on this
by thursday would be good
michelle
yes
if you send me the names and the amounts we will be paying
we'll put them together
mhc
please calendar
thanks
mhc
please begin to prepare this
i've asked her how much
mhc
doesn't this sound divine
attached is a proposed letter to use when rescinding an offer of employment
i have consolidated drafts done by fran mayes and terry bosien
if you have other forms that you think work better
please send them our way
i think it will be useful to work from the same document across enron
please note that each situation should be handled consistently with others in similar circumstances
and that special care should be taken for those who have quit prior jobs
relocated
or are in precarious visa situations
michelle
the minimum number of days should be 0
and they should have 0 days to revoke it
although the adea probably would not apply to a&a candidates
it could be an issue for the rest of the organization
michelle
the attachments didn't make it
no
sounds right
yes
i have been working those
after i get all info i wil probably consolidate and give to sharon for keping but i think it make sense forme to consolidate all info on these employees
thanks
m
unfortunately
i do not think we'll have time for this today
given other critical priorities
i would suggest that the deadline may be slipping in light of other activities
michelle
can you provide some insight
thanks
michelle
hi
janette and diane
based on my conversations with mark
we are going to revise this letter a bit
so
hold off on giving them to him until the next round
thanks
michelle
the intent is not to include 0b officers
payments will not be made if termination occurs prior to payment date
i'll get back with you on the other issues
michelle
never mind on this
twanda took care of it
thanks
michelle
as we discussed
here is the second set of q&as
your comments would be appreciated
michelle
fyi
i guess we'll all be busy
michelle
thanks
i needed a little levity
michelle
fyi
in case you didn't get this
michelle
although this is ews floor meeting
you may want to come to hear the messages being delivered
mhc
here are the details
michelle
david
just a question as to whether dynegy has been notified that we are amending the contracts of these guys to delete minimum or target bonus and replacing with performance bonus memo
we may want to send a brief email confirming the discussions and their consent so that we have it for our files
thanks
michelle
i understand your point on this and agree that someone may try to argue that it is due to them upon signing the offer letter
our practice and intent has been to pay after they start
and i believe that the letter refers to payment after they start
so there is some wiggle room on the other side
i agree that it is not a
slam dunk
on our part
but my view is that the risk is worth not doing anything unless and until we get some sort of demand or claim
we then can cross the bridge as to how to proceed
in the meantime
i am comfortable with this level of risk
of course
if these folks are ones to whom we are paying any money
then the waiver should address the signing bonus issue
ya'll let me know if you disagree
has this been approved by david oxley
if not
we can't proceed
thanks
michelle
the meeting with mark haedicke has been scheduled for 0:0 tomorrow
kerry
i suggest that you arrive by 0:0
as our security has increased significantly
by copy of this email
i am asking twanda to call the security console to alert them of your arrival
please ask for me when you arrive
extension 0
we'll meet with mark and then meet with david oxley
who runs hr for the company
to discuss your role while i am out and beyond
thanks
michelle
hi dawn
i am working on a project that requires the review of employment contracts
i do not have signed copies of several enron canada agreements
would you mind faxing them down to me via twanda as soon as possible on friday
we are on a lavo deadline
thanks
the people are
chad clark
mike cowan
paul devries
eric ledain
chris dorland
john mckay
and john zufferli
only if he signed the one we did for enron canada for him
i have the ena one dated 0/0/0
i appreciate your assistance
please call twanda before the fax arrives
as it is a central legal department fax and not a private one
thanks a lot
michelle
twanda
how can we get these
can we enlist knudsen's help
thanks
michelle
based on my review of the files
we do not have signed agreements for the following
tom alonso* mark fischer* ben jacoby laura luce mike mcdonald dave parquet gregg penman frank vickers andy zipper would you mind asking the vault if they have these
if not
could you get with knudsen to get them
thanks
by the way
no one should know why
thanks a lot
michelle
eric
as mentioned in my voice mail
pat mccarthy is the attorney we use for gsp employment matters
i believe that he may be better suited to answer your questions
and may have the time while i am out on vacation next week
his number is 0-0-0
i have left him a voice mail telling him that you may give him a call
so he will be prepared
i hope that is helpful
michelle
absolutely
i agree with that
michelle
i like the message and agree that communication is critical at this time
should we go right out and say that no one will be affected next week
more artfully phrased of course
i believe that is the right way to go
no terminations thanksgiving week
so i'd like to go ahead and say it
michelle
i have retained kerry notestine from littler mendelson to help me on this project
so we don't need to get bob vote involved
yes
that would be great
michelle
cole
here are the revisions to the benefit plan q&a doc
i think these are ready to go if these comments are incorporated
but check with barrow on them
on your question about being able to put some of them on the web
let's go through which ones can go and which ones need to be further reviewed
thanks
michelle
i agree
unless some of them have moved from eel to ena or vice versa
in that situation
we definitely want to know about it so that the docs can be assigned
michelle
pat
please let me know if my email of last night did not go through
i am in the office now 0-0-0
thanks
michelle
fyi
sharon will handle maintaining the list of all persons who are critical witnesses in future litigation so that we can take that into consideration when managing personnel decisions
michelle
fyi
i've been reviewing most of the q&as on the questions raised post merger announcement
i don't think you need to do much
but i wanted you to be aware that this was going on
michelle
lizzette and ryan
kriste and i substantially revised the waiver agreement today
so sit tightkriste
do you want to add the mediation provision
i'll leave that to youmichelle
fyi
let us know if these folks are appropriate to include on our
critical for litigation
list
thanks
michelle
thanks a lot for managing this
valeria
i agree that we need her to execute that note by a date certain
this has gone on too long
michelle
lance
thanks for passing this message on
it is good to know what is on the rumor mill
and nobody who knows what i do ever passes those on to me directly
i believe that we should carefully stay away from any statement that cuts are based on mid-year prc
as that would not be the best legal defense to have
instead
hr
with assistance from legal
has put forth a matrix for businesses to use in determining which employees
if any
will be affected
listed on that matrix include factors such as job criticality
which is weighted to be twice as significant as any of the other factors
ability to perform several different types of jobs
business knowledge
leadership
teamwork
and historical performance over the last 0 months
prc results would not be the sole factor
otherwise
someone who is the only person who knows how to do a mission-critical job might be affected simply because he rated out lower at mid-year review
that result obviously would be disasterous
michelle
i think this looks good
for simplicity
i would use the ethnic codes we have in datamart/sap rather than creating new ones
that makes it easier to populate
one other field to add would be visa status
as with the other documents
i believe that the population of these documents can be done now
with just the blank for
yes
or
no
for layoff waiting for the rest of the process
you probably will have to run these by the generalist
valeria or someone in er team
and the attorneys for the special risk factors column
be sure and mark this document as privileged and confidential
prepared at the direction of counsel
so that we can protect the privilege of this document if necessary
thanks
michelle
pat
i really like that approach
looks great to me
michelle
kriste
did you get this
if not
i think it really works
michelle
pat
i am not sure if your email to kriste went through
i've forwarded it to her
but
fyi
her address is kriste.sullivan@enron.com
thanks for all your help
kriste
i believe that all but one of the amendments/bonus memo documents are complete
the only one in question is for brian redmond
whose contract we did not have
jeanie is going to pull the contract in the morning and give it to twanda
twanda will prepare the draft amendment and change to the memo and get it to kriste for finalizing
then
i hope
we'll be done
thanks
michelle ps
the number to the grammar hotline is 0-0-0
stewart called me last week for some advice
i had to leave a message for him when i called him back
so
i gave him your names as backup in case he needs immediate assistance
just wanted you to know that he might be calling one of you
michelle
david
late last week
i received a call from kristen kracraft
who does employment law at dynegy
she indicated that they would like for there to be a protocol for how to handle things if there is a desire to allow the hiring of employees from dynegy to enron or vice versa
of course
such hiring would have to be coordinated at the top of the company to avoid any type of free-for-all
at a minimum
i would think that you and andrea lang would have to be the ones who make the decisions
with that thought
i have asked tim o'rourke's team to work on such a protocol
in the meantime
kristen mentioned that one person in rick shapiro's group wants to go to dynegy
she understood that shapiro had said it was ok
do you know about that
if not
should you give andrea a call about it
i am concerned about the floodgate effect
so i believe we should proceed with extreme caution
let me know your thoughts on this
michelle
i think this works
what is the best way to incorporate this into the plan
i'm holding off on these until i get the package from pr
my info is correct
michelle
yes
indeed
here is a proposed communication regarding severance plan changes
this proposal makes me most nervous
my recommendation would be to let everyone know it has been restated and attach an electronic copy of the new plan
thus letting the plan speak for itself
we then could arm hr with a list of faqs to address the changes without publishing anything other than the plan to the population as a whole
what do you think
also
kriste
we will have to determine the audience for severance plan communication
as not all enron entities have this plan
e.g
nepco
same thing with vacation
michelle
what do you think
we have a babysitter that night already
although i am sure we could cancel it
i am a bit unclear
are these ready for my final review yet
if so
i will get right on them
michelle
terrie
on the issue of communicating the restated severance plan
below is the recommendation of four different attorneys who have considered the issue
michelle
thanks
i agree
michelle
karen
is this now ready for my review
no rush on this
late this week is fine
michelle
would you please handle this
thanks
michelle
this is fine
but is it harsh enough
i got a call from rome's lawyer
who wants to call the whole thing off because he doesn't think he'll get the money he wants
i told him we were ready and willing to proceed
he was going to call the mediator to see if he could cancel without incurring the mediation fees
so
i'll keep you posted
michelle
i'll get back with you asap
michelle
fyi re
offer revocation
michelle
money
i am not sure i understand the question
give me a call when you have a chance
michelle
the good news is
we don't owe a mediation fee
right
lizzette
i'll give jack a call
michelle
my recommendation would be that we don't comment at all
but let the terms of the plan and the related waivers speak for themselves
we cannot provide them with legal advice
michelle
i don't think that is true
our waiver does contemplate such a release of claims
i think we should not comment on legal questions and let the terms of our plan and the separation agreements speak for themselves
i agree
i'd like a copy of that
if possible
i think it should state
confidential and proprietary
not to be disclosed to persons other than human resources and legal department
if possible
put it on all documents
as well as the cover of the notebook
michelle
go ahead and pose the question
but the answer should be that we don't comment at all on litigation
and that the terms of severance plan and related waivers will govern the situation
we should reiterate that we can't provide with legal advice
michelle
what is he asking
it is in the q&as already posted
we cannot comment on hr policies/plans for dynegy or for the merged entity because we simply don't know
michelle
i guess i would delay in responding to this one until we know what the plan will look like
hate to direct them to current plan if it will be changing
michelle
i will provide more detailed comments later
but want to clarify that the severance plan has not been adopted by all enron entities domestically
similarly
some enron-owned companies have adopted their own vacation
sick pay
etc
so
we should be careful about the audience for these communications
i suggest getting with rick johnson on that issue
michelle
simone
how do i get to livelink again
i think that ya'll have handled the legal work for these entities in the past
can you provide ann with this information asap
thanks
michelle
ann
i've looked over this list and realized i have no relevant information
so i've forwarded it to sharon and kriste
who should be able to help you
sorry i can't do it myself
but i just don't know anything about the pipes
michelle
i have reviewed the contract for brent
he has a 0-month non-compete after the termination of his employment
is he planning to honor it
if not
we have to make decisions about pursuing him in court
michelle
i agree that it is best to leave alone
yes
send to me
thanks
michelle
it shiuld be cynthia barow instead
i think the benefits info already is in what we sent to katie caplan at weil
let me know how i can help
michelle
go ahead and notify
what a jerk
i don't think we should curtail cause terminations
others would probably be best to wait unless there is a disruptive situation
michelle
you should indicate that the severance plan is subject to the approval of the enron corp
board of directors
we do have a plan in place
but we haven't terminated any employees under that plan in the last few weeks
so
we can't say that there is not plan in place righ now
michelle
we need the following data asap
0
number of total employees at all enron entities broken down by domestic and us 0
breakdown of those domestic employees by whether they are hourly or salaried 0
amount of accrued
unpaid vacation balance
michelle
i agree
no offer
let him pursue his claims with everyone else
michelle
yep
sarah
please feel free to call me on my cell at 0-0-0 or at home at 0-0-0 if you need to reach me urgently
michelle
i think that we should enforce the agreement
did he get a signing bonus
if so he probably will have to pay back
he also will have to hnor noncompete
what happened with brent price
michelle
sure
kathy
would you please get access to expertfinder reinstated for my group
me
lizzette palmer
twanda sweet
and diane goode
thanks a bunch
michelle
i left a voice mail for terrie
indicating that i think we should close out this communication with something to the effect of
if you have further questions
please contact ________________
this looks fine with me
michelle
i think that is right
but i do not have the data to confirm that
michelle
thanks
we're using weil
talk to you soon
michelle
i would say that we should honor the terms of any sale or acquisition agreement with regards to service bridging
if we agreed to do so
then our records should reflect that service date
michelle
sure
i didn't read it all but assume it is ok
michelle
ill see what i can find out for you
michelle
get with david lund
nepco is not in br
let's discuss the charges
m
thanks
both of us are still here
you of all people know how hard yesterday was for me
i hope never to have to go through that type of experience again
talk to you soon
michelle
i assume that you are working with terrie james on this
the answer depends
so we need to be careful about how we answe it
michelle
i'm still here
it has been very rough this week
thanks for checking with me
michelle
fyi
we have suspended our neutral reference practice in light of the layoffs yesterday
fyi
i have heard from some folks that business folks think that too many hr people are gone
so i think they may be ok with numbers
michelle
the answer is no
we can't provide personnel information to anyone outside the company
not appropriate at any time
michelle
can you and +iane please join me sharon and kriste at 0 for a status meeting
go tob 0
kari
this is helpful
is there any way we can delete the names of persons who no longer are here
thanks
michelle
i am working with mary joyce on that right now
michelle
i think we should consider this request
i think that the answer is that she will be eligible for the $0 and will be allowed to continue whatever medical coverage she had elected already until 0/0
please refer her to the q&as on the web site for details
michelle
i have received an urgent data request from the counterparty for netco
they want the following asap
signed copies of contracts for greg whalley and vince kaminsky
who may not have a contract
sample signed agreement for a regular trader
presumably give one at vp and above and one below vp
i can get this from my files easily signed sample agreement for an it person
such as jay webb
i think i can get this one as well
they also want the following data for the 0
name 0 total compensation
broken down by base
bonus
etc
comp for 0
broken down by base
bonus
etc
i'd exclude stay bonus in this number
if the person has a contract
what is the future value of the contract did the person get a stay bonus last week
if so
amount
date of hire if under contract
beginning and end date of the term of that agreement
they are in a rush for this data
so give me a call and let me know how quickly we can assemble it
thanks a lot
michelle
please file
pam benson
thanks
mhc
please file in diomedes
file
thanks
mhc
fine with me
mhc
you need more than the 0 for this
you also need the it personnel
i'll forward those to kathy so she can get started
thanks
michelle
here is the second list
michelle
i got this request a second time
probably fran would have the best knowledge of exactly how these people were paid
alan
i got a request from carey sloan that we confirm in writing that he was no longer an officer or board member of any enron entity as of the last date of his employment
can we do that
if so
who can assist
thanks
michelle
we missed diane's birthday on friday
i can't believe i forgot it
i'd like to get cake monday afternoon
michelle
we are working on it but in the grand scheme of things it is kind of a back burner issue
michelle
i agree
but we should pay them the 0
we have decided not to make any reps about these plans
since any buyer would not be taking them
however
we have a data room list that specifies what was made available
and the other side is welcome to review most of what is in that room
we remain cautious about releasing employment compensation data and contract information about individuals
but are happy to provide totals of current and future costs under those agreements in the aggregate
let me know if you have questions
which deal are you actively working on
fire or wind
do i need to be working on the draft agreement
thanks
michelle
here are my comments
thanks
michelle
go ahead and let them stay until vesting
please reverse their terminations and see if there is any work they can do until the termination day
if they got the $0
offset that amount from pay
michelle
we will need to look at our vacation pay practice with weil to determine whether we can pay out in the future for accrued
but unused vacation
i think we can say that they'll get no less than $0
but we want to confirm with weil
don't know about parking/bus
i think it is regular course
but we may have to change that regular course
mary jean
did you get ok from your partners to publish 0k info to public and employees
pr seems to think that glen signed off on doing it
michelle
happy to give them
but no reps are going to be made
as i understand
michelle
yes
i approved
after talking wtih weil
michelle
all of them
hi
randy
i hope you are doing ok
i thought you might be interested to learn that victoria sterling amended her lawsuit to add enron as a party on nov
0
of course
the claim will be stayed due to bankruptcy
but it is interesting that she finally did it
take care
michelle
how about 0 in my office on 0
did you add the sections on what we want newco to do for the employees
see you then
michelle
great
i will
subject to having the opportunity to review it
thanks
michelle
good morning
david has asked me to summarize a request for data relating to employment agreements
as the company needs to decide whether it will reject or accept those agreements in the bankrupt entities
we also need to decide how to handle agreements in non-bankrupt entities
we will need summaries of all employment agreements in the entire company
broken down by business unit
group
name of employee
term/duration of agreement
and future obligations under the agreement
we will need those segregated as follows
employees involuntarily terminated in the last 0 weeks
employees involved in newco/trading operations
eel employees employees remaining in the enron estate
could you arrange for this work to be done
preferably by tomorrow
i would suggest that someone develop a single format that works for this data and then share it with the others
thanks
michelle
maureen
as soon as i receive anything
i'll forward it on
i am working on it and have been since yesterday
michelle
no employment claims for gas or power
michelle
don't give ssns
i'd suggest giving names only
are we agreeing to this
given that this has not been communciated to current employees
i believe that we should consider whether we want to continue this strategy at this time
it strikes me as something that should be discussed at the management committee level
as that was the group that made this decision last summer
michelle
i'd transfer to ena effective 0/0
if the people have employment agreements
we will need to assign
michelle
how does he want to change it
if it is more generous
then i think we should discuss
michelle
likely story
lizzette has taken the lead on this immigration issue
thanks
michelle
no
it looked suspicious
so i didn't open it
fax is 0-0-0
yes
do a wire
her check to irs will bounce if we don't handle it today
thanks
michelle
we are working through that issue this week
michelle
yes
we will
michelle
kalen
do we still have the disclaimer on these
i'd like to make sure that it appears on every set
thanks
michelle
go ahead and give her a call
let's get it right
even if it causes a few minutes
delay
if anyone on this email knows how to contact her quickly
then have her give mike jones a call asap
thanks
michelle
bob
i am happy for you to handle the richter matter
lizzette palmer on my team has been taking the lead on nepco matters
so get with her on details
i'll confirm with david lund that he has no objection
michelle
i'm working on it
i'd send this to sarah and ryan for their database
ill check around i have a good friend who works there
i assume the severance question is only going to former employees
wbut the doctor question goes to both current and former employees
let me know if the plan is different
michelle
have we assigned employees to netco
i didn't think we had
in fact i think we were going to move everyone into ena and have them hired by netco after closing
i am on blackberry and missed the end of the talking points
could you resend
thanks
michelle
in general if a person turns down an offer to go to a divested company
it is considered a voluntary termination/resignation
we haven't made that decision here though
as to solicitation of employees back and forth
it will be a negotiated deal term
i can't recall if we put any provision on that issue in the bid template or not
let me know if you want me to check the latest version michelle
no
we think it may be payable as a past expense
michelle
can you supplement the answer to the visa question
thanks
michelle
who is handling reinstatement for ena
david
i think we should remove anything relating to the components of a retention
i.e
whether it is rs or cash
and any thing relating to vesting
no way to predict at this time
as i have more comments
i'll send them on
mich
one other thing
texas law will apply to those employees in texas
as state courts will not allow other laws to govern in employee matters
oregon is the same
as i re-read
i found more references to vesting or payout dates
again
these should be more generic or blank
michelle
unfortunately
no
we have to get those approved by creditors here first
bummer

louise
the view is that the capex hold is across the company and your counterpart probably hasn't raised the issue of buying anything with higher management
suffice to say our guys have confirmed they don't think the bid is real
i thought any
contractors
had a zero limit which must be the case
we have kathy abshire buying things and she is a contractor
please could you check that contractors and temps have a zero limit

could you provide a column including the approver

but here is where we got to
forgot saguoro
sold it last week
why is the ca dated august 0th
have we been sitting on it since then
let's just hope no-one notices
obviously it is not what we want
we are assuming anthony has power beth has gas
let's hope no-one else notices
let's make sure no-one does anything internally so people notice it
thanks
hideous photo
couldn't we have given them a better one
haha
definitely not
thanks
i await the next update
need to include saguoro
i am a bit confused i thought we had agreed to the following last week
expand to show approver and only include those things which have been approved
issues
why are there so many repeat lines
each request is issuing 0 times in some cases
will this mean we order three by accident
i have no idea what has been ordered
last week i could see this time its all in code
please resend with descriptors
thanks louise
funny
thanks very much
perfect
don't worry orig is what i wanted
just to check have you ever done anything other than gas and zinc
if so
when and how much
we passed each other
this answers all my questions thanks
let's try and keep this quiet
nearly time to go
oh
never mind
haven't they heard of a fax
it'll happen
i concur with your view
no to all of them louise
just a quick question
0 years for pgt
great thanks
i'm still here too
geoff this cannot be right
its millions i thought we were about $0mm all in including the secret zhei project
me
0knew as usual nothing about this until it was too late
enron nominated 0 people
i'm trying to keep it quiet
yes
wellhead desk can you please send jean a list of the 0 people
i'm ok
give her 0
i can't tomorrow
how about next time she is in town
or in new york
good idea to prepare a list
we shouldn't distribute but push the discussion to cover them all
but definitely put a list together
thanks
trying to keep it quiet too
sems to be working
lavo didn't even see it
i'm planning to go see greg with wes for 0 minutes on friday to let him know how far we have got with the budgets
it budget for this year is $0mm
i'm still working on this one obviously
hideous isn't it
i'm 0 months pregnant in it
can you ring these guys and tell them to deliver immediately
at their cost as it is late
whatever they can of the order
ha bloody ha
funny though isn't it
i rang jeff
he's out
surreal experience really
i was hoping no-one noticed
pr did it and as you can imagine
without asking
cheers big ears
broadcast voicemail
sounded good
yes and yes
i really want it in q0
not q0
no fine thanks
is speaking to mike mcconnell today
thanks
what happened to this guy
itss crap
almost all of our own websites
i've read it
probably have a copy somewhere if you want it
we are pushing back heavily on several budgets and instead of cutting costs
they are just planning to hold more of the allocation up at corp
some areas are better than others but essentially
the overview is moving the wrong way
up
we have no jurisdication over the corp numbers
as an aside
the technology budget is up dramatically from last year
the numbers coming from it are huge
$0mm this year
excluding europe
versus $0mm last year for the whole of enron corp
we are all over this one but progress is slow
if you want more details
let us know
see photo
we'll guarantee a minimum of $0,0 for 0 based on current price of $0,0 per data room
we will not agree to an allocation though
thanks louise
thanks
appreciated
yes
hope you saw the funny side and it cheered you up
was down $0mm in q0
did you know
i think i have your replacement for savita
amita is now free
at least she will not keep quiet
duran has to okay it
like to me with you today
ok
i know that's why i am hoping/assuming we are not going that way
i'll assume we are off standards unless you tell me otherwise
did we take the money against this from the nymex swap
did you get this
on my way down
where do i go for lunch
and the current slides you have on display i'll then do the updates to our slides and correct the errors
thanks
you have two problems
i
unwind of interest rate swap
$0.0mm
ii
mismatch of money from swap versus interest rate swap
approximately
$0mm
is not offset
louise
could you put together a list of all the enron corp employees who have enron
non-dell
equipment at home

i will send you the final one at 0
diary
thanks
woops another coming in 0 minutes
we have unsuccessfully attempted to find sponsors for the project list you gave to me in our meeting
i would therefore like to start the game again but starting from zero and working our way up
assuming we are starting with no budget for it development
please could you sit down with each of our business sponsors and agree a number with them
they are
tim belden
or his appointed person
for west power lloyd will for east power geof storey for gas laura luce for peoples and global net chris gaskill for gas fundys rob milnthorp
or his appointed person
for canada
mark haedicke/greenberg
or his appointed person
for legal
each of the above will be allocated their charge for it development and capital
apart from geof who will allocate across the desks
and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs
please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working
i am assuming its zero at the moment
thanks louise
their current capital markets stuff is going well
maybe we're wrong about them
in your previous email by the way
did you mean we pay them or they pay us
i read they pay us but carl tells me it was the other way
ats is not new origination and shows through the mpr
all the rest were too small
louise
please do
so far i have spoken to both bill and rick buy
both of whom recognized the issue and said they would try to address it
i have also just completed their budget for next year and increased the number to allow for incremental staff
i left a message for bill this morning to see if he had made further progress
i need a description of each of these assets asap
no more than one sentance on each
before 0:0am if possible on email so i can pick it up on blackberry
thanks louise
please register talk to liz/nicki to see if they want you to attend to help
only if you want to
marcello is getting very frustrated
only matthew is talking to him
all second hand

gross margin per mmbtu for 0
i think you need to push wasaff
can you chase a response on email asap
what are the units
i want per mmbtu

wahey on runway
about time
well done i think even i would have given up before now
is that what ecr want to do with it
i agree
thanks for this
it will have slow death
dave are you unwinding it
thanks
stupid though isn't it
please set up a meeting with me
geof and steve stock louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
q0 now over
you will each be receiving in the internal mail a copy of the origination numbers associated with each of your groups
please could you ensure the numbers are both
i
correct
and
ii
correctly allocated should employees have left the group or company please do not allocate the amount to another originator as this will distort the numbers
just leave the name of the employee and number in place although they have left
these numbers will be used as a
obviously only one component
component of performance review
as you know we also monitor the soft targets so please ensure these are correct too
if you want to check your progress on soft targets
these are available from faith
please send all alterations to faith killen or call her on 0
thanks louise
here's my first pass on our 0-0
spreadsheet at bottom
number 0 arnold number 0 presto number 0 sturm number 0 motley number 0 davis number 0 benson number 0 duran number 0 martin number 0 allen number 0 gonzales number 0 richter number 0 davies number 0 black number 0 herndon number 0 miler number 0 luce number 0 storey number 0 foster
thanks
i didn't get a copy of dave's email but a few comments and i attach a compromise ordering
i added to your file schoolyard
our differences are
me
don miller
joe deffner,chris foster i would put them all ahead of bernie however i have no data points apart from p&l on nothing with frank so i can't comment on him
not huge differences in order
apart from your slant on canadians
the main issue with yours is calger behind benson and zufferli
and even maybe dana
he's a future leader of this organisation
your ordering is very p&l based
are we supposed to cover wes or will causey
i added to your file schoolyard
speak to you later
louise arnold presto sturm davis
dana benson herndon motley davies martin richter black luce allen duran storey zipper foster ermis or miller gonzales
i see what you mean
with calger leading the likes of parquet etc they can make $0mm plus
without him no chance
i think it's sort of indirect p&l
i think we are close enough i'd put our top 0 above any group
our final ten are really strong too
harry
orlando and zipper as the last people on our list really does show we have some major talent
let's not stick to 0
let's do 0 putting miller,deffner
foster
zipper
ermis and aucoin in
daliney's note shows he is giving a lot to people we have in our second half of the list
that works
stop working weekends again see you tomorrow
i wouldn't mind seeing your sofa if you still have it
if you give me a time
i'll pop over
thanks louise
jean is still pushing to run wellhead desk
she may come and see you
i have pushed back stating that we are much better placed to evaluate her outsourcing business as it is and that we will review this when we have seen sime dealflow
yes to this i discussed with don
fine
i'm fine
still laughing about co-president
probably not hey dave
can i have an update on originator track
could you please get marcus nettelton added to this
thanks
why can't i consume alcohol on atkins
you should not drink alcohol during induction
but you can drink moderate amounts of alcohol during the ongoing weight loss
pre-maintenance and maintenance phases of the atkins nutritional approach
when given the choice
your body will burn alcohol for energy before it burns fat
but alcohol does not act as a carbohydrate so it will not interfere with burning fat in the same way that sugars and other carbohydrates do
alcohol consumption may also increase yeast-related symptoms
such as bloating
gas and cravings for sweets
and can therefore interfere with weight loss
beer
which contains yeast
probably has the most yeast-forming components of any alcohol
an occasional glass of wine or vodka is the best choice
scotch and other grain-based spirits are more likely to promote yeast problems
note
use only mixers that contain no sugar or fruit juices
even tonic water contains carbs and regular soda is made with sugar
seltzer
club soda
mineral water and non-aspartame diet sodas are better alternatives
louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
sorry abigail
wrong person trying to get liz taylor
i'm fine
don't worry
can you send a note out to all assistants making sure they all get the money back from astros playoff tickets
tina very ill in st lukes emergency room with possible heart attack
we are struggling through we have elp from a lady loretta
please help dave tomorrow
if you are well enough to come back
the only comment on the structures transaction slide is that
i
they are not from this quarter
ii
the rockies power
prebuild
i am not entirely sure what this deal is
but there was one in washington
iii
remove midwest gas utility outsourcing as we haven't completed this yet
hopefully you can have it for q0
iv
price risk management is your call
its really just trading
louise
ok i thought it was in washington state
hi i don't have any
jay fitzgerald managed all of that for me and we closed the group down last year
sorry louise
for diary by th eway was i invited to a prc committee meeting last week
i don't seem to have heard of it but lavo said it was on wednesday or thursday
yes
good guy
i think he is moving with marcello into their new cross commodity group
but he's bright
agressive and worth trying to get
can you resend me the doyle email from last week
as i want to go to the cantor memorial service
louise
have you done any deals yet
i will thanks
no to both
let's discuss
cris bit of an issue here
i had thought we were marking purely the intrinsic value of the options due to their illiquid nature
i really think we need to mark these down to real values unless we can prove out the value by selling a proportion of the warrants into the market
we also clearly have a write down from the number on the balance sheet which is way too high
please could you evaluate the warrants and come up with a proposal of how we deal with them
thanks louise
please move
when you get in tomorrow
move geof and steve til wednesday move hotte until end of week move calger to thursday thanks louise
i found the meeting which was when i was in chicago
please let me know when i am missing such meetings just for my information
in this case i needed to know as i have a follow up meeting with john tomorrow louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
you need to give yourself some
could you let me know probabilities on your deals on the hotlist
no rush
thanks louise
it doesn't look like you were asked to do anything
just notifying you
no is the answer though
thanks louise
i think we are missing
generation investments and mitch robinson's group
nope
get the specifics we are organizing a meeting
need written examples
could you pleae co-ordinate a full list across gas and power
thanks
it takes a long time to get around to announcements
congrats anyway
i think its a good idea
i thought a lot about it
spoken to jonathan recently
had a meeting on 0
how was it
louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
can't remember whether i thanked you for this
if not
thanks for your prompt response
i am also meeting with robert on your contract
so we should get that done today
thanks
joe deffner needs to take responsibility for reducing these costs and ensuring that our allocations are appropriate
the ones that really stand out to me are kelly boots and glisan
joe needs to get comfortable with their allocation methodology
louise
i think we are moving towards this concept
steve hotte will take over from beth perlman as cio ena
anthony dayao will remain cio ees but in addition to anthony's ees responsibilities
he will also assume responsibilty for creating a combined wholesale/retail power trading and risk management system working closely with steve hotte
on the commercial side
i am thinking beth
i have had preliminary discussions with beth and mark on her moving over to our side to manage our requirements
if you have a problem with this
let me know
i have to say finding someone to do this is a difficult job and all ideas welcome
i think beth brings a base understanding of the business and certainly should be able to drill down on it side
its a huge budget and we need someone really responsible for it
on the operations side
i have asked sally to take a large portion of the it development budget into her budget as essentially its things like maintenance
sounds like we are thinking the same thing and we have made some progress towards this goal
louise
thanks
i have used it already to tim
i mentioned the beth concept
i'll let you know what he says
jeff richter is too busy
he runs ees in the west
keep thinking though i like the idea of jeff or barry
did howard attend
if so how's he looking
thanks
feels better now
its post earnings so no feeling on a day
nope
same thing just prettier and with more details
suggest we send to hr for them to implement
i don't just mean the logon i mean the domaine name too
once you are in enrononline you need to stay on www.enrononline.com/xxxxxxxxxxxx
we can't wait for another meeting
we are in front of the ooc on monday with the enron americas plan
here's my numbers
i got them from etrade
0
0 transactions per day $ 0:0/normal transaction
including internals
options $ 0:0
per option
using option grid
take or pay minumum number of transactions per annum = 0,0,0 service interruption
outage
reduction in our bill of $0,0
less than 0 minutes
reduction in our bill of $0,0
greater then 0 minutes
per product type set up 0
its in your interest as the number of transactions is high in ena
it think this issue is for other groups
on development 0
its in your interest
i think this again an issue for other groups
now we all have the same incentive
grow the number of trades
i think this is pretty close for us
only paying once for a sleeve trade
let the games begin
louise
i went up to chicago last week and noticed the lack of flat panels in the office
we obviously have hundreds of redundent ones in ena houston
as the new building has new ones
they are going to redeploy them to you guys
free
as we have already paid for them
they are going to start with calgary and toronto
contact it if they haven't contacted you
steve harrington or jenny rub
great
two please
we only covered commercial
if you have an issue you need to ring eric gonzales
he shouldn't have had the meeting
there is a lack of integrity on this
this is great
two please
great photos is that all that's left of ebs's people in london
how many did you have a one point
just in case you didn't know yet
please could you do the following
cancel today 0pm weekly power meeting tomorrow 0pm frank vickers friday 0am brian redmond 0pm brad richter thanks louise
brian redmond or jean mrha will need to approve the budget as your number will be charged directly to them
brian or jean please co-ordinate your response through faith killen
please tell them
that i am cancelling due to the budget process
did you hear about jonathan
louise kitchen
expenditure verification you have purchased some new computer screens
any particular reason when we all get in the new building
there are a lot of people who are not enron americas
please cut them out
before matt left he deposited a confidentiality agreement on my desk which dates back to august 0
0
jaime has it now
what do you want me to do with it
sign it
as i said in the note of yesterday
i have no interest in having the meeting
my assistant is away so its just a misunderstanding
see yesterday's note
we are going in on monday
i think losing amita is a major error
there are no other candidates in the organisation with her expertise apart from zipper
forster and savita
thanks louise
today was the last date i discussed with piper
before 0pm
dynegy to run orig
in europe working for cardone
here's a little issue
we have recently needed some screens
pcs etc for new starters
obviously this is a bit of a peculiar time to buy something when we are on the point of moving
my understanding from don black
who is hiring these people
is that we have to use ibuyit to request equipment for these people rather than just get it to give us a temporary
old screens from egm
until we move
what is happening behind the scenes on this issue
do you go an buy new ones or is someone substituting ones that are now redundent
thanks louise
looks like we are making outstanding progress
this is great news
power trading or origination spring to mind
power trading is interviewing tim tomorrow
do you want me to set something up for you too
forster is running one of the power origination groups
give hime a ring
ok
fine
how are you
baby not turning over yet because he's big
lots of people falling out of ebs aren't there
how's nadine and baby by the way
he's 0 months
0lbs and not rolling over
0th percentile for weight
0th height
0th head circumference
doesn't sound like it will be long before you have another one
done
just so you know
no concerns
we managed to get about $0mm reduction the it development budget
you are picking up some of the reduced budget
see lloyd will's email of earlier today
let lloyd know if you have any problems as we are getting fairly close to sign off
thanks louise
is in town
are you seeing him
if so are you taking anyone from power
i think we need to include groups with mpr where is was originated this year
do these match ours
make sure we get at least 0% reduction
thanks louise
ok
i butt out
ebs only has a handful left now and with redundancies over there they are trying real hard to place their people
we need a back up plan for when you are away because kim is away too
louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
please arrange a meeting between ena and ees asap
title
coverage attendees from ena
frank vickers
chris calger
louise kitchen
john lavorato
david forster,dave duran
barry tycholiz attendees from ees
ring kay chapman to find out
early next week or end of this week
let me know what he said
just so you know
i am nearer the bottom of the issue
a user of ibuyit can select whether they want new equipment or old equipment
so i surveyed our assistants
obviously more than ours up here
to see if any of them knew that you could order old equipment instead of new
none of them did
including tj black who has since i have been receiving my weekly reports ordered the most it equipment
jenny's group is to some extent relying upon this selection to buy the equipment
don black's equipment was bought new even though he is about to move but will get used in remote offices where they have no flat panels
so the buying is done by ea and someone else is benefitting
as there is no way around ibuyit
i think we need a default where we use old equipment instead of new equipment
as no-one replied to my previous email
i live in hope
thanks louise
can't wait to see you
i think its a good choice
not really enough detail on specific areas where they are crossing territory
we know they are talking to munis but are they talking to utilities
we need names etc
split the list into areas industrials in our sic codes utilities munis thanks
yup
no problem
the issue is i can never find you on the address book
because of the c
louise
no
only if specified is my understanding
although on flat panels they are now trying
well
what do you think of that
i have someone who is a suplong louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
scott just sent you the message before i'd finished
so i have a real long shot for you to talk to at some point
matthew scrimshaw
i don't think he'll move to portland but he might
so an ideas yourself
nope
i would be
it was an email with scott on my lap
john's conversation with you today is what i am talking about
if so
i have a hole
do i not in portland
so i know this chap ms who won't move to portland but its worht you talking to him
should you decide to pursue john's conversation further
let's talk tomorrow
zippy trades under arnold's but if you report to john and michael you need v@r
heads up
i spoke to jonathon this evening
i confirmed that dynegy had been speaking to eric shaw at length
i think the only reason jonathan got the job was that he asked for less money

poor little kid

calger
foster
just in case we haven't invited any of them
thanks louise

john arnold asked me this morning about individuals on eol
apparently
john was told that i had a problem with this
i haven't had a conversation on this since 0
at that time i sidelined the issue as it was complex
bearing in mind everything else that was going on
i would suggest you and mark address tis together
i have no idea who told john this as i haven't had a dizcussion on this issue since 0
louise
let me know if it goes any lower
lavo called it
never mind though
yup he can do it by phone

quite boring though
i am looking forward to the salad
on my way bak
don't know i have to go
venting
too late

i can perfectly see which reports i have access to and which ones i do not
so please explain why all i can't see enron americas position report for example
i was referring to all cost centers excluding hpl
regulatory does not need to be covered by you
here's my cut on texas
do we need more
you director manager associate analyst
the only thing i have to look forward to
that'll be fine thanks
is it me and not lavo due to him maybe not attending
i think the job may still be open next year
just what i needed
i'll talk to frevert but i really thought the panel session last year was incredibly weak and don't think something of that format should be pursued again
i would hope for a major change in format
going out tonight
forward to tim detmering tim

we can review in another month or so
let me know if you are planning any of these
we recognize that we are experiencing a difficult time at enron now and you are all interfacing with our customers every day

tammie to advise on the room
please invite all of your groups
louise

by switching to paribas

this meeting will happen this morning at 0:0am
tammie is still tring to get a room

jay has been pulling reports over the last couple of days and so far so good
reported attached if you need it
the question is
with our capital constraints
is he the right guy
how's it going
any news after the revolver letter went
it is evident that our customers continue to view enron as a major liquidity provider in global energy markets
change 0,0 users to 0,0 counterparties
you are officially my favourite people
thanks
see squawk box
yes please
let's discuss how we move forward in the morning
seems like a great idea
left a voicemail for him
mike i do not think these emails are helpful
pleae direct all questions to chris calger
thanks louise
delay it for a couple of weeks at least
i really do not think this a great week for me time wise
i'll try but i doubt i will manage it
we just haven't got time this week
i assume he will understand
brian redmond is working this
keep working the deal
i left tom a voicemail
now we have the cash you can work the deals at a b it slower pace
use your judgement
i still want as much of that money as possible
thanks louise
brian is working this are you two talking
txu is off everyone else ok
tyhis is very sensitive please leave it to brian
i called tom at 0 this morning
i left a message
is that enough for this week
how much
i have no idea what this is but don't do anything fred until i find out
we need to talk about this month
how are you doing with sierra pacific
i really need it
i didn't leave strong and stable
i left a unstable but got loads of cash voicemail
having spoken to brian yesterday we need to redo his plan as most of his stuff is covered by reserves

lc wrap i need this for tuesday/wednesday
this is a the high priority
i have given lisa all the resources
we need this

she mauy have been told she had people but nobody had started
i will be checking up with lisa
is lisa doing ok on the lc wrap
what arr you up to with vince
please ring lavo on 0
in the budget numbers we had a headcount of 0
i would like a list of all of those employees of enron north america
with work numbers
home phone numbers
cell phones and pagers
i would also like the same for ees wholesale
it may be easy to do this by looking at the floor plans for the new buildings
not in the near future
is it bad
i am all over it
not good really for me as i was finally hoping to get paid this year
go slow on this
in terms of closing ref money out the door
new onecoming tomorrow
ignore the other one
sorry missing the message when are the payments and how much are they if we keep moving forward as i am not prepared to write down a 0mm loss
payments and payment dates please
thanks louise please say not soon too
attachment shows where we ended up
i really don't think it helps if we have customers read only on eol
how does that hurt us
it certainly helps them
i think you have a publicity nightmare too
we should probably talk but i am more of the opinion we'll take anyone's credit now and risk reducing helps them to keep trading potentially
aep sent us a very threatening letter
way outside of their contractual rights
do the innocuouss route and send them a letter stating you will change it at the next available/scheduled gtc change would be my suggestion
also just to confirm no gtc changes on anything for the near future
thanks louise
it never rains when it pours
finally read it
i thought it was pretty crappy
i am spending all my days in credit
head above water but only just
surely we can cover this from within virgo's team
we are not sending the money
let's discuss
ring me if you can
i'm in the office louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
but we didn't include eol
what's the story there
louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas

i'll let you know
working on peoples inventory or cash from anywhere helps
what is the number
i am very worried that you are sending a negative message on enron out of the building
it may tie but what is the difference
i think the uneven margining in mahonia 0 is costing us a lot
i'm not worried about the actual number just the imbalance in margin which hasn
t come back to us
ray essentially they are fishing its not a really good time for them to come in
but when is
its a reassurance meeting please help if you can
joe bob perkins did a lot of damage in the market to us initially
one month ago
so assume everything you say get's made public
the fact we are doing 0 trades a day still is a thing you can tell him
thanks
louise
let's get on it really seriously tomorrow
we should have at least started aep's notice period with your note today
did we send margin letters on others today as we need to

these guys tried the ken lay route
now they are part of your working group
not going well
please update daily
i need a two bedroom
seems like something which takes time to implement particularly as we do not have margin contracts with our counterparty
this changes the function of enrononline to a margin exchange mechanism
long run not a short term solution
not included in the schedule is the $0mm of lcs expiring on 0/0
just so you know
but i think the decision is obvious

unbelievable that a trading shop was brought down by rogue traders
i meant rogue finance guys
you need to stay
i am trying to get us sold
the same here now
thanks for the note
we are really trying very hard to keep the trading and marketing organisation in north american gas and power together with a view to selling it
we have a lot of interest at the moment so i have my fingers crossed
everyone is still here and to be honest i'm proud of the fact they are holding on still to see if we can compete the sale
here's a little fact
two years to the day of launch i turned enrononline off worldwide when it was in full swing
it was actually just when we had the downgrade announcement
i think it will be back though
i think i am still in shock that a rogue finance group and some bad investments brought down a trading shop
that must be first
if all else fails
i'll ring you on how to get my book published
take care
i will keep in touch
louise
we are doing commercial this morning

i left you on portland for now but obviously when we announce the strucutre it will change
duran does know though
we do need a list tomorrow morning
i am still in meetings
is is possible to email me questions

seems like a logical request
tell me 0 days is not serious

i have worked 0 weeks straight no week-ends

we have buyers
it's just gettting more and more horrible to be in the building
well actually in houston come to that
please make sure tom does does have any of hiis access shut off today by error

louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
please contact bob macauliffe to make sure he doesn't have tom cut off from an access and it perspective
its important please make sure you do this immediately you get in
thanks
piper is incorrect in the sense there is no decision on who owns the code or licence yet
eol is not for sale today
he would be a good addition somewhere
thoughts
louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
in the interests of full communication
here's an email i sent to eol
it's only a comment not a direction for jay or anything
but it was a pretty sad read for me
you are been estalked
any time tomorrow morning possible
give me a ring when you are on your way
thanks for working on this
i appreciate it
louise
i did
let's get some time tomorrow
essentially although there is still a long way to go and nothing is certain
greg has decided that rick will run a group including market risk
credit risk and research
things are too early to know whether you will report in only in that way or also directly through their credit departments which was certainly a preference of one or two of the bidders
let's discuss more
i do have some other details for you too
shouldn't we have let this group go
why are we retaining them
pay
no holidays
not even christmas
i would like to discuss a change of management for enrononline under the netco scenario
i believe that we have a very short period of time to get enrononlne back up and running and with this in mind it may be preferable to change out the management sooner rather than later
i think there is a lot of preparation work which can be done now
can we discuss
thanks
i can send you people
jay webb and jenny rub can do the rest
copies of the front to back detail process flows for the gas and power businesses done in april by it compliance department louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
what happens to the money in wachovia
louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
ohoh its all gone to ratshit
we now have a structure in place dealing with enron americas estate and ensuring that we best maximize all of our contractual and asset positions
this team will be headed by don miller going forward please help him and the team as this is our highest priority
some areas of this organization remain blank and will be completed by don and the head of the appropriate business unit
there are some areas which will also be dual tasking for a period
louise
what does that mean
firstly
i never pick up voicemail so i just got your message from the week-end
sorry
anyway enrononline
there are two versions today
we keep one in newco and the estate keeps one
two teams can be allocated for each
it works
we have enough people to do it
in terms of the estate
the estate will keep a copy of the source code and the estate will also maintain a staff on both the development side and the support side in order to ensure the service can be maintained
the source code and build process are sufficient to allow for running almost immediately
we actually have two enrononline environments today
the
staging environment
and the real
production environment
essentially we would leave the staging environment for enron
it is simply a question of staffing which i believe is totally possible now we have allocated the staff to newco and the enron estate
in terms of newco
enrononline will be maintained for newco using the production environment
with its own staff
i altered it
you don't ever need to sell to me
i'll let you know progress as we move forward
fine
working name only
just rang me
they want to meet with john sherriff and joe gold
what is going on
they are going very deep into reserves too

as you know i have business flights home each year under my contract
as i will be unable to travel to the uk due to the requirement to be in houston over the holidays i intend to use them for my parents
borther and sister-in-law
any difference in the cost i intend to cover or offset against the cheques from expenses which bounced until we can figure out whether enron intends to meet expense payments
i read anne's document
does that not work
what is john casaucoumeq's title
i take it i do not need to do this
sorry its all prepetition
i already claimed the flights
now i will not be using them as i can not go home
i am using the money to pay for my parents's flights although not all of the money will be used
the rest of the money i intend to offset against expense checks which bounced
should there be an imbalance
i will sort this out with enron once payments have been completed on expense checks
ok

i have never received any expense in my bank account
probably due to the difference in the names on the systems
this is a huge issue and i need to know how much money is missing immediately and how this gets resolved
i would think that we issued them in
kitchen
and therefore they were bounced by my account which is in
nettelton
i may be wrong if this is a common problem
i may never have been paid any
please check all expenses going back all year
this is a huge number which state they have been paid and have not hit my bank account
of the expenses showing up not cleared on my bank account i have received none of the payments which i think adds up as follows
plus i have a cheque for a prior expense which bounced which is for about $0
in pre
petition expenses this is clearly more than $0
in post petition
i also have expenses pending which will bounce if the name on the payee does not correspond to the account holder name
tammie
please work on this as our highest priority tomorrow
as i never used them
when do they get refunded
we then need to net off on expenses and reclaim the family ones
louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
so i never got paid
expenses
for my tickets home
surprize
so if i cancel
obviously as i didn't go
can i then reclaim the economy ones i booked for my parents and brother instead as i did not take my 0 entitlement
the tickets were all economy
0 x $0:0
a lot cheaper still than three business seats
louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
we will have a networked pc in the room
so choose if you want handouts or a powerpoint
kim will forward details of the room today
thanks louise
thanks
he will obviously be finally moving to houston then
clever move
have thought of a way around this
find out as much as you can on why it happened and lets discuss
the emails i sent out
please discuss the meeting and let me know the way forward
got it thanks
it will be greg whalley and i attending
greg is president of enron
john is out but will attend next week should we prrogress
see you tomorrow
thank you for all coming in this morning
i think it went very well
particular thanks to those of you who were supposed to be on vacation
please could you all send a copy of your presentations to tammie schoppe
thanks again louise
we have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the re-start/integration plans for netco
so far
we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors
several plans are in the final stages of completion including
+ infrastructure jenny rub + development jay webb + hr david oxley + cash management tom myers + credit debbie brackett the rest will be completed shortly
we now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus
john and i would like to receive the plans
re-start/integration
plans by january 0th
0 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups
the focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible
i have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but i thought it might help
please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually
customer side + customers phase 0
first week
eg top 0
phase 0
first month
eg top 0
phase 0
first quarter
eg top 0
+ action plan phase 0 customers phase 0 customers phase 0 customers + contracts by customers
pre-prepared with credit terms etc
+ customer visit schedule product side + list of products phase 0
first week phase 0
first month phase 0
first quarter target number of transactions it transfer louise
oh oh
i suppose it all went to the other bob
i thought you were robert l hall jr
groovy thanks
what is the purpose of this
can you co-ordinate weather
reg and structuring
i have some concerns we have missed out some weather models etc
i would assume 0mm for planning purposes
now you're in
no attachment
firstly
dave is not responsible for the initial creation of these numbers which was done by brad richter before dave joined the group
i presume it was based on brad's evaluations
i suggest we wait another week to see the structure of the transaction before moving numbers
we just need people to give us a week
surely they'll give us that long
how are the new designs coming
did you and avril have a nice christmas
i am trying to reconnect my uk cell phone
i have been on the phone for 0 and half hours
just when you thought it was safe
we need to start working on getting everyone together who is in netco in time for the sale of the company
the ideal move time would be either this week-end or the next
the idea is that everyone
0
resides on 0 and 0 in the new building
hr has the most up to date list of who all of the people are
but essentially the organisation is just a smaller version of what we have today
all commercial people on 0
non-commerical on 0
we would need to plan for an office to be created in the room next to mine
but hold off on implementing that piece
as the credit group is already here
in the room next to mine
it would be really good to move them first so they do not have to move back to the old building and then back
thanks
ring each of the people on the list to make sure they know they have to produce the plan below by the end of the week
let me know who you have problems contacting
happy new year by the way
no real choice
apparently there was an issue with visas so jay told them they could say no
let's revisit wednesday
i copied this email list and copied rita wynne
stacey white by mistake which obviously i shouldn't have done
eric moon resigned haedicke back in elbertson back in louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
east orig was dessimated
we really need to staff up quickly
dave has some ideas of people and costs
can you get together on getting some people
thanks louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
are you still in
louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
no
this is a serious problem ferc is just a month and probably will be expediated to less than that
i want all the transmission and pool agreements to start much earlier
what is the problem with starting the negotiation now
we really cannot accept these timescales
we have always assumed one month and all of this stuff is in place
i'll be on the phone call
let me know times/numbers tammie
get liz sager to attend
handouts only
make sure all these people get to the meeting
cool
we are ready
no i did mean duran
he told me he had a whole group of people we could bring in and he knew at what cost
tammie
please set up a meeting with chris
he needs to be in a room in portland for confidentiality
as soon as possible this morning
hopefully before or not long after the 0:0
portland time power meeting
louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
portland meeting 0:0am please could you attend
you mean shouldn't be together
good point
if you are in
please can you come to my office if not tammie please organize a dial in
i can't get attachments
please send text copy
good point
assume for now that we are running identical trading books as it should be easy to cut the ones we do not want
obviously we shouldn't bother with bridgeline
peoples or anything like that
will that work
please ask wes to come over for 0:0 or earlier
the meeting is to try and get portland back in line on timings
we clearly should not be in a position to trade physically immediately but within a month
i am scared by his approach of 0 days for interconnection and 0 for ferc
can you ask wes to bring the proforma too
0 copies
where's jeanie
yes still need it
when are you back
can you get me the calger letter done
no surprize there
it is no probs
can you talk to the appropriate commercial people and get them to decide
i'm so sorry
hope things go ok
no the weather group is the meterologists and the crude group are the original fred lagrasta marketers who were spun off under randy maffett
they will be brought back into the fold for gas marketing
so we don't need mid/back office support
fyi
no master on eol
yes
all enabling agreements need to be included
shawn we have had a lot of discussion on the contractual arrangements we would need to put in place in order to recommence trading as quickly as possible
i am working on producing a fuller list for you today
however
there is one particular contract/licence which does require special treatment
power marketing licence to be granted by ferc
in order to ensure that we start this process as quickly as possible we are looking to complete the filing documentation in advance of the bankruptcy decision on our future
our current strategy is as follows
all dates are approximate
present
january 0th
0 complete filing documentation january 0th visit with ferc
one of senior executives here plus a senior executive from our buyer
january 0th file and request an expedited process it would be extremelly helpful if you could identify someone for the head of our regulatory group
jim steffes
to co-ordinate with at citi
thanks louise
does seem a bit of an issue
who is in charge of this
robert
jim steffes will be contacting ubs through you
i did citigroup
hope that's ok
is barry pearce in the list
see below for alterations
the following people have been identified as no longer with the company although they are on the netco list
please let kari know on any changes
jeanie is out
i assume there are no problems but if so let me know
larry hunter

thanks louise kitchen aka louise nettelton
it might help if i told you the shipping address
houston
texas
usa
hr gave the list to me
i hope they are still getting paid
but what is her status now
is it coming back
louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
i needed the full list tonight
is this all i get
we are assuming all pipes that we trade today
it was someone for david
i'll sort
organisational charts have been requested by one of the potential buyers
please send to tammie by close of play tomorrow
thanks
no
please carry on
ubs meeting went ok
barry is in accounting for now
jim wants him for the estate
all of that was before you were in
i had to plan
i think barry is an asset
wes and i don't know where though
any thoughts
it's long but good
i definitely had a black mat last time
i would like a black mat again
in reality this is a picture for a friend so i will copy to her and she can order it directly based on the fact that it doesn't look like i got any discount for being a returning customer
so ellie
this is what you want with a black mat
mtx0-0 solitude
lake mcdonald $0.0
$0.0 ex gst for o/seas orders
frmm0 mount and mat $0.0
$0.0 ex gst
freight $0.0 fay
please co-ordinate with ellie
thanks for your help louise
east desk
seems marla is the contact
contracts cannot be assigned
its that simple
they have to be offered out to market under an auction like structure just like everything else
all agreements remain with the estate and will be managed by the estate
i will check with canada on their status but i presume its the same
draft enrononline relaunch timetable louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
i have asked one of our deal team lawyers to send you a copy of the document
her name is anne koehler
regards louise louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
i do not understand the netco/newco comments
clearly at this point enron the estate should maintain the space until it is sold to a new buyer
that would be a don miller/fallon final call
but i think its a no brainer
what happened to don's salary
louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
duran removed him
why was he not originally included
top 0 counterparties
can you send me the list
louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
i had a conversation with richard stuckey at citi and he is still struggling with how to do teh ees carve out
can i make the following suggestion
i think its the same again
can you come over for it
do we include a
confirmation
group in the plan
i am unsure where it falls on the front plan
louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
the lawyers have come back and ask if you are including any of your global counterparty or contract admin
have we covered this function
louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
can you do on gas and power together

following is a brief description of the enrononline contractual framework and copies of the proposed eta and pa
which have been revised from the initial enrononline versions to reflect experience of the last two years
hopefully this will assist the meeting on monday morning
contracts structure there are three key documents that create the contractual environment for netcoonline
the
password application
pa
the
electronic trading agreement
eta
and the commodity contracts in the form of
general terms and conditions
gtcs
or
alternatively
a master agreement
the pa is the only document which needs a written signature from the customer
the other documents are accepted online
password application
pa
the pa is a one-page document and is the only document that has to be physically signed by the counterparty
as opposed to any of the other documents
which are accepted online by clicking acceptance
the pa is the document by which the customer agrees to be bound by the terms of the eta and the gtcs
the pa
signed by an authorized person in the counterparty company
and approved by netco
allows the customer to obtain a master user id
the master user will be able to set up all traders and administrative users within his/her company and administer their access to various products in netcoonline
we will send copies of the pa to likely customers of netcoonline before we launch the site
the document will also be available to be printed from the website after we launch
customers will specify their initial password in the pa and must change it in the first log-in session
upon receipt of signed pa
netco will under normal circumstances enable the master user passwords within 0 hours for pre-approved customers
for counterparties with whom we are not familiar
more time is needed to run credit
legal
contracts
regulatory and tax check
electronic trading agreement
eta
the eta binds counterparties to completed transactions through netcoonline
when the counterparty accesses netcoonline for the first time
he/she will be prompted to read and accept the eta in order to proceed
the eta states that all trades done via netcoonline will be governed by the general terms and conditions
gtcs
posted online for a particular product
unless there is a master or any other agreement between netco and the counterparty in place
general terms and conditions
gtc
to be sent when the buyer is known
when a customer offers to transact in a product type for the first time
he/she will be presented with the relevant gtc
the gtc's are similar to a streamlined master agreement
in that they provide the general contractual framework for multiple transactions in a given commodity
gtc's identify termination rights
provisions for security
as appropriate
operational conventions
nominations
etc
payment periods
tax treatments
force majeure
penalties for non-performance
etc
customers must accept the terms of the relevant gtc online in order to proceed with a transaction
unless the company has a master agreement in place with netco
only one acceptance of gtc per product type per company is required
if there is a valid master agreement
then the system will not display the gtc
and the master agreement will apply
password application
electronic trading agreement
cheers
we didn't manage to touch base
let's try again next week
its the week-end so i am finally doing my emails
i forgot to thank leslie for doing these
so thanks leslie it was appreciated
can you get me the new list
buyer to handle
we'll need to adjust then
what did donnelly say
sorry only just got to read this
i sort of see eol group as getting the customers to the point of being able to click and our marketers doing the masters
looks like we will not get approval anyway
see you monday morning
what did we send
it in or out
woops
i would hope that in the negotiations of the master we can remove the confirm provision
let's discuss monday
tammy let's get together for 0 mins on monday in general
commercial and energy ops on 0
0 would be all the support functions apart from energy ops
also we need a resort of the commercial teams can you let me have a couple of blank sheets again
thanks louise
we intend to send a copy of all restart plans to our new buyer
could you please format your accordingly
thanks louise
oh good
have you sent presto's yet
did you revise this
i can't find it
let's assume pas and etas go out on 0th
fyi
chris i am sort of hoping you know about the deadline for start up plans
i know yours is slightly different but something needs to be done by tomorrow
thanks louise
who is doing the gas logistics restart plan
bob superty hopefully
why is he staying with the estate
you will be sending me a plan tomorrow for all of energy ops though won't you
my t0 is down louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
jenny can you sort this out for mike today
thanks
bob
would you sort out
can i see them first
cool
are you sure
david and ellie's outbound flight is 0
hello
glad to hear you are well
this all depends on who owns the domain name
if it is enron europe we need to forward all inquiries to price waterhouse
this is important as enron europe is no longer part of enron and the administrator has all legal claim to the name
i have no idea what happened to the sale of enrondirect and who now owns it
i would suggest ringing london and asking to talk to someone from price waterhouse managing enron direct
take care louise
harry/jay
can you help come to some conclusion on this
needs duran alteration
same with this one
keohane or someone will be on their way to new york tonight
louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
next tuesday was tomorrow
could we try for thursday as it really is onerous to get stuff through the new buyer
thanks louise
in order to get peoples up and running as soon as possible
we will need
as netco
to enter into a service agreement with the estate
can you set this up with don or jim
louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
can we meet after we are sold
things are very hectic now
how about some time in february
then you want greg piper
that is nothing to do with me
eol
if you mean the gtcs is in addition to the contracts below we require by thursday
mark hasn't left me a message but i'll put a phone call into him
financial gtc mark taylor thursday financial master mark taylor thursday physical gas gtc firm mary cook thursday physical gas gtc spot mary cook thursday master gas firm mary cook tuesday master gas gisb mary cook tuesday netting agreements carol st clair thursday power gtc leslie hansen thursday eei master leslie hansen friday let me know if there are any problems
louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
bob superb would you mind adding responsibility names to each
thanks louise
i was envisaging something like the one talked about for canada which is cancellable by the estate at any time
netco theoretically should be able to help the estate harvest the value in feb and march where the majority of the value is for this contract
where does this patent reside
in the estate or netco
diary
are they coming
this has got to be the last time
tomorrow morning a new team will arrive for due diligence purposes
tom martin will be hosting this team the schedule outline is based on initial overview discussions/presentations and then more detailed discussion can occur in individual groups the outline is as follows

louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
why is this necessary in the first place
i really do not understand why it is necessary
there is a potential that counterparties will allow us to promote a small group of individuals simultaneous to deal closure
to facilitate that process
please provide a list of those individuals you would like to promote along with a brief explanation to your hr generalist no later than 0:0 pm on thursday
january 0

please keep in mind that the nominee should have been in his or her current role for at least a year and received a 0 or better rating during the mid-year prc process
listed below are your hr contacts
gas trading and gas origination jeanie slone power trading and origination/eol amy fitzpatrick tax/accounting/legal/credit/treasury/it infrastructure sarah zarkowsky it development mandy curless your hr representative will be contacting you in the next day to review your employee lists as well as discuss any promotions
unless i am mistaken the estate is a part of this new deal
does this mean we can do without this
it is going to be really difficult to do the split
eg the enrononline patent is moving
can we take all of the history of concerning that which is on drives etc
don't know
anne we need these for netco
is it too late
i sent you all your birthday stuff a day earlier just in case we lose our email for a day if it is taken down to be cleared
louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
i had presumed it got transferred
wes could you please sort
its an it security issue
ask jenny or bob what they think the plans are
it would be better if we were near peole
solarc is the system used for ngls etc
we do not plan to convey it into netco
in terms of the court case
the whole thing is stayed pending the bankruptcy
they did try and prevent the whole netco thing but there is obviously no basis for any suit as we are not taking it
what's your address
pat for your information
i have attached the current proformas
ubs and the standard
i know john and mike have had a lot of conversations on this
essentially where we stand is that the work has been done to complete the commercial reductions
by name
but the non-commercial groups have just been reduced across the board and we intend to start the process today on how to cut the numbers on the non-commercial side
the theory was that communicating the netcolite concept was something we would not do until we had a bit more clarity
webb knows but that's about it on the non-commercial side
hope this helps
louise louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
recognize the truck
issue keeps coming up
disaster recovery there is no number in our budget for disaster recovery either space or systems
big expense
i'll just go with the black mat please
do i get any discount for repeat ordering
please order and mail
fedex
thanks louise
another one to delainey
could you pass to don miller louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
apart from the practicalities
only enron canada and enron australia have the right to trade in the north american markets
australia is in bankruptcy and therefore in default of the cost sharing agreement
so we assume that's dead
ecc is in the deal and selling its rights
so as far as the exclusive for north america gas and power we are ok
the practical issues are still huge but i thought i'd tell you this
no-one has rung me yet
just to clear up a mis-understsanding
netco does not have any disaster recovery facilities
equipment
software or people
it is true to say that netco is getting everything we have but we never had disaster recovery
netco is not getting additional equipment that the estate has to provide this function in the future either as it would mean the estate would lose functionality
in terms of our budget we only have a place holder for $0mm in the budget which jenny assumes would cover equipment and licences but not facilities or ongoing costs
assumption is that we would take this year to get it in place and budget for next year
we really are guessing too as we never had this facility before
thanks louise
yup
put in
its important could you return my books
louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
how long will it take
spoke to the deal team
they understand the economics and have gone to speak to bill
ok great thanks
margin requirementst substantially reduced if we have it
please get this printed
it is not formatted at the moment
we need to get the exotica library
it's in the docs
how do i get this done
it is in the deal
no and no assurance should be given
i suggest we kill this before the week-end
thoughts
wes colwell
fine
let him sort it
conflicted
sorry
can either of you open it
org charts were netco as we haven't decided on who is in netco light
no that's fine
any clue on numbers yet
top's support people are ringing our guys and telling them they want more people
legal
bit of an issue when we'll be cutting
no no
issue
arnold picked this group up from egm because he said they were profitable and would be a good source of income
my recommendation is to drop them as we have no systems
lawyers
credit capacity to manage them
unless i hear otherwise they will be gone
expensed them
its the old ngl group
i presume propane
butane etc
how is it going
did you get tg back to 0yr docs
a bit of light entertainment
see attached file
doubletree show.ppt
0% or less of the current group
we have a market of 0 year = $x
so we'll need more cash for less people
we may need our spare cash to fund the $0mm for the back office etc
current costs
in these plans we have expensed software and hardware which we will probably amortize
gets us around the $0mm mark
jenny what is the cost issue
this is a problem for timing of restart
can we have them until we move
that would probably be the easiest time to give them up
this amused me this morning
once upon a time there was a shepherd looking after his sheep on the edge of a deserted road
suddenly a brand new porsche screeches to a halt
the driver
a man dressed in an armani suit
cerutti shoes
ray-ban sunglasses
tag-heuer wrist-watch
and a pierre cardin tie gets out and asks the shepherd
if i can tell you how many sheep you have
will you give me one of them
the shepherd looks at the young man
then looks at the large flock of grazing sheep and replies
okay
the young man parks the car
connects his laptop to the mobile-fax
enters a nasa webster
scans the ground using his gps
opens a database and 0 excel tables filled with logarithms and pivot tables
then prints out a 0-page report on his high-tech mini-printer
he turns to the shepherd and says
you have exactly 0,0 sheep here
the shepherd answers
that's correct
you can have your sheep
the young man takes an animal and puts it in the back of his porsche
the shepherd looks at him and asks
if i guess your profession
will you return my animal to me
the young man answers
yes

we presume you do
louise

long and boring story
at about 0 we got those admins but their were no numbers in them
zeros
david and i sent them back

nice but he avoided the question
but we do have the
w
louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
we need to do the move
can we meet today
$0mm per annum
fyi
i am tired
we plan to have a conference call at 0pm sunday to discuss progress
we want to reallocate dollars which have been returned to the pool and ensure we keep the process moving and any contracts redone by the ubs team in preparation for monday
david is going to send an email with contact numbers etc for questions people may have with regard to the contracts
apart from the numbers and promotions
as all those questions need to be sent to hr
please make sure you contact all of your guys and have an idea of where they are at
tammie will contact you all with the dial in number
the meeting will be in john's office
thanks louise
message understood
we will try and accomodate derek have a good week-end
please email me the ruling when you have it
thanks have a good week-end
i will start drinking heavily
i propose a huge night out when you get back
not sure
i can't plan that far ahead at the moment
we are just in the final stages of getting the part of the business i work for sold and therefore out of bankruptcy
i work for a company called enron which has gone bankrupt
we have just sold the trading piece to ubs so we are in the process of transfer and i have no idea what the new bosses will be like
are you going
louise
david please make sure all team leaders have this or a smaller version
i agreed terms with greg can you get my contract ready for me to sign tomorrow at 0pm
thanks get then to ring greg if nec
i really want to be able to tell people i've signed
not at the moment
we have 0 spare
assuming schweiger is in
everything has been somewhat confusing recently and i made a hasty decision to put you reporting through legal
decision prompted by the community relations comment
there will a dotted line into the desks
i hope you are happy with this if not we can unwind but following many conversastions with them over the last few weeks
it really has been lou eber dealing with all the reg issues
i really believe that putting reg in the legal area is the best choice to ensure your group doesn't fall down any cracks as it doesn't have a direct equivalent in ubs
did you get your contract
louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
what's your phone number
you might want to ring port
he wants the same numbers as bill bradford
so double what he has now
there is a lot of disclosure around and so he thinks after he had bad treatment in the bonusses
the same is happening now
his number is 0 0 0
well that's ok if we don't
i have no idea what stockman's view is and heis back tomorrow
its easier to control money if we have the conversations
currently at the drug test
there is a long list of people from ene who have been here today
did you see laura's message
it reads like she is in
currently at the drug test place there are lots of ene people on the list
tried to call but couldn't reach you
i think we do need to discuss contracts for both of them and find the money for them
i am assuming from this that you are in
which is great news
i will forward to oxley to make him aware that there is something coming
i saw an offer letter to teresa staab so if we didn't give it to her its on the reserve list somewhere
david
did it go out
if so whitt is done
ok by me
as shankman would say
working ya

dear linda i apologize for not having responded earlier but i do not think i received the invitation
which is quite possible bearing in mind the difficulties here at the moment
we have recently received approval from the bankruptcy judge to sell the portion of the business i jointly manage to ubs warburg and in fact i am planning to relaunch enrononline
under our new entity
and we hope to be up and running around the time you are in germany
i am sure you understand that it is going to be a busy time for me in february combining the integration with ubs and restarting the gas and power trading operation under our new owner
i appreciate your comments and thank you for your invitation but i do not feel able to accept
i hope you all have a safe and enjoyable trip to germany
regards louise kitchen
ouch
we are off to the uk in a couple of days so we'll come and see you when you get back
what's his problem
i think he'll be done at his current offer
do you want to give him more
i told him he's reporting to you and milly and he was pleased
are you listening or video conferencing into this meeting
we need to add the word energy to the
ubs warburg
on the top left hand corner of our screen
so it reads ubs warburg energy
we would really like some ubs signs for the trading floor
can we take the ones you have here
what happened
great thanks
tammie get all the assistants to do it by the week-end
have them delivered to jim derrick and explain that they are fastow's deal mementoes which were left in his office
i don't think his picture will have reference so we'll keep it for now
thanks louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
there is clearly an issue here
we have been asking for this for weeks now
mark please help resolve
this seems to be the best way of getting on top of all the meetings
let's discuss
get ready to fax to me
we need a copy of whatever they are looking at
as i am out if you need anything please contact oxley directly
what is the name of the website where all of this information resides
i totally understand but we now have a real problem with regard to the timeline
jim please confirm to vince you are happy
0 plus percent of all of our trades are with those 0
we need to give them a defined group for day 0
i had a long meeting with their chief credit officer from londonyesterday and he agreed to put someone here from day 0 capable of making decisions i think we have credit working on 0 and we should start compiling the next list on the plane doors closing
chase back office and their restart plan updates individually
we will need to allocate individual seats early next week

thanks louise
don't worry
you're not supposed to let go while i'm away
speak to you later
i am confused
in terms of the options exercised
we covered those in last year's tax return which unforttuantely i do not have a copy of here
i am concerned i am double paying tax on these
can you check last years's us tax return which covered those options
i am contatable on 0
thanks louise
i think there are issues with this as essentially we are changing the business model
we need to hire into the areas we are lacking people asap in order to ensure we have coverage as much as possible
will your people mopve to houston
agreed
give chris calger a ring if you are serious
i hope you're not
tammie
forward this message to calger and milly and forster hello i am really concerned over the lack of approvals from ubs of our contract formats as even when we get them we have to still populate with the specific credit terms and then get them out into the market place
i am really getting worried on timing
could you guys get together and see if you can push forward on this today
try rining dinerstien and explain the urgency
i did mention to hutchins and costas that this is my main concern last week
so we should involve greg if you can't get anywhere
thanks louise
simply people
systems and floor space
back to front applications with no specific counterparty data
we have historical pricing etc but no counterparty names
you could get most of it from reuters
as per yesterday's governance schedule we will have a weekly one but for now i would suggest one on one with eber as it has be0en the only succesful route0 to date
can you give him a ring with steffes today and get this stuff moving
thanks
really you need to do it
pack everything apart from the esvl files and sec subpeona stuff
pack on ly what is in the hanging files in the cupboards and my drawers
anything outside of a hanging file leave for later
i would prefer you to do it as it needs indexing
stuff in my office hanging files goes to don miller and the rest goes to
ask legal
leave binders,etc for now
did you get rid of the deal momentoes
0 boxes
tell them they can get me on my mobiles
no problem
liz can cover
have a great time
pick up your tickets early in the day
0
0 are better than where we are now
the important thing is you need to get furniture as we currently have lots of rooms empty and they are refusing to give us furniture
the old building is a really bad idea due to the press etc
when it ends things will be easier
but currently moral would be ahuge issue moving to the old building
fine by me
i haven't got access to the cash spreadsheet here though
yes but no counterparty names
jay has it all
that's fine
i
m back in tomorrow
we are assuming we will be physical on monday feb 0 in canada
let me know if there is an issue
what would be the cost of moving etc
all the new infrastructure etc
when you say cheaper what do you mean
all in including moving etc
we obviously have the same issue here but cannot on a cost benefit analysis afford to move
i really think jeff is a bad choice
let's discuss
are you working on the new contracts
none exists today
on the phone
is it written yet
not for canada
for the us
what's wrong
both interruptible and firm
thanks
no absolutely not
where are we with www.enrononline.com
its non specific
the trades are there but with no counterparty names
no reason i can see
great news
friday unfortunately
i asked for earlier
lavo asked the same question
not yet
marcello is coming to houston tomorrow to interview for a position trading financial gas

louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
on the people
we are planning for a group to start mopnday pm as it is not as urgent as teh credit wording for this monday

i think this is one for you anne
can you help
we are going to ask kim's group to help pull information for credit
public domaine information
in order to help accelerate the credit process as his group is heavily stretched at the moment
working ya
as shankman would say
it appears they will offer guarantees but i am awaiting confirmation
thanks for your swift assistance
pat o'donnell mentioned that you guys have an issue with starting on power
what is it
thanks
canada appears to be an issue
we need to make swift progress on this
unlike in the us the contracting entity with our counterparties will not be ubs ag
london division but ubs warburg energy
canada
ltd
with the lack of parental company guarantees forth coming from ubs
this is going to be an issue
there are two main points
because of our current history our customers will not contract lightly with a subsidiary with no guarantee and secondly the credit group are asking for guarantees from our customers
please let me know how we can progress on this
louise
i'm working it
do not worry
i thought we did establish product control on friday
let's just deal with dave issues on priorities as we catch them between us
did you meet with kim
thanks louise
greg
mark and i met with the estate this morning and canada did come up in terms of the transistional services agreement

how material
we'll need the headcount for commercial people and i know legal want their assistants
hire them as contractors through an agency
fine by me
the site will go live this week-end in preparation for monday morning
i just wanted to say thanks to all of you for your hard work in getting the documentation to the stage it is at today
i know things have been very difficult but this is a huge step in moving us forward
unfortunately i do not see things getting much easier during our start-up months but i really do believe it will all be worth it and hopefully we'll have a lot of fun along the way
the commercial team was extremely pleased to receive the documentation and has set off to deliver them to our new customers
thanks for your late and long hours
louise
no questions
nice to emeet you
we will probably start with alex at 0:0pm

louise
true
oops
just a couple of suggested changes to both
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership structure of the entity
enron had previously announced that the entiy would be 0% new owner and 0% enron
we need to ensure this message is corrected as clearly as possible
that it is 0% ubs owner
on the release for ubswenergy.com
we do intend to trade physical gas and power immediately initially at least in the areas we can
so i have removed that sentence
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a particular reason
thanks louise
this is the procedure which currently is documented in the product control function concerning the validity of a signature
anything that has areas requiring information to be filled in can obviously not be
i don't think i do
i thought elizabeth said she would use a reference document
not the eei
this is just commercial
let me know if you want the rest
it doesn't work
either get something which does or set up a meeting
www.ubsenergy.com isn't working louise kitchen chief operating officer enron americas
no money has been paid into my account in expenses ever

the attached spreadsheet allows you to easily calculate eco's year-end lng inventory for a variety of cases that vary dispatch rate
# days of outage for ct0
and number of cargoes diverted between now and year-end
simply enter your assumption for number of days of ct0 outage in cell a0 and the number of cargoes you want to divert in cell a0
the year-end inventory is automatically calculated
a negative number means that you require more lng than you are entitled to receive
assuming that you want the lng tank full at year-end
0
eco will be able to receive 0% of the remaining 0 cargoes if the ct0 outage is 0 days or less 0
0 days of ct0 outage are required to result in eco being able to divert 0 cargo and still have a full tank at year-end 0
a 0-0 day outage for ct0 results in surplus lng but whether or not it is enough to market depends on how much the outage exceeds 0 days the above figures assume a 0% dispatch and 0% availability on days that eco is not assumed to be in an outage
paul
thanks
i didn't realize that you were still in hong kong
how's life
are you married
i can't remember
married life is good
different but good
paul
based on today's closing nymex prices there is $0.0 mm of price difference between ecoelectrica's 0 winter cargo commodity charge plus commodity surcharge and the delivered cost of 0,0 cbm of lng
that is $0.0 vs $0.0
this assumes we pay a day rate of $0,0/day for the vessel
jan
0 nymex is $0.0
and the fob price for lng is $0.0
let's stay in touch about the possibilty of landing a spot cargo into puerto rico in january
as we discussed
how we play this with cabot is a big issue
there could be an additional $0.0 mm of value that could be captured by eco if cabot were unable to release its right to not deliver a winter cargo
also
let's continue to think about how we make the logistics work and how we can get cabot's cooperation if needed
also
note that eco may need 0 cargoes of this size to make it until the early spring cargo
paul
i read through all of todd's e-mails regarding cou's and they all had to do with ecoelectrica
none of them contained a draft document
let's talk to clay on monday and get him to update us on dan's efforts and forward a draft document if he has one

tuesday
may 0th is fine
if we worked out a price structure similar to the last cargo
we could eliminate the price risk by paying the following for the lpg
0 mt at a fixed price
represents amount borrowed that went to april sales
0 mt based on may mont belvieu plus premium 0 0 mt based on june mont belvieu plus premium 0 and 0 mt based on july mont belvieu plus premium 0 the fixed price for 0 mt and the premiums 0,0
and 0 are under discussion with suzanne
this structure matches the cost of product with procaribe's sales revenue
question
how does procaribe get paid for the 0 days of product that goes with the progasco sale

gene
i have a methodology that gives me the answer with 0 uses of the balance 0% of the time but requires 0 uses of the balance the other 0% of the time
are you sure this can be done
for my first use of the scales
i place a total of 0 balls on the scales
0 on each side
if they balance
then none of the six balls on the scales is the odd ball
if they do not balance
then none of the six balls that were left off of the scales is the odd ball
thus
i have reduced the possible suspects to 0 after one use of the scales
is this the right starting point
second
i place three balls that have been eliminated as suspects on one side of the scales and three balls that are still possibles on the other
two outcomes
0
if the scales do not balance
i know that one of the three suspects on the scales is the odd ball and i know whether it is heavier or lighter than the others
i can determine which is the odd ball on the third use of the scales by placing only one remaining suspect on each side of the scales
if they balance
then the suspect left off is the odd ball
if they do not balance
i know which one is odd because i already know whether the odd ball is heavier or lighter
0
if the scales balance on my second use of the scales
then i have three remaining suspects
the balls left off the scales
but do not know whether the odd ball is heavier or lighter
i cannot figure out how to determine both the heavier/lighter question plus identify the odd ball in just one more use of the scales
i need two more uses
am i close at all
i hope that you had a good trip back
stay in touch

the u.s
needs to establish a very
very strong ground troop presence in afghanistan as soon as possible
until we accomplish this
we will not win over the afghan people who would like to be rid of the taliban
as of today
defection is very risky and maybe almost impossible
we need bases of operation in more than one area of the country
the logistics of feeding and sheltering and supplying these troops may be difficult but not impossible
the afghan people need our support on the ground if they are going to rise up against the taliban
we are currently losing the media war
if our ground troops were hailed as liberators by the afghan people and that was broadcast all over the world
we would start winning the war of words
we must control ground very soon
there will be casualties on our side and the american people must prepare themselves mentally
we are fighting a ruthless
brutal enemy
our resolve must increase
not diminish
when images of our casualties begin to come across our television screens
we must take down the taliban and bin laden and other terrorists around the globe or face more attacks and loss of life in the united states

eog currently has three producing wells in lipscomb co
blk 0
sections 0 and 0
according to eog
they are flowing ~0 mcfd into our 0
line through duke's interconnect in section 0
eog has recently completed a well in section 0
possibly 0-0 mcfd
and has plans to drill at least one more well
they are considering having their own tap into our line
probably in section 0
i am interested in knowing whether or not there are any other pipelines nearby that they could use to sell their gas
also
i spoke with perry frazier and i am thinking we would do the tap
install a valve and efm
eog would install the rest of the equipment
what are you thoughts
thanks
paul
perry
walt is saying the field would just tap the line and install a block valve
can you talk to sammie williams and make sure that you both agree regarding the efm
thanks

i do not propose any language at this time to cover the eventuality of children

please review attached document and let's discuss
you can make revisions to this document and return to me
thanks
paul
alton
thanks for the concern
fortunately
i transferred to one of enron's pipeline companies in mid-september
just before things started getting really crazy
this is the most stable part of the company and we will survive no matter what
although we may be owned by someone other than enron
i was also fortunate to have very little enron stock exposure
many of my friends have not been so fortunate
they are losing their jobs plus they've lost most of their net worth
andersen is tight lipped because their butts are on the line also
i don't understand how they could have allowed enron to guarantee so much debt and then keep it off-balance sheet
are you all going to port neches for thanksgiving
renee and i are going tonight
i hope that you all have a very nice thanksgiving and christmas
many happy returns
paul

laura has re-invoiced pnm and we should be in agreement now

final pricing for the subject cargo is dependent on nov-jan lpg prices
a provisional amount is due today
please base the provisional amount on a nov mb price of 0-cents
dec and jan mb prices of 0.0-cents
these prices reflect the current market
thanks
paul
suzanne
i calculate a total amount due of $0,0,0.0
that is
total 0,0,0 gallons @ $0.0 average price
please confirm

i glanced at the presentation
it looks good
two comments
0
could we use our older machines for home use
they are still very good they just aren't the newest technology
all are fast
cd ready with plenty of memory
it could knock the cost down significantly
0
i would have the cost of houston only to start with as a pilot
that would reduce our initial costs significantly even for na
i recommend that you at least know what that cost is as a fall back position
good luck
your teams hard work really shows here
mike
richard
hello from south america
i am forwarding this email from john regarding the j-block problems
have you been involved in this
what are your thoughts
if you have any ideas or can provide with some help
please follow-up
this is confidential but i thought you could help
when he mentioned this
i really couldn't remember much
amazing how the memory fades on some of the details in just a few years
mike
john
hello from south america
i just got your email and i certainly concur with jeff making the call
he has maintained a good relationship with mulva
this was a risk that we had but we did have assurances from phillips regarding performance
i don't know how much it will help however
richard harper and mary nell browning may have some ideas here but i am sure you've already gone through it with them
i am amazed how the details get fuzzy on an old project
when you discussed it
i was trying to think back to our remedies and discussions but the 0 years have made it difficult
i don't know if there is anything i can do but i'm always willing to help
good luck

philippe
i did talk to skilling about this
i must have forgotten to call you
jeff really does want it around
you were correct
is there a compromise solution here
maybe a smaller room with a control center vs an entire floor
think about items like that and lets discuss
at this point in time
lets not assume we have the option to move it from the new building
at least not all of it
one key consideration is the cost savings by moving it to ardmore
how much will it really save
those numbers a long with all the other points might bring clarity to what we should do
thanks
mike enron north america corp

joe
thanks for the email
i am looking forward to the trip and learning more about what you are doing thus how we can help
if we would have had any idea that europe could have been as big as it has become
we would have done some things differently and we can get a head start with japan
thursday sounds great and just let me know about friday
is anthony in japan during the trip
remember
i am not a technologist and therefore can't discuss technology specific applications just the business concepts and potential ideas and opportunities
a couple of other questions about the trip
do you want me to make any presentations while i am there or simply talk about our plans
also
what is the appropriate dress code
i am assuming suits but i didn't want to make any assumptions about new cultures
do you have any cultural facts that you can fax me about the do's and don'ts of both cultures
do i have clear instruction how to take the train from the airport
i normally get a driver
i am uncomfortable in new countries that i can't speak any of the language
if there is a way to get lost
i'll find a way
one more item
could you please have your assistant set up a message for me at the hotel
i am usually very stiff and sore after a long trip and it really helps
make sure it gives me a enough time to arrive to the hotel after the trip
i would also prefer a female if that is acceptable to the japanese culture
thanks
mike
julie
looks great
please make sure the video is also in there
i'm doing better but very week

i am writing this from my bed and i am improving

0st meal since sat
but i think it will be fine
i'm definitely in recovery mode
i am having everything messengered out to my house later this afternoon but am concerned about contacts and getting to the hotel
i know you have said that it is easy to take the train and the bus but i am concerned about it
especially if i am still a little under the weather
i still don't want to have a car
but would you please set up someone on your staff to meet me at the gate and escort me through the process
sorry if it is a pain but i think i might need it and it will make me feel much more comfortable on the flight over knowing that i will have assistance
thanks for your help and i'll see you soon
mike mcconnell
allan

a couple of other thoughts and ideas for monday's meeting
i would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines
personnel responsibilities and key action items
i think this is another good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and assignments
andrew parsons sr
director
and superior performer
is a great and very smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort
you will like him and he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team
even if it is for a couple of weeks
he wrote the it compliance process chain and could reverse engineer difficult parts that are unique to the ariba platform
he has others on his team that could help and i've asked him to think about his existing aa resources that are available
some are working on clickpaper already
other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the short run
beth pearlman
john tollefson
it
bob schultz
lk said she could spare him without delaying phase 0 roll out
dave forester
not a good option because it would definitely set back phase 0 roll out
mary solmenson
scott mills
berry pearce
david port
david sweeny
sally beck
advice and discuss additional resources
i did ask louise to jump in
and i know you did too
to help on some quick thoughts on process and lessons learned
i saw the process maps for eol and i think they
or the simplified early versions
are very important and key to a successful launch for clickpaper
i went by to see mark palmer
he was out
and left him a voice mail on the marketing effort and what margarat allen is doing
i wanted him to make sure that he understood the importance and priority of this effort
i also talked with beth pearlman about helping out
or assigning john tollefson
and i told her that we would be talking about this on monday afternoon
do we need to have alan aronowitz or mark taylor look over the agreements to add a trading perspective
a few thoughts
see you tomorrow
mike
greg
fyi
i'll give you a full update on monday afternoon via voicemail
we are on our way
monica
this looks ok
but i can give you more accurate and more up to date slides for the future
one important fact
we do not distibute the eol slides to the general public
normally what we do is present the story but do not include hard copies with the conference hand outs
mike
thanks
enron north america corp
cathy would you please review daily for updates and make the changes on a running list
i'll read for info only and you can update them
after i read them and waiting 0 day
i'll delete from the system
thanks
mike
cedric
as a follow-up to our meeting
below are a few comments and ideas regardinthe net works piece of the analyst presentation
i know i sent you a lot of data and presentations
here are a few pages inthe various presentations that i think may be appropriate for the presentation
or pieces of them
including
why enron
recent enron ecommerce experience
lessons learned
business strategy
target market criteria
enron today/enron tomorrow here are a couple of other thoughts and ideas
we need to emphasize our new businesses outside the energy business
obvious
clickpaper.com will be out and live just before the analyst meetings
this is very exciting and could take the industry by storm
eventually
especially with jeff,s comments with the analysts
thisshould be emphasized with the metals piece
the concept is that here are 0new areas where enron is going to change the
old economy
businesses andindustries
clickpaper will have real time pricing which is different thanall the other 0 existing sites
all of the others are charging 0% fees fomatching buyers and sellers in a bulletin board or auction type of transactions
we will also have that functionality
and will charge 0% or $
we,ll update you later
but will also have an eol type of real time pricomponent
this piece will be free
this piece will not be ready for july0th but will be announced publicly and in final development stages
shouldbe out by end of 0rd qtr
i believe that the link with net works with bopaper and metals is very important for providing a more complete picture than just metals alone
also for your information
we are working on 0 acquisition deals that will be coming out soon
0 is to buy a mill and coulbe announced next week
which will also clarify and add to the story since we will have access to physical pulp and paper
paper must be an important piece of the presentation
greg piper is the md for clickpaper and he cananswer any other questions and fill you in and answer more questions
he can be reached at ext
0
also
on the
target markets
page
i would reorder
put lumber underneathpulp and paper and think about separating the others as potential markets
that way we could actually check off the top 0 as
done
and the others arein
incubation
and examination stages
please draft up your initial thoughts on these items and send me the latestversion and i,ll add additional commentary
i will be in all next week
thanks
mike
mark
as discussed this morning
when does cedric get back
i can go through them in more detail but i thought these would help
mike
mike
thanks for the response
yes
i would like a complete review of your initiatives
please call cathy at 0 and get on my calendar for a 0 hour update
thanks
mike
rebecca
philippe being the only other corp officer within the large technology organization has an enormous volume of contracts to sign
a large bulk of the signatures that are required come from two areas
infrastructure and ena
i would like to have 0 current vice presidents within the business units made corp vps
beth pearlman and jenny rub
can we make this happen and when would it occur
thanks
mike
they look fine to me
there is a lot there
not
i know that is the plan
i'm kidding
mike
i don't think you got a copy of this
mike andrew
please make sure jeff gets a copy of all of everything
he is the office of the chairman sponor of the vertical and will be managing this process with greg piper until launch
i stepped in while he was out of town on holiday
rebecca
ouch
thanks checking
sorry for being out of the loop
i'll let philippe know
although he should have already been aware of this
mike
fyi
i got this from mike late last week
any comments
it looks very early in their development but mike may want them to talk to a couple of people here about their site
we need to be helpful if it will help his business
dan are you up to speed on this
if not please call him and get his viewpoint as well
mike
guy
fyi
is anyone familiar with this
mike is looking for some feedback
it looks very premature and not worth a lot of time but he may need us to talk with them to help him with his business down there
any comments
mike
steve
here is an email from mike
are you up to speed on this
what do you think
please provide some quick feedback via email
thanks
mike
thank your email
i am forwarding it on to robert jones
vp of hr for the net works group and he will make sure that it gets wide distribution for possible positions
mike mcconnell
fyi
please forward as you feel might be the best fit for consideration
mike
please set up a time for us to meet
meet only
please put him in front of some meeting so it cant go on to long
thanks
m
i could make the atlanta conference on oct
0
0
the presentation would be similar to the one i am going to do in sept
would that be a problem
actually
i thought the sept
conference was aimed at this type of crowd as well
mike mcconnell
i am working on the presentation for the analyst meetings that are taking place july 0-0
enron net works is being featured and as part of the overall story skilling wants to see some basic information on your businesses
and a few other possible verticals and market places
please provide me with these 0 specific items of information
0
total market size for your business
e.g
pulp and paper is approx
$0 billion
0
your target market share of that total 0
targeted
or other comparable
margin that you would
or could
expect to see i realize this is subjective but i do need an answer to all 0 questions
put any explanation that you feel is important or needed
also please quote the source of the global market size
when i get all the information
i'll go through it with everyone
we also need to get the global size of the markets that we are considering moving into and if you know any of these below
please let me know
data storage grains petrochemicals steel logistics thank you for your quick response
mike
mike
i just had my schedule changed dramatically for tomorrow and will not be able to talk
how about friday @ 0am
sorry
but we have a situation i must get involved with and change a direction
i did review the email
and passed it on to others
i do not see much from this site nor how it is actually going to develop real liquidity in the market
if there are a couple of items that you want me to specifically be ready for
please send me a couple of comments via email or voicemail
thanks
mike
mike
i agree with your assessment on keeping tabs on them but currently i don't see any real opportunity or decision to spend time or money with this effort
i have received feedback from others in the group as well and they agree with our general thinking
have you talked with louise lately
we are announcing today that we will be pushing our pricing to other platforms in the us
therefore we keep all the liquidity of their markets
maybe this will apply to these guys
someday
certainly it is not appropriate now and with your domination concerns it might scare them even more
my time is very limited next week and i am double booked most of the time
i'm out wed
sunday and then the analyst meetings begin after that
i really don't have time to meet with them especially if there is not real deal pending
is there someone else that is more appropriate
maybe someone can take them through eol
if you like that
please call louise and co-ordinate
thanks
mike enron north america corp
steve
fyi
here was my response to michael
i was surprised that you didn't know about this but i probably shouldn't have been
let me know if you have a different opinion
mike
gary
below is some information that might be of assistance to you
i don't think that i sent this to you when i got it
if i did please ignore this
d'arcy carroll
works for us in s
america
came to us from cargill and knows a lot of people there
he has a couple of names that i have passed on internally for consideration but i am sure they didn't go to the right place
on a recent trip to sao paulo
many of the ag products came up in meetings as good opportunities for enron to go in and change that industry
coffee
orange juice
grains and sugar were brought up a lot
d'arcy may have traded an ag book for cargill
i can't remember
anyway
i am passing this message and names on to you for consideration
a phone call to d'arcy might also be worth a few minutes of your time
he knows a lot about cargill and has an opinion on how to capture their markets
mike
cp
would you please follow up and get the right forms to fill out
i willgive my $0k
thanks
mike
lisa
i am now catching up with some old emails
i've been out of the country for quite some time
what is the status on this
what got approved and how much
do we still need more for ted
mike mcconnell
thank you for the email
i have forwarded it on for people's consideration
mike mcconnell
richard
life does move on
what is malcomb thinking
can you imagine intentionally working for and believing in jonathan legg
hope all is well
mike
steve
thanks for the voicemail
i was surprised that you were not up to speed
although i probably shouldn't be
please talk with joe and get is view on this
i left michael an email on my view
which is that it looks very early and i don't think it is worth our time or money at this point
certainly he wants to maintain a good relationship and watch them and maybe you can help with that
let me know if you get any other news
thanks
mike
jeff
fyi
i just got this from tom
we don't have a very big opportunity here
tom did tell me that his numbers were going to be difficult to get
not that i don't want to put $0 trillion on our chart
but what do you think we should put as market size
nat gas
power and our existing verticals only
what do you think
he is the only one to give me a number yet
i am going to discuss it at the staff meeting
mike
john
we have discussed i0 in the past but we need to take some action steps to make decisions and move forward
here is what i want to see done in short order
meeting with all key technologist on the full suite of products and functionality with complete demonstration by i0
i would especially want pb
jp
bp
he
and jg from george's group
follow-up meeting
after the technologists see functionality and form opinions and possible applications
with key commercial leaders
gp
p&p
tg
commoditylogic
bg
metals and steel
jf
new markets and investments
as
new markets and bus dev
during that meeting
we need to have some real players with i0 there to brainstorm and discuss business expansion opportunities in the specific verticals
it would be good to actually have this meeting in dallas but i am concerned about attendance
i0 owns the process and supply/downstream management in these industries and we need to really look to see if our combination can accelerate our new efforts and solve any logistic issues
put together an action plan
george's group has already put a presentation together about i0
the products and possible applications
george
please sent that to john
i would like that document to be our updated business plan for i0 to be used as a
living
document as we move forward
assign someone to make and co-ordinate the use and full deployment of those products
utilize our $0 million spend
i want someone to have the responsibility for i0 and he or she can also work with ebs on what they are doing also
to be clear
we have spent the $0 million already but are not using the products
i want to deploy all
if possible
and make this investment fully utilized
i do understand that we don't drive businesses around a pre-purchased product but we should look at is as a sunk cost and rationalize why we shouldn't use if rather that simply considering it as an option
jason robert
0
0-0
was at the dinner with sanjiv
greg brady
jeff and greg and he knows some of the mutual objectives
he would be the guy to work with and set it all up
ebs should be involved as well
rex shelby is spending a lot of time with i0
weekly visits
and should also participate and use their products as well
is there an application for all of ees and their business
remember
ken lay is considering joining their board and we should be able to give him very clear insight on their products and how their company works
pb
if you want someone outside pavetto's group to work on this that is fine but i want to understand the background and how they will make this happen
thanks and please let me know your initial thoughts and timing
if you need to have me send out an email to make sure that everyone understands the priority
please draft up and i'll send out
mike
market size is in the presentation
thanks
i want you to pick the number you want me to reference as our potential market share target and a potential margin number extrapolated from that
please respond asap with what you feel comfortable with
thanks
mike
its on my calendar
here is a draft of the jay announcement
what do you think
mike
jay
i like it
two questions
0
you didn't address how our investment group will work with other groups
specifically
eel
ena will
may
be different than how it works
and approves
investments with the investments from the other business groups
0
you still called it steve's group
do you want to address the issue more directly or leave it more ambiguous
what are your thoughts
mike
greg
fyi
this is a draft org announcement to clarify jay's and now alan's rolewe have discussed this before but i think this is important to send out andofficially address
it is intentionally very brief and informs people of the new situation
please let me know if you have any comments
i would like to send out this week
thanks
mike at enron net works
it has become clear that we have a tremendous opportunito utilize our unique strengths
skills and new business efforts across anentire new set of opportunities being created in the private equity marketsbecause of this
we have reorganized the enron net works investments groupwith the view to leveraging the group better across strategic opportunitiesin the ecommerce and technology space
and within enron
effective immediately
jay fitzgerald will take responsibility for settingenw,s investment strategy and the implementation of that strategy
repoto him in this new role will be steve horn and the venture investing group.further
alan sommer will be joining jay,s team to focus on developing nmarket opportunities
with a focus on working with the various domestic andinternational enron business units to develop ecommerce-related businessesand strategies
jay will be relocating to new york city and will be working both out of thenew york and houston offices in his new role

jay
howdy from houston
i bet it is cooler in ny
i don't really have any other ideas as you addressed below except i changed the word
his
to
the
investment group
as far as other clarification of duties
i don't have any issue with it
but every ceo will call me and ask if this is a change in how they deal with alan or investments
what is the status with steve and how the group is organized
did you talk with him and let him know that he is a stand alone dealmaker with an area of concentration
is that your official assigned work number
if not
we need to get one assigned before the email goes out
also
i am assuming that this is in the mg office not the small enron office
is that accurate
greg and i both think that the mg office is the best location and will help them assimilate with enron
thanks
mike ps
good luck in the move
jeannie
thanks for asking about my dad
he is doing very well after surgery which we believe was successful
my kids loved it
the really enjoyed learning about dad's work and what i do
i think that this is a very important event because we all spend so much time here at enron
i have two children claire
0 and michael
0
they both look forward to the event and talk about it for weeks prior to the actual day
actually my daughter talks about it all year long
also they really can identify with enron and talk more about it because of events like these
mike
cp
please forward quote to jdf for their consideration
mike
it looks fine
thanks
mike
mary
i would say a couple of things
i describe enron's unique culture using adjectives like
empowerment
innovation
innovation on steroids
high energy
exciting
challenging
cool
a great place to work
each one of these can be made into a sentence and/or a statement
i hope this is what you were looking for
mike
jeff

sorry for the slow response but i got the latest word on voicemail while out here in sf
they completely screwed up my order
not ron the guy from mercedes usa
but the dealer
ron has stepped in and followed up himself and i'll be receiving a 0 in late august/early sept
he is a good guy and is trying to make up for the major dropping of the ball
my sales guy that blew it is no longer in that job
hopefully it will be coming soon
i'll believe it when i see it but i am very excited and it was a real let down in june when it didn't
arrive
thanks for asking
we'll talk soon
mike
chris
thanks for the email
i certainly understand your situation and perspective
give me a call when you return and we can discuss it
we do have a lot going on in net works and we may have some additional clarity on our direction and priorities when you return from your trip
thanks for your tips on sf and for offering your home in the wine country
maybe we can take you up on it another time
mike
matt
i did receive it and sent it on
if you don't hear anything please let me know

mike
cp
check out my emails
as you can tell my trip wasn't all fun
i was obviously able to make the system work from the hotel
finally
i left a few emails from various speaking forums
would you please follow-up on them and delete items that we dont need anymore
thanks
mike
pop
i got this today but there wasn't any message
was this a test
you are so high tech now
mike
joe
thanks for the email
project summer does bring up some big questions and issues and i am not up to speed on the current thinking
we'll talk later and i'll find out the issues and viewpoints
on your other issue
i understand and we'll discuss
thanks
mike
joe
it worked great
thanks for all your help
mike
fyi and evaluation
attached is a business plan from the calme group
please let me know what you think
they are trying to play ball and sent this to us
also they are beginning to call me
i had planned to send this to you while i was out but it wouldn't go thru properly from san francisco
allan
please give her a call and let her know you received it and let her know your overall impression
by the way
karen is david haug's new fiancee
thanks
mike
cp
i want to get this out this afternoon
after hours
i want this to go to ena
enw and executive committee
mark and david
below is my first stab at the organization memo
i didn't over focus on specific wording and i am not sure how you want to address the various groups that will be affected
i believe we need to address all of them by name and they should probably be in alpha order as to not upset anyone on the order
i also didn't know any other information that you may want to include with regard to the successes from the group year to date
greg
jeff and i are getting together for lunch tomorrow to discuss the new works organization
i think that this should come from enron's office of the chairman vs
the business units because it does affect 0 different lines of business and it will have more impact and clarity for the other groups especially
my departure from net works
after you guys pretty this up
and destroy it
please send it back via email and i'll make sure and coordinate with whalley
thanks
mike
i see we passed $0,0,0,0
that's a lot of zeros
congratulations
who would have predicted this when you got called back from your plane trip to work on this new trading idea
you should be very proud
we all are
mike
mark
here is the org memo draft we discussed
i sent it to you yesterday but found a rejection notice on your address this morning
here it is again
i'm in all day and tomorrow if you want to discuss
mike
steve
sorry i missed you yesterday
there is a lot going on here and in s america and we can probably discuss it next week
i agree with your assessment of and the need to clarify roles and implement the business plan
we will address all but there are some things going on that make it appropriate to wait a little
if you have any questions you can address them with joe but i would wait and keep moving forward on your daily business and projects
i like the plan and we will discuss my comments next week
thanks
mike i am in most of next week
david
thanks for the comments and updates
i didn't know exactly how it was structured
i am waiting on the revised draft from frevert
after i get that one i will circulate it to greg for his additions for the net works pieces
i don't believe that we are going to add shankman to the executive committee right now
i am assuming the same is for lavo
there may be an appropriate time in the near future to make changes to the committee and they may be considered then
i don't think they want to add any additional people at this time
mark may have a different opinion and if he does
i am sure he will add it
i do think we should add that mark is chairman of all the organizations
thanks
mike
mark and david
david i got your latest comments this morning
i like them and added the correct enron net works changes
i will send this to greg and jeff immediately to work on the enw piece
i am sure they will add to it and change it
thanks
mike ps
mark
i haven't seen your draft
what do you think about this one
greg and jeff
attached is the draft announcement for the organization changes
i am sure you will want to change the enw piece
so far the focus was on the wording from the wholesale side but the titles should be correct for enw
please provide your comments and i'll make sure they get included correctly
thanks
mike
david
attached for your information is an email from the ceo of six foot studios
this guy is the brother-in
law of robin gibbs
one of the top litigators in the country
robin and his firm is used a great deal in our key cases for enron
this looks like a cool company but i have no idea if you have any interest in his company or it's products
i do
however
need someone to follow-up with him
even if it is a polite discussion that we don't have any interest
we need to respond in some manner
i forwarded this a while ago but he didn't hear anything
he is successfully getting in to companies in houston and compaq is a big supporter
i hope there is an opportunity here
thanks
mike

chris
claireand michael were up last week for lunch and we all came by to see you but ocourse you hadn't moved yet
it will be fun
on the memo
i am fine with it and like the changes mark put on the drafts.i do have 0 issue to talk to him about and that is the emissions piece whicnow appears to have separated from the coal group
i will talk to him abouit and see why that has changed but other than that business call
it is fine
i was just with skilling and i think he is ready for it when you geteveryone's comments
mike
david
thanks for the email
on metals
i believe all of that will remain under john sherriff and not our new group
paper will remain in na as well
both will be re-examined at some point but not now
i like cindy as well
she sounds fine to me
who is better
cindy or hoyt
do you want me to co-ordinate with cindy while you are on vacation
thanks
mike
thanks for the email
reorganize and grow this business
not me
upon first look
this business appears to have huge opportunities and ones that can be executed upon
especially if they consider themselves a core business
it will be a big challenge but we will make it work in a big way
a lot of people have tried to make this business work
i'll follow-up on treasury connect
thanks for the heads up
by the way
science is gary's passion and he has an undergraduate and ms in chemistry
he might be an interesting guy to get involved
at least at the edges
with this project
i told him about it and he really would like to get invited to the next meeting
what do you think
it always helps to have an avid supporter in a new business
mike
tom
as we discussed

it was nice getting caught up
mike
greg
listed below is a brief outline of some of the key items that i turned overto mcmahon
i didn't attempt to put down anything but a reference point buhe has the files and we went through every point
we didn't spend a lot oftime on the international activities because a great deal of it might not bpart of the group after project summer
he attended my
his
monday staffmeeting and he got a flavor of the group and what everyone does
this isgoing to be primarily philippe's meeting now but he is going to attend toprovide needed commercial balance and if he does
i believe that is all thetime he has to spend on that side of the business
i hope you are having a successful trip

fyi
here is the latest draft of their business plan for your review and commentary
i had the video call yesterday and went through all the org changes
i did not provide any commentary on the specifics for obvious reasons
mike
john
thanks for the email
it was great hearing from you
this job will be fun and it will be odd to return to the energy business after my last year in technology and the new economy
i am glad to hear that all is well with you and your family
i don't have a trip planned currently but i am sure i'll be in london at some point during the year
i'll give you a call
cheers
mike
louise

i dothink there is a lot to do in japan and all of asia
i won't be a strangerit is a very interesting job and it was a tough decision to accept it

good luck and i'll see you by the end of the year
mike
i would be happy to participate

mike enron technology
jay
i think that should be looked at and re-evaluated
the way i had it
as
pb
db and i
we had commercial and it infrastructure covered in 0 call
all attended the video calls but i primarily drove the business activities and co-ordination
i had envisioned allan and your group taking over directly pre my change and pre other international ongoing activities
i suggest that all of you re-look at it and do what you want but there are obvious big changes coming that will affect your decision and how we will approach the business opportunities
i believe they are a great resource for future development and they really appreciated the communication effort and we really helped them
good luck
mike
ted

thanks for the email and raising this issue

i'll give you a call when things settle down
i hope all is well with you and your family
mike
brandon
i told mcmahon that i would sign it so please forward on to me for execution
thanks
mike
jonny
thank you so much for the email and kind words
i was very moved by it and you know i feel the same way
i have become very reflective with the more
success
that i have been fortunate enough to receive
i am so thankful and appreciative and although i have always been religious and spiritual
it has grown more deeply
i see so many people that have lost their perspective and i pray that i will remain grounded and truly appreciate the blessings that our family has received
chris and i often discuss how we can help others and what can we do to really make a difference
the jones and the mcconnells are truly very lucky
thanks
and give my love to your family
mike ps
what about ou
texas
do you have any ideas or plans already in the works
fyi
mike
kevin
a quick question before our meeting
didn't we have a little different form that you used at hpl
i thought i remembered a little different version of the contract approval sheet
one that had more detail and description of the risks
thanks
mike
dave
per my voicemail
please give me a call on this
mike
dan
thanks for the email and quick response
i am in the process of discussing this with various people
a couple of observations that have become clear and i want to pass them on to you
overall
the size of the transaction is not going to fly
if we brought in other players and significantly reduced our exposure and the other players validated the technology and overall play
it would increase the odds that we are interested in this type of deal
rick buy stated firmly that jeff will not be interested in taking this type of deal to the board especially with what just happened with ecogas and kafus
i called george last night and touched on these topics but they have been reconfirmed this morning
i understand that the deal is very active and needs to move forward now
but i think we should inform pacificorp that we will not take the entire deal
last night george stated that he may not want to tell them that and i agreed
but upon reflection
i think that needs to be re-addressed
the original deal size is doa and if i really believe that
then not passing that information could hurt us in getting any size deal potentially closed with these guys
also having them assist in bringing others to the table might be beneficial
i'll keep you informed as i move forward and learn more
mike
dan
i have read the synfuel marketing plan
it is excellent work and i would like to see this duplicated
or amended
with aig or other concepts like this as they develop
thanks
mike
pup
that sounds great to us
i take it you are not bringing the kids
have you already made reservations and a tee time
who else is included in this
also
am i interfering by inviting ourselves in your plans
mike
i agree
congrats
mike
lea
i like this and it gives us something to start with
let's us this as a
living
document and expand it with the thought that we can present this to ken as a presentation
a few thoughts
add a section of what the collection will not be
e.g
not so contemporary that majority of people will have a very negative reaction
understanding that not everyone will ever agree on everything address a few ideas on key locations and options per key areas
for example
0 key large major areas could contain the following themes
0 large painting by commissioned contemporary recognized artists
present a few artists as options and ideas
key trading areas
could be modern and high energy to reflect the culture or the opposite
more serene commentary as a balance
pick artists as an idea
address key themes
trading are will have xxxx
individual business unit common areas can be distinct to their culture with guidelines such as xxxx
describe the area reserved for enron memorabilia
general theme considerations and guidelines
innovation
global
as you've already addressed list out options with front entry area
nevelson
address old building and what we are going to do with the collection
for example art work will be more consistent within business units and will be re-aligned
common areas will link with new concepts and themes a few thoughts on budget and generally how it will be spent as a guideline
e.g
0% will be spent on 0 key areas
0% on trading floor areas
timeline and the need to start now update
rc set up and ready
funding by andy fastow i hope this helps and gives you feedback as you wanted
with jeff and my new responsibilities
we have even less time to spend on this then before
we should discuss and address now so that it is fair on you and we put that plan tougher as well
thanks
mike ps
i'm sorry but i forgot to address the sponsorship idea you had
if you still feel strongly about it send me an email and i'll run it through the channels
paula
thanks for the email
i do have a question
i am talking with these folks because of your personal reference but how does this work with project summer
although we don't talk about this
i have heard
not first hand
that there will not be an opportunity for people transfer because of the deal
i don't want to waste anyone's time if this is just an exercise what is the scoop
mike
jeff
attached is the first draft of the first organization announcement
please add your changes
ideas and corrections and return to me
once you have provide comments
i'll send to sally and brent to make sure all of the that part is accurate
also i have a call into jere confirming the move on the corp insurance piece
i didn't but in anything about cindy skinner
go ahead and add that as well
please don't hesitate to make wording changes
i don't have any pride of authorship here
thanks
mike
this year may be more fun
we are very thin and if our qb goes down or doesn't perform
it will be a long year
it will definitely be more fun however
dons loss was a shock to all of us and his family is in our prayers
he was a very nice man and his sudden death woke us all up about our priorities
mike

mike
greg
i didn't realize you were doing that
that's great
i am sure they need your help
so few people are willing to give back to their old collegiate experiences
my thanks as a sig ep
i just changed jobs within enron
again
and have had a wild and difficult morning and your email made me chuckle
i have done a few things at ou
and may be coming up in sept
for a speech
and i'm not sure what pictures you are talking about
the business school took some pictures and so did the energy management program
the old plm school
but i have not seen them nor do i know what they did with any they took
if you are talking about a formal picture
i could provide one with my corporate bio if you need it for some reason
thanks for the chuckle
mike ps
i have been called a lot of things including
that god damned mcconnell
but that is as close as it gets
george
thanks for the email
congrats on the getting non-binding bid
i think
when we get a chance
after sempra closes
please set up a meeting with all of us and frevert to discuss in detail
also include jeff donahue
you are aware of my concerns and issues and we need to discuss them in great detail before we move forward with pacificorp
mike
everett

the rest is history
enjoy
mike ps
we are way to similar
greg
thanks for the clarification

storagefacilities and control of information keeps coming up as a possible way togain a competitive advantage

mike
yes
i thought it went well also
we can find a way to get a long term commitment from eott
thus changing their organization
without taking on the price risk
on the hiring
i think that is a good idea
if it is put in a way that due to the extensive growth that we expect to have
you want to be in the hiring loop
i don't see how people can object
it is not a trust situation but an additional reference point
we are here to help

cathy phillips it is my sincere honor to once again lead the enron team in this year's juvenile diabetes foundation
jdf
walk scheduled to take place on sunday
november 0
0
at the sam houston race park
i continue to serve on the board of jdf representing enron and will be enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts
as many of you may already know
i am an insulin dependent diabetic myself
even though i know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day
i cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease
taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications
insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die
enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for jdf again this year
jdf is a very efficient organization in which approximately 0% of all money raised goes directly to research
enron's goal this year is to raise $0,0 and we need your help
enron has been the number 0 walk team for 0 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place
we need team leaders
walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal
the theme for the walk this year is
knock out diabetes
and we would like to have you join us for this great event
the walk is truly a blast and we had about 0 enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it
if you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader
or if you would like to make a pledge
you may call any of the steering committee members listed below
if you are interested in being a team leader
please contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included in the first important and informative training session taking place this week
thank you very much for your support
mike mcconnell steering committee members

the bigger issue is what are we going to do with ee&cc
if their time is coming and we need to split them up then i would agree with this but otherwise i am not sure this is the best thing to do
i have had very little actual work with ee&cc in the past year and can't really comment on their effectiveness
mike
thor
i've been out and forgot to call you back
sorry for that
i'll take a look at the plan when it comes in and if there is some other information that jeff or i want to see
we'll let you know
thanks
fyi
i've had a meeting with oxley on this
ron
thanks for the great news
also thanks so much for the gifts that i just received
i wrote you a separate note on friday
but i wanted to thank you again
the car is great and it arrived in a time of chaos and was a very pleasant distraction
i am gathering information on my bmw so that i can sell that to the dealership at the same time i pick up my new car
i will have all my lease information with me
i have a few months left on the lease and will have all the needed information to complete the transaction
if you would
please forward this to or let me know who i should deal with at the north side dealership
i don't want another bob brooks situation to occur
also i don't want him dealing with the purchase of my bmw since i believe he is in that part of the dealership now
i expect a fair price for my car and with our history
i don't want him involved in pricing my car
i am confident that someone else will be better to deal with and will give me a fair deal with my cash purchase for the cl
i guess i just need a name at the dealership
thanks
mike
congrats to all
jeff and i believe that eol is a vital part of growing our businesses and your focus is appreciated

too close to last year
george
i would like to have a brief
0 minute

thanks

stan horton has been invited to attend a series of meetings associated with ingaa in tokyo
i believe that stan is the chairman of ingaa
there are some tokyo companies that are a part of the organization
bill smith
ceo of sonat
now el paso
and will be talking about lng and japanese requirements and will be going to tokyo
stan has asked both sherriff and me if this is worth his attendance
i thought you would be the best answer to that
i also told him that you could represent enron very well in any meeting in japan
please call stan at 0 0 0 and discuss with him
he can fill you in better on the details
your call
thanks
mike

i just realized that i didn't return your call on friday
i ran out of the office on friday after two difficult days and had cathy collect all my stuff for my trip
jeff and i landed in singapore last night at 0am
it is odd leaving for the airport on sat
morning and arriving on monday morning
and are in the office for a while this afternoon
i'll give you a call a little bit later
if your call is urgent
please don't hesitate to give me a voicemail if our time zones don't match up
thanks and sorry for the delay
jeff
i don't know if you got this
what do you think
interesting background and info for net works or our moving into the chemical business
mike
mark
attached is the information you requested for your presentation to the analysts
i didn't know exactly what you were looking for
so i listed out a lengthy laundry list of facts and philosophies for each group for you to pick and choose what information and style that you wanted
i didn't attempt to put this in a final set of dot points
i realize that this is a lot more than what you wanted but i didn't know your other pieces or what was needed to be consistent with the other sections of the presentation
i hope this is what you were looking for and i apologize for the delay
if you want anything else or more specific types of other information
please let me know via email or preferably via voicemail in houston
i'll be singapore until wed
evening when i arrive in toyko
i am 0 hours ahead of houston time
thanks and have a good trip
let me know if you want me to look at a draft copy
mike ps
good luck with eric
boy do i want to be in lng
gonzelas
hello from singapore
thanks for the email
i am interested in the lichtenstein
is the #0 the same as the one you had in the gallery
what is the price and what does the frame look like
do you have a picture or could you put it on your website
i am still interested in the matisse but chris isn't so sure
we are still thinking about that one
thanks
mike
thanks i know they are meeting but didn
t specifically know about lng
i'll let you know lhow it comes out
cool
this is a big deal and a deal we should highlight as an example of our vision of the future
congratulate the team
thanks
understood and good luck
mike
fyi
project dragon
it looks like it is done
i replied that we understood and it was fine
my passport number is
0
cathy phillips can answer any other questions
thanks
mike enron north america corp
rex
if i am no longer a section 0 officer
do i need to be removed from this list
what is the status
thanks
mike
mark
ouch
that stings
hopefully you are the only one that knows
i know you can close the deal anyway
mike
virginia
thanks for the update
i will not have an opportunity to talk with you right now
i am in tokyo and my next destination may change due to business events in the middle east
i am very interested in acquiring blue note
however
i do want to know more about the price
i was close to locating one via a gallery via ebay for a lot less
also
your price was $0,0 for the same piece framed
is there room on the price if i give you a firm commitment
the ebay price is significantly discounted but they are not ready to close the deal yet either
if you can't get them down on the price
it is worth me chasing down the other option for a while
please let me know via email and i will attempt to be responsive via odd time zones
thanks
mike
beverly
wow
fantastic
thanks for sharing your success and letter
mike
don
howdy from tokyo
thanks for the email
it was great hearing from you
i would be happy to talk with you in dallas about your business
in the mean time
why don't you send me a new email
without the personal stuff
about your company and references to your website and i will forward it to the appropriate people within enron with a note to insure that it gets the proper attention
thanks and see you soon
mike
marty
thanks so much for your email and support
i apologize for the slow response but i am in asia and have had some difficulties keeping up
you don't need to worry about the matching
i'll take care of it all
we are making this hassle free for the supporters
thanks again so much
mike
joe
i enjoyed it as well
we all have a lot to do and money to make
i got a long voicemail back from k lay on my message to him and he heard me on the epower side
he also said that he had heard similar concerns as well
rick bergseiker
lng
will be calling you
he left me a voicemail that he has been working with epower quite a bit and has talked about 0 lng facilities
i told him to work with you
cheers
mike
carol
thanks for the email
please send it to the office upon your receipt
on the coat
i don't have time to think about it now
thanks for bringing it to my attention
mike
rick
obviously we want to control access to the lng terminal
i don't really understand why it is so difficult if we go to 0%
its a negotiation item
or at least a cheap retention option not to be given away for free
after your follow-up meetings
please let me know if we need to get more involved
thanks
i like the letter
jay
attached for your review and commentary is a copy of the draft review i prepared for steve
i would appreciate your views and please make changes you feel are necessary and appropriate
it is set up for thursday morning at 0 am
i could use your help
what do you think
mike
jeff
you're right
i missed it
go ahead and send yours back with the singapore operations and current trading operations exclusion and mention that i agree with your assessment also even though i said fine earlier
doug
sounds fun but i can't commit now
please do not wait on me
go ahead and fill up the foursome
sally
thanks for the email and update
i agree that we must do something quickly to resolve this
i believe that you should interview for summer interns as an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip
i know you were very happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at ou that you got last year
i was surprised and the school was thrilled that you offered all 0 permanent positions upon graduation
we cant lose that momentum
i am sure that each school's program is different and that most don't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what i have learned about the ou schedule
we will lose all the top candidates if we wait
i am sure that is not what charlene and celeste were trying to accomplish with their guidelines
please keep me up informed on this matter
thanks and good luck with the students
mike enron north america corp
fyi
fine
sorry for the delay
charlene
thanks for the email
i have talked with sally several times on this lastcouple of days and i understand that ou has a different recruiting schedulethen other schools
enron is on campus for recruiting in the near future ai have asked sally to tag on some interviews for summer interns while on that trip
i believe that she has been able to schedule this so i believe thatfrom an ou perspective it may be a mute point now
doing that should be abto maintain the momentum that we have developed at ou and all the work lexihas done
by the way
the recruiting trip a couple of weeks ago was verysuccessful
if you have any other questions or comments please let me know
mike
gary
thanks for the email
here is my attempt to type out a response
i hope it helps
0
it was a matrix organization
the it personnel reported into the global tech
group but we did that for communication and consistency purposes rather than simply control
they attended business unit staff meetings and the bu had a great influence in the review process and gave constant feedback
it was vitally important for the
customer
to be happy and that the it person completed the projects from the bu
when it came to the review process itself
gt ranked all the employees and peers but the business unit had the greatest influence on where the person actually ranked and was rated
0
when enron net works was formed
nothing really changed on the day to day working of the it world
it
global technology
was folded into the newly created 0th business unit at enron
remember global technology had more that it alone
we had an ecommerce commercial group
a principal investments group and was developing ecommerce or technology origination roles developing around the world
philippe bibi is the cto for enron and enron net works
he is in the office of the chairman of enw with greg whalley
ceo and louise kitchen
the newly appointed coo
both lk and gw are non it people
there are many vps on the next level that are it executives
0
in a nut shell
scott grinned when i told him of my 0 weeks experience and title as ceo with enron's goal of becoming the largest b0b player in the world
he chuckled and said something like
that sounds like enron
it always looks at things differently
he then stated that my ceo title and enron's approach was very unusual but that it would be more common place soon
as this was the way of the future and enron was the first to recognize it and change its culture
0
when i used the word cannibalize
i meant that if we didn't change the business ourselves
than our competition would do this for us
for example
we were the leading trader of natural gas in the us by far but we initiated enrononline and completely changed the way we traded natural gas and did it for free
thus we cannibalized our own successful business even when it was going great
we are looking at all of our businesses for changes like that
gary
i hoped that helped
please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any other questions
mike
i'm all for it
please move forward
he is a great guy but don't forget he is happy in his current job and all of this must be carefully done for him and not to disrupt his current job
let me know how it is progressing
let's follow the book and proceed properly
thanks
it was great and long over due
the cold and rain didn't stop the ultimate enjoyment including 0,0 people chanting
over rated
it was great and we must enjoy it until the sat
when reality comes back to the sooners and we lose the next 0 or 0 straight
k state
neb and tex a&m
ouch
nice 0 game stretch
i like that schedule
the game was great
the cold and rain couldn't effect my enjoyment
long over due
reality comes back on sat however
gary
there were two such events
on the scott mcnelly side
i realized that we weren't too late to change our approach and take a commercial view on technology
none of the other companies were thinking our new way at all plus when someone of the caliber and reputation of mcnelly gives you a general approval and confirmation
as a new guy
that meant a lot
it inspired me to keep going on a
nontraditional
path
the other big impact moment was listening and having a brief conversation with john chambers of cisco
it was at the ecommerce summit in washington dc and he gave his
its a matter of survival
speech
that really hit me and our conversation was also similar about my new job and enron's new approach
he gave me a positive response and also gave me some advice that included an observation that the incumbent it people may not have the abilities to help me lead enron in the ecommerce world
it was going to take a different kind of technologist
that moment had the most impact on me of the two
i saw john again and spoke with him at an economist conference in laguna nigel and told him of his original impact and i think he appreciated the story
he also was very nice to give me some time to talk after that speech as well
i hope that clarified things
good luck with the piece
thanks
mike
thor
a quick note
i don't believe i ever followed up with you on your weather business plan
i looked at it several times primarily in pieces while traveling overseas
i read it again today and wanted to give you some feedback
i thought it was excellent work and very well presented
thank you for all your effort
i am in town this week
i canceled being out of the office an additional 0 days
and i will be spending time thinking about weather as well as some of our other businesses
i'll give you a call toward the end of the week to discuss some of the ideas you presented
mike
congrats
i'll see if i can make a combination trip
thanks
rick

virginia
thanks for the email
i apologize for the slow response
life is crazy and i have been back on the road again
i am interested in purchasing
blue note
and i understand that the price is $0,0 framed as before
i am chasing down another piece
as i think i have stated before
but have not closed yet on it
it is significantly less but i have not closed the deal
i would like to own the piece
do you think there is any room on the price from your seller
i will commit to you but i can't leave a couple of thousand dollars on the table because of my impatience
that being said
i do want it and this one is found and ready to go
i will commit today to purchase the picture in this condition for $0,0
you can tell the seller that i will commit with american express immediately at that price
i don't know if that works for you or the seller
please let me know what you think
i am in this week
thanks and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions
i am ready to make a decision
mike

hello
i am back in the country

i am very happy with the car and your contact treated me very well
the transaction went smoothly and they worked with me to get the car before i went off to asia
i wanted to thank you again for all your help and efforts
i have had many comments already and there is not doubt that this will lead to a new wave of enron purchases of mercedes
i am a mercedes believer
sincerely

here are a couple of responses
please rewrite as you see fit

agriculture
we are currently looking at and studying the industry
we have traded some commodities as well
we believe that there may be large opportunities to apply the enron model to the agriculture industry
we have spent quite a bit of time an effort and are currently developing our strategy
this is very early in development but we have high expectations in this area
i don't feel comfortable going into more detail at this time
gary hickerson is responsible enron's ag business
0
rail
we are looking at numerous opportunities in the rail and transportation businesses
i haven't seen a lot on the electricity piece of rail
it is an interesting concept and one that we will look at
dan reck is now responsible for looking at transportation opportunities in the us
erin rice@enron
joe
we are both there
i am also going to dubai and jeff will go to australia
i'll be in the night before and out the morning after
hope all is well
cathy is co-ordinating everything
looking forward to it
gary
this is the guy we talked about
he is worth atleast a look
ex cargill
please meet with him
please put on jeff's and my calendar for 0 minutes
thanks
mike
jim
i think it does
i am usually unable to attend so i would really like you to stick with this as our rep
also we will talk about the best uses of your time after this weeks budget meetings
i'll give you a call
thanks
mike
doug
last week
you referenced that there are a lot of deals that come up during the day for various regions and companies around enron that your group doesn't get any monetary recognition for but that they need to be done or are provided as a service to save money
by the way
saving money is real money to enron
would you please provide me with some examples of that so i can put it in context
thanks
mike
virginia
thanks for the email
go ahead and send it unframed
i don't remember what the frame looked like so it will probably be easier to send without
for my later reference
how much do you charge for framing
mike
as discussed
gary
i turned 0 in march
thanks
mike
greg
i need to talk with you about your ebs/fiber project
please give me a call in the morning
i'll be in first thing in the morning
i don't have your telephone number
you are listed on a houston number
mike
dana
thanks for the call and email
i will look at your resume and get back to you
mike
cool
i thought you would enjoy this
ps bring the magic dollar to lunch
bob
i don't want to wait for mike
please set up the meeting without him
he can join us by phone if needed
thanks
guys
attached below is a presentation that i put together for m frevert for the latest analyst presentation
we kept it to only a few businesses
they didn't end up using any of it
i do however want to have an egm presentation that everyone can use
please prepare a section on each of your businesses and return via email or hard copy
don't worry about power point
simply the dot points that you want on the page
thanks
mike
john
we're getting old
mike
jeff
i like the memo and i'll keep my ears open for feedback
your presence is needed more than i thought
my gut told me that they really needed your help but its more than that
taking contol of that p&l is the highest return of your time and talent for egm and for enron
atleast for this quarter
they will learn or they will be out
mike
jeff
let me know what you think of this guy
wade cline and tim det
are both high on him
jeff donahue is not so sure but will meet with him on friday
during my lunch with jeff
we discussed that we need a corp
dev guy dedicated to us full time but if he reported to him
that would be great
i think we could use that co-ordination with his group as long as we didn't get a part time guy in the process
he could also report to us obviously
like larry
but i think in this case a dual role makes a lot of sense
what do you think
if you like don
he could be an immediate candidate to start doing our corp dev work
but that is of course not the best reason
i thought he was all right and he did have a good understanding of our products and is an innovative thinker
he has also worked as a trader and although it doesn't seem possible by his personality
having some background is a plus
mike
jeff
sorry for the slow response
i don't have a strong opinion either way
i am fine with the combo idea
in the future
please let me know if something has a short fuse
i am still slower on email but i do respond very quickly to voicemail
i am almost caught up on back log emails but this will probably never by my first and best way to communcate
thanks
mike
cool
thanks for sharing that with me
see you at the walk

global tech drove and directed the prc
performance review committee
for all of it's employees
enron ranks all of it's employees 0 times a year
the employees are examined and given feedback on their performance
it is a very lengthy process but it is very fair and insures and identifies excellent performance
the criteria for the rankings comes from a person's accomplishments
characteristics and customer feedback from numerous sources
it is all on computer and when we discuss a persons performance and ranking
that feedback
primarily from the business unit
is a key driver
plus
there are business unit reps on the prc
0
i guess the way i would describe it would be that on every major expenditure and project
the commercial people involved helped drive the process as well as our group looking at it the same way
an example would be that traditionally any it group or technologist is in love this the latest and greatest technology
and could look at embedding a new system in the company because it is the latest technology and is very cool
i would ask what commercial function does it perform and how does it give us a competitive advantage
it was a very customer driven
internal and external customers
process
it was also a mind set and paradigm shift internally within the group because they started looking at themselves adding to the bottom line rather than simply a cost center
i hope that helps
sincerely
mike
bob
thank you very much for supporting our effort
mike
cool
thanks for sharing that with me
jay
thanks for the donation and commitment
the check should be made out to jdf
we'll do all the matching
hope all is well
mike
i didn't call rick
did you
what do you think
rick
i am scheduled to be out on vacation but i think you should have the meeting if it still fits peoples schedules
i am doubtful but will look at later
jeff
what do you think of this guy's background
do you know him
angela
by the way i was not ceo of enw i was vice chairman and coo
whalley was and is ceo
please correct if possible
good idea
i would like to thank you for your very nice nomination
as flattered as i am
i believe that our current chief technology officer
philippe bibi
is more appropriate as a nominee from enron
i am very proud of our accomplishments when i was responsible as ceo for enron's global technology group but my tenor was only about a year
in august i was asked to take on another assignment as ceo of enron global markets
although this was an even more challenging position i will say that it was a tough decision to leave the technology world
philippe bibi has driven our technology group for many years and deserves a great deal of the credit for enron's recognized technology advantage and innovation
he has been in the tech business for about 0 years
sincerely

i have a friend that is a principal in a company called nexstar
the company is on a roll and offers an interesting product
i have attached his email and basic presentation but i thought it was interesting enough to bring it up to you
also he is a friend and i don't want to ignore him
do we do anything like this with our employees
i would really appreciate some feedback on this
unless you think it is a total waist of time
i would appreciate you and some other appropriate members of your hr team to attend 0 intro
meeting to listen to their pitch
i would of course attend as well if you like
they have an impressive customer list already
let me know what you think and i'll help co-ordinate the meeting
thanks
mike
please co-ordinate and make sure that lea has your email address for distribution
thanks
rick
while in tokyo
sanjay grabbed jeff and me regarding redoing and re-looking at the existing lng fuel deals for dabhol
the bottom line is that he believes that the government may have issues on actually performing post phase 0 and if we could redo the lng contracts and allow more flexibility we could help them
thus help ourselves
we need to look into this and i would like your initial opinion
this is complex to say the least and it would involve using the ship differently than scheduled and diverting some of the oman lng to other markets with their approval
he believes that there is some flexibility in the shipping and oman contracts to address these issues
if it works we could create a long physical condition and an extra ship for transport
is there an opportunity here if all the cards fall into place
lets discuss when i am in dubai
sanjay is not going to let it go so you need to think about who can look into this further
mike
thanks for the update
fyi
cindy
i don't think we have a fit here but would you please follow-up and let him know that we looked around and couldn't find anything
also please forward to other groups as well
thanks
mike

mike
brent
i would like this to become formal policy within egm as well
i know that it exists and is around but no one is familiar with this or exactly how it works
we have made strides with credibility with rac regarding coal and we are doing a better job of seeing deals in general but i would like to put out a policy like this for us
please take a look at this and draft a memo that can be sent out addressing the approval procedures and the guidelines and limits around them
thanks

christine
i so rarely write love notes
0 years ago it was common place
even a daily event
what happened to that guy
i could have been a cartoonist in another life
i am here at 0,0 feet 0,0 miles from bankock thailand
flying by china
soon to be over the philippines and pondering our lives
you said something very interesting to me on the phone as i was getting on the bus to the airport
you said that you would love to have 0 hours on the airplane by yourself
i can certainly understand that
i seem to have a l lot of that on this trip
i am sitting here on the plane
a little tipsy after a couple glasses of wine
and my mind turns to you and the kids
i wish i could be there now to see the kids all dressed up in their costumes ready to go out trick or treating
i bet they look great
as i sit here and feel a little sorry for myself then i come back to reality and realize just how lucky we really are
i turned to ken rice at the ceremony yesterday and said
what is an okie and a boy from nebraska doing at a japanese barrel ceremony with thomas foley
former speaker of the house
breaking a barrel of saki in front of 0 japanese executives and tv
the prime minister of japan didn't show up and actually it is expected that he is out of a job on a no confidence vote last night
really bad luck for enron here
i would have liked to have met him
actually
the ceremony was neat and i imagine that they will have some funny pictures from it
you should see me in a happy coat
i'll explain when i get home

i came back from the big dance last night
it was a real privilege to be there
i've been to 0 ou/tx games and the energy
excitement and overall electricity in the orange bowl beat them all put together
it was wild and a moment that i will never forget
bob stoops for president
he is the king
the best was at the end of the game
and everyone stayed around celebrating until about 0:0 am
when they said
there was the wilkenson era
there was the switzer era and welcome to the stoops era
oklahoma is back
boomer sooner
mike
thanks for the email
the game was great and my throat still hurts
i've never been to a better event or had as much fun
i'll be calling roberts
mike
jonny

i still can't believe it
i will have the video in mail overnight on monday
sorry for the delay

thanks again for the tickets and for driving
it was fun being with trey
i hope b is feeling better and that you had a great time celebrating madeline's birthday
i can't believe you have a teenager
we are getting old
i was showing my ticket off this morning to everyone and someone mentioned the price of the ticket
$0
i didn't realize that when you gave it to me
i really don't want your dad picking that up for the two of us
i didn't mind his hospitality at $0 bucks but i simply didn't realize they were that much
i
ve never been to the big dance before
if your dad wasn't comped the tickets from ou
mark and i would like to reimburse him
please let me know the situation
cheers and boomer sooner
mike
mary
i would be happy to talk with anyone about this
the story did have some mistakes
tom was correct in his statements
by the way
i never saw the draft before it ran
i think i would have caught the errors
if i saw it before the printing
i must have simply said ok without reading it but neither cathy nor i remember an email on it
mike
allison
thank you very much for the email and request
as much as i an very proud of our accomplishments while being responsible for global technology
i am still of the opinion that philippe bibi is the best and most qualified candidate from enron
enron has changed its culture and business around technology and enrononline alone changed the way our business operates
eol ended the year over with over $0 billion in transactions
eol was only 0 part of our transformation however
thanks again and good luck with your award

i didn't know if you had a chance to make the writing better or simply correct mistakes

i was president of houston pipe line and louisiana resources company

you could also restate with

head of two pipelines
head of an enron pipeline subsidiary
something like that

huskers drool over sooners
virginia
hello
i was originally inquiring about purchasing a cross or signac impressionist lithograph
i found them and purchased both from a gallery in london
william weston
they should be delivered this week
they are beautiful and will add a lot to our collection
by the way the lichtenstein is up and hanging in our formal living room and it is magnificent
i have also purchased an appel in the last month
i am interested in several artists
actually
a lot
i will be looking for one or more of the following
my concept is that overtime i would like to own one of all the following artists and they are all depending when i find something that we really like
i listed all of our
sometimes mine vs
my wife's favorites and priorities
they are kind of in rank order but as i stated if i find the piece that i like we will purchase it
i want signed and numbered
i realize that some were not signed by the artist but it is an important fact in my buying decision
i also realize that some may not have done any works on paper or they are outrageously expensive
for example
i would like to know if rothko or kline did any work on paper
at least that is what i am thinking now
bonnard
colorful only
suerat
any works on paper
i don't know that he did any
other impressionist or post impressionist lithos braque moore rouault rothko kline motherwell by the way
i am interested in re-looking at a picasso
although we have 0
that your gallery had a couple of years ago
it was a cubist piece from the 0s and i believe you called the technique a
push wa
pronunciation vs an attempt at the proper spelling
it was for sale in a couple of galleries in sf and was about $0,0
is there 0 available
also i am still thinking about the matisse we discussed before but as you can see
i have a lot of other artists i am interested in and it may remain on the back burner because we already have one
thanks
mike
actually
i believe that may be correct
i verified it in the new book by tom osborn
how ou dominated my coaching career
my only losing record in coaching
it was a best seller
mark
i thought you would enjoy seeing our banter
any suggestions at a good comeback
thor
i am sorry that you can't make it but please don't worry about it
we wanted to invite you as an important business leader and give you an update on our businesses and also have you share your vision and accomplishments of your great work in norway
we intended to only invite 0 non-egm officers
joe hirl
paul quilkey and you
i hope you have a great holiday
cheers
mike

all of the cornhusker fans are bitching about stoops not taking the head coach position at the cleveland browns or any other job that will get him out of their backyard
by the way
stoops just started working on his book
ou's 0th football national championship
chapter 0
who are the huskers
mike
robert
thanks
i've talked with ees
tom white and i will forward on his resume for consideration
i will also talk with stan horton
mike
john
this is a follow-up to our earlier discussion
i would like to have you lay out our physical crude needs to become a player a long with some action steps to accomplish the goal
i don't want to forget about this because i believe it may be something we need to assign someone or a mid-market or originator or team to accomplish
i would like to see foreign and domestic
i see this as one of our possible competitive advantages or at least to solve the problem of not being in the know and getting second hand info or pricing
thanks
mike
howdy
i could not open the attachment
could you please resend or cut and paste it into the body of the email

thanks for inviting me
mike
tom
in response to our discussion
attached is fritz's resume
it doesn't prinwell
as i mentioned earlier
i have know him for many years and was hisemployee and then his business partner
i exited the business when we wereready to go public
which never happened as planned
his company went under a couple years after that
fritz is an amazing self made man
he is the consummate salesman and wouldbe
and he now has some background
a great trainer
he works tirelessly ahas a great deal of energy and sales experience
at one point he was considered to be one of the top natural gas transport experts in the us andthat is where he made his millions at excel
he lost all of it in the end
he needs help and has come to me for consulting work or a job
robert jonevp for hr for wholesale
networks
worked with him and he did some work fous and was pleased with the training work
he is also considering other options
i thought he might fit somewhere in your organization because of his sales,marketing and ability to work with a wide variety of customers
ees has smany different types of jobs and skill sets
i would be very grateful if you or beth would interview him and see if theris a fit somewhere in the organization
i would really appreciate it if onof you would take 0 minutes and see if there is a fit anywhere
thank you very much
i consider this a favor and one that might just workout
sincerely

bruce
i've been out of the office until monday afternoon since the day of our meeting
i forwarded your presentation to several individuals that night
i'll follow back with them and get back to you
thanks
shanna
i'm supportive of the raise to $0k
i think he is doing a good job and has a lot of value
he didn't fair well during the ranking due to lack of big $ or closure but maybe this will send him a good message
thanks
shanna
i certainly believe that jennifer is better than kim
jeff is certainly the appropriate judge but she is very young and has a lot yet to learn
this comment is not meant as a cut down at all
john's questionable judgement shouldn't just be trumped however
my thoughts
a few things that i want to make sure that we have in our briefing package
a map of the region and facility assessment of country risk address concern that a lot of
old
money
big landowners
are taking their money out of the country
something we shouldn't ignore update on other ven
activities for ene other how is this going to work with translators
earlier meetings with ministers
we want to have a dinner the night before with key people we are now flying out after the meeting on friday on the company plane
mike
here is my first draft for rick's review

i am swamped and unavailable

i am sure that jeff talked with you last week and he shared his insight from other dealers at your dinner and his comments
it sounds like we should let him go and not pursue
i was going to talk with skilling that day and elected to drop it after that
see you on monday
mike
jeff
my brother had this guy call him and he forwarded his resume
do you know him

if you do
please forward on

jeff
here is gary's review
it is still on the wrong template and i'll correct today
please review carefully and make changes and return
jeff
i called joe this morning and left him a pre-email voicemail on this
i referenced the power of 0% focus and the accountability for someone driving the earnings and his pressure to make earnings in trading and electricity
i like your email and tone
i would like to recommend you add a statement about morten being very strong and that we aren't attempting to
own
him vs
having a 0% dedicated weather guy
i would also add that you want to talk him about this and how we could move quickly to complete our global vision with tawney
mike
george
i just talked to rich
i told him about the timing of the settlement proposal and that we should hear back late next week
i also suggested that if we get a negative response
that you and i would give him a call and update
he is being patient but i have a feeling that it has its limits
his response is logical to this point because as he stated
there should be a lot of money in this for both parties and thus a commercial settlement
mike
thanks for the update
we'll discuss again when i am over next week
dan
eric hasn't called me but if he does you know i'll help
i like it
that is where i am staying
approved
john nowlan will make sure that someone from net works sees it as well so if they get a call they can discuss it
yes it is
listening to clients
a great business model
shanna
talk with rick but he will be working until june or july then he will retire and be available as a consultant to us
jeff

my brief moment in print
very brief
certainly hasn't gone to my head especially as an enron
b
teamer
in response to your worker bee comment
i can certainly say
buzz
but not someone who can sell that many shares of stock
you are the king
your last email was good and i'm not sure i can respond adequately but at least i didn't get help
you win

mike

things are great here
mike
pelt
i thought you would like this
i hope all is well
everything is great in houston
randy

if there are any issues
please let jeff or me know
fyi
john
this just got sent and it appears you were left of the cc list
we will be discussing with your guys this week to determine the best way forward
everyone is under earnings pressure and it is asking too much for someone to dedicate 0-0% of their time on a product
the intent of this email is not to take people but to add people to the offices
if necessary
to make sure they live
eat and drink weather
we can discuss when i'm in later this week
mike
virginia
we did get the package but can't address right now
thanks
all
at our offsite in miami next week
each of you are on the agenda to present your business and goals
this will be very short
only 0 minutes
an agenda will soon follow but we will have a business meeting from 0am
0:0am on saturday
please prepare a few of pages on power point and submit to cathy phillips so that she can have all the presentations ready for that saturday morning
attached below is a copy of the abbreviated goals that i submitted to frevert
summarizing egm's 0 goals
please do not hesitate to change the list and add to it
it is only a guide and was used as a quick reference of egm for the enron board
after this meeting
i will take each of your presentations and make a more comprehensive goals and objectives list for egm as a business unit
also please add some of your other specific goals that illustrate where you want to be by year end regarding your competitive position and/or market share
for example
to be the largest marketer of coal in the us
to be the largest options player in crude and products
or what ever is appropriate
also attached
for your information
is a recent presentation from the coal group
we thought that this was an excellent format and review
in the upcoming weeks
we would like to see an update on each of your businesses as well
i will let you know more in the next few weeks about the timing and format
thanks
mike
fyi
there is no official meeting with chavez
howdy

dan reck
congrats
he is a great guy
shanna
what a deal
when jonathan and i talked
he did ask if this deal with net works was a problem
i told him that i wouldn't imagine it would be an issue but to work it out with eric and i gave him yours and cindy's name rather than robert
is this out of line with others at his level and responsiblity
mike
greg
thanks
we'll resolve
darryl
i couldn't open your attachment
please resend
thank you for your email and ideas
i have kept up with some of the strategic sourcing activities and know that things are going well
enron's art committee's stated vision
goals and objectives are similar tothe ones you reflected in your email
as i have stated on an earlier voicemail to george
i can't remember if icalled you as well
the enron art committee has spent a lot of time focussing on our vision and goals for the enron art collection
this has been coordinated with the approval and support of ken and jeff and we have nedrifkin
menil
and barry walker
mfa
advising us
i believe that we aremaking progress with our goals and acquisitions
thank you for submitting these concepts
we are executing on our approvedgoals and are not going to pursue your ideas at this time
good luck with your endeavors
mike
thanks for the information
let me know if there is anything else i can do
i know that neal gerstandt just joined the company last week and will be working with you on project jose
you will find him to be a great guy and a person with excellent judgment and overall experience in the energy industry
i have known and worked with neal for over 0 years
i think he will make a great addition to the team and help bring this deal home
the largest deal at enron
mike
thanks
no interest
don
thanks for the email and quick response
i'll address in more detail later
i'm gong out of town again this morning
but i did call alan kent and you will have a copy of his standard construction agreement and a copy of the deed restrictions e-mailed today
also please call alan directly with any questions on the contract
larry is his real estate agent for selling homes in this subdivision and i believe he is just helping him
alan should be able to answer most of your questions for clarifications quickly
i don't need to be an intermediary
in case you don't have his numbers
he can be reached at his office at 0 0-0 or we can discuss the other issues you addressed later when i get a chance to review them more carefully
we are comfortable with alan as the builder and want him to build the house
we just want to have a remedy if things don't go well
thanks
mike
cheryl
thanks for the update
i like the progress
i realize that we can not cover us 0% for the future contract but at least it will help
what i think we need is some way to protect us incase he gives us a very high bid price to build the house because we are captive
what do you suggest as a possible remedy
some sort of checks on allowing others to bid
some sort of out on re-purchasing the lot at a set price
without a cost plus methodology we could be very vulnerable here
what do you think
a few of the other issues you addressed in the earlier fax
0
earnest money
i like putting it in title company vs
flair
0
title policy
lets go ahead and take the additional coverage
i think it is prudent especially with the new subdivision
how much does an additional 0% cost
i don't have any idea
0
have provided 0
not sure i understand this 0
yes
delete 0
definitely change and check b0 and hire an inspector 0
add in clarifying statement 0
agree to add builder obligation
i am fine with a quick closing date and needs specificity
does he have an estimated time of completion
0
rollback taxes
i agree
clarify as to the exemption
we need to be protected here
0
add this to contract
flare may want the money but we should try it
i hope this helps
after you review and discuss these issues
let's get together via phone and discuss outstanding issues
please call cathy phillips with a time to talk
she can be reached at 0 0-0 thanks
george
what is that status of this
kinder hasn't called on this but probably will
let's discuss or leave me an email

ken
per my voicemail
we are having an all employee meeting on next monday at the hyatt regency
the purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for an update on egm and a brief presentation from all the business units within egm
this includes about 0 hour of business and then drinks and food
we expect about 0 people
we have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of these businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have come in a few months
i believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability
we had a record q0 with $0 million of gross margin
that was 0% of what they made in all of 0
combined with the fact that in december of 0 alone we made $0 million in gross margin
i believe it will have a big impact
if you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way in helping us drive our other point which is that the egm businesses are now core to enron and has the attention of both you and jeff
thanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information or assistance
mike
jeff
attached below is my first cut at the org memo
please review
make additions,comments and corrections and return it via a word document on email
once i receive comments from all the individual business heads then i'll ciculate again for final review and commentary
mike
thanks for the response
i found a beautiful bonnard in london and ny
i will be buying in next day or two
asking price is $0,0
i will keep the lautrecs in mind
i think one is in my future
next
i don't think i'll be buying one for a few months
i'll get back to you
mike
david
thanks for the email
it did cause an interesting conversation without knowing what the situation was
we all have very open relationships around here
it is why we are so successful as a company
please don't think twice about responding to greg or any senior manager on an issue
but he would also have no issue with your response being cc back to jeff and/or myself at the same time
thanks
mike ps
we are all thinking about p+ constantly
jeff
fyi
this is an excellent email and one that addresses all the issues we need to make decisions on
lets discuss because i have some views but am very open to others especially when i don't really know
first hand
what oppts really look like there
we need to address quickly
mike
morten erik
thanks for the email
i thought it was very thorough and hits all the main points that we are thinking about right now
jeff and i are very bullish on the opportunities in japan are just now focusing on the specifics
i believe that will also drive the structure
you should have received an egm overview yesterday and it will be an excellent brief on what we are doing and our general direction
i am very interested in having both you and joe look at that and provide feedback on the opportunities in japan
we can talk about all of your issues later
when we are more prepared
but on the prc issue
the key is not simply p&l but on transactions and growing the business
i believe that these businesses with proper focus and dedication can grow quickly and show success even though the margins may be small
i am glad that you are coming over and also touring enron europe and ena
it will help you make a better decision and we will have all of this clarified in the mean time
jeff and i will be talking about some of these points tomorrow as well
thanks
mike
joe
as we review all the options for enron japan
people and commodity/business plays
we would like to see how you think it should be organized to facilitate growth and have the biggest impact
when you get a chance to examine the egm information and get your thoughts together
lets us know your views and your view of the best way forward
we have everyone thinking about it and we are solidifying our own thoughts as well
it will help with morten erik as well
thanks
mike
chris
hello from houston
i really enjoyed meeting with you last saturday at your gallery
your collection of work is very impressive
i have not received your digital pictures that you were putting together but i did talk with my wife about the bonnard
the bonnard is my first choice of all the pieces we discussed
i found an illustration of it on the net
from another gallery
and she liked
although
not as much as me
i am prepared to purchase a bonnard and the radiator is my first choice
i would like to establish a relationship and do business with your gallery and would like to know what is your best price for the piece
i will not shop the price around and will make a quick decision with a credit card number
when i get your response and if it is competitive
i'll confirm the purchase when i pick up the email
thanks
mike mcconnell ps
i will hold off on the others for now and when you send me the pictures i will show them to my wife for consideration
i am considering the mary cassat as a gift for her
kurt
i agree with eric
california is very dangerous right now and we would need something very real to bring this to his attention
steve kean really liked the idea but only after we were ready to rock and roll
mike
john
rick bergsieker is the key here
he can certainly direct you to the right people or others on his staff to help from abu dabai
rick
houston ext
0 mike
sounds like a plan
eric is the key to all your activities
chris
thanks for the email
i'll wait to get the pictures it will definitely help
i miss understood about the photos
i thought you were sending me via email that next day
congrats on the cassatt
that person will really enjoy it
let me know about the price as soon as you get a chance
i understand that there is a shipping component and no sales tax
i like to have all my art shipped because the tax savings can be significant
especially in new york
i did like that frame on the picture but didn't understand your comment below
$0
the price you had did include the frame didn't it
thanks
mike
i look forward to it
any update
how did the interview go
by the way
good calls
don
thanks for the fax survey
we couldn't read the numbers however

thanks
mike

lisa
as i was pondering the meeting last night going home in my car
i realized that i forgot to talk about 0 people
including regulatory and your personal efforts
i apologize for that
it was unintentional and i hope you realize how important you and your efforts are to egm and enron
i could not read my notes very well due to the extremely heavy lighting
that didn't appear on my notes just on me
thanks
mike
thanks
thanks
done
joe
attached below is a draft of an egm update and org announcement
it will be broad in scope and will address many areas
please review and provide comments especially on the japan part
i went ahead and took a stab at the first cut here and expect you to make all the changes and emphasis you feel is appropriate
we are a couple of weeks away from discussing every player
morten erik
that is why i left it very broad
please take a moment
change and send back to me for examination and incorporation
i wanted to get this out on friday
but may have to wait until early next week while i am on the road
thanks
mike
billy
i like it
my only suggestion is to put in a statement like
that after all your discussions with business unit head and aas we are
changing
improving the program on the suggestions that you all wanted to see
i think this could help everyone believe they were a part of the changes personally
just an idea
i like it very much as it is
good luck
chris

jeff skilling and enron
coal came up a lot and i described my enthusiasm for our coal business and our growth
he wants to put some focus on the coal business and i need some facts to get back to him
what percentage of our coal transactions or business is online
speed changes on a typical transaction post and pre online
other changes you see or products to develop international effects total coal moved
physical and financial
especially online other competing exchanges and why ours is better other proenron facts that illustrate our growing business especially as it relates to paradigm changes or online changes please feed me this info and if there is something specific that you don't want me to say let me know that too but go ahead and give me the answer

here is a brief email on a possible resolution for the european/oslo weather situation
mark sent this draft to me last weekend but i haven't had time to review it this week
personally
i think that this is the wrong answer from a corporate perspective but this issue keeps hanging around and isn't worth any more of our time
for what it is worth
i think our communication strategy did make a big difference but didn't get us exactly where we needed to be
these groups will be expected
and held accountable
for good and consistent communication on an ongoing basis as well
for a p&l that is this small
and negative
we are all spending too much time on this
there is more to this story but i think we should just drop it and move on to bigger and better things
i am certainly not wedded to any of this but would rather focus on all the other issues and problems on my plate
let's discuss upon your return on our weekly call
thanks and i hope your vacation was relaxing
mike ps-this hasn't been shared outside the group on the email
kathie
thank you for your email
i've been out and all over the world
i appreciate your help on this article
attached is a copy of a presentation that will fill you in on some of the businesses that we are working on
this should give you some ideas and clarifications on the first draft
here are a few other points of emphasis
egm was created to provide sharpened focus on very large global markets and commodities to enable them to grow quickly these markets are huge and we will become a big player rather than being active in them egm provideds true network for market making opportunities related to commodities that are highly liquid in physical and financial terms and are enormous in market size egm leverages the value of enron's existing network and international asset positions egm's operation will coordinate with leveraging all of our wholesale businesses egm has very aggressive growth targets in transactions and earnings egm has contributed almost $0 million in gross margin in its first 0 quarters in existence go big or go home philosophy egm will represent a clear transfer of enron wholesale market making model into other commodities this year growth is the key
thanks for your help
mike
paul
i am in the early stages of planning my next run to singapore and sydney
i was thinking about bringing my wife and staying over a couple of days
or a week
what is the weather like in july and are you going to be there
thanks
mike
tuesday is fine but i do need it
all
after filling out and gathering all the feedback forms in the last couple of weeks
jeff and i just realized that we forgot to ask everyone for an accomplishment list from each of you
we have had a very successful 0 so far and we need to be able to discuss each group and your personal mid-year in detail
please send us an email with your accomplishments so that we have all the facts during the prc process
this doesn't need to be formal but simply put together and email to both of us for the appropriate time
thanks
mike and jeff
randy
i would be happy to sign it with legal approval and tim detriming's group must also see it to make sure that we are not obligating ourselves to anything else that is going on around the corporation
maffet knows the drill
mike
thanks
john
attached below is my first draft
it isn't pretty and i would like you comments and changes
please make changes directly on the word doucment and send back asap
thanks
i apologize for the delay in getting back to you
i've been traveling againi also just found this in my in-box as returned as un-delivered
i put onlytwo v
s
instead of three
i hope your other discussions went well thatday
below are a few comments that i believe you addressed and wanted some additional feedback from our coal activities and changes in the coal industry
i wanted to get this out to you quickly so please forgive thislack of formality or writing creativity
enron activity
eol
enron's online activity has been very successful especially as compared witour early estimations of acceptance by the industry
i believe that there is only one other active coal trading system
dynegy direct
that simply isn'tposting prices as a bulletin board and waiting for a response with telephonfollow-up
i also believe that we have done a very significant amount of omaybe all the coal transactions on dynegy direct to date
we do a lot of obusiness online and the numbers ytd are that approx
0% of our trades areexecuted online
that number has been higher
as much as 0% for certainmonths or when we are trying something new or moving a particular product
also
as bid/ask spreads tighten
which we would expect
that bodes well foeol and our
and the markets
ability to transact even more quickly
transactions that took days to put together now can be done in 0 second
between the speed and the cost savings of having a fully integrated system,we believe that our transaction numbers and percentages of online businesswill significantly increase
changes in the industry we discussed changes that we believe are coming in the industry
we see several things on the horizon
we expect the acceptance of the online transactions to further increase
especially with the volatile price movements what we have seen in the last 0 months
we are currently developing several new products for eol that i believe will become very popular and will create new markets in coal and related sectors
i don'twant to discuss them right now but we are close to releasing them and i thithey will raise some eyebrows
the development of the global coal exchanwill also help
i frankly don,t believe it will be very successful because of several things but primarily because of the difficulty in closing the transaction
one thing has been very firmly demonstrated
every time a newbig system has been introduced eol volumes go up
it simply accelerates thacceptance of online business and it gets down to the best prices and liquidity to see who will ultimately win the day
another big change in thindustry is the growing acceptance of the otc market
the significant pricchanges that have occurred have
forced
many traditional players to the otmarket
this also includes forcing them to agree to standard otc terms andconditions and getting them comfortable with the market
this is very goodfor enron especially when you consider that we are the major player on theotc market
we don't release specific percentages of what we are doing onthe otc
also having more natural and traditional players signing these types of standard agreements helps us on the eol side because standard contracts are important for developing a more liquid commodity market
enron coal volumes a couple of numbers that we are willing to release
year to date
we havemade markets and transacted approx
0 million tons in the forward market
on the physical side of our transactions
about 0% go physical vs
financial
last year enron was the largest us market maker
not producer
with 0 million tons transacted
internationally we moved approx
0 million tons and overall the total was slightly less than 0 million tons.we have high expectations for 0
i believe that we should be up approx0% and we are on track with that
i think the industry would be surprisethat we did almost 0,0 transactions in 0
this doesn,t include any of our shipping business
i hope this helps and please let me know if you have any other questions
mike
eric
a couple of high priority activities we need to address very quickly
run down of nigeria deal
0/0 mmbtu/d
bahamas
skilling update
acceleration of corp effort
approvals elba
supply and managing t-o-p ven
lay call
timing of ven decision and game plan r bergseiker future and other ei people asia strategy and clarification current view of long/short via category of segment
shipping
physical
facilities
i know you are on top of all of these items but jeff and i want to run them down and get an update
thanks
darrell
i attempted to call you a few minutes ago
late night your time
but there was no voicemail
i didn't want to wait several more days before i contact you
i'm out all weekend
eric shared with me some of your concerns about resources for a korea lng opportunity
i certainly understand your view but wanted to share some of my thoughts
rick and/or clay know the asian lng industry better than anyone else in the company
they are very good and i have a lot of faith in them and their ability to assess opportunities and develop projects
they are lacking wholesale type of transaction experience that a few of the guys that have recently come into the group have
that is why we have brought them in
we have a very strong team and i like the mix a lot
eric is the person we chose to run the group for many reasons but it wasn't
done as a lack of faith in rick or his original team
the biggest opportunities and the viewpoint we must take in this business is running it like a wholesale unit and running it as a portfolio of transactions and books
that certainly doesn't mean that 0 years of experience doesn't have enormous value especially in the non-atlantic markets
rick is in the process of coming back to houston after the shut down of our middle east projects and strategy
rick is also in the process of assessing what exactly he would like to do in the time of transition
my very sincere hope is that he will stay in the lng group and perform a very important role especially in this type of development or deal making role
especially in a big deal in japan
korea or something in the asian area
we will discuss this next week when he comes to town
i need eric to be in houston right now due to our elba island
venezuela and bahamas immediate activity
he will certainly be engaged in everything but he can not be focuses as much as you need in korea or joe needs in japan
please give me a call next week and we can discuss this in more detail
thanks
mike ps
frevert also likes this role for rick
also the eric specific head role has not been officially announced yet
ron
i hope you had a good week
i've thought a lot about your family and you've been in my prayers
i apologize for the delay in this email but i decided not to bother you with this while you were away
as a follow-up to our conversation
the authors that have had the biggest influence on me and along the lines we discussed are
dr
denis waitley
the psychology of winning
how to build your child's self-esteem
many others but i can't remember the titles
dr
norman vincent peale
the power of positive thinking
og mandino
the choice
the mission
dr
wayne dyer
many
anthony robbins
unlimited power
personal power
many others
attached are a couple of the outlines i did
to my extremee frustration i can't find some of the others that i did many years ago
i got a lot out of all of these
usually a little from each and when you least expect it
i am a great believer in the old saying
when the student is ready the teacher will come
as we discussed
the results of all of the hundreds of books and tapes have had a profound effect on me and my family
a few direct tangible results include
my extensive long and short term goal setting
affirmation collection
over 0 pages and growing
my family journal
0 pages and growing
when you get a chance and things settle down
please give me a call or i can definitely find time for lunch
mike
how's this for the next stab
please review
make changes and send back for a final
i didn't try to make this just perfect but consoldite a little and add a little
thanks
mike
mark
thanks for lunch
i really enjoyed our conversation
here is the presentation we discussed
this is an internal presentation only
mike

good to go
mike

peggy
i'm glad you had a good time
i can't begin to express my appreciation for all of your work and dedication to jdf
i was proud to have you represent enron
mike
our relocation to the new building is fast approaching and there are several important move related items that i would like to stress at this time
i would appreciate your cooperation with the key move issues that are outlined below
important
a special building tour has been scheduled for the egm business unit heads receiving this message
jeff and i
along with bill donovan
would like to invite you to join us for a tour on this friday morning
june 0th
from 0:0 to 0:0 a.m
even if you have already had an opportunity to visit the new building
we think this would be a great opportunity for all of us to see the space together and discuss any issues at that time
please contact cathy phillips at x-0 if you plan to attend the tour
new building floor plan modification requests will no longer be accepted
any change requests that have already been received are currently being considered and will be conveyed to the appropriate business unit head
if vacant positions exist and they will be filled before the move on august 0rd
they need to be identified on all reports and floor plans with their name
nh
for new hire
and an approximate hire date
example
bob smith nh any space/move related questions or issues that may arise should be addressed by cathy phillips
please do not contact susan lopez for any space related issues
jeff and i have asked cathy and jennifer burns to be responsible for the allocation of space in the new building and they are keeping us well informed as to the progress and any issues as they arise
jeff and i are very aware that space is very tight in the new building and we will be addressing growth and additional space needs and issues in the near future
a limited number of turret phones will be available in the new building
the turret phones will be assigned to traders and their assistants only
everyone else on the floor will receive a new upgraded version of the lucent phone
with the existing phone numbers
please contact jennifer burns if you have any questions or issues related to phones
all private team rooms
offices and conference rooms have been assigned and there are no more available for assignment to the individual groups or people
on the 0rd floor we will have the following public conference space available by making reservations
specific scheduling details to follow later
0 mega conference room 0 large conference room with videoconference capabilities 0 large conference room
no videoconference 0 team rooms file space on the floor is being upgraded and allocations of file space will be made for each group
every attempt is being made to have the assigned file space as close to each individual group as possible
at this time
details related to food deliveries and distribution have not been resolved
your patience and flexibility with all food related issues will be appreciated
it is highly probable that food service in the new building will be very difficult at first and as we get closer to the move date
more information will be provided related to food service
deliveries and distribution
since jeff and i both already keep cathy and jennifer very busy
we would appreciate it if you would send all your comments
questions
or issues to them via e-mail
they have agreed to make themselves available every monday at 0:0 p.m
to meet with anyone to discuss their questions
please make arrangements with them directly to meet regarding your issues
there will be a 0 day freeze on any building changes once we move into the new building
i understand that this is a difficult process and that there are a lot of questions and issues
but jeff and i are convinced that this will be great and everything will work out in time
thank you for your cooperation and assistance in making this transition to the new building as smooth as possible
mike
joe
in the next couple of weeks
thanks
ps
amazed at my quick response
tom
i am fine with this but our effective date is a call of fairness that depends on your view of the middle east adjustment
i don't want to be hard on this and get back a bigger number on middle east by default
its up to you and your judgement on what you think is appropriate and or a trade with europe

yeah
what a game
that 0
0 score that held most of the game was a killer on the nerves
both defenses looked very good
both offenses looked like they were playing very good defenses
i do like our coaching staff
bob hasn't always had things go his way
during his first season
0-0
he tried some different type plays and many didn't go his way including a fake field goal in the independence bowl that probably cost us the game
that being said
he has had a pretty good string lately
good luck with the rest of the season

university of texas police have smashed a suspected terrorist cell
three terrorists
bin losin
bin whinin
and bin cryin were apprehended on the ut campus shortly after the defeat of the longhorn football team by the university of oklahoma sooners
university police warn a fourth terrorist
bin winnin
is still at large
however
sources within the department concede that winnin would be very conspicuous on the ut campus and suspect he has fled to the campus of oklahoma university

it sounds like you have the right attitude about the situation
i wouldn't have guessed otherwise
the fun aspect of it is that you can do whatever you want
sometimes the hard thing is figuring out what that is
i truly wish you the best and i certainly want to know where you place yourself

it is always nice to pick up a voicemail and have it turn out to be a colleague from the not so distant past
i hope you and your family are doing well
as ebs changed direction
i did as well
i decided to get back to my roots in the gas and gas asset business
i looked inside of enron and also with some outside companies and decided to work with transwestern pipeline
an enron company
i've been here for about a month and all is well
the people here are very nice and very genuine
just like my old friends from london
it is weird to actually have a product to sell
if you know what i mean
i think i'll like it but i'm already missing my travels in your neck of the woods
also
i'm home so much now
my wife doesn't know what to do with me
i'm still saddened by the demised of our blockbuster/vod deal
it was a great concept and it worked
oh well
we'll see it someday
i'm just not sure who is going to win the race on getting it to the public in bulk
christian sent an email to me and he seems to be doing fine
loving rio but still looking for a job
speaking of that
i hope your job is going well and as secure as it can be in today's climate
it is a strange time here in america
the terrorist attacks
the retaliation in afghanistan and the constant update on new discoveries of the spread of anthrax are constantly being talked about and on every news channel
it is amazing how a handful of people can create such sadness and effect the world in so many ways
there is no doubt that the spirit of the people will prevail
take care martin

steve
i have likewise done alot of reflecting about our dinner and the events that followed
as of now i have no plans to do business with natsourse
you need to also be aware that this will include gulf coast basis and gas dailys
thank you
steve
my opinion of your organization and the way they chose to handle themselves in a stressful situation
is such that i prefer not to have any business dealings with anyone in the entire organization
i am sure that matt and darryl are good people and good brokers
the bottom line is
i do not believe you are getting
that i do not want to
and do not plan to do business with natsourse today or in the future
steve
will you call me
when you get a moment>
i dont get it
sounds great
but i am too conservative
that is alot of $$ for three days
and it is close to x-mas
sorry

too funny
learn the ins and outs of filing after mid-april deadline tribune media for the many millions of individuals who have yet to file their 0 income tax returns
there is no reason to panic
if you need more time to file your return
you can easily get a filing extension
and if you can't afford to pay your tax bill now
you can buy more time to pay up
while you may be subject to interest and penalties for payments made after april 0
you can put off the day of reckoning for months without fear that irs collection agents will come after you
there is even a loophole in the law that will enable many individuals to get an extra month to pay up without being assessed interest or penalties
nevertheless
april 0 is a critical deadline for anyone who has yet to file his tax returns
you'll need to file either your tax return or an extension request by the deadline
and to avoid interest and penalties
you'll generally need to pay any taxes owed by april 0
april 0 is also the deadline for making ira contributions for 0 returns and for making the first installment of quarterly estimated taxes for 0
filing extension
if you'd like more time to file your return
getting a filing extension is simple
in fact
the irs has expanded the options this year for obtaining a filing extension
you can now do it by phone
computer or mail
the traditional way to get an extension is to fill out irs form 0
application for automatic extension of time to file u.s
individual income tax return
and mail it to the irs by the april 0 deadline
if you're using tax-preparation software or a tax professional
you can file your extension request by computer
or you can phone in your extension request by calling 0-0-0
if you owe the irs money
another option for requesting an extension is to make the payment by credit card
american express
discover or mastercard
on the internet or by phone through one of the two companies the irs has authorized for processing credit card payments
details on the option are included in the form 0 instructions
by making the extension request
the irs will automatically give you four more months
until aug
0
to file your return
you can get an extension for any reason
no explanation is asked for when requesting an extension
but be aware that your extension request only gives you extra time to file your return
not to pay your taxes
to avoid interest and possible penalty charges
you must estimate how much you owe and make the payment with your extension request by the april 0 deadline
unable to pay
if you can't afford to pay your tax bill
you should at least file an extension request by the april 0 deadline
though you'll be subject to interest and possible penalty charges for late payment of your taxes
you'll avoid being hit with a late-filing penalty
which runs a steep five percent a month
up to a maximum 0 percent
installment plan
if you still don't have the cash to pay your taxes by the time your extension runs out on aug
0
you can negotiate with the irs to pay your balance due in monthly installments
you make the request for an installment agreement when you file your completed tax return using form 0
installment agreement request
offer in compromise
if you can't afford to pay all you owe in taxes
even in installments over a period of years
you may be able to work out a settlement with the irs
the irs recently expanded its
offer in compromise
program
in which taxpayers in tough financial situations can offer to settle for less than they owe
offers are submitted using irs form 0
offer in compromise
a loophole offers an extra month to pay up
if all you need is an extra month or so to come up with the cash to pay your tax bill
there is a way you may be able to get a short reprieve without being subject to interest or penalties
all you need do is take the irs up on its offer to calculate your tax bill for you
if you're eligible for the offer
fill out your tax return
stopping short of computing certain totals
and send it in by april 0
the irs will compute your tax and send you a bill for any tax owed
if you pay within 0 days of the notice
you won't be assessed any penalties or interest
to take advantage of the loophole
your taxable income must be less than $0,0 and you can't itemize deductions
the full list of eligibility requirements and step-by-step instructions are contained in irs publication 0
the irs will figure your tax
retirement account contributions
if you hope to contribute to an individual retirement account
the final deadline for 0 tax-year contributions is april 0
even if you obtain a filing extension
the deadline is more flexible for self-employed retirement plans
contributions to keogh or simplified employee pension
sep
plans can be made up until the due date of your return
which can be later than april 0 with a filing extension
estimated tax deadline
for self-employed workers and other individuals who need to make quarterly estimated tax payments to the irs
april 0 also is the deadline for making the first installment for 0

as i sit here this wednesday morning and watch ene trade $0.0 i can not begin to explain the pit in my stomach
i have been an employee of enron since june of 0
i have never written a memo to my ceo to express opinions and or ask direct questions
i can not believe that the individuals that are responsible for this catastrophe are still employed
and i guess i need to understand why
fired them
it is apparent to me that the information we have given to the market place is not sufficient enough
they
don't trust us anymore
get a plan of action
attack it
and save this company
i had mentioned to you last night that i would forward you the memo i sent my ceo of enron yesterday
today seems better here
not so much anger around the trade floor
this is our bid week so we have alot of business to take care of
and as of 0:0 this morning our stock is actually up slightly for the 0st time in weeks
hopefully
we can close ont he highs
scott
just a quick note
i believe you did a great job this afternoon in communicating with your group about enron's
cluster
today i have found this overwhelming since of pride for this company and i don't want it to fail
so if there is anything i can do to help please let me know
i am in for the challenge and the long haul
sincerely

sempra energy has called and asked to
cover
outstanding positions with enron
they have done some deals with me this morning via eol
as well as a
sleeve
with epng in order to minimize their exposure with us
indications were that they have longer dated power and other gas positions that they want to minimize as well
i advised them to call the respected traders first
as apposed to calling voice brokers
to see what they can facilitate
i have no idea what this e-mail is suppose to mean to me
i thought i would share with you some of the e-mails i get from my firends in the business that i am in
we ladies tend to share theses with each other
because we work in a mans world
brad
i really don't know where to begin other than just to say it
enron is having some extremely difficult times now
i have been trying to focus on helping enron stay together
this is not a good time for you or anyone else to try and seek employment here
i am sorry if i am letting you down
i was only wanting to help
i will always keep you in mind
and hopefully when things turn around here i will be able to address you coming here
here is some
light
reading for you
print this one out
get a coke
and a pack of cigs
enjoy
the author got this one right
this has been my life and many many others for a long time
this is what enrons culture has been like for years
