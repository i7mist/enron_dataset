is there a reason we think we will need to run station 0
i think with the volumes we will have to move to insure 0 miles and hour for the smart pig will be approx
0 to 0 m0
if my thinking is wrong please let me know
ds
projected flows ds
you are correct looking at the models ken chow ran before he left was between 0 to 0 this will allow the pig to move approx
between 0 to 0 miles an hour
ds
projected flows for griffith
right now it looks like we can run station 0
station 0
station 0 or station 0
we will just have to see what we have scheduled for the day
this will allow us to set our hp accordingly
unless i'm missing something station 0 should not be needed
however i will check with ops team to reverify volumes
ds
please see the attached
this is tw pressure at the inlet of the griffith i/c
this is interesting news
thought you might want to know

lindy
you are correct they are physical plant receipt points
the pecos diamond plant is the straddle plant located on the atoka lateral
thanks ds
please read i'm sure you will be getting some calls
ds
i will be there
what is the time frame these units need to be down
there are no postings for volume deductions
please someone give me some ideas
thanks ds
ken
we currently have a unit down at station 0
if you need to work on something now is the time to do it and not wait until june
ds
i need to get with dave duff and have him add the new point to the map
dave can you do this for us
this new point will need to be inserted under the mapco point on the ignacio to blanco column
ds
i will be on vacation
ds
we need know everyday units need to be taken down and for how long
depending on system conditions we may have to allocate
ds
how long will the unit be down 0 hrs
0hrs
0hrs
or all day or longer
ds
spoke to lynn blair
kim watson
cynthia rivers
linda ward
and terry kowalke
we would like to hold the same scheduled numbers on id/0 from san juan lateral as we had scheduled for id/0 from san juan lateral
we think this will help us minimize our operator and shipper imbalances
please let us know if we start getting complaints from our customers
if anyone has other ideas or comments please let us know
example
non-grid
san juan scheduled 0,0
we will have to do the right mouse click and update the capacity to the flow rate needed
i'm sorry tomorrow afternoon is not available for me
i have a ortho
appt
and i get my braces off
on thursday afternoon i have to back for my retainers
can we meet sometime in the morning
ds
this is a new interconnect into the suction side of wt-0
i think the capacity is going to be approximately 0,0 mmbtu
this may be able to flow sometime this or next
ds
i would like to attend
ds alma carrillo
for gas day june 0
flow nom
due to the flooding in houston there will be no representative available to attend from gas control
ds
these are pictures of the underground tunnel system
dave can you please add the new la plata red cedar point to the map
please add it between mapco and red cedar points
also please check to see if the rio puerco receipt and delivery are added into the totals of the central area
if they are in the total please exclude them
rio puerco is a stand alone point
rio puerco should still be added into the total transport receipt and delivery
if you have questions please call
thanks ds
i spoke to the guys in the field last week when our deliveries went up and we made the decision to run the pigs
it was passed on to us that the fluids in the line were heavies that were in the gas streams possibly coming from the bitter lakes and red bluff points
i had them pull moisture readings and they were well below tw's #0 of water
they said it was more like drip
this heavies are in the gas stream that is falling out and collecting in the pipe
i agree that we need to run pigs when we have the volumes
we in gas control will continue to work with the field to make that happen
if i have the wrong impression on what is happening i apologize
please let me know
thanks ds
gary gary spaggins and i have a presentation that we have to give to stan

thanks for the info
ds
this is the error i got when trying to update capacity
this was done in model office
the capacity is set at 0 mmbtu/d
please allocate with the points if it still shows up after we allocate the west of thoreau group
if you have any questions please ask
ds
sorry i'm already committed to another meeting

they will be down for friday and looks like they will come on sometime early saturday
ds
station 0 will be unavailable until monday afternoon
july 0rd
the recycle valve is leaking gas and a new valve is being shipped from houston

tuesday or wednesday works for me
ds
citizens is going to sign the agency and operating agreement today
tw will be taking over the operations and monitoring the griffith plant on citizens behalf
we will be monitoring the alarms at the plant and you have a call out sheet for citizens personnel
we also will be responsible for the operations at the plant
currently in scada we have griffith power plant el paso and griffith power plant tw
please get familiar with the points and how set points will need to be sent
to change el paso
the set point will be at 0
tw will be at 0
when you send flow set points of 0,0 that will automatically convert to pressure control
set points less than 0,0 will stay on flow control
we will have to experiment with set points when we have orders on tw and el paso
currently we have orders just off of tw
0
currently el paso is set on 0,0 flow which will control on pressure and tw flow set point is at 0,0
this is on flow control
0
when we have a flow order from el paso we may want to set them on flow control and tw on pressure
we will just have to experiment with the best operation
0
remember the above mentioned is at the plant and not at the tw mainline i/c
we are working with citizens to be able to see el paso mainline i/c
el paso will be responsible for the mainline i/c and setpoints
i put a copy of the agreement in everyone's inbox for your review
if you have questions we can get with craig lipke with citizens and ask for their help
last conversation with him was we would just have to operate and see which scenario best fits the situation
in other words they really don't know which is the best way to operate
thanks ds

when doing allocation process and we allocate points or groups on the timely
evening
or non-grid
we allocate with the capacities that are loaded from cas
when allocating points or groups that have not previously been allocated on any of the previous cycles during id-0 or id-0 we need to use the flow rate calculation
example
allocations are as follows the only point to be exempt from this method should be socal needles because of their window issue timely
m/l thoreau west system 0.0
capacity
i/b link 0.0
capacity
socal needles 0.0
window
evening
same sequence non-grid
same sequence id-0or id-0
same sequence shows up to be allocated
since they were previously allocated on the earlier cycles we do not need to right mouse click and calculate flow and update capacity based on flow rate
the only time we should have to calculate flow rate is when there is a new point or group shows up that has not been previously allocated
the reason for the change is we have recieved more ferc data requests on capacities and scheduled volumes
lets try this for a while and see how it is working
i will be here tuesday only this week
tuesday works for me
we will need to start operating the griffith plant tw and el paso points
refer to the previous memo that was sent suggesting the operations
ds
when operational capacity changes during any cycle the below comments will need to inserted into the point or group comment section in cas
0
low line pack inventory 0
i/c or plant non performance 0
high line pack inventory 0
compression status 0
other *during normal business hours except for evening and id-0
myself
gary
steve
terry
or john should be responsible for loading comments into cas unless the reps
have been given the directive to update comments
*weekends
and holidays
reps
will be loading comments into cas
*when new points or groups show up to be allocated that have not previously been allocated
you will need to page me or in my absence gary
steve
we will let you know what to do with the capacity either update or allocate
if you have any questions please call me or page

thanks for the invite
ds
the below was revised and posted to the tw internet site
ds
they have a rep
flying in tonight to help evaluate the situation
it has something to do with the variable speed on the unit
they can start it but can't keep it running and speed up
ds
the below attached has been reposted to the tw web site
we need to make sure that when we have any issues concerning the griffith plant we put something on the log
it has been brought to our attention that we had a problem on aug
0th and aug
0th and there is nothing in the logs about anything
i was here on the 0th and know they almost ran themselves out of gas because they started pulling more than our setpoint and did not call to let us know
if anyone can recall what took place on the 0th please drop me and e:mail
citizens is trying to gather information on these days based on complaints from griffith plant
thanks ds

tim looks good to john and i
thanks for you help
this is all we know for now
do you want to be on the call
if so can we use your office
the pressure regulator has been taken out of service at the tw griffith i/c on the mainline
this is to hopefully minimize the pressure swings to the plant
david if you have any other comments please respond with your ideas
thanks ds
i'm sorry i have a previous meeting scheduled

this will make it transparent to our customers
thanks ds
i will not be able to attend nng is having their customer meeting in kc

you did mean september 0th instead of october i hope
i know your doing this to see if anyone really reads your e:mails
ds
i just figured this was a new way to test us
ds
test
after talking with ken and our gas control it appears we had and operater error
a setpoint was put in at the tw mainline
the problem was corrected and the plant pressure came back
we think with an open line of communications between the plant and gas control we hope to minimize the mistakes
if any other concerns please call
thanks ds 0-0-0
we need to keep our communications open to the plant
i know that during their test mode they have had a variance in load projections
hopefully when they become operational their loads will be more steady
ken
sorry about yesterday
thanks to your quick responce to our gas control so we could correct the problem before the plant went down
if you have any more questions please call
thanks ds 0-0-0
they had a 0,0 order and kieth put the setpoint in at the mainline
they sent a schedule for what they intended to pull hourly and he didn't look at it
i got with him yesterday and explained how the spread sheet works they send us and how to figure the hourly takes for a 0 hr period
guess i should'nt assume they know to do that
i will take the to do to get with each gas controller again and explain how griffith works both at the power plant controls and the mainline
ds
i don't know that for a fact
i assumed since they do the same thing for the lamar power plant they should know to do the same for griffith and calpine
that is why we send those daily schedules
ds
this is fyi
we need to be more careful on this point and refer to the schedule they send us
please if you have any questions call
ds
fyi
mike can you and danny get with either gary or myself to get access to change capacities for the mops system in nng contract management system
cas
we will show you where and how to do that
you will also need to post outages to the nng web site
thanks ds
this is what ken sent for gas consumption during the pressure loss
this is the schedule that was sent to gas control
was on a conference call with keith
tw gas control
and ken gruel
griffith plant
monday morning
september 0
concerning pressure drop at the griffith plant
it was discovered that the tw mainline setpoint had been changed to reflect the new order of 0,0 for the day
the plant sent tw a schedule of hourly burns for the day
they had intended to take their 0hr rate with-in 0 to 0hrs
asked keith to raise the tw mainline setpoint to approximately after speaking with keith off line and asked him to open the spead sheet from ken on their takes asked him to figure the hourly take for the 0 hrs
he said that he made a mistake and didn't look at it
the griffith plant has been on line since sometime in april and this should not be anything new to the gas controllers
asked keith to call ken back with griffith and make sure they had gas controls e:mail address and or fax number to send any revisions
thanks ds
ken this was forwarded to gas control
please add gas control to your e:mail distribution list
ds
please send a test page to the gas control address as i am on it
thanks ds
it's the same as the name
but with no spaces
please send us a test case
thanks ds
this has been forwarded to the gas controllers
gas controls e:mail address no spaces

citizens griffith az
i/c
mainline takeoff
grif
the lo pressure alarm on the analog page for the downstream pressure going to the griffith plant from tw's mainline has been reset at 0#
the lo lo pressure alarm is set at 0#
reason
this should give you time to react to possible low pressure concerns in the 0 to 0 miles of pipe from mainline to griffith plant and hopefully prevent any plant upsets
this is for our protection
you may need to raise the setpoint
for call outs for alarms tw operations is responsible
if anyone does not agree with this please let me know and we can discuss
griffith power plt
el paso and tw
citz
we monitor these two sites as emar for citizens
remember anytime you receive alarms on these points you refer to the call out list for citizens
if you have questions please refer to the handout you received or call me
the plant is currently down and planning on coming on line and commercial tuesday september 0
there are still some questions on which is the better way to set the site for flows
let me know what you think of setting tw on pressure control and el paso on flow control
reason
tw pressure is higher and with el paso on flow control this will allow tw to take the swing when griffith has orders from both pipelines
let me know of your experience with this and let's discuss and write up some guidelines for us to follow
thanks ds
check with the plant
we need to watch this real close
we are scheduled for a conference call with griffith and citizens and el paso
they want to discuss operational scenarios
jesse i will let you know when and where so you can listen and add your view points from a gas control perspective
thanks ds
the gas temp that gas control see's leaving roswell
station 0
is running between 0 to 0 degrees
please if i'm looking at this wrong please correct me
thanks ds
next week will be fine
let me know
ds
what seems to be the problem with start up
when you do will you be in more test phases or commercial
ds
sounds like to me they will still be swinging and still in the test mode
tw will work with griffith as we can
ds
sounds like you will still be in your test mode and need to swing

just in case you receive a call from either jb or david
they were called yesterday and i spoke with neal and let them know they were going short again after we cleaned up their current imbalance over last weekend and monday
they were short for wednesday's gas day
my conversation was with neal that they make adjustments to their nominated volumes or turn on more gas
it does not appear they did either one
i will call them this morning and let them know that they have until id-0 to turn on more gas or cut their noms or tw will be cutting their market for id-0
maybe this is a good opportunity to discuss park and ride again
tw covered 0,0 mmbtu/d of markets according to the scada numbers that we see
let me know if you agree
thanks ds
this will be for approximately 0 hrs
jeff will be calling you before they do anything
fyi
right now guys we will do our best to keep the station on line however we can't predict what flows will be
if we don't have the volumes we can't do it
the gas prices so far for oct
look higher going to cal
border
we will have to see if we have the volumes next week to run the pigs
sure would have been nice to have run pigs this week everyone could see that flows were up and we should have taken advantage of this
again
we will take a look at all scenario's next week

this is special from christine
below is a perliminary report that citizens sent and their recommendation
please note rob's message
gary will you and tiny review the report and next week we can set a conference call to discuss what we think that can be done if we choose to regulate our pressure to the citizens site
the call will include all the above personnel
after we have our call i would like to call citizens and let them know if there is anything tw can or is willing to do
or is it a citizens design problem
i will let everyone know the dial in number on monday
i will be on vacation tomorrow
thanks ds
this is an email sent to me after my conversation with rob last week
i don't know where he is leading with this
however will every one please read the below and jerry in my absense please work with everyone to try and come up with a solution that tw is willing to live with as we go forward as tw and emar
operators for citizens
sorry i won't be able to any help this week as i will be traveling to new mexico for my mom's funeral

this is the outage for redrock tie-ins and volumes
as of the 0th tw and nng are balanced
i agree with gary we need to stay balanced
this is the most current
would this be something we would consider or do we need to suggest tw host in houston
you are correct however there are no nominations
yes i can
let me know when this is finalized
looks good to me
my portion
we currently have an accumulated imbalance due tw from pnm of approximately 0,0 mmbtu
we do not need to let this keep growing
talked with chuck thompson
pnm
and we both have agreed that tw is not to over deliver to pnm until we can verify the measurements
we need to keep the total order in balance
we will work on this next week
thanks ds
i don't think that decision has been made
i think we should be allocating
this should be discussed today at the tw afternoon marketing meeting
as of the jan
0 amy got them to take their schedule down from
0 to
0 and tw is now receiving make up
we will continue to watch this point
i called steve richards at the station and this unit is in plant held for future use
i told him to get started
this is for unit 0 down from 0/0 to 0/0
we will still have two units available
per robert baker
the tw valero pecos i/c unavailable until further notice
will keep you updated
thanks ds
yes we do and i will make copies
works for me
i would like to know where and how this is going to affect us and all the parameters
kim i know mansoor is working on the project and i will get with him
i would like to be included in the discussions from the beginning on new i/c ideas and locations

melissa left a message that the volumes should start flowing to make the imbalance for the month
they cannot split stream flows
as of sunday
january 0
0 griffith power plant located off of tw's mainline was declared operational for commercial usage to the power grid market
gas control issues
nominations
their could be nominations every day for flow from el paso and tw depending on the price and transportation agreements between duke and ppl
you will see a total nom for the tw side in your daily orders and the el paso order will have to come from the tw logistics team
flows
we may have to batch the el paso volumes depending on the nominations
we will watch the noms this week to get a feel of where and how much they may vary
as agents for citizens under the emar umbrella
we will need to get with the el paso controller and let them know that your going to open their side to be primary and start taking flow from them to accumulate the order
if this looks like it is going to be small volumes we may need to batch the gas and work with el paso controllers
currently at the griffith power plant tw and el paso screens the primary control set point is 0
tw primary
when you need to flow from el paso you will need to switch the service to 0
el paso primary
and flow the gas until accumed and switch back to 0
tw primary
if anyone has a question on this please call me and we can walk through it
again as emar we are to make the changes at the site from gas control
the only time we should get the citizens people involved with the i/c is if we have a problem with primary switches or pressure problems
please refer to the call out sheet on the console for citizens
please don't hesitate to call if you need help
thanks ds
i will be out thursday afternoon
how about friday sometime
i can make that
that is fine with me
just let me know
0 is a bi-directional point and physically can flow both ways
one oak built a new delivery point with the capacity of 0,0 and the other point that was a delivery only is still active
the two i/c's go into different pressures into their system but physically located in the same yard
tw
along with marketing
kevin hyatt
asked to keep the same poi and asked to set this point up as a summation meter to make it easier for the customers to nom on both pipes
karen was involved in this point
0 is only a delivery only and is good for only displacement
0 is no longer a bi-directional point according to will fernandes on the monahans team it is a delivery to nng only
he will send an e:mail
the burlington jackrabbit i/c in san juan
that was burlington's plant and i/c
they were the only shippers able to use that point
they are not using that point and they will get back with me and let us know if they want us to keep the point in active status
if any other questions please call ds
0 tw-nng ward
we need to leave as bi-directional
will fernandes called back and said they were mistaken and there are still one 0
orfice run dedicated to flow gas back to tw
they apologize for the confussion
burlington jackrabbit
olivia with burlington called and the point does no longer exist on their side and will not ever be using it
does this mean we can inactivate it on tw
i appologize for some confusion
0 valero ward
is only a delivery and we do displacements
0 tw-nng ward
is a bi-directional point
jackrabbit we can inactivate
thanks ds

this is cheaper than hiring a collection agency and we retain more of the funds
let me know if you have questions
dear dr
lay
thank you for your presentation yesterday
as always
you handled very well some tough questions in a very trying time for enron
i was literally mortified when i heard the
crack
question
but i think you handled that well too
as a 0-year enron veteran
the question made me truly ashamed to be associated with the co-worker who asked the question
hindsight is always 0/0
i'm sure you must know that the majority of enron's employees don't feel the same way as this one individual
thanks for your continued hard work and support

as we discussed yesterday
panda energy international
inc
and teco energy
inc
tampa electric
have formed a partnership to build
own
and operate a 0 mw gas-fired electric generation plant located in maricopa county
arizona
southwest of phoenix
the partnership may be called
panda gila river l.p
here are some of the details as we know them
all building
air permits received
construction has commenced financing closed 0/0/0
oversubscribed by 0%
$0.0 bn loan
$0.0bn 0 yr
bullet loan and $0mm equity bridge
financing led by citibank and societe generale 0% of power output sold under long term contracts
0% on spot market what we want to know is
how did the banks get comfortable on the financing if only 0% of the gas pipeline transport capacity is under contract
and right now there is only one pipeline capable of serving the plant's needs
how did the banks get comfortable with only 0% of the power output sold under long term contracts
what happens after the bullet loan comes due
are the operators taking interest rate risk and hoping to refinance at a lower rate in year 0
any information you can provide on the above would be very helpful
we are scheduled to meet with panda in dallas on tuesday 0/0
thanks for the help
kevin hyatt
thanks for the update on the cougar
i need to try and see him this weekend
estimated annual storage costs are $0mm if my math is correct
thanks buzz
this helps alot
lorna
were you able to get a copy
couldn't another explanation be that the board did understand the partnership transactions and were comfortable with the deals once the chinese walls and protections were put in place
i don't believe the board members would shirk their responsibilities
as you pointed out
most of the members have more than the average expertise to understand the transactions
if for no other reason than not taking the chance in possibly sullying their individual reputations by not properly vetting the deals
i am out of the office travelling 0/0
returning 0/0
let me know if you have an alternate time/day and what topic you would like to meet about
the
revised
bear looks better

can you please verify for me the delivery pressure in pounds for volume off the sun devil project at the juncture of panda's lateral at the el paso interconnect outside of phoenix
using doug's cost scope from 0/0/0
are we at 0# or something different
this was the scope with the 0-inch phoenix lateral
thanks
carrie
fyi
what would be the pressure if we don't install stations 0.0 and kingman
my thinking is we might not have enough market at cal border to require those stations
hi harvey

0
website is www.electricpowerexpo.com/ep0/cfp.html
primary attendees are electric power plant developers
builders
operators
and equipment suppliers
one of our proposed speaking topics is
lng
a new role in north american supply
a concern among power generators has been the lack of domestic gas supply and pipeline infrastructure to serve growing gas-fired electric generation needs
the committee feels lng can and will play a more a prominent supply role in the near future
i'm looking for an lng expert who would be willing to give a 0-0 minute presentation on the morning of march 0
0
0
0:0am
they would be speaking with 0-0 other presenters and then participate in a q&a session afterward
after you visit the website

can the two of you coordinate a revenue model for sun devil that incorporates a straight
fixed variable rate design along the following parameters using 0
0 and 0 year terms
san juan utilization
0% of 0,0/mmbtu/d mainline
0% utilization of 0,0/mmbtu/d phoenix lateral
0% utilization of 0,0 mmbtu/d also
prepare some roe sensitivities if the above utilization falls by 0% and rises by 0%
i will be out of town till tues 0/0

it may be after the first of the year before i do anything
i'll continue to stick this out for awhile
maybe ride this wave back up
i'm working on a new pipeline project to serve phoenix growth
maybe the new owners will take a greater interest in assets than the previous ones
we will likely not have a problem until after the merger closes next year
i think for this year we'll be fine
i'm working on a replacement
i saw scott last year at a rockets game
remember steve dickerson
he's working with us now on a consulting basis
i've called julie twice
still waiting on a response

no meeting today but here's the update
we had our meeting with az public service on friday 0/0
here's the highlights
0 year term is not a deal killer rates
fuel are high but san juan gas price helps they like the pressure guarantee they like being able to swing the volume within the day aps has electric line row that may include underground row going south towards el paso
if so
we may be able to use this path to reach panda and the el paso system at a reduced cost
aps will check it out and get back with me
next steps
meetings are being set up with duke
sempra
and pg&e for the week after thanksgiving

enron credit rating and where the pipelines stand with the current financial situation
do we have a timeline wherein the pipes
specifically tw
will have its own credit rating
0
full requirements contract settlement at ferc aps still has no idea where this process will lead as far as their volume requirements are concerned
aps is still comfortable committing 0,0 mmbtu/d to sun devil
but likely not the 0,0 we asked for
though 0,0 with an option to increase is a possibility
if i can set it up
are you available for breakfast with panda on wed morning
how early
regards
panda has already scheduled other meetings around ours so they can't move our time
the will likely be in our office around 0:0pm tues and we should be done around 0:0

thanks

glad to hear you're hanging in there
i sent your resume over to gaye lyn schaffart at northern border
they were looking for an analyst
did anyone contact you
it's been tough with sun devil
we've changed the scope somewhat and lowered the overall cost
but the current financial situation still makes it tough
stay in touch and i'll keep my eyes and ears open for you
kevin
it just keeps getting uglier and uglier around here
how are you
you making any money off getting former enron folks hired out or are they being treated like lepers
i've got a resume i'd like to send you if you're interested on a kid who was our business development analyst

a recruiter friend of mine suggested you contact leadersonline.com if you haven't already

if so

some days are worse than others
i'm still trying to develop new gas pipeline business in the west
but it's hard without a lot of loose cash lying around
contact nova guides in minturn
colo have fun
i verified the numbers with ron
he did make the addition error
i also added the line for the red hawk lateral as a separate item
james had already run the economics using $0mm plus a 0% risk adjustment adder for the capex for a total of $0mm
i think we have enough pad in this thing to take care of the error
life is good
work sucks
things are a little tough
we judge the day by how many news trucks are parked outside
we need a good natural disaster somewhere in the world to take the media heat off enron

tw currently owns a section of pipe called the gomez lateral located south of tw's west texas #0 compressor station
the lateral is approximately 0 miles long and is a 0-inch diameter pipeline

pioneer gas pipeline is an intratstate gathering and transmission company
pioneer has expressed a written interest in acquiring the lateral from tw for $0 million
current book value on the line is ______________
tw could file with ferc for abandonment of the pipe
and sale
under the existing blanket authority if
0
no it gas has flowed for the 0 months prior to effective date of the sale or
0
no ft shipper has a firm receipt or delivery point on the lateral for the 0 months prior
if an ft shipper does have a valid contract on the lateral
then we would need to get the shipper to amend his contract to effectuate the sale
items to verify
0
identify any entity currently having firm receipt or delivery rights on the gomez lateral 0
determine volume of gas in pipe and associated value for sale
field ops is checking
opportunities for tw
by pioneer puchasing and integrating the lateral into their system
they can effectuate incremental supply deliveries into tw
this would reduce the amount of gas necessary for tw to transport south of wt-0
via displacement
and make more supply available for deliveries going west
a lunch has been scheduled with phil allard from pioneer on wednesday 0/0 if you would like to attend
per our conversation today
when you folks get a chance
i need someone to verify the current pressure of the gomez lateral and do a linepack calculation for me
we are evaluating a potential sale of the lateral and need to know how much sweet gas is in the system

i've installed a new one
but the only windows operating system i have is on a restore disk from compaq

it's giving me an

error when i try the restore
this may be due to the fact that i trying to restore on a bigger hard drive than the original
anyway
i also have win0 upgrade 0nd edition
when i try to load this
is looks for verification of ownership of a previous win system
which i don't have except on the restore disk which won't work
so my question is this
do we have an old win0 operating system lying around i can borrow so i can load my win0 upgrade

risks
red lake connection to kern cuts into tw forward haul market rewards
expands tw's park n
ride capabilities
we offer more capability and back it with a storage position
better pnr rates over the short term than what the storage can offer more backhaul business on tw mainline
i.e

i hope your conversation with paul cherry went well last week
paul indicated to me that you might be sending a conf agrmt for us to execute so you could then pass along to us some of the debt covenant waterfall language
i'll be happy to push that agreement thru the channels here once you send it
if you feel it might be faster for us to send you our standard form agreement
let me know
also
along those same confidential lines
if you can provide to me some various operating scenarios for the plant

deregulation of the chicken's side of the road was a threatening dominant market position
the chicken was faced with significant challenges to create and develop the competencies required for the newly competitive market

in a partnering relationship with the client
helped the chicken by rethinking its physical distribution strategy and implementation processes
using the poultry integration model

andersen helped the chicken use its skills

the fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity
bill gates
i will soon release the new chicken office 0
which will not only cross roads
but will lay eggs
file your important documents
and balance your checkbook
oliver stone
the question is not
why did the chicken cross the road
rather
it is
who was crossing the road at the same time
whom we overlooked in our haste to observe the chicken crossing
charles darwin
chickens
over great periods of time
have been naturally selected and evolved over time in such a way that they are now genetically endowed with the capabilities required to cross roads
albert einstein
whether the chicken crossed the road or the road moved beneath the chicken depends upon your frame of reference
buddha
asking this question denies your own chicken nature
ralph waldo emerson
the chicken did not cross the road
it transcended it
colonel sanders
i missed one
bill clinton
i did not
repeat
did not have sexual relations with the chicken
sorry
i was thinking bi-directional and wrote unilateral
the ca with panda should be bi-lateral
outstanding
thanks

hope you received the easement and line maps ok
we are pulling the maintenance records together and should have this done by 0/0
how does your calendar look for friday 0/0 to meet at the monahans office or early the week of 0/0
prior to 0/0 i will be out of the office at a power convention in st

i could then meet you at monahans on 0/0 or sometime the following week

following up on our conversation re
red lake storage assuming only a phoenix lateral gets built off tw
no mainline or sj expansion
capital cost is estimated at $0mm
a fully subscribed rate on volume of 0,0/d to get a 0% ror would be $.0/mmbtu
with zero fuel retention
if we assume a more gradual volume ramping up
beginning with 0% load factor in year 0 climbing to 0% in year 0
the target transport rate would need to be $.0
closer to my
top of the head
$.0 we discussed yesterday
both of these scenarios assume 0/0 debt/equity and a salvage value in year 0 of the project equal to 0/0 of the capital cost
also
regarding the kern river expansion
what might the likelihood be of mojave receiving kern gas and backhauling to tw for delivery into aquila red lake
if the kern volume of 0,0
out of 0,0 capacity
doesn't go to calif end-users
i think mojave will have a somewhat stranded segment from cal border to the kern interconnect
we could then take this gas and haul it to phoenix
let me know what you think
and where are you going
if heat exhaust is counted in the
renewable
category
this would be another opportunity to take waste heat at tw compressor stations and convert it to electricity at above market rates
we are looking at one of these opportunties at tw station 0
i'll check and let you know
good luck
is it the same outfit we've been working with who handles red cedar's production into tw
see what happens when you leave the gas bidness homey
williams was in some pretty dire financial straights ala enron and debt they had with their communications group
they apparently realized this last fall and started to panic
buffet boys come in and pick off one of the crown jewels at a pretty sweet price
including the krgt expansion
the sale not only helps wpl's current finances but eliminates the need to spend $0.0bn on the expansion
what's interesting is the preferred shares also established in the deal
warren could end up owning a big chunk of wpl when it's over
arnold
what's the word on ormat
sta 0 heat recovery
are they pursuing
we may have additional opportunities for ormat based on pending legislation in new mexico
let me know please

mona suggested that it would be a good idea to try to schedule a separate meeting to discuss rather than attempt to do it during our weekly staff meeting
let me know if this date works
ok
i'm trying this again
jim
please let me know if you receive this
i'm attaching the previous notes
hi
fyi
yesterday a deal was submitted to the california commission
without just about everyone in the industry signing
to restructure socalgas
more details to come
but wanted to give a flavor
knowing that you're actively engaged in negotiations
assuming a 0.0.0 approval date by the commission

i think dennis
shawne and i were supposed to work more on #0
but since i can't recall
i'm sending to all
first
i apologize
i tried to work directly with the excellent spreadsheet carolyn put together
but i kept fumbling
butchering
etc
so i canibalized her great stuff and created a new spreadsheet
attempting to incorporate the
clarifications
yeah
right
that prof mccullough distributed via email
and the stuff we talked about during break
i.e
timing of cash flows
the answers are at the bottom of the work sheet
and i've also included the report
though i did not peruse it for errors
relevancy
etc
my biggest concern is question 0
my answer
despite some outliers
sez that there ain't no loan in june
this may mean my spreadsheet's got a fatal flaw--significant probability
finally
doing a series of 0,0 trials resulted in some considerable variability across runs--again
could be due to screw up on my part--so the answers i generatd comes from a run of 0,0 trials
if you run the sheet
beware
0,0 takes some time
unless you've got dsl or something
let me know if this is completely out to lunch
or if you're coming up with something remotely similar
best
jeff
greetings
due to scheduling conflicts and in the attempt not to waste anyone's time
we'll try to conduct some preliminary due diligence via email
voicemail
etc
i've asked gp to get us their audited financial statements for purposes of credit check
here is some additional information about the project
if any questions come to mind based on this info
please let me know and we can forward along to gp for answers
at this point we have tentatively scheduled a meeting with gp's ceo in the s.f
office for tuesday
june 0th at 0 am

a little background
plan to construct an undersea fiber optic
0 fiber
cable linking several of california's major coastal cities
san diego
l.a
santa barbara
san luis obispo
monterey
s.f
will use a
festooned
arrangement
i.e
exit sea at each city point
total undersea length is ~0 km
at each coastal city
they'll have a pop to connect to pstn
at san luis obispo
santa barbara and manhattan beach
they will deploy two
separate diverse cable routes from sea to pop
will deploy dwdm
plan includes eventual connections to existing and planned trans-pacific systems
in addition to
loops
created in slo
sb and manhattan beach
plan includes a terrestial leg from s.f
to monterey to create a land/sea loop between sf and monterey
total terrestial piece is ~0 km
which includes s.f
to monterey terrestial leg
eventually
they'd like to secure terrestial leg from monterey to san diego to create a complete loop
has received environmental permit from state lands commission
clec certification from california puc
and is awaiting environmental permit from coastal commission
expect to have southern portion of system
san diego to san luis obispo
built and lit by end of q0 0
northern piece likely to take longer due to complications associated with federal wildlife preserve off of monterey
may end up bypassing monterey altogether
the people behind the build are techno-philes
they admit to being
clueless
when it comes to marketing the capacity
due to tyco's perceived lack of performance
tyco is out and alcatel is in
per ethan's emails
they are distressed
deutschbank has $0mm in the deal and is pushing on them
willing to part with dark fiber for a deep discount
best
jeff
fyi
i didn't receive email yesterday
and i only started receiving them today at 0 am
quesiton
after clinton's speech
don't you think the convention is going to cry when they have to sit through al gore
i'm worried----he's so pathetic
great
glad to hear it
did you get my voice mail
makes sense for you to go ahead and start cobbling together a formal proposal
i've talked to folks internally
and will discuss further with them tomorrow and friday when i'm in houston
i'd like you to keep the information confidential
but i'm fairly confident that we're already at the point where it's not a matter of whether but of what the terms and conditions of the contract and the scope of the project will be
best
jeff
when's a good time to discuss
i'd like to get as diverse a group of co-sponsors as possible
and as many as possible
attached is the letter that we sent to lynch explaining the info we thought ought to be made publicly available
we're discussing how we can ensure that the market has access to any and all information that ferc might use in its
investigation
so that independent analyses might be undertaken
is there anything in addition to the information we included in the letter to lynch
or that is already be publicly available
that ferc might use in its investigation and that we ought to target for public release
thanks alot
best
jeff
hi
i'm hear in houston---currently at elizabeth's desk
do we have a number for sue nord and scott to call into
or are we just going to call them from the conference room
i'll come look for you later
jeff

thanks so much again for your help

hi
thanks for all the help
life's nuts
i'll try to give you a call later in the day and catch up
greetings
just wanted to let you know that i've dropped product management
e0a-0
so i can be removed from the list
thank you
just checking in to see if anything that you folks were working on ever got into the s.d
tribune
etc
or if you were continuing to work on things
hope all's well
it's a jungle out there
best
jeff
greetings
i'm back from vacation
trading voicemail with jessie knight
trying to get him to appear at the hearing
if there's anything else you need me to do---call ms van way
etc.---just let me know
best
jeff
greetings
is there a chance of setting up a call-in number for these meetings
hope all is well in the land of craziness
best
jeff
rob had robert michaels give me a ring re
potential panelist at the field hearing
be happy to pitch him to ms van way
thoughts
my apologies
i took a vacation that i was in much need of
and as you know
it's more hectic trying to take off on vacation than it is coping with the day-to-day mess
and i came back to utter chaos
regarding my homework assignment
i checked my records and
lo and behold
i am completely vested
that said
i also thought long and hard about making a switch and came to the conclusion that the switch would need to be a significant one in order to make leaving a compelling proposition
of course
it goes without saying that working with you is about as compelling as it gets
but when i stack up the other pieces of the puzzle
they seem somewhat less compelling than the opportunity to work with you
it is so enticing
but it is with extreme regret that i am inclined to decline your gracious offer
would be happy to discuss it further
and you know without me saying that i am honored that you considered me and greatly appreciative
give a holler when you find a minute
best
jeff
fyi
though i had a somewhat different notion when i initially raised the idea of co-sponsorship
i agree with lee's observations and think that we should proceed the way he suggests
house power subcommittee
will you send a note to folks regarding the ga meeting here in sf next thursday
greetings
let me know when you would like to discuss the
value
that ga brought to our pipeline group
we discussed it when i was in houston week before last
best
jeff
fyi
according to roger
if the freeze is extended out toward 0 for pg&e and edison
his book makes big money
does tomorrow work
thursday or friday works best for me
thursday or friday works best for me
but i might be able to make wednesday
too
sorry about that
meant to send to tracy
no
e
cooper in portland
oregon
darlin
the last thing i want is to be rid of you
get in touch when you can
and next time you're in town
i'm buying
best
jeff
thursday
0.0
works for me for meeting #0
we talked about this in detail with steve when he was in houston
please check with him
the idea is that there would be the flexibility necessary to do just about anything
also
there are problems with the decision that steve was going to talk with pulsifer about
need to get status of those conversations.my understanding was that
if there's a problem with the decision
perhaps our filing would be pushed a bit past the tuesday
we'll need to find that out
too
position on what
jim has mentioned a meeting next week with all of us to talk about strategy
etc
over the next many months
might be a good opportunity to clarify how we coordinate on these matters
c0 was up 0 points today
i figure that means you signed a deal with them yesterday
retest
sounds good
given that sue is going to be back on tuesday
you may want to coordinate drafting duties with her
howdy
just between thee and me
i think this note gets to some of the challenges we faced and discussed as part of our
group gropes
over the last several months
with sue coming back on tuesday
and in the spirt of our gropes
it might be useful to discuss as a group prior to charging ahead
may even result in the same outcome on how to proceed
but a little
process
on the front end may go a long way toward keeping things on an even keel
anywho
just my two cents
hope your meetings in salem went well
best
jeff
fyi
greetings
wow
lots of fun out there
eh
don't know what it will be like without steve peace around any more
i have a very mundane question
though
what prices for intrastate capacity did the puc finally come up with in the sempra bcap for large generators under the new
sempra-wide
rate doctrine
thanks a million
best
jeff
thanks a million
agree that humor is needed right now
though it's in short supply
so to speak
did i
or did i not
already give you mine
signed
confused
don
see attached from today's wsj
greetings david
just checking in to gauge how you folks are doing in cobbling together a proposal and to see if any roadblocks have been encountered
hope all is well

jeff
greetings all
if memory serves
our filing in california is due on tuesday
steve bowen
co
should be getting me a draft today based on our discussion a couple of weeks ago in houston
soon as i get it
i'll be distributing for review
aim would be to have it in shape cob tomorrow
thoughts
p.s
some good news
recall from our meeting a couple of weeks ago that i mentioned that there were some preliminary filings we had to make in arizona
in order to transact business there
prior to filing for a cpcn
well
i've spoken with robin hill
and those filings have already been made some time ago
so that's one less thing to worry about
best
jeff
we'll send a card
she's 0
well
if we have to
we'll take some tomotoes
taking the suit and
if prentice permits
annie
too
could you discuss with eldon whether you guys want to do the dome road while my is doing my road at the end of the month
he's going to fax me the estimate based on his visit when we were all up there last
to be honest
the deck's got me pretty darned gun-shy about
projects
and this guy is really nice and i want to work with him for years to come
he's pretty willing to do whatever you folks want
i.e
from yugo-style road to rolls royce-style road
and if you want to take a pass
that's of course great
too
i just want to make sure it doesn't turn in to a cluster-you-know-what
just let me know
need amber's address
too
thank you
yes
please forward along

nope
not at this point
rather than start with money
we'd rather start with getting the rules
i.e
the ious
fixed so that there ain't regulatoy roadblock after roadblock standing in the way of deployment
sound reasonable
fyi
call me unreasonable
i can take it
been called worse
though
of course
coming from you
it hurts more
i don't we're ready
could call at some point so we can discuss
alpert has passed both assembly and senate--on way to governor
0.0 cent cap
am faxing in case you don't have
jeff
do you mind if i meet with carl and severin and rich next time i'm over at haas to discuss this a bit with them
i'm sorry
i'm losing my mind
did you send amber's address
if so
i've deleted it
could you send again
also
are you sure you don't want the tickets
they come with free parking
it ain't the closest lot
but hey
it saves 0$
also
please let me know when you've confirmed with the g.o
that you don't want to do road
so that i can tell jeff
and of course we'll pick up the football forms
just make sure they're somewhere easy to find

we'll be coming up tomorrow evening to pick up all the stuff

california's price caps raising average cost of power the retail price caps imposed in california are leading to higher averageprices for longer periods of time as demand responsiveness is dulled and supply is retarded
according to a report released by morgan stanley deanwitter
traders interviewed by the firm said that calendar strips for 0through 0 have traded in excess of $0/mwh
or around $0/mwh higher than a month ago
what's more
the firm said
the expected trough in the forwardcurve * projected in the 0-0 time frame *
continues to move out in time
the dean witter study reported that the change in futures pricing for thecalifornia oregon border
a proxy for northern california pricing
and atpalo verde
a proxy for southern california pricing
trading hubs show similar upward trends from june through august
the study said the most alarming thing for the state is the increased threaof power outages
higher priced regions like the desert southwest and thenorthwest
will suck exports out of the state and deter imports
dean witter said
the tight supply situation is pushing average prices higher
more often
and increasing the risk imports won't arrive at all when they are truly needed
i assume
since c0's stock rose 0 points yesterday
that you struck a deal with them
so far
all is well
thanks for asking
best

hopefully you mean

cathy van way called asking my view on some names she'd been given to invite to the hearing
i continue to cajole jessie knight to appear
during the call
she mentioned that the committee intends to invite steve kean and that she needed someone to email here steve's vitals so that they could write a letter inviting him

cmrc:nasdaq
despite its best efforts
including wednesday's 0% gain
it's still less than half the stock it used to be
trading at about $0 a share
it's well off its split-adjusted high of $0.0
reached near the end of last year
meanwhile
archrival ariba
arba
nasdaq
at about $0 a share
has steadily been marching back toward its all-time high of $0.0
it has jumped 0% since reporting its earnings on july 0
but as wednesday's move may indicate
it may be commerce one's turn
people are beginning to pay attention to the strength of its partnership with germany's sap
sap:nyse adr
an exchange that commerce one is helping build for the big automakers is about to crank up
and perhaps more importantly
some observers are beginning to see some value in commerce one's focus on so-called direct b0b
which involves buying and selling major supplies like steel for cars instead of office supplies
issues aplenty of course
there are still plenty of issues facing commerce one
the same issues that have held its stock down
for instance
it carries the stigma of being a concept stock because no one knows whether those same big industry exchanges actually will work
its sluggish stock also puts it at a disadvantage to chief competitor ariba when it comes to making acquisitions to grow
but for now
there are signs that sentiment is shifting in commerce one's favor
gavin mlinar
an analyst at sands brothers
sees three short-term positives for commerce one
he's the analyst who had the gall to downgrade ariba on valuation concerns
his firm hasn't done underwriting for either company
mlinar says the word on wall street is that commerce one
along with its new best friend sap
will announce two new online exchanges in the coming weeks
tsc's adam lashinsky recently wrote a column about the partnership between commerce one and sap
while those sorts of announcements no longer guarantee a moon shot for a company's stock
they could show that the partnership is working
two weeks ago
they announced new exchanges in the mining and energy industries
commerce one declined to comment about the possible exchanges
blastoff on top of that
covisint
the mega-exchange that commerce one is helping build for the auto industry
is slated to begin operations at the end of september
which could give the first indication of whether these exchanges actually work
then there's the coming completion of commerce one's acquisition of consulting firm appnet
apnt:nasdaq
investors initially reacted negatively to that deal
but since then
it's become clear that there aren't enough consultants in b0b to go around
so the deal will give commerce one its own army of geeks to plug in its software
there's no doubt that investors are in a good position with
either commerce one or ariba
mlinar says
but it's a matter now of who has the near-term operational catalysts
i think there
it's commerce one
beyond those short-term catalysts
others say commerce one has been positioning itself smartly for the long term
especially with its focus on the direct business
we think the big play here is in direct
says john biestman
director of investor relations for commerce one
while we will continue to service the indirect procurement side
we are hitting at the heart of where we think b0b will be
which is direct goods
we want to be the best-of-breed player there
ariba has also made headway there
but its focus has primarily been on the indirect business
in part because it's easier to get companies to buy things like paper and pencils online than material that actually goes into the manufacturing process
but with companies becoming more comfortable about buying and selling online
they're now looking to the direct business as a way to save more money
with big customers like gm
gm:nyse
and boeing
ba
nyse
and its partnership with sap
commerce one could be ready to exploit this growing comfort
direct vs
indirect
what's happening is the marketplace is beginning to understand the difference between direct and indirect
says ben smith
a consultant for a.t
kearney
his firm hasn't done consulting for commerce one
picking a
software
solution for one doesn't necessarily include the other
smith points back to commerce one's partnership with sap
for years
the german software maker has been concentrating on the complex kind of software that helps businesses build things
if a firm can successfully plug that in to software designed to buy the building blocks
like commerce one's software
it could have a winning combination
the sap partnership legitimizes commerce one in the direct materials space
smith says
it gives them much more depth from the product standpoint than they can possibly build on their own
of course
ariba isn't letting this business just slide by
it's working with partners i0 technologies
itwo:nasdaq
and ibm
ibm:nasdaq
but this is commerce one's focus
so if companies do begin to use direct b0b
commerce one will be ready and waiting
thank you
thank you
exciting stuff

internet b0bs rose hard and fell hard once before
time for act two
by joe bousquin staff reporter 0/0/0 0:0 pm et url
beware the booming b0bs
several business-to-business stocks rocketed upward wednesday on little news as the nasdaq waffled for most of the day
while some market watchers said investors were betting on a strong quarter
many analysts couldn't explain increases of 0% or more in stocks like commerce one
cmrc:nasdaq
ventro big day for b0b several of the stocks rallied wednesday on little news
you've got me
says bill epifanio
b0b analyst at j.p
morgan
they're all going nuts on nothing
since earnings season ended
sentiment about b0b stocks has shifted back to the rose-colored variety in this sector
while this change is based on the concrete results that companies like ariba
arba:nasdaq
i0 technologies
itwo:nasdaq
and freemarkets
fmkt:nasdaq
delivered
investors also may want to pause and reflect
after all
it was only this past spring that investors grabbed any b0b stock within reach on hopes of unlimited growth
only to have them come crashing back down
focus
before
we were buying stocks on promises of what they could be
and that's when it got out of hand
says eric upin
b0b analyst at robertson stephens
now
you've got to focus on which stocks are delivering lots of growth and revenue
upin looks to ariba and i0 technologies as examples of companies that are actually delivering
he rates both a buy
and his firm hasn't done underwriting for either
ariba recorded $0 million in deferred revenue in the most recent quarter
deferred revenue is money that a company collects before it actually delivers a product or does its job
it's a good signal
because if people are willing to pay before a company gives them something in return
it means there's strong demand
ariba was up $0
or 0%
to $0.0
i0 is considered a strong player in supply-chain management software
and it has a partnership with ariba and ibm
ibm:nyse
it climbed $0.0
or 0%
to reaching
but in a possible indication that investors may have just been reaching for any b0b stock
ventro finished up $0.0
or 0%
at $0.0 on no news
this is the same company that upset analysts and investors with a poor second-quarter performance
with just $0.0 million in net revenue
investors need to be more careful regarding which of the b0bs they select
adds david hilal
a b0b analyst at friedman billings ramsey
when b0b was at its highest
any company that used that acronym seemed to perform well
now
you have to dig deeper and figure out which ones are the real players in this new economy
meanwhile
one of the most interesting subplots wednesday involved commerce one
on no real news
there was talk about an already announced deal
commerce one shot up $0.0
or 0%
to $0.0
there's been a lot of chatter about the company lately
gossips love to talk about how its partnership with german software maker sap
sap:nyse adr
might lead to a merger
then there's the persistent rumor that the two companies will soon announce two more internet exchanges for major industry groups
on top of that
covisint
the big auto exchange that commerce one is helping build
is setting up to launch near the end of september
lump that in with the fact that commerce one's stock has slouched in ariba's shadow lately
add a dash of wednesday's positive sector sentiment
and you've got the most active stock on the nasdaq wednesday
it traded more than 0 million shares
whereas it usually trades 0.0 million
ready to bolt gavin mlinar
an analyst at sands brothers
says the stock has been setting up for a move for a while
september is a big month for them
they have so much on the table for a potential lift
mlinar says
he's been crowing about commerce one since mid-august
when he said the company was starting to look more attractive than ariba on a valuation basis
and overall
mlinar contends that conditions were right for a b0b run
the emphasis and momentum has clearly been building lately
he says
there wasn't much
on a broad basis
since april
and now we're seeing a total rotation into these names
which is just what some observers are cautioning against
hey buddie
give me a call tomorrow
want to catch up on a few things
thanks a bunch
best
jeff
i'd prefer to wait on the call
i'll be distributing my suggested refinements to and speakers for rob's
option 0
by cob today
i'll be in d.c
can't wait to see you
best
jeff
can get that number
you want it pre
blue book
or pre ab 0
or both
if there is going to be a play come the first of the year to meld california's px and iso
skilling may want to consider pre-empting that agenda
and most of this is not new
already included in previous messaging points we've developed internally
it's the gas industry
stupid---for profit transcos is the answer
california's big mistake was replacing one monopoly--the utility---with another--the px
px's are not necessarily bad things
but pxs with a monopoly is a very bad thing
forcing the ious to buy everything from the px was irresponsible
put everyone on a variable rate mortgage
story
decision makers openly admitted that they put in place a strucuture designed not to encourage retail choice and competition
decision makers actively urged families and businesses not to switch to providers offering an
insurance policy
i.e
fixed price deals
against the volatile and risky power exchange price
when you combine the supply shortage
the px monopoly
the nonexistant retail market and decision makers
attempts to discourage choice
you get a debacle--that's what california set itself up for
and that's what it got
putting the px inside the iso will only infect the wound that's already been inflicted
the real answer is
we've developed these points already
this is quick and dirty and can be made much more punchy and articulate
but wanted to get the notion out there given our time constraints

here are some more prices
many thanks to roger yang
power plant siting bill to follow if you'd like it
legislative package only delays pain
critics warn by craig d
rose union-tribune staff writer consumer and political leaders
as well as sempra energy's chief executive
said yesterday that the three electricity bills before gov
gray davis do nothing to fix the fundamental cause of soaring bills
the cause
they say
is that power generators can continue to charge what most characterize as exorbitant prices for their electricity
and consumers ultimately face the daunting task of paying them
no matter if all of the bills are signed
the leaders say california's power market will remain a seller's game that gouges overmatched consumers
and while san diego gas and electric co.'s hard-pressed customers may pay less now
they will pay back all or nearly all the savings
plus interest
beginning in 0
the governor's bill postpones the pain
but the pain is still there
said maureen o'connor
a former mayor of san diego who has been active in seeking relief from the soaring bills afflicting sdg&e's 0.0 million electricity customers
the rate bill promoted by davis and now awaiting his signature will have sdg&e's customers pay about 0.0 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity
or 0 percent more than what they paid as recently as may
power companies
however
will continue to charge the customers as they have
presently
they're charging about 0 cents per kilowatt hour for sdg&e customers
the difference between 0.0 cents and whatever prices above that level emerge from the state's volatile power market will be recorded as ious for each customer in so-called balancing accounts
a second bill before the governor could provide up to $0 million in state money to help pay the balancing accounts
but the bulk of the ious will almost certainly be paid by sdg&e customers themselves when they become due in 0 or 0
a third bill before the governor would speed the construction of power plants
so while the rate bill lets customers pay less now than they owe
it obligates them to pay the balance with interest later
the situation creates the potential for a troublesome compounding effect
the higher electricity prices grow
the more is set aside in the balancing accounts
and the greater the wallop to customer wallets when the accounts come due
based upon prices now paid for future electric deliveries
sempra energy estimates customers will owe $0 million by 0
ious of that magnitude
said sdg&e
will require that customers pay a surcharge of $0 monthly for a year on top of whatever they are already paying for their power bills
keep in mind that typical residential bills at this time last year were about $0
they now stand at about $0
consumer advocates say it's likely power prices will remain at levels that will lead to huge debts for customers under the davis proposal
the generators have shown themselves to be unconscionable in extorting profits
said nettie hoge
executive director of turn
a san francisco-based consumer group
hoge said the bills that emerged
seemed the best a corrupt system could spit out
she added that turn and other groups will shift their focus to pressuring the federal energy regulatory commission to restrain the electric generating companies and wholesale power markets
ferc
she said
must legally determine if charges from generating companies are reasonable
turn and other groups will also press for re-regulation of the industry and will begin to explore municipally owned generating plants
michael shames of the utility consumers
action network supports the davis bill
although he said it won't fix
the almost irreparably broken california energy system
the problem is that california's electricity customers have been subjected to market prices in a dysfunctional energy market
shames said
it's a market controlled by the sellers of power and their cronies
but shames said the davis bill provides at least temporary protection against further rate shocks
and he expects taxpayers across the state will ultimately assist sdg&e's customers in paying their electricity bills
but jamie court
executive director of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights
which has called for re-regulation of the industry
opposes the rate-cap legislation
this keeps ratepayers and taxpayers on the hook for the costs
said court
who added that the bill also locks in near doubling of power rates compared to last year
stephen baum
chief executive officer of sempra
said the bill puts sdg&e
a sempra subsidiary
in the position of financing the difference between what power companies charge for their power and what it collect from customers over the next three years
the balancing accounts
baum said
could grow so large that they will challenge sempra's ability to borrow to cover them
the problem is with the wholesale markets
said baum
who today becomes chairman as well as chief executive of sempra
this legislation does nothing but postpone a big bill
he added that sempra believed the bill included ambiguities that could be illegal if not later clarified by the california public utilities commission
if
the puc
can't or won't
then i think the legislation is legally flawed and can't stand
baum said
talked to dave
in a nut shell
here are the problem areas in the bill as he sees it
it was a very brief conversation
but i think i've captured the key points
based on an expectation that the
expedited siting
bill would help site plants
dave's group had six plants on the drawing board
the 0 ppm requirement kills 0 of the 0
i.e
the 0 can't meet the 0 ppm requirement
the requirement that the plants would either be 0
shut down after 0 years or 0
replaced with a combined-cycle plant kills the other 0 because a
shutting down the plants in 0 years kills the economics
and b
the sites for the two lm-0s can't accomodate combined cylces
i.e
dave couldn't get siting
in addition,the generator would be required to sign an exclusive with the iso
which the eob would have to approve
which takes away the optionality of going to the market
thus killing the economics
on the labor side
it's complicated
but in essence
by requiring that
it be shown that the applicant has a contract with a general contractor and has contracted for an adequate supply of skilled labor to construct
operate
and maintain the plant
it forces dave to negotiate a labor deal before he knows what the project is
i.e
before the project has been approved
and
it effectively prevents enron from having the option to use internal resources
this issue is very specific to enron
i can explain more if folks prefer
in short
bullets 0-0 would seem to affect both enron and the market
while the last bullet is
according to dave
very enron specific
point 0 in bullet 0
according to dave is sensitive and should not be made public
if any questions
let me know
bruno has emailed the price cap and the
general-funds-to-help-finance-the-cap
bills
and faxed the siting bill

hi
my brother just called
would you mind if i gave him the sunday cubs tickets
if you've already secured people for them
not big deal
but i think his kids would get a big kick out of it
they're both big ball players
you're a saint
who won at ping pong last nite
well
sorry to bring it up again
but did we finally give up on uc/csu
jessie knight called me
he's now the ceo of the chamber of commerce is s.d
they plan to launch a campaign next week telling businesses in s.d
that the best thing to leave sempra and switch to another provider
do you want the legislature to manage your energy costs
or do you want to manage them yourself
they want to give illustrative examples of folks who've switched and how well they're doing
ray mcnally's sister is an extremely enthusiastic enron customer and is going to contact the chamber
be useful to have a business or two
or
uc/csu
know it's a long shot
but figured it don't hurt to try
available wednesday but not tuesday
happy holiday to all
man
there must be a lot of bad hair out your way with that kind of heat
hi gavin
could you do me a favor
know you're busy
someone told me that there's an article in last thursday's
nyt blaming the california fiasco on former california commissioner dan fessler
who was responsible
a few years back
for putting in place the structure we have here
have you seen it
if so could you forward
if not
could you try and find it and forward
very much appreciated
best
jeff
here's an attempt at being frank about the legislation without jeopardizing our relationships or commercial prospects
overall
we respect the effort
but california failed to get the ball over the goal line
on siting intentionally or not
california has designed power plant siting laws that make it excruciatingly difficult to construct power plants in the state
folks seem to have lost sight of the need to balance growth and environmental quality in california
that's why nothing's been built in the state for a decade and developers are going outside the state to build power plants
tinkering around the edges won't help
and
with all due respect
the legislation passed yesterday tinkers
real reform is required if california hopes to build the supply necessary to keep pace with silicon valley and a high tech culture and tame the price spikes
if developers continue to have to navigate through a maze of a half a dozen--or more--state and local agencies
california's supply problems will continue
or worsen
california needs real
one-stop shopping and it needs it now
on the retail price cap they don't work
we've already developed all the arguments
so i won't repeat them hear
the press has already reported that the measure the legislature passed simply puts off the day of reckoning
it's like using your credit card--eventually they're going to knock on your door to collect
now
families and businesses will have a hard time managing their budgets because they can't gauge the size of the balloon payment they'll face a couple of years down the road
so san diegans who continue to take service from sdg&e will pay the same amount
but the cap will remove the powerful incentive prices create to use electricity wisely
there's a better answer
instead of urging consumers not to switch
encourage customers to sign with another retail provider
clearly
the biggest mistake california made was the press and decision makers should spend more time talking to folks who signed fixed price deals with companies like enron
but for the press reports
they hardly know there's a crisis
some thoughts on the conference

making it hot for deregulation gregory palast the new york times the news
observer raleigh
nc final
copyright 0
peconic
n.y
while reporters ogled celebrities at barbra streisand's bungalow during the democratic convention in los angeles
something important was being debated 0 miles to the south in san diego
where there was a real display of populism
there politicians have enrolled 0 million citizens in a scary economic experiment
this year
san diego became the first city in california to experience the end of state regulation of electricity prices
when california's lawmakers voted to bring the miracle of market competition to electricity
they wrote into the law that homeowners
bills would fall
by at least 0 percent
in fact
bills jumped 0 percent this august over last
rather than repudiate this mad market experiment
the federal government and 0 other states have rushed to imitate california's lead
actually
californians were lucky
every hour of every day
san diego gas and electric
the local utility
must now buy its electricity at a state auction known as a power pool
on the first hot day this summer
during the noonday heat
the companies that produce the power
newly deregulated
cranked up their bids to $0,0 per megawatt hour
that's about 0,0 percent more than the once
controlled price of $0
but it could have been worse
according to those inside the secretive auction agency
sellers assumed the pool's computers could handle only four-digit bids
in fact
the computers could have accepted bids for seven figures and bankrupted a chunk of the state in a day
one can trace california's electricity market plague largely to a single source
daniel fessler
in the early 0s
fessler
then president of the state's public utilities commission
developed an infatuation with one of margaret thatcher's free-market ventures
the troubled england-wales power pool
how strange
britons pay about 0 percent more for electricity than americans
that's hardly a surprise
as each day around tea time
when england's usage peaks
a small clique of power plant owners take over the electricity auction
bidding up prices by 0 percent to 0,0 percent
in the united states
utilities vowed they would play no such tricks if california removed the limits on profits that have been at the core of regulation policy for the past 0 years
the promise lasted several months
during which time five giant international electricity sellers
all new to california
imported the techniques they'd learned in britain that were designed to manipulate the bidding process and in a single month produce profits once permitted for an entire year
the deregulation bug is now winging eastward
new york city
for example
has reportedly succumbed to 0 percent increases in con edison bills
but in san diego
something extraordinary happened
this month
thousands joined an unprecedented consumers
boycott
the power companies can send out their bloated bills
but the tanned masses won't pay
refuseniks include the council of churches
the school district and
without a hint of shame
steve peace
the state senator who sponsored the deregulation law
the electricity fiasco should be a godsend for al gore's campaign
after all
it was fessler and his fellow republicans who threw california's consumers to the meager mercies of the marketplace
and gov
george w
bush pushed through deregulation in texas
which is widely expected produce hefty returns for a former business partner
sam wyly
owner of the greenmountain
a power seller
but while gore spoke out in los angeles against
powerful forces
on this subject he's mum
no wonder
the clinton-gore administration still promotes california-style deregulation as a model for the nation
but someone's ready to feel california's pain
and it's not good news for gore
during the democrats
big show
ralph nader went to san diego to remind boycotters that he was founding father of the utility consumer action network
the 0,0-member local group leading the anti-corporate uprising
electricity is the first big u.s
industry formerly under the tight control of states to be opened up to international operators and their free market rules
for the first time
americans feel the bite of real globalization
and we don't like it one bit
did they bite
i.e
commerce one
i'm very excited

you're a gem
jackasses
that might not be a word we'd want to use in emails that might
shall we say
get into unfriendly hands
given that the hearing is friday
we'll need to decide pretty quickly
might be useful to discuss on a call first thing tomorrow am
we'll want to assure that our message is tracks consistently with message j
skilling will be delivering this week and with other messages we'llbe delivering
e.g
ferc inquiry
also
attached are some messages that jim distributed following a focus group conducted in orange county
greetings
as part of our final tariff filing
we need to submit
sample
forms for things like a disconnect notice
sample bill and new service orders
do we have any
have we had to file any elsewhere
if not
do we want bowen
co
to
create
some for us to review
or do we prefer to find the right folks internal to ebs and create them internally
make sense to arrange a 0-0 minute call to discuss how to execute
all opinions

ain't seen the joint resolution
thought my in-box is a mess
did you send that around
could you please see if you can get a copy
electronic
preferably of this
greatly appreciated
done at 0:0
can you pick me up
i'd love it
check your voicemail
too
i left a message there
been out all day
will get a copy
i believe that jeff's suspicions are dead on
given all the investigations regarding electricity
price spikes
in california
seems very likely that edison feels the timing is right to push the gas issue
will confirm that it is targeted solely at el paso and get back to you either way
if there's anything else
just holler
will keep you apprised of events as they occur
best
jeff
i can wait a little bit
but let's coordinate
ok
glad to hear that you're back
generalissimo
we will follow you up the hill
seriously
though
you will start seeing/hearing from us quite soon
e.g
skilling's at the national press club this thursday
hi darlin
thanks again for everything last night
all kidding aside
i wish you all the best with your procedure tomorrow
i'll be sending lots of positives vibes your way all day
and i'm sure we'll be up to see you this weekend

my pleasure
sounds like he's got a big job---glad that enron can help
ok
getting you the info by the end of the week

will not be a problem
you might want to try using a landline phone
sweetie
only 0 cents
works great
did you burn the man
are we having lunch
are you famous now
i love you very much and miss you
tomorrow is absolutely horrible for me
let's talk in the am
perhaps you and mona
sue and sandi can cover sans moi
haven't had a chance to read yet
but wanted to get to folks asap
don't apologize
more interesting when your blood boils
jessie knight
the ceo of the s.d
chamber of commerce recommends
stay at the hotel right here where the chamber is located
it is one of the best and a 0 minute taxi away for you
it is called the whyndham
on broadway
i'm on the phone with jim now
if you want to contact him
i'd wait 0-0 minutes and give him a call on his cell phone
floated idea
people like
but
hate to sound like a broken record
the whole ball of wax from enron's view regarding sponsorship
streaming
etc
will depend on the agenda/participants
looking forward to the call
i'll only have 0 minutes max
however
so counting on you to facilitate forcefully
lara
i have rather hastily put this list together
for that i apologize
hope it is helpful
the things on the list are ones that you've likely already considered
nevertheless
some of the issues we face in california include
0
power plants the utilities
subs are building power plants
competitors
like enron
are also trying to develop plants to sell power into both wholesale and retail markets
the utilities control the interconnection of plants to the grid
the interconnection rules are currently so vague and ambiguous
that the utility could quite easily favor its generation sub over competitors
this would have an effect on prices at both the wholesale and retail level
i.e
how do we know we've gotten the best generation deal if the utility can favor its subs plants via interconnection
0
distributed generation and the same goes for dg
in california many are pointing to dg as a viable solution to the price spikes
if the utility loses sales because a customer has installed dg on her premises as a hedge against price spikes
the utility will have an incentive to thwart interconnection of the dg unit
recall that in many places
recovery of distribution costs is derived from kwh sales
and if sales go down
so can recovery of the utilities
distribution-related costs
in addition
if someone attempts to install dg at the grid level
as opposed to on-site dg
and sell the dg power in wholesale and retail markets
the utility has the ability to frustrate the dg project via interconnection
this permits the utility to retain bundled service customers
utility control of dg interconnection can also permit the utility to favor its dg subs
and the same goes for the retail level---remember how sdg&e used interconnection to thwart our deal with south west marine in san diego
obviously
we're not doing these deals any more
but the interconnection caused us ultimately to lose the commodity deal
too
0
trading pg&e and sempra have developed significant trading units
now that the utilities have been granted authority to buy outside the px
the trading subs are getting more aggressive and vocal about the opportunity to sell the utility power via short and long term power contracts
again
any sort of favoritism could do considerable harm to consumers and competition
through the shareholders of the utilities
parent would surely profit
0
distribution in general
the utilities control over distribution is complete and it's a problem
see dg
above
for example
shouldn't state and federal policy makers at least consider doing the equivalent of ferc order 0
i.e
open access
at the distribution level
right now
distribution is a real black box
0
retail in california
the utility effectively controls customer sign-up
switching
information
and turn back
the problems have been significant
0
market institutions finally
a big mistake in california was to replace one monopoly--the because the utility has been forced to buy from the px
and because the market structure in california gives customers no incentive to switch
the utility continues to control the overwhelming majority of the load in california
this gives the utilities monopsony power
with that power
they can influence px prices
solution
0
don't make the px a monopoly
0
create a system that provides customers with the incentive to switch
if you have any questions
or if there's anything else i can do to help

sue mara called from the iso
the market issues committee rejected lowering the price cap from $0
the market issues committe of the board voted to extend the iso price cap authority beyond october 0th
with no end date
iso board will vote on these issues tomorrow
0% chance that the iso board will adopt the issues committe's recommendations
pleasure's all mine
anything else i can do
just holler
ebs update congressional and ferc hearings in s.d
next week gas update
as you know
i have great interest
however
i've checked flight schedules to come out tuesday night
and to put it mildly
it's very ugly
seems like alot to arrive in d.c
around 0 am only to turn around and head back to the left coast the next day at 0-0 pm
but i think the meeting should go ahead and take place anyway
is there any chance that lisa could get a phone in your meeting room so that i could participate by conference call
sorry for the headache
let me know
thanks again for the chat this pm
best
jeff
great food for thought
thanks
my only concern is timing
likely to be spending the balance of the week
tomorrow and friday
on prep for the ferc/house subcomittee hearings
we can discuss further on the staff meeting call tomorrow
fyi
under the settlement with socal
pg&e and countless others
altra was going to provide the platform for the
unregulated
secondary markets in intrastate storage
capacity and imbalance trading rights
altra declined and socal and pg&e will now look for someone else to provide the service
dear ms leisure

thanks
sue
agreed
also
i met today with bowen
co
re
interconnection
we have some decisions to make on that front
too
which will also require a bit of discussion
tracy
i'm sure that scott's in istanbul and donald's in marrakesh
could you try to track those two broadband cowboys down and see if we can set up a conference call for next wedneday
hopefully
that's ample lead time
finally
the draft final tariff
in strike-out-underline form
will be ready for review by cob friday
i'll email it around
hope all is well with all

paul and lysa
i want to apologize in advance
it now seems that ferc has realized that it has a biz meeting in d.c

which makes having a meeting in san diego on the 0th somewhat difficult
so
if ferc changes the date
again
and pushes the meeting back
i'll go to s.d
on the 0th to see steve kean testify and fly to d.c
on the evening of the 0th or morning of the 0th and attend paul's meeting in person
if they don't change the date and it stays on the 0th
i won't go to d.c
and will participate in paul's meeting on the 0th in d.c
by phone
i'll let you know what ferc decides
when it decides it
exasperatedly yours

looks good
i vote yes
would seem useful if we all contribute in some manner
but i'm open to suggestions
perhaps we could divvy up the questions

ariba hits some speed bumps on the fast-growth highway by joe bousquin staff reporter 0/0/0 0:0 pm et url
san francisco
in a sign that the business-to-business software game is tough even when you're on top
ariba
arba:nasdaq
has been running into problems this summer
both at home and abroad
ariba told analysts and investors at a private breakout session here tuesday at the robertson stephens internet conference that its business in europe this summer has been
soft
according to eric upin
an analyst at the firm
and at home
analysts are starting to talk about problems the company has had integrating its tradex software into its own and customers
systems
an ariba spokeswoman didn't immediately return a call seeking a comment
the challenges ariba is facing illustrate how difficult it can be to stay ahead of the game in an emerging industry
even for one of its most aggressive leaders
and they come at a time when its main competitor
commerce one
cmrc:nasdaq
is gaining momentum in key markets
including europe
through its partnership with german software maker sap
sap:nyse adr
upin
who rates ariba a buy and lists the company as one of his top b0b picks
says the new concerns have to be taken in context
his firm hasn't performed underwriting for the company
ariba's just getting ramped up in europe
and europe's slow during the summer
it's a tiny part of their business
upin said
but there was concern because ariba was saying that business was soft
in europe
in august
that concern has been reflected in ariba's stock
which is trading just under $0
off from its sept
0 close of $0.0
it fell 0.0% wednesday after the breakout session
though it's up about 0% thursday
with the stock trading at more than 0 times next year's projected sales
it's priced to perfection
ariba's softness in europe comes at a time when commerce one has been making strides there
its partnership with sap has resulted in six new customers so far
commerce one also announced a joint marketing and sales alliance with intershop
another german software maker
on thursday
at home
ariba has been encountering problems in integrating its tradex software
which enables users to participate in auctions over the internet
into its customers
systems
as well as into its own software platform
ian toll
an analyst at credit suisse first boston
says those problems shouldn't be viewed as too much of an impediment for ariba
but they do illustrate the complexities of building software that is designed to do everything from manage back-office accounting systems to trade real-time with outside partners
implementation has certainly been a concern with tradex
toll said
certain tradex customers have highlighted what appear to be longer time lines than they had hoped for
but i think that's true across competing vendors as well
toll rates ariba a buy
and his firm hasn't done underwriting for the company
while ariba issued a news release thursday crowing about how drugstore operator cvs
cvs:nyse
recently went live on its ariba buyer software in just 0 days
observers say that getting tradex installed and working is taking closer to six months
in the hard-charging world of b0b
that's an eternity
ariba completed its acquisition of tradex in march
ariba has hailed the acquisition as one that gives it best-of-breed auction capability
which it would integrate into its own suite of software products
but competitors
most notably oracle
orcl:nasdaq
pooh-poohed the deal
saying that stringing together complex technologies through acquisitions is easier said than done
and in its most recent quarterly results release
when it reported record revenue of $0.0 million that was backed up by $0 million in deferred revenue
the company cautioned that integration of tradex could be a stumbling point
in the release's boilerplate section that noted that actual results could differ from projections
ariba said those differences could result from
among other things
difficulties in assimilating companies recently acquired
including tradex
despite the problems
though
analysts are still positive on the company
ariba could be the next oracle
robbie stephens
upin said
and there were quarters when oracle promised and didn't deliver or it missed altogether
but even for an ariba
there will be those bumps along the road
but as competition increases in the b0b sector
those bumps are getting more pronounced
looks like i won't be going to washington
but i will participate in the strategy meeting by phone on the 0th
folks
my apologies in advance if i vent somewhat
briefly
some of you know that i attended berkeley's policy school
i have been very closely involved with the conference severin describes in his note to littlechild
i have been working to try to establish a joint venture between the policy and business schools at berkeley to hold an
energy summit
where national and international energy leaders would converge on california
under the auspices of uc berkeley
to talk energy policy
jim steffes has helped a lot in brainstorming the idea
in short
our goal was to have a group of prominent folks squarely refute the extremely retrograde notions of
turn the clock back
that the governor of california's two most recent appointees have been articulating at every opportunity over the past several months
and re-seize the agenda in california
the
energy heads of state
at the summit would come up with solutions for going forward
the concept
and invitees
that severin describes is loosely based on proposals i have made to the
steering committee
however
for reasons i won't bore you with in this note
the effort has frankly turned into a fiasco
i notified the group this week that enron would not be participating
that they should go forward with the conference without us
and that i would help somewhat
contacts
etc
when
and if
they ever came to agreement on the agenda and particpants
from my perspective
the effort turned out to be a rather big disappointment
i urge us not to get involved or contribute $$s
at this juncture i would recommend against having ken lay participate
depending on how the thing shapes up
we may or may not want to have someone at a substantially lower level participate
but i'm pessimistic at this point
if anyone would like to discuss my reasons in more detail
i'd be happy to discuss
i still think the idea of an energy summit is very promising
but the forum that these folks are creating ain't the right one

we should decide how we want to handle
one thing i'm not clear on and that i couldn't find in the syllabus is
what's the format for the write up
if we're called on to discuss
do we simply discuss orally
some sort of simplistic pp slides
spreadsheets
other
anyway to discuss between now and monday
or do we want to just take dylan up on his offer

or if you'd like to discuss
don't hesitate

greetings
kim's stuff looks pretty good to me
there's a pretty high likelihood though that i won't be in class monday or tuesday either
that means i can't turn in whatever it is we're turning in tomorrow
if i sound clueless
it might be because he ran out of handouts in the first class describing how the cases would work
and there's nothing posted on the site--apologies
i can do the write-up for next week
thanks
dylan
in the event i can't make to either class
i'm available wed and thur evening to discuss the next case
and as i mentioned
i'd be happy to write that one up
best
jeff
thanks very much
now i just need to get the workspace view i had before you had to re-install notes
best
jeff
i think the answer to #0 is
as much as possible
but i'm not altogether certain--pretty sure that our preference would be to use our own internal construction folks as much as possible
answer to #0 would be very interesting
i don't know the answer
but i'm sure that it's tightly linked to the answer to #0
i think you might want to start with shelly corman to find the right contact for the pipeline constructions
i leave for s.d
tonite
i'll give you updates as the day transpires tomorrow

jeff
didn't receive your attachements
only got the ones kim had already sent
did you just modify those
or create a new document
i'd say
what next
but i'm afraid to ask
regarding our california strategy
preventing the merger would seem to be right up there with
end the price caps
in our list of priorities
at today's ferc hearing
a hair-brained consumer advocate called for merging the px and the iso
during the panel i was on
i made the point that a merger would make california's problems worse than they are today
the ferc commissioners seemed somewhat responsive to my concerns
p.s
after the panel
heber lobbied me hard to support transcos

dow jones
david freeman
seen a likely replacement for marcie edwards on the board of governors of the california independent system operator
said his first order of business would be to try and merge the iso and the california power exchange
edwards resigned her post on the iso thursday
an informal consensus among the board has already approved his membership
freeman told dow jones newswires that the $0 per megawatthour wholesale power price cap in california is too high
and that he would like to see it reduced below $0/mwh
i think my role
on the board
will help the state solve it's serious generation shortage problem
freeman said
some market participants said freeman is expected to run for chair of the iso's board of governors

the los angeles department of water and power has this summer been able to sell the iso power in the real time market
and make a great profit for itself in return

we talked a little about how to proceed on the next case

everyone takes a question
if the answer to one question depends on the answer to another
the folks doing those questions should get together and discuss
everyone should distribute to the team a draft of the answer to the question by tomorrow

thanks for the update
just want to add that 0
if we're uneasy about wearing the full requirements risk
then focusing on offering a purely wholesale deal can still be very attractive
given sdg&e's blunders w.r.t
procurment wholesale power on behalf of its customers
and 0
the cpuc has been beat up pretty well for tying the ious hands in attempting to hedge
so they'll be subject to a considerable amount of pressure to pre-approve if a deal is offered that can be show to shield san diegans from volatility and that looks
attractive
appreciate being kept in the loop on the details
thanks
best
jeff
thanks
plz call when you can
thanks
jeff 0.0.0
the cpuc can do it it it wants---it's a decision about risk and reward
if the cpuc wants to set up a mechanism by which pre-approval is permitted
it can do so
here's the catch
pre-approval means that the iou has to be willing
generally
to accept a bit more risk
they don't like that
the cpuc has to be willing to relinquish a bit of control---this commission definitely doesn't like that idea
so often
the utility puts up a proposal that the commission says places to much risk with granny
the cpuc often issues a decision in response that the utility claims leaves to much control
read
second-guessing
with the commission
and therefore leaves to much risk with the utility
in the end
the utility often
declines
the commission's offer
however
it can be done
for example
under california's restructuring law
the utility's purchases from the px are just and reasonable
period
of course
we see where the incentive built into that mechanism got us--a debacle
do you have pg&e's and edison's proposals filed regarding bilaterals some weeks ago
in which they propose certain pre-approval mechanisms
the commission didn't adopt them wholesale
and the decision has made pg&e and edison reticent to sign any such as a result---witness the unfruitful rfps
this at all helpful
honey
i really want to come
but my homework is due to my group tonite and i haven't even started it
i love you tons and hope you understand
please call your mom
she was a pain on the phone today
saying there's no need to remove the stumps at the dome
jeff's willing to do all three for $0
it's just ridiculous and i am having a hard time haggling anymore
i love you tons
and if you want to talk more about dinner
please call me
i'm sorry
but there's just too darned much to do
i think my cold's getting worse
not better
thanks very much for the info
certainly makes it interesting
how's things
p.s
do you know that edison at the ferc hearing said that it hedged $0mm and made a whopping $0 mm
are they gouging san diegans
are they
gaming
the system
inquiring minds want to know
you may want to check in with smutney when edison made the statement
there may be nothing to it
but it might be interesting to check into
is edison one of those
profiteers
who ought to give san diegans a refund
0 am works for me
needs to know before your parents leave for mexico
which is tomorrow
unfortunately
i guess i'll be at my house
you want to stay there
or you want to stay at your place
either way's ok with me
fyi
in case you're interested
who are john and kittina
who are the others you've invited
what's the occasion
when's your anniversary
why is there a foie gras shortage
good points
chris
and well taken
the puc commisisoners took some heat for their heavy-handed approach at hearings held by congress on monday and ferc on tuesday
i think those hearings may have loosened things the commission up at least somewhat
though finding a balance between commission willingness to grant pre-approval and utility willingness to wear some risk in exchange won't be a cakewalk
we need to remind the commission that they gave 0 % pre-approved reasonableness for purchases from the px
and that pre-approval for other purchases is necessary
that said
i concur that it ain't a gimmee
best
jeff
not a problem
the schedule was only a suggestion
work it in when you can
and if you get totally fried
just say so
and we can take on the question
i love you
thanks for being so sweet
how long you going for
i'm jealous
thanks
the hearings were tiresome
but hanging out with you and steve was a real treat
hope to do it again soon
you probably noticed that

now i'm really jealous
let me see what i can muster up for you on tuscany
o
jealous am i
can you talk to sandi
she's on vacation beginning on monday
the idea wathat she and i should get together before she left
based on the call we hawhere rick and paul put the ball in my and sandi's court to coordinate thestrategy
she suggested that it would also be a good idea to grab whoeverwas here tomorrow
too
it's really just a prelim meeting to discuss thenote that sandi sent around and for me to bounce a few ideas off of her
we'll be having many
many more
and nothing discussed in tomorrow's
kickoff
will set anything in stone
that said
if you prefer that we wait
that's ok with me

pg&e's $0 billion power grab we've been gulled by our greedy utility ken garcia
0 san francisco chronicle url
san francisc
the executives at pacific gas and electric co
sure try hard to live up to their name
because i can't think of any company that has been more adept at giving consumers a jolt
the doyens of greed that rule over the california utility giant recently revealed that they hope to pass on to customers more than $0 billion in expenses
``unforeseen costs
in the euphemistic view of the power company
but unjustifiable rate increases to those of us residing in real world
the consumer-soaking surge is apparently based on pg&e's inability to predict a rise in wholesale electricity prices
which is costing the company about $0 million a month
yet
as usual
the utility giant wants us to forget all past promises and obligations
a favorite technique of energy merchants who see rate increases as something that can be turned on with the flick of a switch
lest anyone forget
a utility rate increase is exactly what california's customers were told they would not get as a result of a deregulated power market
which was supposed to lower
not raise
energy bills because of an expected increase in competition
it shouldn't come as a surprise that our friends at pg&e were among the prime architects of the state's deregulation policy
which they now want to bend in their financial favor
this is known as having your cake and
billing
edith too
because certainly she and her fellow customers wouldn't want the utility company's stock to fall
now
i realize pg&e has been prone to blackouts over the years
but just because it doesn't like the deal it forged and signed a few years back
doesn't mean that its customers should be forced to pay for its lapses in judgment
if you want to dance
you have to pay the fiddler
even if it turns out to be nero and the electrical lines are burning
``it should be pg&e that eats the costs because they made the initial promise that rates would go down
dan jacobson of the california public interest research group told the chronicle the other day
and he's right
even if the state public utilities commission once again buckles under and decides to give pg&e a break it doesn't deserve
while pg&e ceo robert glynn was trying to assuage analysts on wall street this week that the soaring electricity rates would indeed be passed on to customers
the chronicle revealed that the state board of equalization has quietly been granting utilities and giant corporations billions of dollars in tax breaks
despite a booming economy
the state agency has inexplicably reduced the property tax assessments of pg&e
pacific bell and others to the tune of $0.0 billion in the past year alone
that's a lot of lost kilowatts and phone calls that could be used by california residents
but in the world of utilities
it's always best to leave the consumer in the dark
in effect
the equalization board is improperly granting huge tax breaks to companies worth billions
at the same time its assessments on homes and small commercial properties are skyrocketing
and if you think something smells a little rotten here
well
it may just be the smoke rising from a lot of consumers
ears
you don't have to look far to see why officials at pg&e are feeling a little desperate in their attempts to pass along their rising costs to consumers as quickly as possible
because the faster they can do it
the faster customers might forget that pg&e had asked the puc for an $0 million rate increase earlier this year to help keep the lights in the corporate tower burning
the utility was granted a $0 million increase
even though an administrative law judge found that the company needed only half that amount to meet its expenses
but what's a few hundred million between friends
yet the funny part is
pg&e officials said that rate increase would actually lower our gas and electric bills
an event that happens on our shores about as often as a tsunami
this energy-defying trick
which i first questioned in february
would take place
we were told
because of cost savings within the utility giant's other divisions
yet if they were making more money
why did pg&e need the puc to give it close to a half billion in bill increases
well
the answer is that it would appear there are quite a few dim bulbs making decisions about california's energy market
and gov
gray davis hasn't seen fit to replace them
so don't be shocked if pg&e again gets its way
and once again customers are ``serviced
by state regulators to the tune of hundreds of millions in rate increases
no matter how unfair or undeserved
pg&e said it would foot the bill when it pushed for deregulation
and now that it's taking a huge hit for past decisions
it wants to pass the buck
it takes time to build up a reputation for power
greed
excess
energy companies
after all
are anything but utilitarian

check out the site
we're in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few months
but while the
otherwise perishable
thoughts are still fresh in my mind from the hearings on monday and tuesday
i wanted to throw out some observations for discussion in the days/weeks ahead
observation--the pressure to finger somebody for
price gouging
is increasing
the administration is hell bent on finding a
fall guy
the price spikes pose real political risks for davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out
his press release following the hearing renewed the call for
refunds
on my panel
loretta lynch asked reliant and duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers
and carl wood's remarks were extreme
at the barton hearing
a liberal democrat
filner
and a conservative republican
hunter
locked arms in calling for refunds
bilbray joined the
gouging
band wagon
the utilities repeatedly called on ferc to do a
real
investigation
with hearings
testimony
data discovery---the works
on the positive side
the ferc commissioners lauded wolak
his analysis
and his remarks on the panel
wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of california's market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit
he also stated that just everyone's just acting in their own self-interest
responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure
implication--it seems prudent for enron to understand better its risks of getting fingered
in the best case
the clamoring for a
refund
subsides
in which case
the only cost to enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the risks of getting fingered
in the medium case
investigations find that enron
like others
played by the rules
but the rules stunk
and enron profited at the expense of california consumers
needless to say
given the governor's press release
i'm a little concerned about what he might want
carl wood and loretta lynch were truly abominable at the ferc hearing
fortunately
ferc
all 0 commissioners
really beat up on the them
i'm convinced that ferc feels that they must do something between now and november and that if we ever had a chance to get them to be bold
understanding that
bold
ain't exactly in hoecker's play book
now's the chance
thanks for the giving heber the straight dope
he was very gracious throughout
but after the panel he
very jokingly
ribbed me pretty well
saying
jeff
i let you off the hook
i was going to ask you how in the hell you ever let california turn into such a mess
i told him that we were exercising herculean restraint in not making lengthy
i told you so
statements
best
jeff
well
i was clearly too ambitious in setting out the schedule
my apologies
i managed to trudge through the reading and the document last night
but didn't not get to answering the question
i appears that this will be a busy weekend
i've a feeling that i won't get my proposed answer to folks until saturday afternoon for your review
if that poses a problem for anyone
please let me know
i still intend to be the compiler of wisdom
so folks should feel free to distribute when they've got something drafted
best
jeff
my apologies
but as you can imagine
california's little crisis has me a bit preoccupied
would love to know what comes out of the meeting
though
best
jeff
i understand that we may have no choice in the matter
but having wtinessed loretta lynch's inability to define market power when asked to do so by joe barton last monday
and
having heard carl wood declare war on capitalism at ferc's hearing on tuesday
and
knowing that the likes of harvey morse
puc ferc attorney
who has never come down on the side of
no market power here
in any analysis
is
heading up
the puc investigation
and seeing gov davis
press releases demanding refunds from the faceless
out-of-state suppliers i'm
well
maybe a little nervous about them getting their paws on our data
jeff
thanks for the offer ms kupiecki
but since you carried so much of the weight last case
i feel obliged to compile this time round
it works
in office mon
tues
wed
perhaps houston thur/fri
sorry
they're on their way
p.s
it's kean
not kane
and i like to discuss further the points you were making on the call
they were good ones
i just didn't want to get hung up on them during that conference call

hi
how's things
long time no see
yes
too busy
very disappointed that i didn't get to see everyone
hope all is well
thanks so much for the info
this is very useful
i will try to make the next meeting
hopefully the crisis out here will be over by then
how would you structure it differently next time
best
jeff enron energy services
congratulation

see you soon

greetings
looks like our questions
0&0
are linked
you around to chat for a couple of minutes
i'll likely eyeball the numbers to see what cash gives in order to answer #0
let me know
hope all's well
best
jeff
one other thing
what's your home number
here's my cut at #0
i haven't had the benefit of kim's answer
but made some assumptions and took a shot
likely to doctor it up a bit
but wanted to find out if folks are in agreement or if you think i've lost my mind
let me know
#0 is somewhat at the heart of the questions
so i want to make sure that i get your feedback
and my apologies for not having gotten you something sooner
be on the look out
there is a cold going around that really kicked my butt over the last week
best
jeff
rams = 0
last man standing
greetings
here's the case with 0,0 and 0 compiled
i took some editorial license with 0 and 0--hope i didn't butcher what you were conveying jimmie and dylan
check it out
still need to determine if folks are comfortable with my conclusion in #0
i.e
look
the biz model and the info provided in the 0k may be crap
but from a strictly technical perspective
patten's justified in using the sales as opposed to the installment method
let me know
kim's up and running on #0
best
jeff
check it out
i've taken a stab at compiling 0
0 and 0
folks comfortable with my conclusion regarding sales v
installment method
best
jeff
i'm in mendocino
number's 0.0.0 if you need to chat
best
hey
nice spreadsheet
two minor questions
0
isn't the provision for taxes on the income statement actually the taxes on the
income
they made from using the sales method
equal to 0%
rather than what they pay will actually pay the irs under the installment method
i think the notes show how instead of paying the 0.0$ based on their recognized income
they pay some itty bitty amount based on installment
if so
i think they actually get a 0% tax break on the 0 million and change that they lose using a cash basis
still a loss
just not so big
anyway
i'm not sure if i'm thinking straight on this
but that's how i read the numbers
0
does the balance sheet have to change a little
for example
does shareholder equity change since the income that goes to retained earnings is now a loss
rather than a gain
also
if revenue is recognized on a cash basis and is now much smaller
there needs to be another liability to equal out the decrease in revenues with the still large notes receivables on the asset side
as you note in the answer the notes recievables stays the same
seems like they might need a liability like
deferred profits
or some such thing
such that the
deferred profits
+ revenues
recognized on cash basis
= notes receivables
anyway
i may not have this right
but thought i'd bring it up to see what you think
best
jeff
no
i don't think i'd make a better accountant
but i did ask a few questions of my accountant brother-in-law
you did a great job
i don't know how much time i'll have
but i'll see if i can throw in a bit of text and raise the issues
see you tonite
hi
hope you had a nice weekend
sorry i missed you all in washington
rick's asked me to attend the meeting at the woodlands tomorrow
do we have a list of attendants/agenda
no big deal
but would help me in preparing for the meeting
i'm assuming that the meeting takes place tomorrow only
i'm staying through wednesday
nonetheless
and have booked a room at the lancaster
but if the meeting's going to continue through wed
i was wondering if i should be staying at the woodlands
thanks
as always
for you help
signed
clueless
my understanding is that pg&e is in active talks to cut a deal with legislators and the governor
but i have no details
mona
does it make sense to have s
govenor poke around is sacramento to see what he can find out
immensely helpful
thanks so much
that's all i'll need
fyi
my plane lands at 0:0 and i'll be going directly to the woodlands
oh
one thing
if you could get info to joseph on where the woodlands is and where i need to go once i arrive there
i'd be eternally indebted
best
jeff
rick called and asked me to sit in on a meeting on enegy issues that he's having tomorrow in houston
wants me to bring to the table information on gas issues
particularly in light of the socalgas settlement here in california
i'll be leaving at the crack of dawn tomorrow monring and will be in houston on tuesday/wednesday and back in the office on thursday
agreed 0%--call me an engineer
our signature should not be on the letter
i'll check and see
i didn't hear back from anyone but you
will do
sandi's on vacation this week
there are rumors that pg&e's actively seeking a negotiated solution with legislators and the governor
but i can't verify and don't have details on what the negotiated agreement might look like
while's sandi's away
have asked mona to check in with our sacramento lobbyists to poke around for information
will report back soon as we get more info
thank you very much

oops
i forgot to plug your phone back in after i used my computer this morning
sorry
could you call me when you get a chance
some ees folks just popped into my office and asked me to pop into their meeting
which starts at noon
i'm not sure precisely what the meeting's about
but mona i noticed you've got it on your weekly schedule
how do you want to handle
i'd be happy to pop in at noon for the meet and greet part
but likely need to leave in order to work on the draft strategy---paul wants me to distribute whatever i've got done by cob today
which i think is a good idea
hey
groom-to-be
what happened
so sorry i missed you
the buzz about b
cherry going to pg&e is starting to get louder
hope all's well

greetings
couple of things
0
from the notes flying around
it looks like the
word-smithing
of the letter to the governor continues
we think you folks are doing exactly the right thing in sending a letter
we intend to play an energetic and constructive role in the months ahead to help california come up with solutions that make competition work for everyone
but for a variety of reasons i won't bore you with in this email
we're going to decline signing the letter
if you'd like to discuss
feel free to give me a call at 0
when's the next meeting
and when's the
annual retreat
all the best
jeff
ok
the powers that be have phoned
i am to be there tomorrow and wed
tomorrow i'm huddle at the woodlands all day
but wednesday i'll be in the office
perhaps coffee or lunch
could you forward to the lovely ms scott
since every time i type her name in
i get someone from ect
can't wait to hear more about herr cherr-y
best
jeff
i don't know if they have the authority
and i could be wrong
but this looks like an obvious set up by the administration
hold up a report from your auditor that sez
it makes now sense to have the two separate
poolco is the only way to go
and they must be merged
then legislation is launched
on the basis of the auditor's recommendation
to merge the px and the iso in california
looks like an audit whose message we'll want to pre-empt well in advance of the report going public
it's rough
but paul and i concluded that
since i'll be in houston
best that i send out whatever i have by cob today
i will be working on this more on the plane on my way to houston
now we have sandi's
paul's and this
all of which i think are headed in the same direction and complement one another
we'll need to meld them
please look at all 0 at the same time
might be useful to begin an email conversation now with folks comments
i'm reachable and will be back in the office on thursday

please do this asap as customer is scheduled to leave at 0pm today
you never need to ask
you can always use me as a reference
what's it for
be happy to discuss
my preference would be to have a brief call to discuss
since mr
filner is on a mission to tan a few hides over the price spikes in s.d
at congressional and ferc hearings in s.d
last week
mr
filner called generators and marketers quite a few ugly names
fingered them as the cause for the high prices
and demanded that congress and ferc make them give all the money back to s.d
consumers
fairly sensitive item
to put it mildly
i'm at 0.0.0

sounds like a great opportunity
hi dana
please accept my apologies for not having responded sooner
things
as you know
are
well
a little nuts
it was great to meet you and i would be happy to discuss opportunities
i need to be in s.d

perhaps we could have lunch
or something
and you could fill me in on what you folks do
best

looks like it's that time again
there only 0 questions

too hot a market
how energy producers manipulate california
published sept
0
0
the priciest place to shop this august in california was in pasadena
there at the california power exchange
where much of the state's electricity is bought and sold
prices that utilities paid for power
an average $0 per megawatt
were up fivefold from the previous august
$0
what is happening
among other things
too much power on hot days is being purchased in the near-panic environment that develops in the hours before a possible crisis
too little is being purchased as it should be
days
or even months
in advance
how was this new market-based system of buying electricity supposed to work
much of the action was supposed to take place at the power exchange
there vibrant trading was supposed to exist in a variety of markets
some utilities would be busy shopping for electricity the next day
others
depending on their needs
would be squirreling away supply a month
even a year
in advance
selling this power are private companies that have been busy purchasing fossil-fuel burning generators from the state's investor-owned utilities
under the state's restructuring of electricity
these utilities were obligated to sell their fossil-fuel burning plants
but not necessarily their nuclear or hydroelectric generators
on any given day
up to 0 percent of the power needed to fuel california was supposed to be already purchased
the idea was to leave just a little bit for the last minute
headquartered in folsom
the state's entire grid is managed by an agency known as the independent system operator
the iso's job is to buy whatever extra power is necessary to keep the lights on
with literally only hours to work with
the iso is ill-suited to drive hard bargains
the iso pays up to $0 per megawatt
the problem is that the iso's spot market is way too big
and too pricey
it is buying up to 0 percent of california's power on some days
particularly hot ones
this august
less power is being purchased in those struggling futures market down in pasadena
more was being bought in folsom
this is a telltale sign that california's electricity market is working for those who own power plants
not those who pay the bills that are poised to rise
thank you
fyi
seems that the problem was that the last letter in my izio login
that comes up automatically when pulling up the page
was being truncated

thank you very much for the tech data
margaret
is there data out there regarding the california utilities performance
i.e
how many rolling blackouts

odd coincidence
might be a good place to do some messaging
let's try this
neither of us will say one critical thing of the other
i won't say anything
in jest
or otherwise
and you do the same
and if someone does
the other needs to bring it up
but prentice
if i say
that's critical
and then i have to have a long argument about the fact that i think it is
and you think it isn't
that isn't going to work
so i'm willing to have a complete moratorium
if that's something that you're willing to try
too
i hope you'll going sailing today
did i leave my sunglasses in your car
i also left my gym bag in your bathroom
which has my sailing shoes in it
i'm at work
you can call me here
kim
been having horrible computer problems
just got switched over to windows 0---i hate microsoft
break it up into a million itty bitty pieces
haven't had a chance to read what you wrote

you should feel free to go ahead and meld mine and yours

i'm ready to go postal with all the computer problems i'm having
did you get the document i sent yesterday morning

talked to jeff green
he said he'd do the road
but can't do it with the wood that's in the driveway
eldon
are you and bob planning to go up this week
if so
any chance of getting the wood moved
otherwise
going to be tough to do the road
jeff starts on my road on wednesday and i'll be going up this weekend to monitor

welcome back
hope you had a good time in mexico

i'm in the sf office all week
hey buddy
hope your weekend was nice
tried to call
but i think your voicemail is messed up out there today
checking in to see whether hoecker said it or not
any word
also
looks like we're on for portland next tuesday/wednesday
would definitely like to gather
phone call or something
prior to the meeting so we
me
you

are clear on what our goals are for the meeting and what the agenda needs to look like
finally
i should have a draft of my

ready by tomorrow sometime
that was our deadline
correct
any other follow-info from last tuesday'wednesday's meeting that i should be aware of
finally
you see harry's note
can you make a call to discuss the pg&e strategy on wednesday
best
jeff
appears that pg&e has joined the
refund
chorus
i'd wait until
for example
ginger and maureen say they're happy and all the bugs have been worked out--my productivity has dropped by about 0%
i'll do some minor strike-out-underline and some minor suggestions and send back by 0 pm california time

caps
stink
but if they must be done in the short term
only do them for residential
since of course the damage that wholesale prices will inflict will grossly outweigh and alleged benefits

can we get pictures
i'm assuming
since i haven't heard back
that we're going to take a pass this time on the dome road
and perhaps have jeff green do it another time
if i'm incorrect
we'll need to get things squared away
like today
let me know
jeff
i was forced to allow my business judgment pre-empt my personal wishes
can you get in touch w/eldon
i've been unsuccessful the last two days
may be too late at this point
i was supposed to get in touch with jeff beginning of the week so that he could order gravel
and haven't even talked to him about the culvert
if he does the culvert
eldon's going to have to make sure that the other people on the road don't have a fit about eldon
re-designing
the road right around the dome
which fixing the culvert will entail
fyi
if you'd like to discuss
don't hesitate
can't wait for the bullets to start to fly
do we know what the total $ amount is to ees
if they were to book the entire credit to enron

we concluded that it would be a good idea to take the proposal that you put together based on your meeting with ees and use it as the
base case
to start running the numbers
idea being that before we shop anything around
we need to know what the numbers look like to determine whether the thing's got any legs
once we have a clear understanding of how the base case numbers shake out
we thought we might then want do some sensitivity analyses around the variables
come up with a final proposal
and then go back to the commercial groups for buy-in
we hoped that your folks could get together with roger yang et al and provide some assessment of what the base case numbers look like by middle of next week
how's this plan sound
few other points
we assume that bullet 0's reference to
net
means that the deferral is calculated by taking any
overcollections
and subtracting them from any
undercollections
over the entire 0 year period,not year-by-year
what is the significance of the 0.0 ctc roll-off date
we're assuming it's commercially driven
we correct
if so
what's the driver
same goes for the 0 ending date
some tweeks were made to the proposal at the meeting to create an
option 0
for folks to consider
though we don't think that any numbers need to be run on
option 0
until after having completed the analysis on option 0
since those results could influence any scenarios we decide to construct
option 0 would
keep the hydro with the utility and apply edison's proposed ratemaking treatment
beginning 0.0.0
make large customers
noncore
similar to the gas model in california
and force those customers to choose an esp
beginning 0.0.0
introduce competitive default service for remaining
core
i.e
rez and small commercial
customers
finally
couple of things that occurred to me after yesterday's meeting that i want to throw out for folks to react to
seems that
to be successful
the proposal needs to remain as stripped down and simple as possible
when the proposal nets out the deferral costs
does it include the over/undercollections associated with utility residual generation
in option 0
by adding the
noncore
feature
and by implementing that feature and the default service feature prior to the 0 ending date
the proposal gets more complicated
and adds significantly more risk to the utility's position
this is not to say that the complications can't be worked out
or that the added risk can't be accounted for
but wanted to highlight it for folks to consider
attached is the original
with just a couple of minor edits
and
option 0
best
jeff
see what we can do
when you getting back
my apologies
i'm confused
0
when are we scheduled to meet with tim
just tuesday afternoon
or tues/wed
thanks
jeff
what time do you get home from school
if it's before 0 could you stop by the theater on the square box office and get tickets
cameron said that she and scott want tickets
too
it's going to sell out
if it ain't already sold out
so we should probably do it quickly
i love you
champagne
p.s
though it feels like it at times
he's not my dad
greetings professor
apologies for asking
but something has come up and i wanted to inquire about the chances of taking the e0 final on a day other than sunday the 0th of december
preferably tu
w
th
the week of the 0th
best
jeff
thanks
best of luck
don't hesitate to call if there's anything you need
look forward to getting down to s.d
soon
maybe we can talk jessie into having a drink
best
jeff
hey there stranger
by the looks of your attire
very nice
and the pace of you walk the other night
looks like you're back in the working groove
hope work is fun and your classes are good
i'm trying to get used to the
no life
thing again
and you slacked on the happy hour
best
jeff
christine
my apologies
my schedule melted down after we talked on monday
here's where folks came out
there's some concern about size
we're supposed to be no larger than 0
but we lobbied aceves and he apparently ok'd our
oversized
group
the other folks in the group--who talked to him originally--are pretty sure that five will violate the rules
folks wondered if there were other groups that are smaller than ours that you could hook up with
sorry about that---it's a wrinkle that i didn't think about when we spoke
if it gets real ugly trying to find a smaller group
let me know
fortunately there's not another team case due for two weeks
best
jeff
appreciate the speedy response
actually
it's a
personal
event opposed to a business reason
and though important
i don't think it clears your hurdle
no problem
never hurts to inquire
and i appreciate the consideration
best
jeff
jonathan berk
please respond to berk
fyi
the weekend of the 0th/0th is definitely out for me
i'm sorry
honey
you know
i'd have to be in a store and have the opportunity to look at a bunch of styles in order to choose a pair
hi
did you hear from sue mara re
how the california iso works
gang
i'm finalizing what we talked about yesterday and something struck me w.r.t
siting reform
one of our key messages in california and nationally is that price spikes are due in no small part to outmoded
arcane siting rules and a shortage of power as a result
price spikes have led to wholesale and retail price caps
investigations
utility under-recovery
and threats of rolling back de-regulation
to name a few
understanding that dave raises some good points about why he's not thrilled about getting involved in more siting reform bills
could someone argue that from a corporate objective
getting a good siting reform bill passed this session is a fairly high priority
i'm not sure what the answer is
but it struck me as i was pretty-ing up the document and i thought i'd put it out there for reaction
best
jeff
any of those days work except the 0nd
thanks
please continue to include me on all the ferc related ditties
mary agree that we don't need to file separately
i think this captures it
i've also attached the
posture
document sue wrote up
while paul takes a first crack at the cover memo
please review both documents and see if there are any changes that either needs
best
jeff
see my note and christine's response
thoughts
suggestions
jimmie
apparently she's had a crush on you ever since she heard you say
cash-sucking machine
thanks for the note
i'm going to pass it along to the others
will get back to you very soon
remember that there's no team case due on monday because class is cancelled and everything got pushed back
but the first individual case has to be done by tuesday
best
jeff
hi scott
thanks for the note
hope things are well
i'd like to call the el paso person if that works for you
yep
moratorium's still in place
at least to build your own---you can always get someone who previously received authority to do it for you
i'll keep you posted
best
jeff
ok
i'm a mindless idiot
and an embarrassed one at that
to which offer are you referring
also
learned that pg&e's big
want
in the son of gas accord is a few hundred million to build more tx and local tx
sounds like this could have an immense negative impact on tw
you better get your fanny out here
like pronto
i sense death and destruction
thank you
the offer's still good
this mean we'll be toning down our criticism of the utility's behavior in the california market in our filings at ferc regarding the price spike investigation
thanks
lee
is there a firmed-up agenda yet
if so
could you forward to me
hi anita
thanks again for you help with the questions i had about the deals going on california
i'd like to follow-up with you and steve
particularly regarding the
not a telecom
aspect of the deal
these deals are going to accelerate--very confidentially
they are directly linked to getting the universe connected to enron on-line
our very successful b0b website
i'd like to discuss with you two as soon as possible
could you let me know when a convenient time is
thanks a million
best
jeff
greetings
just checking in to see how mitch and carl are doing on the proposal
unless someone has concerns
i'd like to share the results of our wednesday meeting w/roger
decided i ought to ask around first
speaking of cheese
i spoke with jeff green last night
and under the circumstances
he'd prefer to do the dome road next summer
when he's up doing more work on my property
i agreed
there's a lot more bark from all the wood chopping and that'll get us through till june
i talked to him about the culvert
he had some thoughts
which i'll pass along and i'll talk to him about it some more this weekend
here it is
thanks a million for your help
roger
we're still ruminating on this within government affairs and will continue to ruminate over the next few days
but wanted to fill you in on where we currently are and get your comments
thanks
jeff
thank you
please loop me in on the call w/tim
thanks
yes
they will have to file with the puc
this works for my schedule
i will likely attend the subpoena meeting
the world is mighty small
as an undergrad at berkeley
i worked as a paralegal at brobeck
one of the
associates
i reported to was
you guessed it
gary fergus
haven't seen him since
will be interested to compare notes
hi
o lord
you know
the pace at school is so much nicer--actually have time to think about things and absorb it
but work has gotten so insane that i sympathize with your plight
since mine's the same
i think i've maybe made it to 0/0--that's 0/0--of the finance classes
north of sacramento
are you driving to sacramento every day
say it ain't so
that's brutal
when you say full time
you mean school full time
that
i assume
means leaving your job
be happy to talk about it
you know me---believer in always keeping all options open and active
if full time makes sense
you ought to do it
unfortunately
though
it looks like i'll be missing class
again
on tuesday because i have to be in portland
if you're not going to sac on monday
coffee in sf during work hours works
or i could meet you during break on monday
or we could have lunch or a beer after work on thursday or friday when i'm back from portland
hang in there
i was worried about you--seemed liked you'd gone underground again
remember
life's too short to get too worried about it
let me know what works for you
best
jeff ps i'm spending my saturday nite working on a financial reporting case
hope that's modest consolation
strategizing
i don't think so
thanks
that certainly puts things in perspective
ditto
i vote that we suggest to christine that 0's too darned unwieldy and that she look for another
smaller group
and if she's unable to find one then we can talk
simon did a nice job on the presentation
but i need some things re-arranged
added
etc
should i call him directly
other
let me know
thanks a million
best
jeff
plz call
any numbers yet
skilling talking to gov today
0.0.0
wow
don't worry about it
have a great time in montana
it will be gorgeous up there
you're camped out in roseville
you don't deserve that
courtney
good idea to find out when the deadlines are
when you get back
give a call and we can meet at break or have lunch or a beer after work or something
considering your options and keeping them open is a great idea and the right thing to do
don't stress too much
good luck and can't wait to hear about big sky
best
jeff
monday--in office thursday--in office friday--vacation day possibly
will do
thanks
here's the edited version
word document format
if you have any questions
just give me a ring at 0.0.0
thanks very much for your help
best
jeff
ok
cut the shakespeare
what's your vote
she wrote again in inquiring
hi christine
yes
forwarded the email you sent last week
here's where folks came out
first
we think that the folks in your first group are mean
second
it's a real challenge managing a group of four and there's concern that five will break the camel's back
suggestion came up that it might be much more mangageable if you could try to link up with a smaller group first
if there's a problem finding a smaller group
then we could try to do five and hope the ship don't sink
sound reasonable
best
jeff
that clears it up
thanks very much for the prompt response
i have to go to portland tomorrow
coming back wednesday afternoon
i'd like to see you tonite before i leave if you're available
thanks
i should be there about 0
you know that i love you very much
prentice
ok gang
she's hell bent
and i've spent about as much time as i'm willing on this
sorry about the hassle---jimmie
if you hadn't used that colorful language
we wouldn't be in this mess
anyway
unless i hear strong protests in the next 0 minutes
i'm writing back to say she can join
and has to do the next case all by her lonesome on the team's behalf as payback
lemme know
best
jeff
have messages in to him
what do you think
me or you get to have all the funny with johnnie
steve
fyi
got bounced back the first time

well
if you're going to want someone from enron

let me know how it goes
best
jeff p.s
and i mean this in all seriousness
many months ago
you were sitting in our small conference room and said
the governor needs to take control and initiate a negotiation
or summit
looks like he finally figured it out
the original proposed messages i distributed for the high tech sector have been put into a power point presentation and include comments received
many thanks to margaret carson
who did much of the heavy lifting
additional comments are welcome and suggestions on how to spice up the korny title slide are greatly appreciated
best
jeff
got bounced back the first time
this got bounced back
too
we're on at 0:0 am california time
i'll call you early in the am to confirm
coordinate
ruminate
etc
best
jeff
christine
sorry i haven't replied sooner
crazy day
consider yourself the 0th member of our team---but remember
no warranties included
best
jeff
there you go again
always demanding substance
i'll fill you in tomorrow on why it's so high level
and repetitive
believe it or not
larry ellison
ceo oracle
and scott mcnealy
ceo sun
is the audience--neither's real up to speed on the industry
ps how's the cover memo for the strategy coming
best
jeff
the meeting between skilling
the governor went well
he's intrigued about the notion of doing an auction for power over the internet
governor and his folks are going to do some internal work this week and there's going to be another call next monday
will fill you in as things progress
thanks again for the pricing sheet
please keep all of this highly confidential
best
jeff
as my mother likes to say
you should be on the stage
the one that left an hour ago
i was worried about this
sent it monday night
kept getting bounced back
could you page me at 0.0.0 and let me know that you get it
i'm in portland
also
got ginger's message re
paragraph on tw deal
steffes said you didnt
need right away because ebr got cancelled
when do you need and do you want just background
or valuation calculations
too
thanks
best
jeff
will do
i like the idea
particularly in view of the
california crisis
makes our positions that much more compelling and offers at least part of the
solution
for california
attached are the high tech slides with the correct figure for dollars that the high tech sector spent on electricity in 0
i'm sure that you'll have a great time arguing our case before the court
if there's anything i can do to help
just let me know
p.s
how's things
our meetings will be much more effective you attend
we should try to talk tomorrow or friday
good questions for which i don't currently have answers
if it's truly the real thing
i'll take two cases
thanks for asking
thanks
sarah
question
could we
and should we
attempt to pre-empt the ferc report and try to get press coverage of the bp paper before ferc releases the results of its investigation
real meaning real acacia
don't care about labeling
what would you compare to in quality
seems to me that one can't beat $0/bottle for acacia
non
what cheese
man
you saw a great game
i was portland for the past couple days
saw some of the game yesterday at the airport
plane was delayed
go giants
tim
i've worked hard with these guys to try to make this conference the best that it could be
but it ain't quite there
so i'd rather keep our powder dry and use skilling at another time
not top-shelf enough in my view
if you want to discuss further let me know
also
one question
is the beep stack the constrained supply curve post-adjustment bids
i have that right
if you have any questions
don't hesitate
hey
no problem
i'll call badeer
steve
let me know if you'd like to discuss
i like tim's idea re
maybe you should take the slot
but in my view definitely not skilling
i think you saw my thoughts about this conference in a previous email exchange with schroeder re
littlechild
also
they're breaking my arms and legs about sponsoring
$0-0k range
i had a thought that maybe ebs could stream the conference as an in-kind contribution---the pr that ebs gets out of streaming might outweigh the cost of providing gratis
i had only raised it as a thought
though
and am surprised to see it turn up in print
tim and i had both had lee as a professor and i've been talking him about this conference alot and have no problem delivering whatever the news is
in fact
i had already told them that they shouldn't count on us for this one but that we're always interested in working together
best
jeff
between you and me
i don't think california is an option at this point
mr
demille would like to know if you're ready for your close-up
couple of thoughts
in light of all the events that have transpired yesterday and today
seems that the ious have decided to up the ante considerably
likely in response to a pounding they're taking from wall street
this will likely increase the pressure for davis to act sooner rather than later
at least w.r.t
finding a way out of the iou undercollection problem
the increased pressure to act in turn increases the likelihood that a bad solution will emerge
regarding the call on monday with davis
the added heat being applied might argue for coming up with a simple
concrete proposal that we can hand to davis and that he can implement immediately to get the ious off his back and avoid having the adminstration cook up something less preferable
i doubt that anyone in accounting has it
and i'm not sure to whom in accounting to send it
suggestions
i think that bowen
co
could likely help us out on this first filing
also
sue
regarding ny
i have a call into bowen but when i called they sounded pretty tied up
haven't heard back yet
fyi
rebecca got back in touch wanting to talk about the history of dereg in california
been trading messages
when she gets back to me with what she wants to discuss
i'll check back in before having the conversation
question
what about giving her a copy of our high tech slides with the intent of getting her to do a story on it
she might be a good
carrier
thoughts
one story has already hit the sj mercury news
best
jeff
here's the next version of the slides
few points
there are a few holes
pre-quals and process in particular
my brain began to fail
but i think there's enough of a structure so that we can easily finalize by tomorrow
i didn't have an electronic version of whaley's slides
so i couldn't integrate them
but i don't think it will take much to do the integration
some of whaley's slides have a strong marketing slant--we should think hard about whether we include them lest we lose our mantle of objectivity
we still have some wordsmithing to do re
participate
run the auction
or participate and run the auction
best
jeff
thanks
i love you
too
seriously
appreciate the feedback
i was working from a great first cut
no classes
just lots of studying
agree completely
notion i had was that we give rebecca the slides
tell her the story on background
then she trots off to interview mcneally
ellison
etc
just a thought
might be easier
faster channel that achieves the quick action/message we're looking for
anyone out there know why ferc has asked the px for still more data
richard
looks good
one comment
under the section
generating documents
requests 0
0 and 0
i would go with the
option 0
ending to the paragraph starting with
for portland general
and not the
alternate ending
to further support this ending
and further bolster the point that pge is pretty extraneous to the investigation
we may want to note that pge currently has a request in to the opuc asking for about $0 mm to cover the costs of increased wholesale purchases
paul kaufman would have details of the request
hope your son's doing well
best
jeff
i can be on the call
mitch
paul kaufman mentioned that you'd like to see the testimony that steve kean
at a congressional field hearing in san diego
and i
at a ferc field hearing in san diego
gave a few weeks ago
steve had prepared remarks
they are attached
i did not have prepared remarks
but i've attached my talking points
my talking points were not made public
however
so please keep them private
finally
i'm trying to get a transcript of the ferc hearing
if you would like a copy
please let me know
and if there's anything else that i can do
please don't hestitate to contact me
best
jeff
beep stack is the supply curve for real-time energy that the iso develops on the basis of bids and offers
the problem is that the plants the iso ultimately dispatches from the stack often conflict with the merit order developed from the bids/offers
and the iso has never been clear about the decision metrics it uses to determine ultimate dispatch
everyone
including belden
thinks it can and ought to be a helluvalot more transparent
yes
will be on call
i apologize for being tardy
i can have my irs to you by monday
hi delaney
i won't need a room
did you want me to participate on a panel
if so
which day and at what time
who else will be on the panel
inquiring minds would love to know
best
jeff
delaney hunter
please respond to dhunter
susan scott is a senior attorney with the pipeline group
tw
i met her as part of the california puc's gas restructuring case
for some time she's been inquiring about government affairs
she called me yesterday and mentioned that she's very interested in exploring if there are any opportunities in ga
from my experience
susan is highly competent and very professional and i think tw would say the same
she likes her work but wants a new challenge
i told her i'd inquire about whether someone would be interested in talking with her
i think that it would be useful for you to chat with her
thoughts
susan would like to keep it confidential at this point
i don't think that the stranded cost issue has been squarely addressed
has sue gotten in touch with you
and have you contacted tim belden in portland
he is the absolute guru on this stuff
lee
i'm not certain that it will be possible to get skilling
but i'll get back to you soon
also
i want to manage expectations a bit about the possibility of having enron stream the conference
just don't want us to get ahead of ourselves
i'd prefer that it not go out in any announcement at this juncture
thanks a bunch
best
jeff
couple of brief comments
0
there is a new and growing drum beat to reduce california's wholesale price caps further
i.e

great news
puc
fixed
the language glitches in the original decision granting eti its certificate and voted it out yesterday
so we're good to go on filing our final tariff
it's attached
please take a look and let's discuss asap
monday
so we can get if on file at the cpuc
best
jeff
it was covered extensively in today's la times
will do
chris
here are the slides with your suggested edits incorporated
take a look
also
feel free to integrate the portions that you're working on
deal bench
pre-quals

directly into the presentation
or i'd be happy to do it
i'm at 0.0.0
i'm contacting benevides about putting an illustrative slide together representing the base and peak blocks
best
jeff
prentice ever get back to you regarding logistics about tomorrow nite
what time is dinner by the way
i'm supposed to do something from 0-0
but could come up directly thereafter
rebecca smith called
she wants to have coffee on monday at 0 am california
topics
0
how california got here
0
how california can get out of it
any chance of talking monday am prior to 0 am california time
i think i've got the messages pretty well down
but might be useful to touch base
let me know
hear's a message i'm practicing
shapiro and steffes went to ferc on friday----problem solved
best
jeff
here's the article that i referred to
could you please email or fax to me the commission's decision denying edison's emergency motion
greatly appreciated
best
al gore
yes
well
wouldn't you know it
i couldn't find the most recent version in my email
but here's the 0.0 version with a few edits
couple of other points
i still very much like the idea of taking the table out and includling as an attachment
i still think that the table doesn't explicitly address an option rick may be thinking about
maintain presence with fewer resources
think it's something we need to focus on
have a great weekend
spreadsheet to follow
i confess that i haven't even looked at the bloody thing
how many questions
should we divide them up and pass around as usual
heres
the spreadsheet
i added
regulatory intelligence and expertise
right after the top 0
check it out
best
jeff
understanding there won't be a call on monday
here's a draft of the auction slides that we've been working on for folks to review
i'm slow
but i catch on eventually
steffes was fired up when he called
sounds like the meeting went pretty well
have a good weekend
best
jeff
haven't heard of them
and i'm not aware of any new tariffs that offer those kinds of savings
but we'll check around
hello
i guess everyone's wrapped up in the baseball playoffs and the debates
there are 0 questions
since the sf people did 0&0 last time and the east bay contingent did 0&0
seems we can switch this time
sf takes 0&0
east bay 0&0
best
jeff
greetings
i'm going to read the material and the case today
should we compare notes
via email
on questions 0&0 by tomorrow
sunday
before lunch
let me know
best
jeff
you're the man
thanks
i'll coordinate with kim and the new recruit
i'll get you for this
here's a very rough shot at #'s 0&0
i think 0's worded very strangely
thus my strange answer
anyway
thought i'd throw something together to get the ball rolling
i'll keep thinking about and send another dispatch later today or first thing tomorrow morning
best
jeff
looks good
kim
thanks
agreed
i'll handle it
best
jeff
looks good
thanks
see you tomorrow
best
jeff
greetings
how's things
got your message
best place to get your hands on the report is the calpx website
if you have any problems
let me know
i'll try to write a note discussing our conversation on friday by end of day
best
jeff
seems that we could provide lay/skilling with the power point slides as prep for any calls
as a starter
it would be useful to provide mcneally with a letter that he could send to federal and state decision makers
best
jeff
greetings
any word about whether the puc bought our proposal
best
jeff
strange
i think that i received an email from someone with the report attached
let me scour my emails
if and when i find it
i'll forward
disheartening that you can't find a document that's getting so much press
great website
please let me know if you want me to participate in any gas panels
and my feelings won't be hurt if you say no
worry not
just need to know so that i can prepare some materials
best
jeff
here's one that's
final
not draft
that just came out
i'm assuming that this is the one the press is refering to
let me know that you think
gee
i don't know what came over me
apologies
just spent about 0 minutes with rebecca
she left with a very good understanding of our view of the problem and the solutions
she also spent time asking me how i thought other players would respond to the iou request for a big check to cover the undercollections
she expects to have a
big picture
story--covering ab 0s past
present
future--completed in the next couple of weeks
in rebecca's words
she wants the story to
shake things up
she's very upset with how the utilities are handling it
i told her we were less concerned with
he said/she said
and more concerned with finding real short and long term solutions that are fair to everyone
mark and karen
in my long history with rebecca
it has always been understood that our conversations are off the record and background
invariably
at the end of the conversation
rebecca tells me that she intends to call later and cajole the daylights out of me in an attempt to use some of my more colorful quotes
it was no different this time
if anyone wants more details
just let me know
best
jeff
jimmie's the
compiler
this time
you're stuff was good
whether he has time to incorporate remains to be seen
but i wouldn't sweat it
we can talk more tonite about our somewhat
loose
but thus far effective means for getting these things done every week
best
jeff
here you go

in the office all week
got it
they've asked me to be on a gas panel
i've said yes
but hadn't planned at this point on attending any of the conference other than the panel
bowen called
and unless he has to schedule a call with a judge from texas at the same time
we're on for 0:0 am
he'll call back if there's a problem
also
he confirmed my recollection on the dedicated transport v
afts and also confirmed that we can change any names we want and that this is the best time to make sure what we file in good ol
ca is consistent with our other filings

naruc's meeting at ground-zero dereg
san diego
in mid-november
right after the elections
might be a good opportunity for a pr event
i can't place him either
fyi
here's what dave pulled together on friday
i talked to him and told him i was going to make a single power point out of the info and then run it by him for review and comment
shoot
love to
but i have a final on sunday--yes sunday--the 0th
hey
thanks for hanging up on me on friday
ms bennett
thanks for the voicemail

i'll see if i can find that needle in that haystack and get back to you
hi
i was surprised to see you at the i-house last nite
haven't seen you for a while
was going to drop by and say hi and catch up but your table was extremely popular and i didn't want to intrude
this is the first travel-free week i've had in a long time
you want to try to have lunch
or we could meet at a non-i-house place during the break and catch up if you like
dying to hear about montana and your possible new life as a day student
did you manage to get away last thursday

first meeting to discuss how to dole out the $0 mm created by ab 0 is 0.0

bob frank and i had a conference call with him this morning

we'd talked about getting together to discuss the bills for the case
we'd originally agreed to a flat fee of $0
0
if memory serves
with a bonus for coming in under the cap
you've sent me bills
as of august 0 according to my records
for over $0,0
as you recall
we had a very lengthy discussion regarding the magnitude of the work associated with the hearings and associated briefs
i stressed that $0.0 was what i'd spend and that we'd have to do the best we could within that constraint
which is why i pressed for a flat fee arrangement at the outset
with that in mind
i believe that it's important to honor the arrangement
however
in light of the particular circumstances in this case
i'm willing to exceed the previous arrangement for a total of $0,0
but can't go above that
if you'd like to discuss it further
i'd be happy to talk about it
let me know
best
jeff
off what hook
seems like information that we'd want to get our hands on
non
aye aye
thanks
mike
i prefer the $0,0/clean slate option
for comments on the proposed decision and lobbying on this specific case
i'm willing to go straight hourly basis
but i will continue to request fixed prices going foward
and worry not
it's not a rick
paul
steffes issue
i'm the headache
all this said
and budget haggling aside
i'm sure you're aware that it's my view that 0
you do fantastic work and 0

sf
given that peace is likely going to try to push legislation to merge the iso and px and other nasty things
likely makes sense to listen in on our message development
tactics in addressing the lmp problem
you think there'd be any problem with that
if not
could you pass along the call in number
thanks
jeff
love one
thanks
good job
thanks
i'll set up a call
thanks
i'll set up the call
where are you
my phone's been on since you paged me
i didn't get any tickets
i love you oodles
you slobbery ol
sniffly day student doggie
thank you
marcia
hi
please set up a call for 0 minutes for tomorrow
0.0.0 for 0 am california time and distribute info to the list of folks below
thank you very much
well
it's upon us again and that means x-mas party
joseph and i have begun
barely
to plan for this year's festivities
but before we get to far along
tried and true democratic
small
d
principles call for a wee bit of polling
because we're already in the middle of october we need your responses pronto
if we don't receive your responses by cob thursday
then democracy's out the window
and good ol
dictatorship takes over
of course
it will be difficult to grant everyone's wishes
but all suggestions will be given great
and equal
weight
here are the questions
would you prefer just dinner
or dinner plus an activity
joseph and i are leaning toward dinner and an activity
but wanted to hear from other folks
if yes
joseph has come up with a couple of very fun ideas for an activity but suggestions are greatly encouraged and welcome
same goes for a restaurant
understanding that the choice of activity may influence where we eat
sue has put in her vote for fleur de lys
should we try to organize the event with the rest of the sf office
i.e
ees and ena
or confine it to ga
should we expand to include western ga or keep it to sfga
we choose for dates the 0th or 0th or 0th or 0th of december
what's your preference
is there a day that just won't work
joseph
if i've missed anything
please tack on
best
jeff
test
please send responses to both me and joseph
thank you
attached is a

now i understand why you were talking to rubin and summers
sounds like an outstanding hire
congratulations
exciting changes for exciting times
congratulations one and all
very exciting
and well deserved to boot
look forward to working with you in your new roles
best
jeff
as a follow-up to our call
here is some additional information regarding qf pricing issues
qfs who voluntarily switched to px pricing have been getting paid full px prices
and there seem to be a couple of thousand mws that have switched
the concern is that the commission's ultimate decision on px-based qf prices will force the qfs that have switched to
refund
some of the payments they've received
e.g
under a
px minus
mechanism
the majority of qfs are happy with the judge's proposed decision pending before the puc
except those remotely located qfs who will take a big gmm hit
as we discussed
the commission strongly rejected edison's emergency motion regarding the gas piece of the qf pricing formula
recall also that a couple of months ago
i accidentally sent it before it was complete
full note to follow
ok
given the enron xmas party in houston
and sue's request that weekends be included in the ballot
please repond to the dates listed below
please give 0
your top 0 preferences
and 0
any days for which you have a
true
conflict
thanks
also
unless i hear otherwise
we'll assume that partners and children come included

bill reed sempra's
chief regulatory officer
will replace gary cotton on the iso board
wednesday
dec
0th would work best for me
fyi
recently
chris calger has asked me to set up a meeting with sempra
ena's seeking deals with the two big ca gas ious
pg&e and socalgas
that would give ena access to their assets
in short
ena wants to offer a complete outsource deal for the ious
core gas load
i.e
rez and small commercial customers
ena would take responsibility for providing service for delivery at the city gate and in return would manage all of core's assets
upstream of the city gate
we're meeting with sempra's
chief regulatory office
bill reed
and sempra's cfo next thursday to discuss
given the fact that sempra's primarily focused on electricity
the plan is to lead off the meeting with a couple of electricity solutions as a bridge to the gas offer
for electricity
the plan has two pieces
0
a commodity offer that beats the 0.0 cent cap
i.e
nothing fancy
and 0
deal bench
services with the intent of establishing a procurement mechanism for sdg&e that the california puc could pre-approve
thereby eliminating some of the immense regulatory risk sdg&e now faces
wanted to run this by folks to gauge reactions
we'll distribute the slides we're putting together as soon as they're drafted--hopefully by cob friday
best
jeff
hey tim
calger asked me recently to set up a meeting with sempra to try to do a gas outsource deal
we're meeting with the cfo and their chief reg officer next thursday
on a call today
we thought--for a variety of reasons--that we ought to throw an electric commodity deal at them
too
while we're there
laird dyer's going to call you for indicative prices
same drill we did for skilling
if you have any questions
or want me to fill you in more
just give a holler
or check in with chris
best

it was nice to see you and catch up
i'm sorry things are so crazy

hang in there
hope to catch up again soon

swift action is warranted

don't hesitate
hang in there

thanks
i'll be here
fyi
just got a call from jan smutney-jones
apparently
word is on the street that peace intends to begin targeting enron as an example of the
misconduct
that peace alleges has occured in california's markets
smutney thinks peace may be keying off the comments of the
unnamed
trader in the dow article claiming that enron's been buying power and holding on to it
apparently peace's other angle is/will be
the same people who colluded in the design of this market are now colluding to profit unfairly from it
no idea of when and how peace might launch any attacks
two immediate thoughts
apart from the bad reporting in the dow article
that article shows that enron got beat by
among others
two federal
canada and the us
one state
srp
and one municipal
ladwp
government
david freeman
who now heads up ladwp
was appointed
czar
by the state of california and charged with the task of implementing steve peace's brain child
ab 0
freeman set up the iso and px market structures
he also set up the governing boards
i love you
sweetie
you didn't run out of gas did you
i don't know
did you get the
i love you
email that i sent today
dj pg&e says won't try to escape rate freeze for now >pcg copyright
0 dow jones
company
inc
san francisco
dow jones
pg&e corp
pcg
won't try to lift california's state-mandated rate freeze before the end of the transition to a deregulated market
saying it wants to protect its customers from volatile power prices
senior company officials said wednesday
we aren't moving at this time to end the rate freeze
but that view might change in the future
said a senior company official
who requested anonymity
pg&e invited reporters to its headquarters wednesday to discuss plans for repairing a
not workably competitive power market
and several steps the utility plans to file with federal regulators to do that
one proposal that is expected to be filed with the federal energy regulatory commission is a return to cost-based rates
where the price for power would be predetermined based on generation costs
the company wants to temporarily put an end to market-based rates
the utility will also request that california's independent system operator reduce the wholesale power price cap to $0 a megawatt-hour from company officials said those steps would allow them to recover billions of dollars in unpaid power costs and would stabilize wholesale power prices and protect retail customers
pg&e said generators would still be able to make a profit on power sold in california with the reduced cap
and the company doesn't believe the state's power supply would be in jeopardy from such an action

hi kim
any luck withjackie re
getting together to start the project

don't hesitate
leave me a voicemail and let me know how the meeting goes
i'll be in vancouver with the ebs gang monday/tuesday
and if all goes well maybe i can chat up some folks while i'm there
best
jeff
thanks
i agree with the recommendation
thanks for the info
that guy was truly out of control at the s.d

glad to hear that his rotten bills aren't going anywhere
who's gonna win the election
hope you and your ankle are doing well
best
jeff
greetings
well
there's a finance midterm coming up and some of us have discussed getting together the weekend before for a study session
i just grabbed an old list from last year so apologies if i've included folks who ain't even in finance
or if i've left some folks off
sorry to those who received in error
and please forward to anyone else who might be interested
anyway
anyone interested
hope all is well with all
best
jeff
great idea
my understanding is that the cap is $0
but that the px has filed with ferc to change it ot $0
my understanding is that ferc has not acted on the request to change it to $0
but i could be wrong
dave
mary
is this your understanding
i think it would be a good idea to have ron carroll in watkiss
shop to do a parallel analysis to what we're going to have mike day do
ron's very good and has done much work on these sortrs of issues
you comfortable with that
my pleasure
by the way
we're not talking after what the ny baseball teams did to the poor bay area teams
best
jeff
i think it's fuzzy enough that two good lawyers could give two different views--wanted to ensure that all analytic bases are covered
but i just talked to mike and he and i think
at least preliminarily
that the puc could do this absent legislation
he's going to do the analysis
likely better to let mike go ahead and do the analysis and if we want to get other opinions
we can make that decision at that time
one last thought
if the puc could do it
that might be davis
preference
that way
he and his people are in charge
but it may be difficult
impossible
for the legsilature to resist and davis may not have the clout to get them to back off
i've been asked for a copy of the transcript from the ferc hearing in s.d
any chance of getting that
and do you folks have a copy of the peace letter
treatise
sent to ferc last week
if so
could you fax it to 0.0.0
many thanks
best
jeff
thanks
mary
did the puc accept our deal re
information from the subpoena
monday/tuesday--vancouver
bc for ebs meeting wed--in office thurs--in office friday--in office
steve
i think i already forward these to you
but if not
they're the prices that henderson came up with for fully shaped prices to the utilities
may be useful re
conversations with the street about getting the utilities out of procurement
note that the date on the prices is 0.0.0 so they're somewhat stale
but arguably still indicative
i'm also going to give you the prices belden just gave us
prior to the run up yesterday
though
for prices at sp0
best
jeff
you're in
yes
i was thinking of offering up my office
also
what do you think about getting together real soon to start setting up the model for our finance paper
we'll have to do the research
but i think setting the model up will be about 0% of the project
best
jeff
some documents that bowen
co
did on clec v
ixc that may still be pertinent
i love you sweetie
you know it
too
it's that butterfly place we don't like cuz it's right next door
here are the very indicative prices tim gave us for 0 year deals at sp0
they'll likely change by the time we meet with sempra on thursday

jeremy
my understanding is that it was sent in today
i'm supposed to get a copy
when i do
i'll forward along to you
got bounced back first time
trying again
prentice tell you we're coming up tonite
little spades is in order me thinks
you
they're still in the formative stage
and the title is korny
but wanted to get the ball rolling
no pride of authorship
feel free to hack away
best
jeff
we'll see you gets a whuppin
prentice before me
me about 0:0
that's actually where it came from
i pulled it from the articles being sent around
this one was important enough that i wanted to get folks
attention
have a great weekend
best
jeff
drop prentice's car off at shop
go to dome
attached for your review is a rough cut at slides we're preparing for the meeting with sempra next thursday
thoughts and comments are appreciated
please disregard korny title
thanks
didn't get it the first time
good comments
i'm actually in vancouver today
monday
and tomorrow
let's keep sending back and forth and get together wednesday morning to finalize
i'll get a hold of calger for his comments
you can leave messages on my voicemail
too
best
jeff
will do
thanks
good morning professor
unfortunately
i'm traveling on business today
it's raing in vancouver
and can't attend class tonite
i was wondering if you'd be distributing the take home midterm in this evening's class
also
could you resend the access code for the craftmade case
i believe that i copied it down incorrectly
thank you very much
best
jeff
ok
lots of folks are interested
given that section is on saturday
i propose 0 am
this sunday
at my office
0 california
suite 0
if folks have a real problem with that
let me know
also
please rsvp so that i can arrange things with building security
best
jeff
thanks for the dinners
and the breakfast
and the company
it was fun
and don't get cranky
but i'm going to be in and out of things this weekend since i have midterms monday and tuesday
likely means that i'll be studying in berkeley and sf during the days on sat and sun but will be present for the evenings
h0pe that works
kisses
jeff ps i'm trying
lord knows i'm trying
to stay out of it
but it's going to start raining up at the dome very
very soon
thank you
in case word hasn't gotten around
ena learned cob friday
that it has been chosen to engage in further negotiations with the iso for about 0 mws of projects
the preliminary award is based on ena's response to the rfq that the iso issued last month for
emergency resources
thanks for the info
congratz on the deal
fyi
you bet
yes
i was in vancouver from last sunday evening through late yesterday afternoon
thank you for checking
sure makes sense
one concern
if they buy up to 0% of load
do we run the risk of
stranded cost
problem later down the road when we hit the backwardated part of the curve
hinges on the term of the contract
sort of chicken and egg problem
if the buy for short terms
the prices will be high
if they buy for longer terms
the prices will be lower
but the risk of stranded cost rises
thoughts
i'm sorry
things are so busy that i grabbed an old list that i thought everyone was on
you are most welcome indeed
my office
0 cal
suite 0
from 0 am to noon

jeff
prentice get in touch
we're coming on saturday---i'll likely bet there around 0 or 0
i'll bring the money then
in the meantime
can i order a case of coast zin and one of cab for pick up and payment this weekend
too
your ol
boozer jeff
macaroni and cheese will be fine
thanks
do i need to do anything with the form
you're a star
thanks
oops
sunday
thanks a bunch
just got it
really appreciate it
yes
thinking about going on saturday
and we s.f
folks are getting together for
yet another
review on sunday from 0 am to noon at my office
you're welcome to come
well
you don't have voice mail yet i see
could you give me a call when you get a minute
i know that will be tough for the next couple of days
regarding margo's voice mail to me
i'd like to talk about one other item as well
thanks a bunch
great
thanks seabron
knew you'd be dying to know that barry staw will be teaching a class on
creativity
in the spring
be sure to reserve your place today
best
jeff
i just figured it was a way for you to finally track him down---you know
show up at his class and get midevil on his ass for a few minutes
that is a great solution
you mean work part time
or go to school part time
very selfishly
i'm of course very glad that you're staying in the evening program
we're actually getting together on sunday
i hope i didn't mess things up
yes
it's for finance
though you're welcome to join---we can use all the help that we can get
i'm really glad to hear that things are going better
you seemed in pretty good spirits on tuesday
though i guess that could have partially been due to the big celebration over getting your first ticket
congratulations
i'll buy you a beer
i have a feeling that the only reason you haven't gotten one until now is because you've managed to talk your way out of many
best
jeff
dadburnit
you're not going to believe this
i'm going to be in---you
oh shit
we forgot to get our picks in
if you page me between 0:0 and 0 pm i can call you and we can figure them out
first apologies if you're getting this and you ain't even in finance---it's a study list from last year
if it's annoying the heck out of you
write back and i'll try to modify the list
second
please forward to those you know i've missed
just to clarify
meet at my office on sunday from 0 am to noon
please bring specific questions
we'll go round the room and let folks ask questions and the group will attempt to answer them
best jeff
excellent

good idea
unfortunately
i'll be sitting in an office in s.d
with sempra execs
my apologies
but since this is likely to be ongoing
preference would be to participate in the
first
meeting
actually
i know it's from 0-0
but i don't know where
you're a gem
thanks
thanks a million
glad to see that you made it back to portland
sorry about the mess
fyi
one of our potential competitors
the vp of biz dev at perfect.com is a very good friend of mine
please forward to anyone i may have inadvertently missed
best
jeff
you can count me in for $0
you by chance know where the review is tomorrow
it's from 0 am to 0 pm
right
thanks a bunch
thanks
see you tomorrow
most folks probably listened in to the press conference
but for those that didn't here's a summary of the iso's proposal to ferc
the description of the proposal was vague and general
and winters tends to speak in run-on sentences
so if i've gotten anything wrong
please chime in
$0 cap for
old
generation
new
generation would be exempt
ferc would require generators and scs to contract forward for at least 0% of their power
for those that meet the 0% requirement
they will be exempt from the $0 cap
and the $0 cap will apply
winters believes that the 0% requirement
coupled with utility-controled gen
will result in the ious scheduling about 0% of load into the forward market
load and supply that deviate from schedules and go to the real time market will be penalized
details to be
ironed
out
the iso is supposed to make the filing at ferc today
no sweat
not a problem
summary will do fine
let's definitely try to coordinate for the next meeting
you have a great weekend
too
best
jeff
well
it's a start
but it needs work
see you in la
hey
i just forgot
you haven't sent me the address of where it is i'm going
no need for thanks
these are busy times
take care
thanks
we're going to do it with ena---dinner at morton's
yes
it's beef
beef
beef
then
stomp
afterwards
taking place on friday the 0th
yes
it did
with many thanks to scott and tracy
god bless you
how's the music biz
bob hillman
please respond to
bob hillman
sorry
was traveling in la yesterday
what's up
i have a finance midterm and will be at your place around 0 or 0:0
most likely
be happy to chat
i can't believe those fins
well
you're just a bit late
peter de vroede already teamed me with him
but i am honored to have been considered
thanks
hi meg
my understanding is that peter de vroede has signed me up with him to room at the offsite
your records indicate the same
thanks
best
jeff
glad to here it
best of luck
let us know the locales of your gigs
be great to see you perform
in any case
hope to see you when you back in best
you
too
thanks
fyi
for meeting with pg&e
which is tues
oct
0
from 0 am-noon
pdt
in enron's sf offices
best
jeff
jim
to say that there was gaming in the uk pool is a significant understatement
couple thoughts
i'm pretty sure that seab has done extensive analysis on the uk and he'd likely therefore be very useful in developing rebuttal
though very close to it at one point
i've been removed for a few years
also
schroeder and his gang could also likely shed some insights
and seems that schroeder's pretty close now with littlechild---that might be another avenue for information to rebut
best
jeff
hi lee
looks great
could you do me a favor
you have
generating company
rep on the agenda
enron does not see itself as a generating company
in fact
the only generation that we own in california is 0+ mws of wind power in southern california
could you change it to
energy service provider
rep
hope that's not a problem
best
jeff
my apologies
i thought we had discussed me being on the first panel
thus
my previous note
i see that i'm on the second
however
sorry for the confusion
best
jeff
yes
0:0 would be better
thanks for asking
best
jeff sent by
owner-eveningmba@haas.berkeley.edu please respond to diane dimeff
i'll participate in the call
mary
i don't think that i have the final
final version
could send me and stephanie each one
thanks a million
best
jeff
greetings
i'm interested in renting the entire compound at
sans souci
0 avenida farralone in stinson beach from december 0th-0th and was wondering if it's available
thanks very much
best
jeff
thursday/friday work
wednesday is bad
i could do it in the morning
say
before 0 am
that work
but my preference is to have it done before 0 am pst---got to catch a flight for houston
need correct pin code for call with sanders
thanks
jeff
what's the number
steve
attached is a memo that reponds to your question
can the solution to the utilities
undecollection problem take place at the puc
or is a legislative fix required
as we discussed
i'm also attaching a memo from mike day on the issue
bottom line
it's within the puc's jurisdiction to solve the problem
but the likelihood is high that it will be a key focus of the legislature in the next session
if you
or anyone on the distribution
have any questions
let me know
best
jeff
thanks for you help
simon
and margaret
as always
thank you very much
actually ordering el paso to do what tw already does
so if anything
affirms tw's operating procedures
el paso has been in the cross-hairs of the entire industry
interestingly
this suit arose from the lengthy and detailed discussions we all had as part of the settlement---as you can imagine
el paso saw it as a negative outcome of those talks
we can discuss further when i'm in houston tomorrow and friday
best
jeff
tuesday--in office
investigation ferc poised to launch proposal meeting in la w/karen denne ebs updates pg&e gas accord ii holiday party update
i'm leaving for houston at noon today
but could participate by phone
juslet me know

edwin essandoh/hou/ees@ees
tim carter/hou/ees@ees subject
re
ctc definition sue
mona
and dasovich
would one of you be available for about 0 mins or so tomorrow p.m
thurs
to square away this issue
maybe around 0 or 0 or so
my recollection ofour original contract language was to capture all of the post-transition period ctcs as set forth in ab0
so maybe we just need to broaden or clarify what we mean by
residual ctcs
i'll actually be at 0 cal starting in the p.m
tomorrow
so this could work out pretty well
otherwise
i'll be in sr on friday and then in socal next week but back insfo on next weds for a two day lsi seminar
dasovich you're speaking at it
thurs and fri so we could discuss then too
sorry for the short notice and i hope i'll at least be able to say hi to everyone tomorrow
andy
i know
bummer
hey
i'm leaving for houstong in about 0 minutes
could you refresh my memory on what i owe you for the coastal and the acacia and i'll quickly send you a check right now
thanks again for the lobster and fun last weekend
sorry i didn't get back on sunday
i cannot believe the dolphins
did i respond
life is nuts
i'm losing it
anyway
peter de vroede signed my up with him last week
so i'm not sure why i'm still on the list
anywho
would have been fun
sorry i'm already booked
had the midterm last nite--wasn't nearly as bad as i thought it would be
though i'm sure i made about a thousand dumb little mistakes
best
jeff
hi sweetie
should we buy some
sent by
owner-eveningmba@haas.berkeley.edu please respond to will c birdsey
we're going to be at the dome
me thinks
sorry
yes
i can
so it is the 0nd after all
thought it might be the first
which i could have made
the 0nd doesn't work---have set up a meeting with ena to meet with sempra execs to see if a deal can be done
yeah
right
but since it's that early on the 0nd
i can call in by conference call and attend the first 0 minutes
or so
will that work
in other exciting news
going to meet with the lawyers and bowen either this afternoon or first thing in the morning tomorrow
you want to join
and should i see if scott and/or donald want to attend
just let me know
best
jeff
looks fine to me
as you know
prentice is a world class procrastinator---i've been trying to get her to get in touch with steve
larry
ed
co
for about a month to see if they can play on the weekend of dec
0/0
and she
of course
ain't done it
by the way
i may have found a really cool
compound
in stinson beach
could you get in touch with those guys and see if they can do it
sorry to bug you with it
but i think it's best if you guys contact them
thanks a million
little bird tells me that i may be lunching with you two at the 0 seasons today

thank you
if you'r open tomorrow
sunday
i'll call you then
best
jeff dasovich
fyi
seems like we've given the governor quite a bit up to this point
but there may be some good reasons to
as they say
keep on giving
perhaps we can discuss further as part of our meeting on monday
best
jeff
katie kaplan
please respond to kaplan
congratulations
everyone is extremely pleased that you're joining
best of luck and very much looking forward to working together
best
jeff
i'll believe it when i see it
seems like a good idea to keep the heat on
thanks
i'm glad they want to follow-up with steve
i've been pushing it
and i've got some follow-up as well based on chats i had in the afternoon on friday with folks post-call
let's regroup on monday
i'll be in portland but can call you
best
jeff
attached for your review are draft talking points for the cal energy markets conference i'm speaking at on thursday in sf
all comments
suggestions
etc
are appreciated
thanks
yes
i would like to participate
thanks
thanks a million
talk to you then
attached is a rough draft of my talking points for a panel i'll be on at a cem conference in sf on thursday afternoon
have distributed to western ga team
plus steffes
for comment and thought you may have some
too
topic for panel
puc priorities
goal is to
politely
refute loretta lynch's and carl woods
continued assertions that 0
california's move to deregulate was based solely on ideology with no basis in fact and 0
the solution is to turn back the clock to command-and-control regulation
the ferc order tomorrow is likely to alter the points somewhat
comments are much appreciated
best
jeff
chris
as we discussed yesterday
laird and i spoke and we think that the presentation is good to go for thursday
we'll need to update the numbers for the offer we made to s.d
last week
you had mentioned that you might want to include a shaped product
you still considering it
let us know and we can add it
and make any other changes you'd like to make at this end
my flight gets into s.d
at at 0:0 on southwest
best
jeff
sandi sez it's actually happening at 0 am and it's renewable-focused
here are the messages as i understand them
please let me know if i've misconstrued anything
thanks
ferc got a lot right in the order and we're very encouraged as a result
in particular
ending the px buy/sell requirement and permitting utilities to manage risk through a portfolio of short and long term contracts is a fundamental step in the right direction
however
the proposed price cap is unworkable and will jeopardize realibility in california
as structured
it will
discourage the development of new generation to serve california fail to provide adequate incentives for demand responsiveness
force enron to abandon 0 mws of new power projects planned for california
we look forward to participating in ferc's process and are hopeful that ferc's final order will fix the deficiencies in the current price cap proposal
we encourage california to work with ferc to implement the proposals and quickly fix the flaws in the market on behalf of the state's consumers
with
much
of what i said
got calls in to richard at pg&e and reed at sempra
will report back
anything you want
honey
i love you
lord help us
call whenever you'd like to discuss the call
that palmer forgot to tell you about
thank you
my bet is that pat will be at naruc
i think that michael moore
phd economist and cec commissioner would be very good
i tried bilas--he's got a conflict
and don't think it's a problem that he and larson are both on because they'll come with two quite different takes
p.s
ferc dropped a bomb on california today
apologies
i'm in s.d
with calger and dyer to meet w/sempra tomorrow morning
will do
thanks
see you at the alaska gate
thanks
fyi--i'll be participating on the second panel
best
jeff
gee
sounds great
can't wait
congratz on keeping the sky from falling out there
best
jeff
just got back from sacramento
davis still pandering
thanks
let's discuss further
wanted to make sure that you knew that today ferc declared the cap that the iso board voted out last week
null and void
which means that we're back to the old $0 cap
ferc proposed a
soft
$0 cap that would take effect in 0 days
however
call if you have questions
best
jeff
my schedule has blown apart for tomorrow--traveling
possible to meet this weekend to discuss the project
either day's fine with me
apologies for the last minute change
best
jeff
is there a suggested time for the meeting
i'm pretty open
i'd like to be sure that jim and paul and mary karen denne can participate
too
do we need to have other commercial folks on the call
e.g
calger
belden
someone
are you and scott available this weekend to look at the place i'm thinking about renting in stinson for prentice's birthday
thank you very much
sandi and dave and mike will dicuss further on the call on monday but wanted to disseminate info regarding the meeting that joe ronan of calpine offered on an iep call today
the meeting was attended by a lot of folks of all stripes
wright was very critical of how the governor is handling the issue and wants to craft a solution with the industry and then invite the governor to get on board
wright threw a whole laundry list of options on the table for folks to consider
dave's typing up his notes from the meeting for distribution later today
one of wright's key concern is forward contracting
the utilities said that loretta lynch is the problem with the onerous
prudence
criteria she's imposing on utility forward contracts
those onerous criteria keep the utility from contracting
much discussion of what california does on the gas side
i.e
set an objective benchmark price
if the utility beats it
they profit
if they do worse
they take the hit
the utility
under this framework
has broad flexibility to contract forward
i.e
puc gets out of the way
fyi
coincidentally
i suggested this approach in very broad terms--pointing to the fact that it's already successfully in use on the gas side--during a panel discussion that i participated in yesterday at the california energy markets conference
the utilities told rod wright that they did not want
nor did they have the expertise
to get back into the generation business
i have no idea how i sent the email to jackie at kim's email address
apologies
i'm losing it
did you guys meet last nite to discuss the project
if not
do you want to meet this weekend for a wee bit to discuss
i'm in town
just let me know
i can't find ted's email on any notes and i'm too lazy
flaky
to search it out
best
jeff
great
you going to the game
that sounds good
what if it's saturday
is there a time you could go
why so much interest in the niner game
0 am it is on saturday
yes i'm going to see kathy cowlick
of course
i will be hurt and disappointed if the sellers family doesn't vote its conscious
doesn't vote for the candidate that truly represents the values that the sellers family stands for
that candidate is
of course
ralph nadar
amen
jeff p.s
rory and timi love dr
laura
just got a call from the realtor
they expect us at 0 am at their office in s.b
tomorrow
lalime's
sp
is cool
ask prentice about it
don't change the subject
vote your concious
gore voted for scalia and
one down
four to go
god bless scott
ok
looks like saturday's out
i'm game for tomorrow
morning
afternoon
we can meet at my office if you'd like
or at a cafe
let me know
best
jeff
fyi
my understanding is that martin and doug are going to be focused on dg in california
yes
you can expect it this weekend
my apologies for being tardy
also
i think you should make a stab at getting mike kahn
chair of the california electricity oversight board on one of the panels
i can make a contact and i don't think that it's too late to try
he'd be very good
very close to the governor
fyi
we'll get a call in number first think monday morning
paul
do you want to notify calger
belden and thomas in portland
fyi
how to remedy the
px only
flaw in california's market has been on the table for some time
i've felt for some time that the gas model offers a good point of departure for coming up with a more rationale alternative to the current framework
as mentioned in a previous note
i made that point at the california energy market conference last week
the eob's chief economic consultant
who also spoke at the conference
was intrigued by my comments and has asked me to go up to sacramento sometime in the next week or two to discuss it--and other options--with him
my understanding is that the idea coincidentally got some attention at the wright meeting last week
with all of that in mind
i wanted to pass on a very brief summary of the gas procurement mechanisms currently in place for pg&e and socalgas that i asked mike day's shop to draft up last month
it might come in handy as prep for the call on monday to discuss the wright meeting
best
jeff
harry
seems like a good idea for you to participate to ensure that ees is in the loop
assemblyman rod wright's trying to find a solution that the whole industry can embrace
which he'd then foist on the governor
sandi
parquet and day attended the first meeting last week
i'll forward to you parquet's notes from the meeting
we'll be setting up a call in number first thing monday morning
best
jeff
here it is
given the emphasis from all quarters on the need for retail competition to make california work
would seem useful to strike a balance between the degree to which the comments emphasize wholesale and retail reforms
and for the record
sue
no i don't talk like that
best
jeff
mike
call paul and/or mona about energy attorneys in arizona
paul
0.0.0
don't give any good talent to our competitors
best
jeff
the call-in number for the 0:0
pst
0:0
cst
phone call is
dial in
0.0.0 code
0 thanks
jeff
reminder we have a call at 0 pm pst/0 pm cst re
clec/tariff in ca/authority to dig in ca
we'll use the internal bridge
which i believe is
0.0.0 and the code is 0
best
jeff
have a great time in nashville
don't forget to vote
gray gonna be there
we can uninvite steffes
hain
denne
kingerski
comnes if having them on presents any problems
i hadn't included marcie on the call
but would be happy to include her
too
just let me know
mary
please include me in the call with mr
sanders
co
best
jeff
ditto
sounds good
talk to you tonite
fyi
i'll be participating in a
round table discussion
on california next monday on the berkeley campus
it's being sponsored by the policy school and some folks from the business school
laura tyson and a former fcc mucky-muck
howard shalansky
will moderate the two panels
alums who now work in the energy biz are putting up funding for the event
e.g
columbia
american public power ass
we're providing a modest stipend
there are two
round tables
first one is
why did we do this
and the second one is
where to from here
i'll be on the second panel
go to the attached website for agenda and other info
i intend to pull from the messages
filings and other materials that we've developed over the course of the last several weeks/months
i'll distribute talking points for review and comment sometime this week
but please feel free to send thoughts
suggestions
etc
early and often
best
jeff
dear colleagues
the draft website is ready to go public
it has been linked to the gspp website
it is still the same address
talk to you all soon
best wishes
heather
i'm calling marcie as we speak
fyi
sue stopped by and wanted to discuss your email re
launching missiles over email to the world
i told her that 0
folks are understandably sensitive regarding the info that gets to commercial folks
0
she should continue sending those notes out and 0
she should restrict the distribution list for such notes to ga
which gives the team a chance to discuss the issues and to decide what info to push out to commercial folks
and avoids rather everyone just willy-nilly sending out notes and potentially getting commercial folks whipped up into an
unintentional and unnecessary
frenzy
i think she took it well and i think she'll make a practice
only time will tell
congratulations
is this something they've said publicly
if so
have they provided any rationale
thanks
thank you
if you get a chance
give a jingle and give me the brief rundown on where we left off on part 0
thanks
gee
and at $0/bottle
i can load up on a few cases
at that price
the mondavi's must be hoping bush wins so america can spend the tax break on that tasty reserve
kidding
do you qualify for the discount on the reserve
too
go ralph
another ugly stereotype that is still alive and well in america
i am so hurt
nancy
so hurt
greetings wayne
sorry that i missed the last meeting
i'll be attending by phone this week
but would like to attend in person as often as i can
understanding that our meetings will be weekly
now don't shoot me
but i was wondering if it might be possible to have the meetings on thursday mornings
that way i could actually be in houston for the meetings
which my schedule doesn't permit me to do on wednesdays
if it's too complicated
don't sweat it
i can continue to do the meetings by phone
but if thursdays can fit into folks
schedule
that would be great
thanks and talk to you on wednesday
best
jeff
have you drafted any talking points yet
i'm working on what i'll focus on for the conference at berkeley next monday and would love to crib from your comments
best
jeff
and do you get the discount for the 0 reserve
i've tried to capture in the document dave sent around on friday
the preliminary conclusions/directions we came up with in today's meeting
if i've mangled or missed anything
please chime in
if folks have information
i.e
bullet points
to discuss at wednesday's meeting regarding the various issue areas they're thinking about
please foward along to me by cob tomorrow and i'll compile for distribution first thing wednesday morning
best
jeff
sf all week
go right ahead and choose me as a reviewer
wayne
if you insist
we can pass on thanksgiving
others
any problems with changing the meeting to thursdays
if the meetings are going to continue on a weekly basis
i'd like to try to attend in person as much as possible
i.e
schedule permitting
currently
my schedule doesn't permit me to be in houstons on wednesday mornings
but thursdays would work
if it makes things too complicated
not a problem
best
jeff
you're welcome
question
re
cat herding
do we have the participants list yet
i've got a call in to smutney
iep
sue talked to him about the cap yesterday and i'm piling on today
if we can give smutney an alternative to
the $0 cap's ok
then we can likely persuade him
tim
be useful to know as soon as possible if the alternative steve suggests below
i.e
>$0 bids with no disclosure
is palatable
if other specific ca generators are participating on the panel
we'll need to know who they are in order to
assist
them with their price cap-related comments
best
jeff
dave and i talked
i've talked to chris foster
midmarket in portland
he's sending me 0
illustrative examples of offers we've made to each of the three ious
0
deals we've done with the ious to date
only one thus far with pg&e
laird dyer will get back to me with the muni deals we've thus far best
jeff
hi
my palm for some reason isn't syncing
could you have chris give me a call to try to get it to work
thanks a bunch
best
jeff
thanks
i can be on the call
one other thing
if there's anything you need me to do re
bowen's bill for services
don't hesitate to let me know
best
jeff
de nada
thanks a million
will keep you in the loop on what's going on between now and thursday
and don't hesitate if you need anything
or if there's anything that you want to add to the stew
plz call asap re
dow reporter called to talk iso peakers
thx
jeff
plz chk email re
conversation w/smutney on price caps
best
jeff
to help herd cats
might be useful to get to the generators via multiple contact points
my understanding is that the houston-to-houston contacts are good ones
we'll continue to work it via iep and generator contacts here in california
steve
i'm not sure how far along you are with the comments
but california's insistence on micro-managing utility purchases is really standing in the way of developing a competitive
functional market
the prospect of having ms
lynch in particular and the state of california generally as a counter party in every transaction is a huge disincentive for the utilities to transact
though the situation in california has now put the utilities into a
damn the torpedoes
mode and persuaded them to transaction despite the regulatory risk
clearly
the first best answer is utility-out-of-the-merchant-function
but given the political climate in california
we're likely to have the utility in the role of buyer
at least in the near term
for the market to work in a structure with utility as buyer
the cpuc and california need to get out of the way
otherwise
it's a never-ending quagmire
a couple of pucs ago
the cpuc set up an incentive mechanism for utility gas procurement
under that mechanism
a benchmark is set
if the utility beats the benchmark
it shares the benefits with consumers
if it does worse than the benchmark
it shares the pain with consumers
it's a model that works
that's simple and that's compatible with competitive markets
it ain't perfect
but it's head and shoulders above the regulator-as-counterparty that the current puc has put in place
given the brief time you'll have
there may be other more critical issues
but this one is getting increasing attention out here in the land of lunacy
jeff
nope
hey
i know it's a pain
but i think there would be value in getting together
if folks are available
on thursday evening from 0-0 with
lots of
beer and pizza and grind through the finance case
we can do it at my apartment
or anywhere else you folks would like to do it
thoughts
as far as i'm concerned ted

what time's the call tomorrow
hey
we meeting tonite
can you believe this bloody election
steve
here are the deals and offers
the desk is concerned about two things
0
that we not make the specific of the deals/offers public
they're fine with general statements like
the offers are below the price cap
0
they have good relationships with the ious and the munis and are starting to do a lot of deal
as such
they expressed concern about any comments that might agitate them and make them disinclined to transact with us
sound familiar
if there's anything else you need
for if you have any questions about this material
don't hesitate
good luck
best
jeff
talked to bill reed
in his comments
he will say
ferc should be more prescriptive
can't wait for a new board
made of new people
to act
ferc needs to be more assertive--i told him we're all for leadership from ferc
they will strongly support the end of the buy-sell requirement and express concern about the cpuc's micromanagement of utility purchases--i told him we'd have a similar message on that issue
ferc should
pjm
the california market--i told him we would differ significantly on that issue
i.e
pjm-ing generaly
and
merging
the px and the iso
he said his comments on
refunds
would be
narrow
and would point out that the ferc staff report says there is evidence of specific
bad actors
and that those bad actors should be required to give refunds--i told him that our position hasn't changed on retroactive ratemaking
i explained our position on getting more information to the market sooner
he said that it sounds like a good idea
i told him about our message on price caps
he said that he would stress that price caps ought to be a temporary
fix
and should be removed just as soon as the market is
functional
steve
i told him he should search you out prior to the start of the panel tomorrow and talk more

greetings folks
as you know
the gas accord is coming to an end and pg&e's trying to figure out where to go from here
i would argue that what happens with pg&e is equally
if not more
important as what happens with socal
as you also know
we're faced with a retrograde puc that
by all accounts
longs for the
halcyon days
of command-and-control regulation
as such
i think it would be very useful
and cost-effective
to pull together the effective coalition we established in the socalgas settlement
in that coalition
some of us contributed dollars and some contributed experts
i think we should employ that approach again
i asked mike day
who i think most agree
did a pretty good job of representing us in the socal settlement
to make a proposal for representing us in the pg&e case
mike's proposal is attached
finally
if there's anyone else you think we ought to include in our coalition
please let me know
let me know what you think
hope all is well with you and yours

goodin
macbride is willing and able to represent a coalition of end-users
marketers
and other interested parties in the pg&e gas accord ii proceeding in much the same fashion that it represented multiple parties in the gri proceeding in both pg&e and socalgas settlements
we would propose to split our monthly billings for legal fees and expenses equally between the parties who agree to join such a coalition
in exchange for joining the coalition
parties would receive frequent updates on the status of settlement talks and other proceedings
participate in conference calls to reach decisions on coalition positions
and have the ability to call on the gmsrd lawyers on the case in order to answer specific questions or provide any other useful information
i envision using several attorneys for various portions of the proceeding
including using associates and paralegals for research
and other gmsrd partners with gas experience for preparation of pleadings
etc
however
most of the face to face negotiating
including working with commissioners and advisors as necessary
would be done by myself as lead partner on the case
i have attached a fee schedule for the gmsrd attorneys who would likely have some involvement in the case
because the majority of this work will be done in 0
these rates reflect our new 0 hourly fees
however
in an effort to encourage participation in the coalition
and because several potential members of the coalition are past or existing clients
we propose to reduce our standard fees with a 0% discount for all participants in the coalition
with this discount
these would be the lowest fees available to any of our clients in the coming year
i have not made any type of estimate of legal expenses for this proceeding
as it is exceedingly difficult to forecast how protracted the proceedings will be
once we begin participating in the proceeding and we collectively decide how best to proceed in terms of actual participation in the case
we can provide frequent budget reports and make more useful budgetary estimates
if you require some type of estimation sooner than that

mark
faced with the price spikes in california
the new administration led by governor davis has been pretty hostile toward deregulation
perhaps the administration's
and its california puc
hostility represents a
placeholder
until the administration comes up with it's own plan to
fix
the mess that california refers to as a
market
as such
there hasn't been much coming out of the california puc other than rhetoric regarding the fact that republicans
not democratics
restructured california's market and the desire to go backwards to good
ol cost-of-service
command-and-control regulation
however
the iso and the px have issued interesting reports
which i'll forward in a seperate email
i look forward to seeing prof
littlechild at the conference on monday
he's on the first panel
i'm on the second

could the 0 opus one be that elusive wine that one never finds
in my continual pursuit for wine nirvana
i have traveled to bordeaux and back with stops in italy and australia and for what
besides losing my luggage
tracking through customs and using non-functional phone cards
i have been searching for that wine of perfection
could this wine finally be the one
this just released opus one may be the absolute finest young red wine i have ever tasted in a bottle
barrel samples don't count
aristocratically structured the 0 opus one magnificently perfumes the air with aromas of ripe
succulent fruit

this wine does not allow its captive audience to escape its web of cabernet ecstasy
made with the five important varietals of bordeaux

ok
the tours are booked
it ain't much anyway
but you're on the guest list for a complimentary opus tasting
see previous note
opus is across the street from and just south of the main mondavi winery
when you get there
check in with the concierge
who will have your name and will set up with the complimentary tasting
it gets real crowded sometimes
which causes them to close the gates
if that occurs
you simply need to buzz the intercom and give them your name and they'll let you in and set you up
you should really do the tasting----the wine is simply awe-inspiring and it's a cool place
finally
they're open from 0:0-0:0
later it gets
crazier it gets
i suggest you try to get there around 0:0
which will ensure that you get the attention you deserve

repeat of today's hearing
but have it california's house

based on his oscar-winning performance at today's hearing
steve kean's the one bowen's office has requested
possible to have a very quick call to get folks
view on the pros and cons of participating in the hearing---recall that peace sits on bowen's committee---and whether steve kean can be persuaded to come to california
or perhaps we can send a video-tape of steve to be played to the committee
you people in california are crazy
but other than that you're a swell group of people
if possible
we would like to have the call at 0 am

i left a message on her voicemail
that oughta do for now
attached is a draft of taking points i'll use for the conference on monday
if you'd like to see the agenda
here's the url
i'm on the
summit's
second panel
what do we do now
i've been asked to identify the big problems
propose solutions
and identify the forum for the solution
e.g
cpuc
ca legislature
ferc
there are two documents
one is a document that i previously distributed and used as talking points for the cal
energy markets conference last week
the other is a table listing the issue
the solution and the forum
i have 0-0 meetings to make opening remarks
then there will be a discussion led by the
facilitator
all comments are appreciated

my email's been mangling addresses when i reply
just noticed that i got alot of

did anyone get them
i'm trying again
please let me know if you get this one
thanks
and sorry about the mixup
best
jeff
that's a great idea
and i think that it would be useful to meet with her
in fact
i think it's important to meet one-on-one with as many legislators as possible
because i agree that the facts are pretty darned friendly
i'll look into setting up a meeting with her
bowen in particular is being advised by enviros who think de-regulation is still the best way to go
and if it weren't for the for the
undercollection/refund
issues
i think that she'd be pushing to move ahead
unfortunately
while she may not be focused principally on a hanging
that's likely to be where the hearing goes
she's been unable in past to control peace at her hearings
best
jeff
mona and i plan to be in sacramento tomorrow at an ab 0 implementation group meeting
i think that sue also has a conflict
my thought was to have someone from the pr firm that karen has brought on go and report back
i'm supposed to give a presentation on gas tomorrow
but it's not a problem for me to cancel and go to s.d
if we think that it's vital for one of us to be there in person

jeff
thanks harry
this is important and we've discussed making sure that neil and jubran
and you
for that matter
be included in any distribution that includes ena west
consider it done
unless others have any problems
i suggest that going forward any emails
materials
phone conversations
etc
that include ena also include ees
i don't think that we have any legal issues associated with including both ena and ees
but if i'm missing something
please let me know

we said no
if karen thinks it would be useful to have the pr firm go and report back
that's how we'll handle it
otherwise
we'll get reports from others
other commitments win out over ferc's
open mike
welcome chris
i can meet during the break
been on two panels in the last two weeks with florio--most recent yesterday
dan richard of pg&e was also on yesterday's panel
mike has now come so far as to push the
core/noncore
split a la the gas industy publicly
if you just wait long enough
people come around
dan richard did not object
i am pretty suspect about pg&e
though
dan richard said things like
i'm one of the people in my company who believes that
over time
the utility should exit the procurement function
but many policy makers want pg&e to act as a
quasi-governmental
body offering reliable
low cost service to small customers
i don't think anyone wants anyone's mother to be thrown to the competitive market willy nilly
people have to understand that the large customers are going to take all of the
good
power
leaving the
dregs
for small customers
while i'm skeptical of pg&e--dan said what he knew people wanted to hear but there was little conviction behind the words--there is certainly an opening that we should try to exploit
in addition
florio is now publicly agreeing pretty strongly that the gas model for utility procurement is one that merits a heck-of-a-lot of attention
i.e
set a benchmark
get the cpuc out of the way
and let the utility live or die by the benchmark
there's daylight among the stakeholders
but a very large amount of uncertaintly regarding whether the administration
its appointees
and/or the legislature will get on board
best
jeff
can we try friday at 0 am
again
as uncomfortable as it sometimes is
i feel compelled to comment on what in my humble opinion are quite troubling statements
particularly when those statements come from the mouths of self-described liberal
open minded
diversity-loving hipsters
i have a very hard time with stereotyping of any sort
and a very
very hard time when it comes from people i'm close to
believe it or not
in the past
i would have been much more aggressive about it
guess i've mellowed
sorry if it made things
well

i tend to trend toward socially libertarian and sometimes even anarchist views---oh well

the group was formed out of california's restructuring legislation
ab 0
it's called the
ab 0 implementation group
i heard that the group decided that its time to change its name
the group includes just about all of the interest groups in california
i focused on the fact that gas offers a model of a
real

artificial
and failed electricity model created by ab 0

esb ownership of network is questioned
competition authority says separation of national grid from core company does not go far enough
arthur beesley reports irish times copyright
c
0 irish times
source
world reporter
tm
the competition authority has questioned the esb's ownership of the electricity network in the newly deregulated power market
in a paper submitted to the department of public enterprise
the body said the separation of the esb's national grid operation from the core company did not go far enough to ensure fair competition
it said arguments in favour of the esb retaining the transmission and distribution system ignored the
overwhelming conclusion
that a generation company which owns such assets
will naturally favour itself
at the expense of customers and reliability
the paper has not been published yet
it is believed to state
however
that the esb's retention of its
non-competitive
transmission and distribution assets and its
competitive
electricity generation business was unwise from a competition perspective
the national grid
which controls when individual power stations feed electricity into the network
was separated from the esb when 0 per cent of the market was opened last february
in theory
this meant the esb could not favour its own generation stations over more efficient competitors when deciding which plant to switch on and off as demand for power fluctuates
but the authority's response to the statutory instrument behind the separation
which renamed the national grid as eirgrid
said more should be done to ensure the market operates fairly
the paper said
some argue that as long as there is an independent operator of the underlying transmission system
ownership of the transmission system can remain in the hands of an upstream generation operator
in accordance with this line of argument
the shift of operational control of electricity transmission to eirgrid would mean that discrimination in dispatch
of power
and other operations would not be possible
however
the competition authority considers that this argument ignores the overwhelming conclusion that the generation company that owns the transmission lines will naturally favour itself
the statutory instrument followed complex talks
which led to an agreement between the esb
its trade unions and the minister for public enterprise
ms o'rourke
when eirgrid was formed
the esb retained ownership and responsibility to develop and maintain the high-voltage national transmission system and the low-voltage local distribution network
the authority says these
too
should be separated from the esb to ensure the competitive market functions fairly
according to a person familiar with its paper
this would ensure equal access to the power network and an objective
transparent
non-discriminatory treatment of all electricity generators in the market
it said
the paper argues the esb has an incentive to allocate as many costs as possible to the operation of the transmission and distribution system

the reference is specific to statements that we made when ferc first issued it's proposed order on nov
0 regarding how to fix the mess in california
we said
and ferc was a little cranky about this
that we were pulling 0 mws of power plants that we'd planned to build in california on the basis of the price cap proposal included in ferc's proposed order
it was in the press
so it was narrowly confined to the power plant proposals
calpine subsequently announced that it
too
would pull the peaking plants it had planned to developed
i think that they announced the same amount would if you need anything else
don't hesitate to call

nov 0,0 california power plants get jolt as natural-gas supplies are cut by rebecca smith staff reporter of the wall street journal los angeles
southern california power plants
already stressed to their limits last summer
got another jolt this week as a cold snap caused a sharp curtailment of supplies of natural gas used to generate electricity
the power plants were able to switch to burning oil and continue to produce electricity
but the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns that an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the u.s
is putting the reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk
that's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the u.s
burn gas and only gas
the units affected this week in san diego were able to shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were constructed to burn oil
generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel flexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than gas and generally has been costlier
in california
where gas-supply problems first surfaced on monday in san diego
there is pessimism about a hydra-like energy crisis that seems to grow new heads every day
the state weathered three-dozen electrical emergencies last summer
caused by a shortage of electricity
officials had hoped to solve the problem by speeding up construction of new generating plants
now
they're finding the state may be building its way out of an electrical problem and into a gas problem
one official
who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single fuel
said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a comprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil
gas and electricity affect each other
we don't just need new generating plants and transmission lines
we may need pipelines
too
said terry winter
chief executive officer of the california independent system operator
the organization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity supplies
you can't look at these things in isolation
the natural-gas problems surfaced when the local gas-distribution company
san diego gas
electric co
notified power-plant operators and a handful of industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half
in california
residential and small businesses have first crack at natural gas
and industrial uses are regarded as secondary
even if they are generating plants
dynegy inc
the houston-based energy concern that owns some of the older plants that serve san diego
immediately switched to oil
but it didn't like doing so
its plants create three times as much pollution when they burn oil and exhaust valuable air-pollution emission credits that power plants here need to operate
the san diego units couldn't simply be shut down
because the state was short of power
roughly 0% of the state's capacity already was off-line
including many of its nuclear units
as most of those plants are now undergoing repair after being run at capacity limits throughout the summer
what's more
the gas-pipeline system that feeds san diego isn't big enough to begin with
the system was built primarily to serve residential customers and not big power plants
the problems could persist
off and on
through the winter
that's because gas-storage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation
but especially in california
because it ran its gas-fired units so hard last summer
this time last year
southern california had 0 billion cubic feet of gas in storage
now
it's roughly 0 billion cubic feet
or 0% less
prices also have moved up sharply
from roughly $0.0 a million british thermal units to around $0 this week
nationally
storage levels are down about 0% from a year ago
gas is trading higher in california than anywhere else in the nation
said john lavorato
chief operating officer of enron north america
a unit of enron corp
of houston
but he said they're headed up in the northeast
based on cold weather forecast for the next 0 days to two weeks
high prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product
electricity
in california the average price for electricity to be delivered thursday was $0 per megawatt hour
that's double the price a week ago and five times the price a year earlier
lisa
sorry
but joseph's gone on vacation for the week
i think that the size of the group is going to require that we do this offsite
we use the
park hyatt
in san francisco
could you check with paul and let him know that i think that we need to go offsite
given the size of the crowd
and if he agrees
could you go ahead and check into getting a room at the park hyatt
as always
i'm greatly indebted
if there are any problems
or if you have any questions
don't hesitate to give me a call
best

jeff
glad to hear it
on the down side
it appears that i won't get you that email i promised until tomorrow
if that's totally unacceptable

jeff
i think that it would be bad if nancy had to cook her own birthday dinner
i'm going to try my darnedest to get down there before the month's out

jeff p.s
when will we know
and who will win
thank you
where the heck are you
can you translate this for me
fyi
i'd like to renew
when you find a minute give a call re
message from sandi
no rush
best
jeff
why's the market keeping us at 0
hey darlin
that's texas talk
how are ya
so good to hear from you
hear you and jc are landed gentry over there in berkeley
next thing you know
you'll be complaining about homeless people and how they're bringing property values down
tee hee
love to see you guys some time
what about this godfersaken election

if you're willing to get the stuff necessary to make this menu
i'm willing to act as

to cameron to help make it
just don
t seem right to have nancy cook on her birthday
you'll be hearing from me soon
love to get together over the holidays
everyone from berkeley moved to noe valley---really ruined the place
give john a big hug
thanks for hosting
kim
jackie mentioned the list of tasks that remain to get this done
e.g
graphs
make spreadsheet pretty
write-up
etc
i'lll do whatever needs to be done
so once folks have picked which task they'd like to take on
just let me know what's left
or if there's another way folks would like to divvy up the chores
that's great
too
have a great weekend
see you monday
jackie
could you email the latest version around when you get a chance
thanks
best
jeff
i'm oozing with free time
monday sounds great
thanks
sure sue has filled you in
but just to be certain
my understanding is that dan douglas
attorney for wptf
is going to meet with the ag
not sure when
in an attempt to narrow the scope of the subpoena
dan also plans to begin drafting responses to the subpeona
since we are a member of wptf and therefore presumably covered by the subpoena
seems important that our attorney's coordinate with dan
sue
if i've mangled anything
let me know
best
jeff
congratulations
even though it's the eei agreement
getting edison to agree to sign something is an achievement
good luck landing deals
jeff
guess this means we support it
kidding
cool
thanks for the info
fyi
sure the desk wants the details kept confidential
but thought folks might be interested to know
rob
here's a quick and dirty list of some lessons from california that alberta may not want to repeat
steve
let me know if i've missed any messages we're using to describe california's woes
or mangled any
for that matter
if you have any questions
don't hestitate to get in touch
best
jeff
great presentation
but the message seems a little blurred
ok
it's done
got two places
one sleeps 0 and is big and is where we can have the party
the other sleeps 0 and is very close by
right on the beach
so surfing will be a must
who is on your list for invites so far
dave/sandi
fyi
in joseph's absence
his fill-in asked that i take a call yesterday from the mayor's office
they called to confirm the meeting set up for dave
mike day and bev hanson on nov
0th at 0 pm to discuss the serious electricity shortage in sf
best
jeff
chuckles is a must invite
counting on paul
i'm adding my two cents
here's 0
but not 0
few things
0
i considered that everything was
material
that reasonable
0
dylan
i struggled with the ban on preservatives
but ultimately decided it was unusual
not extraordinary
since the book sez that any write down of inventory is unusual
as opposed to extra
but a case for extra can still
be made i think
0
i did not include the 0 litigation expense associated with the ban
since it seems to me that it's merely an expense that they would have taken in 0
as opposed to a
potential litigation outcome
that they'd make an allowance for---i could be wrong
though
0
finally
i assumed that the depreciation-related gain was already included in the 0
income from continuing operations
number
and consequently included it as a footnote on my spreadsheet
rather than make it an explicit line item in the income statement
i'll look at kim's #0 and if i have any comments
i'll add them to hers and circulate
best
jeff
ok
having taken a second look at the spreadsheet i sent yesterday
here's a revised sheet
there was a math error in the original
and my adds to kim's #0
most significant issue
the discrepancy between kim's and mine is that kim's assumes that the $0,0 million includes pluses from things like dep/gain on sale
while mine assumes that it doesn't
i.e
kim subtracts them
i add them
no big deal
we just need to make an assumption and go with it
there's a couple of other differences that are identified in the answer to #0--again
just need to make the call either way
best
jeff
my understanding is the same
content looks good
message points been developed in the event they're needed
best
jeff
will have any comments to you pronto
see attached
just a couple of typos corrected in strike-out-underline
question
thought i'd included the gain on sale as
unusual
as opposed to
extraordinary
if we leave it out
are we assuming it's already included in the $0.0mm
if so
we might want to include a note at the bottom of the spreadsheet like
$0.0 mm figure includes $0,0 gain on sale of certain assets completed in 0
or am i just totally out lunch on this one
thanks
this one was a little messy
you did a great job of pulling it together
best
jeff
my suggested edits are in caps
fyi
i like it
give it one final read through for final refinements
then send to bay guardian
sf weekly
pacific sun
marin
and the east bay has a weekly mag
too
the name of which escapes me--might be out of berkeley
any of these would give good exposure
and likelihood of someone of your caliber getting in is pretty high
get better
no problem
hi
marcie
i've added two things to the end of the update
pg&e/edison sue the puc in federal court to recover procurement costs
edison files proposal with puc to declare rate freeze is over and establish a new rate freeze at 0% of old rate freeze that would last for 0 years
i don't have all the details to fill in
though some of the details might be available from the pg&e/edison websites
and sue and mona might have additional info
hope this helps
best
jeff
might be useful to observe how others react prior to responding
the good senator may have to fight over the surplus with a lot of teachers looking to spend the $$s on school books
that fight could get interesting if the backdrop for the debate is a cec report that sez
no problem
we're in charge
i'm sure we'd be willing to build a few plants for $0 billion
my pleasure
no
you're correct
in the spreadsheet
there were three sorts of
items
discontinued ops
unusual items
extraordinary items
and accounting changes
the sale of the assets came about in the attempt to
trim the fat
or manage earnings
you make the call
here's the line item from my spreadsheet
it came right after the entries for the
unusual loss from the government ban
i included it with the
unusual
items
right after discontinued ops and right before extraordinary items
big question is
is it included already
i assumed not
since
though it's confusing
the problem makes is sound like none of the additional
agenda items
were accounted for
i don't think it's a huge deal
though
the questions left a lot of room for ambiguity
best
jeff
i agree completely
which is why i think the *$
*#-ed case is confusing
let it go
leave as is
think about it no more
see you tonite
jeff
great time
thanks a million
sorry i had to do homework for some of it
what would you like me to cook/bring for friday
i make a mean oyster stuffing
and my homemade cranberry sauce is ok
too
just let me know
fyi
ok
i don't put my stuffing in the bird
the more cranberries the better
yours truly
jeff
p.s
how did pittsburg lose
i don't get it
what does she want to do
i know
these performance reviews may push me right over the edge
good talking to you earlier
sounded like the paul i know and admire
you sounded energized
looking forward to having you around more
one thing
please don't count december out as a possible start time for the special session
anything can happen
book your hotel room early
best
jeff
there's a place for working and re-working
there's also a a very important place in art--writing in particular--for spontaneity and whim
i'd do a tweak here and a snip there
but quickly and only around the edges
and submit it as a film review
it's novel
it's fun
and exposure'd a good thing
things are good
going to be weary for the next 0-0 weeks until schools out
though
best
jeff
rick
just want to let you know that i missed the boat a bit in coordinating my reviewers with paul
in my first attempt to input them in the system
i hesitated including you for the simple reason that i'm certain you have countless other reviews to do already
and
frankly
i feel that you're an integral part of my review whether you're formally on the list or not
when i went back to make my final additions to the list
the systerm was already closed--paul had approved the first round
which i guess shuts it down
it's likely not appropriate for reviews to happen outside the system
but i wanted to let you know that
from my perspective
it would be great to receive from you
i'd value it a lot
and i think we've worked closely enough together over the last year for you to have a basis for reviewing me
but again
i'm of the view that irrespective of the list
you partake in my review of necessity
and i don't want to add any additional burdens to an already loaded schedule
no big deal
just wanted to let you know
and i'm having a field day filling out your review
rick discriminates unfairly against neon-colored shirts
seriously
i was quite pleasantly surprised to have ended up as one of your reviewers
best
jeff
i threw out the green shirt
swear to god
it's a never-ending cavalcade
here's the report that sue referenced earlier
appears that the administration's analysis of california's energy problems will continue to focus solely on the
bad actor
conspiracy theory
congratulations
and count me in
we're off to the races
best
jeff and a very happy thanksgiving
here's what i need
thanks
honey
0 bags of fresh cranberries 0 oranges box of brown sugar 0 jars of oysters 0 loaves of bread
get the
rounds
of bread---vary them
like olive bread
sour dough
sweet
whole grain
potato
thing of celery 0 large yellow onions couple bulbs of garlic 0 pounds of butter
clover
salted
thanks
sweetie
and good luck on your midterm
forgive the tardiness
as soon as i come up from air from completing a tidal wave of performance reviews
i'll give a full report
bottom line
his message is a very good one
his delivery could use a tad spicing up
however
unfortunately
when i was free
he was in meetings
and vice versa
so we never got to sit down and chat
i'll fill you in more soon
best
jeff
i can attest to the fact that you hit the bulls-eye
dead center
sir
with your description
but again
the message is great
and his written stuff
i think
is effective
your decision to help fund his participation was an extremely good one in the end
best
jeff
don't hesitate to call and discuss further the
hard lessons
that i sent you
i may want to amend the iso rfp numbers just a wee bit
too
before
and if
you use them
best
jeff
doesn't strictly qualify as an origination opportunity
but through a contact
i've met with some folks who have some pretty nifty network hardware/software that offers some interesting possibilities w/respect to network performance
optical routing technology
i'd like to hook them up with network folks
both a technical and a commercial person
anyone suggestions
thanks
best
jeff
i'm forever indebted
best
jeff
if possible
that would be perfect
and greatly appreciated
could you please follow up with stephanie and let her know that i'd like to review
thanks very much
sorry stephanie
i meant to send the previous note to joseph
bet you're having fun
are there comments that accompany alan's tech piece
thanks
would it be a violation of interstate commerce to keep press from alberta from crossing the border into the states
ok
i'm on for stuffing and cranberry sauce
sure this is just what you needed
best of luck
best
jeff
neat
don't worry
i'm excited to cook
i'll try to do it in advance
but if i can't
i'll need to cook at your place
that ok
see you soon
best
jeff
p.s
it's 0:0 pm
i'd leave a voicemail with sandi
she's taking voicemail on her trip
and ask her if she'd like for you to contact them
got your message
a hearty congratulations on the portland general approval from ferc
i'm chained to my desk doing reviews
best
jeff
alberta
i'm not sure which is worse
the story
or the timing
you psyched about the ferc approval
and is there a story behind the sale of sierra's power plants
now wait one darn minute
lil
lady
do you hear john wayne's voice
the price cap in california remains--that's right
remains--at a lofty $0/mwh
thank you
government affairs
seriously
seems reportable
given that at one point it had moved to a time-differentiated cap
plz try me again
thx,jeff 0.0.0
agree that we should decline to participate
i also got a call from iep regarding the press conference and strongly encouraged them to signicantly diversify the group to include customers
consumer groups
and the like
haven't heard about the meeting on the first with the governor's staff
interesting that the administration is choosing to meet with folks on the day that the report is released
for the same reasons that we wouldn't want to be grouped with generators at a press conference
we may not want to be grouped with generators when the staff disseminates the report's words of wisdom
if there is a deal shaping up
it's happening by and large through the auspices of iep
we've thus far decided to maintain an arm's length relationship with iep
choosing not to get too close to the generators
if we want to influence any deal they cut
we'll need to assess how closely aligned/associated with them we want to be
further we distance ourselves
less likely we'll be cut in
that said
sue and i have been participating in iep's
interminable
conference calls and actively weighing in to influence what they do
there was considerable discussion on the last call about developing some sort of
price cap
proposal that could form the basis of a deal
but no discussion whatsoever regarding refunds of any kind
there were differences of opinion about the benefits of doing a deal on a cap----williams is dead set against it
dynegy
reliant seemed considerably more pliable
we reminded folks that there are many other things apart from caps that california could do to
fix
the problem
e.g
site plants
forward contracts
retail market
core/noncore split
etc
which might obviate the need for caps altogether
we also recognized the political nature of the situation and expressed a willingness to discuss a cap that might be acceptable
but pointed out our general concerns with caps
that last meeting provided the impetus for the 0th press conference
at which
hopefully
a large number of stakeholders with urge the governor and the puc to get off the dime and do something concrete that can help---develop a rational policy for forward contracting by the ious and abandon the
puc as counterparty
policy that currently exists
again
haven't heard a peep about any deal on refunds
will check around
though
best
jeff
i'll check with smutney
can you two check with your dynegy and reliant contacts in houston
i'm available

lawmaker pushes for state energy reserve california state sen
steve peace called for the state to set aside $0 billion of a projected $0 billion budget surplus to create a reserve account to serve the state,senergy needs
a representative at peace,s office said the senator planned the fund as a
cushion0 to help the state bounce back from energy price shocks like those that hit it lastsummer
peace
speaking monday at a briefing on the upcoming state budget
suggestethat the california legislature set aside $0 billion to use at a later date
the funds could be included in the budget that gov
gray davis is scheduled to announce jan
0
ostensibly
the government could use the funds to purchase some of the state,s transmission grid angeneration assets
or to build new assets
in his remarks
peace said some of the $0 billion could be used to build a0-mw generation facility
which he estimates at $0 million
a peaker that could be set upfor $0 million
or a transmission grid such as the $0 million system a california utilityhas proposed for the southern part of the state
the use of public dollars to finance development
private-public partnerships
or to capitalize publicly owned utilities are all options which california policymakers mayhave to consider if
ferc
is unable to bring wholesale energy markets under control,0 he said
still
representatives at the senator,s office stressed that peace was nmaking any policy decisions in his statement
rather
a representative said
peace was actingin his capacity as chairman of the senate budget and fiscal committee and setting aside fundsthat can be available for future use
peace,s initiative comes on the heels of a report by the legislature,legislative analysis office forecasting a $0.0 billion surplus for fiscal years 0-0
a $0billion surplus for 0-0 and a $0.0 billion surplus for 0-0
what's the latest tally in florida
it gets increasingly important every time richardson opens his gawd-fersaken mouth
unless loretta lynch
or worse

you going to distribute that spreadsheet
and when do we need to regroup
happy thanksgiving
i'll report by on my conversations with mike
best
jeff
thank you
hey
just wanted to let you know that i've received all the sdg&e stuff and that you can count on me to completely drop the ball
kidding
i'll take care of it
i'm still awash in reviews and may not ever leave the building
which is why i'm not responding as promptly as i should
best
jeff
jim
have a great thanksgiving with your family
it's a great pleasure doing business with you
best
jeff
well
this shows the direction in which the
new
commission is heading
the very good news
though
is that tw's proposal was included in both settlements
now that's hedging
thus
the benefits to tw were preserved under both proposals
congratulations
that's fantastic--hard work that paid off
we will of course express out extreme dissappointment with the pd
and point out that this decision condemns california to a 0th century infrastructure
when the state's 0st century economy demands much
much better
we should discuss
since the pd empowers the likes of norm and florio
it will be important to play very close attention to implementation of hector
sorry to have to be the one to deliver the news
but we have a knack of making lemonade out of lemons and we'll do out best to do the same here
whatever turns up at the end
best
jeff
monday--la w/s
kean re
meeting w/gov's staff tuesday--in office thurs/fri--houston re
ebs meetings
are you offering a finder's fee
i'm cheap
thanks
all
i'll get a compiled answer out later today
aleck
i'll take a look at it
if i have any comments
i'll forward them along
also
i may forward along some very slight changes to the numbers on the iso's rfp
experience
should you decide you want to incorporate those
lessons
into your presentation
i'll provide any amendments to those numbers by tomorrow
best
jeff
ok folks
here it is
sorry for the delay
but those pesky questions ended up being more detailed than i anticipated
please take a quick look and let me know if there are any comments---more ambiguities than usual in this one
i'll await comments and finalize this evening
jimmie/dylan--my apologies
but last wednesday evening
i found out that i have to be in la for a meeting tomorrow
if i make it to class at all tomorrow
i won't get there until after the break
could one of you print out the case and bring it to class
if not
don
t sweat it
i'll email him an electronic and turn in a hard copy to him on tuesday
sorry for any hassle
best
jeff
thanks
i'll soften the expropriation language
i don't think they can disclose the $0 million on the product liability case
since the entire package appears to be one negotation
all the pieces of which likely have to be agreed to
or no settlement
but you're point's well taken and i'll try to acount for it in the answer
finally
i can't see disclosing the fact that i'm infringing on someone's patent in my annual report
seems like i'd have a hard time defending myself in court if they sued me
if i'd admitted it to it in my annual report
if i don't see you tomorrow
have a good week
see you at the freight
best
greetings professor
i'm in charge of managing our collective responses to this week's case and have been called out of town on business at the last minute
as a result
if i make it to class at all tomorrow
i unfortunately won't make it until after the break
while i think one of my teammates will bring a hard copy to class tomorrow
i wanted to plan for any mix-ups
contingencies
by emailing a copy as well
best
jeff
folks
here's the final
i incorporated some comments from christine and emailed a copy to aceves
jimmie/dylan let me know if one of you can bring a hard copy to class tomorrow
if not
he's now got an electronic copy
and i'll drop off a hard copy on tuesday
hope to see you
for at least half the class
tomorrow
best
jeff
you're the man
i got some comments from christine
sort of
see most recent email
i emailed it to aceves
but if more changes come in
i don't see any problem telling him to disregard the email and use the hard copy you turn in tomorrow
thanks a million
greatly appreciated
i owe you one
this one was really a hot potato
first kim
then me
now you
best
jeff
$0 million
p.s
the plant i was talking about is
hairy vetch
or
purple vetch
i'll look for some

if you find any
make sure it's

and hasn't had any chemicals added to the seeds
thanks again for a fantastic time over thanksgiving
i had a lot of fun
ferget it
folks
let me throw out a proposal
i believe that we should immediately draft a very brief letter or press release that explains why the pd is misguided and will lead to very bad energy policy for the state
and why our settlement is the right one and why it's good energy policy for the state
the letter should be signed by everyone who signed the settlement
it needs to be released by the end of this week
absent this kind of action
nothing's going to turn this thing around
spending time and money writing
comments
will be a waste of time and money
we'll need to do a lot more
but i think we have to start this way or fold up our tents now
thoughts

jeff
greetings linda
let me open by saying welcome
and by apologizing for the fact that california has probably made your first days on the job a bit crazy
just wanted to pass along some info
i'm sure you've seen senator feinstein's comments to ferc
and i think you're aware that she held a meeting in california with a group of stakeholders
including davis staff
on the day before ferc's recent workshop at which steve testified
she stated at the meeting that she is thinking seriously about sponsoring legislation to place a price cap on the entire wscc market
economists in the room expressed their strong misgivings about caps
but feinstein seemed fairly focused on at least sponsoring some sort of legislation
not sure where it will go
but wanted to pass it along
best
jeff
i'm not buying and goddam banjo
i can't stand the noise those freakin
things make
ferget it
we kid
i think that's it's a swell idea
you can totally count me in on pitching in
i'm declaring bankruptcy after this birthday
let's talk more tonite about the big day
i have class
but should be over there by 0:0 or so
best
my apologies
linda
sometimes it pays to see what name pops up from the enron address book before hitting the send button
and thanks

not sure
but i assume that the bluegrass songbook is mine

i'll need to ponder
i'll try to get back to you pronto
fyi
we have this report
hi david
thought that you might be interested
best
jeff
well
he launched today
have you seen the materials from the press conference that he launched today
i think this is actually a good thing--makes our proposal look like a much more preferable alternative by comparison
makes our support in the process more important
and sets harvey up as the ralph nader equivalent in the election to fix california's broken system---a potential spoiler
hi
well
wouldn't you know it
i'm not driving tonite
but i bet that we could hitch a ride back with anil
i'm not sure
but i think that he's got class tonite
too
i'll search him out before class or after that break and see if i can set it up
oh come on
i heard that you're a ghost writer for harvey's proposal
kidding
seriously
it's been great discussing these issues on panels with you lately
i have a picture of the two of us from the berkeley conference i'll pass along to you
i really think there's a way out of all this without dropping a nuclear bomb on all of the hard work folks have done thus far to restructure the industry
look forward to working on it
best
jeff p.s
don't have too much fun dangling the initiative in front of the likes of peace and the ious
hi aleck
how did your talk go
i hope well
if you're refering to the px study on whether to have an
as-bid
or
single-price
auction
the px is in the preliminary stages of having a report prepared
what they've done is assemble a
blue ribbon
panel of economists
as reported in the press accounts you've seen
to examine the issue and report back
i'm not aware of a report having yet been completed by the panel and submitted to the px
have you heard differently
i'll poke around
best
jeff
thanks
delaney
see you on friday
quick comment
though just about everything's uncertain these days
folks seem to think that legislators are likely to get very active just as soon as they arrive in sacramento
next week
seems that a key--if not dominant--part of the agenda ought to be how this group can
quickly
come to agreement on a comprehensive solution that it can offer to the legislature and the governor as a pragmatic and positive way out
sure you folks are very focused on this
but it struck me that the agenda looks pretty ambitious for a 0-hour meeting
in any case
just a thought that i wanted to share
thanks and can't thank you enough for all your efforts
best
jeff
here is cleca's
barbara barkovich's
current thinking
left a message
sense is likely won't release till post-press conference
will keep trying
jeff
hmmmm
i think you're right
looks like the more we can get done tonite
the better
perhaps
if we can wrap the analysis up this evening
we can do some serious divvying up of assigments at the end of the meeting
then folks can go off and complete the assignments between now and sunday
which should make sunday's activities pretty light
that make any sense
best

hi
thanks for the note
couple of things
prentice is going to do xmas with us this year cuz her family will be out of town
so we should absolutely include her
but i think she really wants to be included in the
picking
so that she gets someone's name
if you'd like to pick the names and let people know
i'm completely comfortable with that
confidentially
i have a great idea for mike
so if
by chance
i get him as a pick
that would be great
also
let me throw this out
you know that if i didn't live in a 0-bedroom apartment
i'd host
and hopefully
we'll be having xmas at my place in mendocino a few years down the road
steve and charry really carry the load all the time
have you considered opening presents and having dinner at your place
i'd be happy to take care of the meal
and hang around to clean up afterwards
no big deal
just a thought
alternatively
we could absolutely have it at prentice's apartment
which is plenty big enough
and will have a big beautiful tree
etc
so give that a thought
might be nice to do it in the city
and we'd be happy to host it there
too
now
the important stuff
what do katie and michael want/need for xmas
best
jeff

thanks a bunch
see you tomorrow
delaney hunter
please respond to dhunter
fyi
in bizarre times
help can sometimes come from bizarre places
granted
we're likely to disagree strongly with hogan's continued obsession with poolco
but the discussion in his paper regarding market power may be helpful---i've read the joskow paper
but haven't yet had a chance to review the hogan piece
steve and i discussed the need to do a focused assessment of the joskow/kahn
analysis
remember it's ed kahn
not alfred kahn
seems that it would be very useful to fold into that analysis any useful stuff on market power included in the paper done by hogan
co
if
in the end
there ain't nothing useful
so be it
but seems like there's little downside to exploring it
jim
my understanding is that alan is already working with the fundamentals folks on the portland desk to deconstruct the joskow paper
might want to include the hogan paper in those discussions and might also be useful to pull seabron adamson into the thinking
too
ultimately
may be preferable to have any assessment of joskow and/or hogan to come from economists
rather than directly from us
best
jeff
you're fired
at this point
yes
that's sort of how i feel about it
unless someone can come up with some damned good reasons to do otherwise
you bet
got your and fran's messages
if you'd like to discuss by phone
i'm in all day
otherwise
i suggest that we do take the following next steps
just as soon as you have the proposal and list of participants drafted
which i hope will be very soon
please forward to me
then
as quickly as possible
i'd like to have a meeting to discuss and finalize the proposal
it would be very useful if laura tyson could be in on that final meeting
and
of course
any other of the participants that you'd like to invite
we're are somewhat behind the eight ball due to the delays thus far in getting this thing off the ground
if we're going to do it
it's going to have to come together quickly
and the report will have to be developed very quickly
too
hope that will be possible
i'm assuming at this point that you and i are proceeding ahead absent mitch and carl
since they have sensitive issues with their clients that we can't seem to overcome
and i'll inquire about the need for expert witnesses in the class action suit and get back to you
best
jeff
no
you're fired
but you have to stay
could you please print this out for me
greatly indebted
man
do i owe you a phone call
please don't hold it against me

you know

had a great time at the conference
thanks for inviting me
i have a comment about the proposed decision if you'd like it

what time do you need it
and can i just email it to you
it'll be quite brief and to the point

yep
thanks
that is music to my ears
can't tell you how much you're help is valued
really would like to discuss this further
and a hearty congratulations on the promotion

i don't recall agreeing to any of this

yep

it always gets darkest before the light
that's what eric said about the red outfit that kari dohn was wearing on monday

hi sue
i hope the packing and other move-related things are going well---i know that something invariably happens that creates havoc
good luck
i haven't wanted to bug you too much with all that's going on
so i thought i'd give you a quick update
scott and bowen and i talked re
getting authority for ebs to dig dirt and install some facilities in california
with some effort
we persuaded scott that having dinner with loretta lynch
well
wasn't going to do get the job done
though scott's not yet completely convinced
instead
scott's going to get from the network folks substantially more detail on precisely what the project entails
once we've got that
we can meet with commission staff and take their temperature on what sort of approval hoops we'd need to jump through in order to get authority to do the project
and what the time frame for approval would look like
scott agrees with this approach
he's going to try to get more info from the network folks in portland
we likely will regroup to figure out
next steps
right after the first of the year
have any thoughts on this approach
i do plan on coming every thursday to the group meetings
however
this thursday is my girlfriend's birthday
and her parents
who live in the area
have had a little
special event
planned for the past 0 months
consequently
i will have to miss the ga xmas party
which i'm very disappointed about----i really enjoy getting a chance to catch up with everyone
i'll also therefore have to participate in thursday's call by phone
apologies
but i'm sticking to the tried and true rule
family and relationships first
hope all is well
best
jeff
today mona and i attended a meeting of the
california energy solutions group
formerly the ab 0 implementation group
but for the issues discussed below
there's not much else to report from the meeting other than folks engaged in a good deal of posturing
at our urging
the group decided to form a
subcommittee
comprised of a subset of the group
the group will work quickly to develop a
strawperson
proposal to present to the larger group for consideration
the goal is to quickly arrive at a
settlement
ideally by year end
or sooner---that everyone can agree to and offer up to davis
legislators
etc
our
reward
for coming up with the idea is the requirement that we serve on the
committee
in addition to us
the other people on the committee are
eve elsesser will chair the committee---cogen types john fielder---edison mike florio--turn bill booth---cleca carolyn mcintyre---sempra aaron thomas--aes
retail
tony braun--munis ralph cavanagh--nrdc john flory--calpx it is clear that one of the key issues is devising the
benchmark
that the cpuc can use to judge the reasonableness of utility purchases---similar to the model used for utility procurement on the gas side
chris calger is in the office working on the power plant deals and i briefly discussed with him ways of devising a politically palatable
commercially defensible benchmark
we came up with some ideas that he suggested i pursue further with bob badeer
chris foster and tim belden
which i'll do on monday
the first meeting of the subcommittee is on tuesday
if possible
i'd like to add the
benchmark
and
committee
issues to our agenda for tuesday's meeting
best
jeff
greetings
we are getting considerable traction with the idea of using a
benchmark
to judge utility purchases
similar in concept to what's in place on the gas side
to oversimplify it
0
set the benchmark 0
the utility buys for consumers and tries to beat the benchmark 0
if
at the end of the year
the utility has beat the benchmark
it shares the profits with consumers
if the benchmark wins
the utility shares the losses with consumers 0
the puc performs no
after-the-fact
reasonableness
no
second-guessing
california likes the idea and is now looking to enron to come up with what the benchmark ought to be
i talked to calger a bit about it today and he suggested that i get together with you guys
as always
time's short
are you available on monday
thanks
jeff
she was at attention
throughout the meeting
thanks very much
doug
apologies
i've had to focus a bit on the finance project
and slogging through the case has been long and painful
i'll have my responses to 0-0 to kim later this afternoon
i didn't get an email on german gaap from the professor
here's the exec sum draft that distributed hard copies of today
it's going to change quite a bit based on today's work
i'll try to turn it around by tomorrow for folks to look at
ditto
christine
i've proposed some edits
for what they're worth

i have a conflict in the morning
but could join by conference calling beginning at 0 pm
is that possible
if not
no big deal
i
like ralph
will catch up at the next meeting
and submit our ideas to eve between now and then
let me know
and i agree with ralph re
staying focused on the most urgent issues
best
jeff
very glad to here that things have gone well thus far
i'm keeping my fingers crossed that the good luck continues
if we don't talk between now and thursday
we'll talk then
best
jeff
not sure that you were on the email list for this
who's
chris fair
i don't think that's you
great
how's 0 pm today
i think at this point
any more changes
and we're going to blow our collective brains out
but here's a question
what interest rate did we use to calculate the interest the county receives on its
ending balance
ted
you likely have a much better feel for this
but should it be something like the 0-month commercial paper rate
or something
did we use the 0-year treasury
again
i think we likely ought leave the thing along at this point
but thought i'd throw it out there
tell me that it doesn't matter
please
and ted
i thought we agreed that the interest rate was 0.0
kidding
jackie
good luck with schwab
i'll keep my fingers and toes crossed
best
jeff
i agree
my expectations for the new
california energy solutions group

no more than
one more page
new yorker reviews henry moss in this week's issue
haven't read it yet
did you guys like it
cameron
what's the name of the bandwidth exchange firm that you guys did your deal with
bandwidth exchange
i
m brain dead
got your message re
reverse auction all of the utility's demand
getting
interestingly complicated
though
now
the utilities want to create a
core/noncore
split in electricity
like in gas
where large gas customers can't take commodity from the utility
with a core/noncore split
edison claims that qf contracts
nukes and other existing generation that it still holds is sufficient to meet
core
needs and it therefore may not need
contracts
as you can imagine
large customers ain't clamoring to get thrown into the market as
noncore
customers right about now
but they may find themselves without a choice
i talked to calger on friday about reverse auction versus benchmark and i'll be talking to the traders about it this afternoon
and we'll be discussing further when rick
steffes et al are here tomorrow
will let you know where it goes
best
jeff
talk to you then
hi michelle
guess who
just went into ehronline and noticed that under vacation it sez that i'm entitled to 0 hours of vacation
and that i've used 0 hours
leaving 0
i think that i'm actually entitled to more than 0 hours
please tell me that i am
thanks very much
signed
desperately in need of vacation also
i clicked on deferral enrollment
and by-golly if i couldn't find the election form to download
am i just clueless
or is there another place that i need to look for it
thanks a million
sounds good
thanks
we should talk more about the perfect deal----if it's still something that you think is worth pursuing
you didn't think henry moss was the cat's meow
did you
i think that you're wondering is right on target
hi
though i'll miss the meeting
if it's over by 0 pm
i'll be able to give you our ideas on the agenda items tomorrow
if there's anything else
just let me know
best
jeff
please keep this confidential at this point
it's the agenda for the california
subcommittee
meeting on tuesday that i mentioned in an earlier note
they were unable to reschedule the meeting
which starts at 0 am tomorrow
but we're on the subcommitte and will have very good access to the final product
so i'm not too concerned about missing the
kickoff
meeting
folks in california are really looking to us to help figure out item #0
forward contracting
it would be very useful to discuss this outline tomorrow while we're all together
best
jeff
good point
if you'd like to include it in this draft
i'm fine with that---we certainly have been very vocal about the need to reform it
alternatively
we could discuss with the larger group tomorrow whether we weigh in heavily and if so what our exact message ought to be
either way works for me
just let me know
thanks
my assumption is that
with respect to power plant siting and what we ought to do
you'll take the lead tomorrow
does it make sense for now to leave a
placeholder
under that one and we can discuss further tomorrow
or would you prefer to put a specific item in there now
like
legislature should revisit last session's streamlining bill
you're cash flow spreadsheet is freakin
awesome
nice job
can you please call me
i'm trying to input the numbers from the spreadsheet into the exec sum
and have a question
thanks
0.0.0
thank you so much
really sorry to bother you so much
just had a long internal meeting
over the next 0 hours
we're going to try to simulate on california a potential solution we devised in the meeting
no sense in offering something up if we don't know what the numbers look like
at least in a
ball park
sense
i should be able to get you something fairly concrete by end of day tomorrow or first thing wednesday
that work
have fun tomorrow
best
jeff
that sounds like a very reasonable way to proceed
attached is a very rough draft of solutions/messages for discussion at tomorrow's meeting
i'll bring hard copies to the meeting
ok
here they are
on exhibit a
i didn't touch numbers are exhibit #s
also
i deleted capm
since we ain't got anything yet
and i deleted the part that said
ticket sales taxes don't matter much
because now that we have the numbers they could matter
cuz it's really tight between bond payments and tax revs
anyway
that's it
i checked and doubled checked the numbers and exihibit #s in the exec sum
but you may want to give one last peek
thanks so much for pulling it together
best
jeff
hi mary
well
the problem is likely just that i'm dense
i log in
click on deferral and find a description of what one needs to do
i.e
fill out the form
but i've surfed around the site a bit and can't seem to find the form
am i
probably
missing something
thanks a bunch
best
jeff
many thanks
mary
and michelle
i'm indebted
as always
if you don't hear from me
that means all went well
i'm on your man
what do you need
0 am pst
i'll try to be on but can't promise
can we have a quick call
i.e
no more than 0 minutes
at 0 am
pst
on monday to discuss
you getting this stuff
will be at both meetings and will have detailed proposals beforehand
we continue to work on procurement piece and have reached teh same conclusion as you in your note---need something to implement now
as well as a
longer
term solution to iou procurement
you'll be hearing from me
yes
thank you
see you tonite
folks
the
subcommittee
i've referenced that's trying to come up with a solution to california's train wreck is moving very quickly
the group's shooting to have a first cut at a
straw person
proposal sketched out by end of next week
the group's meeting on tuesday to continue to bounce around ideas
i'd like to try to have an internal call on monday at either 0 am
pst
or 0 pm
pst
to pin down at least a vaguely detailed conceptual framework that i can propose to the subcommittee on tuesday
the agenda items for the internal meeting are
finalize proposal for benchmark
s
for utility procurement
goal
increase utility willingness to enter into forward contracts by replacing puc after-the-fact
reasonableness
review with a benchmark
been working the portland desk on a
portfolio benchmark
concept
determine our view of how to treat term contracts w.r.t
the px credit
i.e
should those contracts be disclosed to the market
or should puc keep them confidential
calculate the px credit behind closed doors
and publish the credit ex poste
the px credit depends on the overall utility portfolio
not just the px price
let me know if 0 am or 0 pm
pst
works better
harry
i'll assume that you'll contact the folks from ees that need to participate
best
jeff
mark
i don't know how any
concerns
i may have raised reached you
but rest assured that there are no worries from my end
i saw the piece on the local news
vacar's on a one-person crusade to kill capitalism
that's certain
it was very clear that you were taken horribly out of context
and they did you a great disservice
just between us chickens
it did come up as if you were implying that there's some reasonable likelihood that manipulation's the culprit
you can imagine just how sensitive we are to that issue
but i don't think that you should sweat it
in a very brief conversation with mike day i mentioned the piece and that they got you responding to manipulation
i.e
when'd you stop beating your wife
on camera
so agitated was i that i didn't even bother to bring it up with herr fawcett
so again
thanks much for the note
but no big deal
now for my two cents
question
what's the problem
answer
very bad state energy policy---and here are the five big regulatory problems standing in the way of a solution for california
market manipulation
well
those charges are raised in every industry
whenever prices spike
the lion's share of the time
it turns out to be market fundamentals
appreciate your note
thanks
jeff
perhaps you were a little strong in relaying my concerns to someone
congratulations
condolences
anyway
let's talk
today's bad
you in tomorrow
thanks very much dave
we've got the proposal
and we've got a few issues with it
i know that you're swamped managing ees
book
etc
so i'd be happy to fill dave in on ees
view of cleca's proposal
the negotiations that are underway generally
and what we're cooking up to try to help the negotitations along
just let me know
also
dave
be happy to talk to hanson
and fill them in one what's going on out there if that would be useful

distributed power
the next big investment
with today's electricity demand expanding beyond the reach of available supply
and nationwide electric deregulation efforts providing inconsistent results
distributed power just may be the next big thing
according to bear stearns analyst robert winters
with technology-laden
electricity-hungry companies popping up every time you turn around
and blackouts and brownouts occurring more frequently as large power grids are becoming less reliable
the analyst points towards distributed energy services as a possible solution
and maybe the
next big investment opportunity for the coming decade
in winters
0 page report
distributed energy services-the world's power and transportation industries
set for a revolution-part 0
he examines technologies and companies within the distributed energy services sector that might be able to take advantage of the current situation
thanks to major technological advances and energy deregulation
a wave of new investment in the power industry has just begun
we believe that this coming era in the power industry could resemble the wave of investments which flooded into the telecommunications industry following the breakup of at&t in the early 0's
said winters
companies and municipalities need to find ways to ensure the availability of high quality
reliable power
added winters
according to his research
microturbines are the best positioned of the
new
technologies that would be able to have an immediate impact on electric generation
he based his recommendation on the fact that microturbines are small
quiet
efficient and very versatile
they can be used as a main power source
a back-up power source or as an alternative when there is a spike in traditional energy prices
the analyst said
microturbines can also be used in remote locations
including developing countries
that do not have access to electricity
another attractive feature of microturbines is their fuel requirements
the units often use natural gas
but can also use several other fuels as well
in the study
the analyst also examined fuel cells
flywheel technology
and existing reciprocating engines technologies such as diesel engines and stirling engines
which he noted are enjoying a comeback
in addition to the report
winters initiated coverage on two distributed energy companies
he labeled active power
a company that is pioneering flywheel technology
as a
buy
and capstone turbine corp
a leading manufacturer of microturbines
as
attractive
the companies are in addition to two fuel cell companies he currently follows
ballard power is currently a buy
and plug power is rated neutral
thanks very much for the info

folks
as you recall from out meeting on tuesday
we decided that i'd pull together a brief description of our key priorities and the actions underway to achieve them
the status report will be updated weekly
we'll use the weekly update as an important internal communication tool to keep folks abreast of activities and developments in ca
it will also serve as a a tool to help identify the need to modify our priorities and/or actions in light of ever-changing circumstances
we were going to try to get the first report out this week
but with the meeting in houston
sue's doctor appt and karen's meetings with marathon
we'll get the first one out monday
my notes suggest that
today's
key priorities---understanding that everything's subject to change on a daily basis---are
no refunds end wholesale price caps as soon as possible get forward markets working in ca expedite plant siting no early roll of/maintain the rate freeze
till ~0/0
maintain current px credit framework
till ~0/0
please forward to me the actions underway and planned in the area for which you've been designated
lead
given how fluid things are
it seems prudent to limit
planned
items to those we've got planned for the next 0-0 weeks
i'll compile for distribution by cob monday
my notes show the following leads
also please let me know if my notes w.r.t
leads is consistent with yours
thanks very much and have a great weekend
best
jeff
rick
jim
harry
you will have the first status report for california by cob on monday
we will update that report weekly
if there's anything you need between now and monday
please let me know
have a good weekend
best
jeff fyi
yesterday
the california puc rejected the utilities request to
among other things
raise rates and end the rate freeze
the status quo prevails
at least for now
well
you two really raised the bar with that celebration
it was just fantastic
prentice said it's the best birthday she's ever had
thanks so much for everything
it was really neat
the votes have been counted
kidding
and the call will take place today at 0 pm pst
call-in number to follow
could you please set up a call and distribute to this list
topic
utility forward contracting proposal
time 0-0:0 pm pst
thanks very much
sounds very good
might be useful to get a
reputable
economist to write a paper that 0
describes traditional means for defining
identifying and mitigating market power
0
compares those with the
new
means folks are coming up with these days
and 0
comments on the
split
in the academic community over the issues
when steve kean and i discussed the notion initially
thought it might be a good idea to gently
pile on
to the public discussion with the goal of making clear 0
just how complex this issue is and 0
how important it will be to have a thorough analysis
say
about 0+ months worth
before rushing to judgment on anything joskow might allege in his paper

jeff
i believe that on thursday/friday
you sent a note with some suggestions on proposed solutions
darned if i can find it
could you resend it
or
in the flurry of activity
am i mistaken
and the last dispatch i got from you was the note you sent on the 0th
apologies
jeff
i've been buried
what did we hear from ferc last week
was that from larcamp's their visit to houston
i ain't forgot
your proposal is a
touchy
one
and let's just say that it's required some nimble dancing in the attempt to gauge where folks sit
if you get my drift
i'm still on the case
however
who's on so far

please forward the letter to jeff

jeff
given the messy spot that sdg&e in particular and socalgas find themselves in due to what's happened to gas prices at the cal border
it might not be a bad time to check in with our friend neil schmally
sp
at sempra to see how enron might help
in case folks haven't already heard through other sources
a reliable person told me that pg&e is hedged for core gas requirements
financial--for 0% of core volumes at prices
in the single digits/decatherm
physical--for 0% of core volumes
via storage
at prices
less than the financial hedge
sdg&e is naked
socalgas is likely in the same boat as sdg&e
or worse
since they optioned core's storage gas to noncore customers
and
those customers are exercising
you're a star
i owe ya
next time you're in town
let me know in advance
maybe we can have lunch or something
hope all is well
best
jeff
ok
you and i are the last ones to get the info
here it is
good luck
only if it's not a bother
you're very sweet to forward along
you must feel great being done
can't wait
talked to eric
he'll give kari a ring and pass along message
best
jeff
paul
here's additional info for the
curtailment
data that we're pulling together
utility pricing for core gas customers prior to the month in question
the utility forecasts gas prices based on nymex monthly prices
so for example
based on november's forecast
the utility sets prices to be charged to core consumers in december
when december's over
the utility compares forecast prices with actual prices
if the forecast was too low
and there's an undercollection
the utility will increase january's price forecast by
just enough
to make up for the december undercollection
if prices were too high and there's an overcollection
the utility will reduce january price forecast by just enough to refund the overcollection
if the overcollection/undercollection is very large
the utilities have generally spread out the
true-up
over several months to avoid
rate shock
one way or the other
however
under the current circumstances
the utilities may be less willing to spread it out
and may wish to recover the entire undercollection in the following month
in short
there's at least a one-month lag in customer prices to account for differences in forecasts versus actual
refer such calls to karen denne in houston
thanks
i don't want to create an hassles
don't feel like you have to get the thing all fixed up by friday if it not's a cake walk
eldon sellers
please respond to eldon
if all goes well
i'll have some info to distribute before the meeting regarding forward purchases
i'll be ready to discuss it at the meeting
too
professor berk
very interesting to hear the perspectives of a south african ex-pat last evening
today's been very hectic
but i'll get back to you on the possibility of having enron sponsor internships for the financial engineering program
until we've had a chance to talk
could you wait before forwarding my name along to anyone else in the fin eng group
much appreciated
best
jeff
thanks---couldn't agree more on the
crisis here
need education

the more we educate folks
the more they agree with our views and positions
bed situation is as follows
everyone will be naked and in the same bed
your parents may excuse themselves if they wish
i'll be there round 0:0
that would work for me
and presumably rory and co
could come then
too
can the deal bench presentation be distributed publicly
i'd like to use it in the
subcommittee
meetings i mentioned last week as a means to a solution for california's reasonableness review morass
left a message with kahn late last evening
haven't heard back yet
will let you know
best
jeff
frank's number at luntz research companies is 0.0.0
for video info
ask steve kean
will do
but rory
who by the way is responsible for this mess
now has decided that he'd like to do a xmas
make up
on the 0th
which is smack dab in the middle of when we'll be up at the dome
tween xmas and new year's--hopefully you and eldon will join us so we can kick yer butts in spades
so the 0th is very bad
as you can imagine
if we could do the 0th
that would be great
when's your plane leave on the 0th
do surf shops rent wet suits
you think i can rent one from live water
yes
do we have a call-in number yet

that work
for today's noon call
when you open
answer
disable macros
to first prompt

no
to question about links
there are three portfolio scenarios that i'd be happy to discuss very quickly during the call
fyi
as you know
we're attempting to find a solution to the
reasonable review
morrass that's impeding utility forward contracting
for that effort
we've worked with the portland desk to pull together some educational materials to use with a subset of california stakeholders that's trying to devise a solution to california's melt down
the attached graphs show 0 scenarios for the state as a whole
0
do nothing
0
for 0% of iou short position
split the amount 0-0 and 0cover half the amount with 0-year fixed priced power and the other half with 0-year fixed priced power
0
create a portfolio with a
0% of short position covered by 0-year fixed priced power
b
0% of short position covered by 0-year fixed price power
c
0% covered by 0-year fixed price power
d
0% covered by may-sept fixed-price power
and e
0% from the px
the term of each scenario is 0 years
because each is priced off our our curves
the average price is roughly equivalent for each of the three portfolios
however
the graph shows
as one would expect
that exposure to price volatility is significantly higher under scenario 0 compared to 0 and 0
the goal is to use the illustrative scenarios to persuade the industry that in the short run
i.e
immediately
the utilities should be permitted to buy a modest amount of power under 0 and 0 terms
and those purchases
if undertaken using a
dealbench-like
tool
ought to be
per se
reasonable
if anyone has questions about it
or would like to discuss further
give a call at 0.0.0
best
jeff
agree that enron shouldn't be the lead
an economist should be the lead with a broad group of folks funding

got your message
as you know
it's complete meltdown here
so i apologize for not having got back to you sooner
i'll read and get back to you
deadline
leslie
looks good
just a couple of comments
0
general may want to point out that the roots of california's current gas woes are the same ones causing the electric problem---combined effect of california's
import-based
energy policy and the state's failure to invest in in-state infrastructure
california imports about 0% of its electricity
but about 0-0 percent of its gas supply
california has failed to invest in the in-state infrastructure necessary to support increased gas demand over the last decade
so we've got an interstate pipeline superhighway to the border and a dirt road of in-state transportation once you get into california
the last bullet seems to suggest that manipulation may be taking place
can we support that suggestion
and is it one that we want to make necessarily
if we do suggest that manipulation may in part explain current prices
do we need to propose ways to eliminate it
otherwise
seems that we may be giving ferc ammunition to take action without trying to
steer
that action in the right direction
maybe i'm reading too much into the bullet
0
specific competition for gas coming to california has increased significantly
the midwest
via alliance
is competing away canadian gas
the southwest
nevada
arizona
is competing away supply from the southwest before it hits the california border
but if they kept grace
they might have a winning season
and lord knows nobody wants that
thanks a bunch
so how in the world did you find yourself standing in front of this tornado
fyi
epsa and iep will have a joint pr call tomorrow in case anyone would like to listen in

just met with the industry group trying to come up with a solution for california
the group liked our portfolio approach
in sum
a portfolio approach is the right long-term solution
in the short run
our illustrative portfolios show that the utilities ought to immediately fill a modest portion of their requirements via fixed-price
long term contracts
and those contracts should be found reasonable
up front
so long as the utility uses a competitive auction
to stimulate discussion we proposed that the utility fill 0% of its net short position with 0-year
fixed-price contracts and 0% from 0-year
fixed-price contracts
everyone on the call liked the proposal
after some discussion about whether 0%-0% was the right one
edison agreed to come to friday's meeting with its proposal for price/term/quantity that it ought to contract for immediately
edison may want the number to be higher
and the baskets to be different
anything can happen between now and friday
but thus far looks positive
thanks to everyone for the help in getting the proposal together
steve swain in particular
steve
we may get asked to run a few more illustrative portfolios for the group
i'll report back on what happens at the meeting on friday
if there are any questions
etc
just let me know

as we discussed
attached is a brief description of ena's and ees
key goals in california and the actions underway to achieve them
we'll update the status report weekly
we hope that the weekly update will serve as a useful internal communication tool to keep folks abreast of activities and developments in ca

did you have wind of jason's story on edison calling for an end to ab 0
his spin on the story was good one---edison got everything it wanted
out of 0
and now it wants out of the contract
the story seems worthy of a response
particularly since jason's the reporter
even the chair of ferc recognizes that going backwards is not the answer

sorry
been a bit crazy around here
thanks for the note
and thank you for doing such a good job at driving this process
my thoughts on your proposal
and these are very preliminary
0
politicians may not be willing to go as high as 0% for fear of being accused of a
utility bailout
maybe 0-0%
though utility solvency may force their hands
0
turn will go ape-#%#$ if we make the
roll off
retroactive to october
0
i'm willing to allow utilities to collect tra undercollections
but feel that customers and utilities
not me
need to figure out precisely what that number is
look forward to getting closure tomorrow
though i'm very concerned that we've lost edison
given bryson's public calls to return to 0
best
jeff
actually
please keep doing this
but send them only to miyung buster and ask that they be included in the group of articles sent out to everyone twice a day
miyung's in charge of compiling and distributing such articles on a twice-a-day basis

glad to hear that you're on the distribution
i think it's vital that you attend
it's a centrist group that's making a lot of progress
but chances for success will be greatly diminished without pg&e's participation

hi kari
i know that you and i are both swamped
so i'm writing very briefly to give you a brief update
but first
thank you very much again for meeting last week
greatly appreciated
and look forward to working together to help in any way i can to find solution that is acceptable to all
here's the update
our
subcommitte
is meeting tomorrow to try to close the deal on a proposed solution
it focuses on 0 key areas
using the utilities retained assets to moderate prices
designing a framework for forward contracting that strikes a much more appropriate balance in ca between state oversight and the need for utility flexibility
rate stabilization/undercollections
utility solvency
i will update you tomorrow on the group's progress
if thing's go according to plan
we may be in a position to submit something to you a early as monday
if there's a deadline from your end that i ought to be aware of
let me know and i'll incorporate it into the subcommittee's work plan
in the meantime
if there is anything at all that i can do to help
please don't hesitiate to contact me
thanks again and all the best

armando rend
n cpuc president lynch and commissioner duque statement california public utilities commission
cpuc
president loretta lynch and commissioner henry duque today issued a statement regarding revisions to item 0 on the commissioner agenda of december 0
0
we note certain revisions to the commission's published agenda for december 0st
item 0 has been revised to reflect the scope of options available to the commission in addressing current financial conditions facing pacific gas and electric and southern california edison
the financial problems faced by california's utilities are the result of the failure of the wholesale electric market to ensure just and reasonable prices for this necessity
the commission need not act on this agenda item on december 0st
but the fact that it is on our agenda allows the commission to act if necessary
the financial stability of california's utilities is of paramount importance to california
and to this commission
the cpuc stands ready to act to protect the financial viability of california utilities
the exorbitant and unjustified prices now being charged in california's electricity market demonstrate the necessity for the federal energy regulatory commission
ferc
to intervene and control the opportunism of the electricity sellers
ferc must act to solve the underlying market failure so that all energy consumers are assured of reliable delivery of power and protected from exorbitant energy costs
we urge ferc to act immediately

here are some suggestions for the op-ed piece
one general comment
it may be a bit lengthy at this point
also
have we decided whether it would be our op-ed piece
and one key point that is very commercially sensitive
the term
end the rate freeze
has very ominous implications for ees's book
depending on the timing of any such
end
in california
thus my heavy-handed edits on that portion
nice job

customer is definitely one of the more extreme scenarios we've been hearing
but with davis
i wouldn't rule anything out
if i hear anything
i'll report back

jeff
the haircut notion
i believe
arises from edison's claim that the px price includes a capacity payment
particularly when demand
i.e
the price
is higher
i think there's discussion of it in the proposed decision that came out some time ago and which sits in
hold
limbo on the commission's agenda
i've attached it
alan could you see if it's included in the decision
if not
i can poke around more

fyi
just learned that california's key small consumer group
turn
will be sending a letter to the puc saying that it would be a violation of due process to issue on thursday the sorts of orders the puc is comtemplating without first giving folks a chance to comment
just got off the call with the california stakeholders
the group's trying to come up with a solution and today's call was a challenge
edison threw new demands on the table that effectively ended any chance for a deal today
appears that at this point that anything more than a 0% rate increase is out of the question politically for the governor
and the utilities are very unhappy about it
consumer groups are already balking publicly at the 0% increase reported in the press
the meeting effectively ended when edison announced that
in response to new west turning back their customers
edison plans to file a proposal with the commission this week that would require all returning customers to pay the spot price for energy
the large customer groups blew their tops and that pretty much ended the call
the group agreed to meet again on friday
after the puc business meeting on thursday
best
jeff
thanks for the effort
not looking so great
we should keep plugging away
however
trucks with bullhorns
best
jeff
don't even worry about it
i didn't feel jumped on at all
the debate has turned about 0% political with very little rational economic thought present
unfortunately
thanks
these are the portions of the deal that i've been highlighting as problematic for us with the settlement group for the past few weeks
the group knows that unless there's some compromise on these points in a way that directly addresses our concerns
we won't be signing anything
after yesterday's call
at which edison blew the meeting up
there's no deal in sight in the immediate term
no thanks necessary
my pleasure
i'll report back with what happens this afternoon
best
jeff p.s
you run a damned good meeting

this article tracks well with the information we've thus far received and that i passed along on the call this morning

i want to let you know that i stand in awe of someone who has the balls to open for someone as talented as dan b
it demonstrates that you're one talented guy yourself
congratulations
your show was great
and it was good to see you
best of luck on the rest of the tour

thanks a million for the summary

i accidentally deleted it
could you re-send
it's still a jungle out there

i've been notified that the california commissioner has cancelled the meeting with stakeholders that had been scheduled for this afternoon
he'd scheduled it to discuss what the order the commission intends to issue on thursday might look like
it signals
at this point
that the utilities continue to have a difficult time reaching agreement with the administration
will get back with more as it develops
jeff
dude
you may have taken her charger cord
she can't find hers
do you have two now
ditto on your comment re
the man versus him music
the personality is way
way out front
you bet
helps a lot having you identify the interests
so please continue doing that
i'll keep you up on what's happening as it happens
heres
the file
again
we used it
in the end
to justify having the utilities go out
now
and fill 0-0% of their net short position with 0 and 0 years deals
the group agreed
though there's still discussions about the percentage
higher
and the mix
0 and 0 year deals
0
0
0 year deals
you get the picture
the guy from edison who's been participating in the talks and agreed with our approach
understanding that the percentage and baskets are still negotiable
is john fielder
svp of regulatory affairs
good luck

status report
utility solvency status report
ebs in california
paul kaufman phoned with the following brief report from the western governor's association
energy summit
that took place today
paul will follow up with more detail when he gets back to a computer
the governors issued the following recommendations
california should immediately implement ferc's order issued last friday and aggressively pursue all available dsm and conservation opportunties
the western region should likewise be much more aggressive in identifying and implementing dsm and efficiency opportunities
increase supply as soon as possible
ferc should do an investigation into the potentially negative effects that price caps can cause in the industry
ferc should add to its investigations an investigation into what caused the price spikes in the first week of december
work with the bush transition team to make sure that someone from the new administration is focused on the issue
hoecker said that he is not inclined to impose a region-wide cap until california takes the actions it needs to take to help alleviate the situation
e.g
reforming regs governing utility forward contracts

we will set up a call-in number to relay to folks any actions the commission takes tomorrow
the commission meeting starts at 0 am pst
but it's unclear when they will take up our issue
since the press will likely have the place surrounded
they may decide to do that item first
we'll send out a notice with a call-in # and time as soon as we have the information
best
jeff
will do
these folks will need to be added to the distribution list
lysa/joseph
it's going to be a bit wacky
because
as the note indicates
i'm not sure what time the call will be
anywhere from about 0 am to 0 pm pst
we'll need to keep the number of ports as unlimited as possible
because i have a feeling that the note indicating that there be a meeting will get around
perhaps globally
as soon as i know what time i'll want to have the call
i will notify joseph
who will need to set up the call and distribute the info to the original list i sent around plus the names below
if you two have suggestions on how you'd like to handle
like ross perot
i'm all ears
thanks so much for your help
also
please make sure to add vicki sharpe and michael smith of ees on the list

s&p threatened publicly yesterday that unless the puc acts decisively today to fix the utilities
cash flow issue
they will significantly downgrade california's ious
i assume that's in the wsj article rick referenced
as rick said
more info to come in a few hours
from the most recent information we have
the most likely outcome appears to be the following
as we've discussed this week
the administration and the utilities continue to have a very difficult time reaching agreement on 0
how much of the undercollection the ious should absorb and how much consumers should absorb and 0
how big the rate increase should be to manage the ious cash flow/credit problems
governor wants 0%
ious want at least 0%
it remains likely that the commission will rule today on relaxing regulations to make it easier for the ious to enter into longer-term contracts w/out getting 0nd and 0rd guessed by the commission
it is likely that the commission will signal strongly that it will not let the ious go bankrupt but will only go so far as to outline its plan for considering and implementing a
rate stabilization
plan in q0 0
that said
the stakes are very high and things could change dramatically between now and 0 pm pst
just talked to two svps with pg&e and edison and they said that they don't know what the commission will do at 0
jeff
will do

call is ferc related

on the other hand
if scott and cameron are in for picking folks up

thanks roger
here are the highlights of today's hearings
common themes--many tracked ours pretty closely not a question of whether rates need to rise
but by how much
though some oppose any and all rate increases
the lion's share acknowledged that the utilities have a cash flow problem and the a rate increase is necessary
due process matters
if the commission is thinking about going as far as ending rate freezes and increasing rates
it better provide for ample due process
or countless law suits will ensue
don't jump the gun
a rate increase is likely
but only the utilities benefit from adoption of the utilities
proposals
the commission needs to carefully scrutinize the utilities
claims and take a careful look at the level of increase required to maintain access to capital markets
however
as expected
the utilities implored the commission to jump the gun immediately
the utilities want the commission to declare an end to the rate freeze and raise rates on jan.0
no more divestiture
the utility should keep the generating assets it retained
but the commission should ensure that the assets
benefits are allocated equally among all customers
one legislator recommended that the state buy the utilities
hydro assets
which would give the utilities the cash they need and give the state control over some generation
treat all customers equally and fairly
the commission should not create two classes of customers
e.g
large v
small
direct access v
bundled
no customer group should be sacrificied to save another
be as narrow as possible/do as little harm as possible the immediate problem is the utility's cash/credit crunch
as such
the commission should do only enough to solve this very specific
immediate problem
a modest rate increase is all that's required and the commission should do no more
at the beginning and the end of the hearing
the president of the commission asked parties to be prepared
at tomorrow's hearing
to discuss whether the commission could legally use its other
broad powers to raise rates without declaring an end to the rate freeze
it seems that she seems some benefit in raising rates
but leaving ab 0 otherwise intact untill the commission can marketers and generators are to blame for the problem though not universally embraced
the theme came up repeatedly
a few parties
e.g
the unions
low income consumer groups
one puc commissioner
called for complete re-regulation of the industry
returning the utilities to vertically integrated monopolies
but they were the exception rather than the rule at today's hearing
0
next steps there hearings were scheduled to end on thursay
but now will continue through friday
tomorrow
lawyers will provide
oral
arguments on whether the commission must end the rate freeze in order to increase rates
we will argue that it does not have to
and should not
go through the complex and controversial exercise of determing whether the rate freeze is over between now and 0.0.0
we will argue that the commission has the authority to raise rates without ending the rate freeze
and if it decides to raise rates
it should do so while keeping ab 0's basic structure in place until a full and fair hearing of the issues is completed
we are talking to other stakeholders to persuade them to take the same approach
in terms of legal arguments
this is clearly a long shot
but one that seems worth taking
after the oral argument
the utilities will present their rate proposals and
all interested persons
will have the opportunity to cross-examine the utilities
in short
tomorrow will also be a zoo
when asked what the process will be for issuing a proposed decision and providing comments
the president of the commission responded
we don't know
it's evolving
in other words
the commission is doing a poor job of ensuring that their jan 0 decision is
appeal-proof
keep in mind that the situation remains extremely fluid and the trend is still toward ending the rate freeze on jan
0th
we continue to aggressively offer alternatives to that possibility and continue to try to bring other stakeholders to our side
we're doing everything necessary to preserve our appeal rights
we can discuss further on the 0 am
cst
call tomorrow
best
jeff
here is some info in advance of tomorrow's call
will do
will do
i haven't received anything
ah jeez
i guess this means that you made it back safely from s.d
today's hearing was dominated by
0
many lawyers arguing over whether the commission must declare that the
rate freeze
is over before raising rates
or whether the commission can rely on its general constitutional and statutory authority to raise rates on an interim basis
without addressing the issue of the rate freeze
and
0
an appearance by ralph nader
the legal issue in general
our proposal seems to have gotten some traction
whether it sticks remains to be seen
however
we proposed that
the commission has the authority to raise rates without addressing the rate freeze issue
the commission will not have the facts it needs
and it won't have provided the due process necessary by jan 0th
to address all the complex issues tied to the rate freeze
and if it tries
it's likely to face a flurry of law suits
which is in no one's best interest
for it's jan 0th decision
the commission should confine itself to determining whether
and if so by how much
to raise rates to maintain the utilities
access to capital markets
we've taken no position on whether there's a need to raise rates
setting a hearing schedule to examine the
rate freeze
and all related issues thoroughly and methodically
the utilities argued that the commission must declare an end to the rate freeze
otherwise any commission decision to raise rates would be easy to attack in the courts
in reality
the utilities want the commission to end the rate freeze in order to assure lenders that the commission will permit the utilities to recover going-forward procurement costs
under the rate freeze
the utility is at risk for procurement costs that exceed the rate freeze
in his presentation
our outside counsel offered numerous citations to past commission decision and court cases supporting the commission's ability to raise rates if it found it necessary to do so
many other parties agreed with our position
a few parties said that the issue was too murky to make a call
during questioning
both the president of the commission
loretta lynch
and the presiding judge seemed to indicate that they believe the commission has ample authority to raise rates without having to address the rate freeze issues
the ralph factor apparently
having lost the presidential election
ralph nader's still looking for work
he showed up at the hearings today and held a very lengthy news conference
from what i could hear
he targeted all of his criticism at the utilities for being greedy
and at the governor for being too ready and willing to bail the utilities out
even when thrown some soft balls about
out of state generators
nader stuck to bashing the governor and the utilities
but i couldn't hear the entire press conference
so he may have said things that i missed
the next steps the hearings that were scheduled to end today will now go into next week
tomorrow
the utilities are scheduled to make their case for financial hardship
customers intend to question the utilities very aggressively
as does the puc
the utilities will also have the chance to question the consumer representatives who filed their own proposals and analysis with the commission
on tuesday
the commission is likely to take up the issue of how big any rate increase needs to be and how much of the increase each customer group should shoulder
more tomorrow on the call

all
please see attached materials from steve kean
ken lay and steve kean met yesterday with the governor of california and his policy director to discuss solutions to california's energy problems
the meeting was very constructive
ken lay and steve offered some of enron's proposed solutions and the governor discussed the options he's considering
we've been asked to provide--by tuesday--feedback on his proposals
the turn-around time is tight
particularly in light of the holiday
we'll need your feedback by cob monday
if at all possible
if folks can group their feedback
comments and suggestions and foward them along to me
that would be very helpful
if there is anyone else that you think ought to receive this information
please forward along
thanks very much for you help
best
jeff
thanks
the hearings the hearings have transitioned to the more traditional
courtroom-like environment
with lawyers engaged in detailed cross-examination of utility witnesses
the hearing focused solely on the utility claims of financial hardship
the hearings went from 0am-0pm and only managed to make it through two pg&e witnesses--extensive
detailed questions on pg&e's cash management practices since restructuring started in 0
questions to witnesses focused in particular on pg&e's use of cash for investment and financing activities over the past 0-0 years
e.g
dividend/stock repurchase activities
transfer of cash from iou to parent and parent's use of that cash for investment activities
questions also focused on options other than rate increases available to the utility
e.g
liquidate certain assets of unregulated biz units
loans from parent
bankruptcy
the commissioners and the alj have reacted in extremely hostile manner toward pg&e's repeated attempts to amend and add to their proposal as the hearings progress
questioning of pg&e witnesses will continue at 0 am on tuesday
followed by edison witness
unclear when the hearings will end
though the commission is scheduled to issue its decision on thursday
at this point
it seems very unlikely that the commission will have developed the record necessary to do anything other than raise rates under its general ratemaking authority
outside the hearing intense negotiations between governor's office and utility management continue
seems that the commission/administration is beating up on the utilities inside the hearing room in an attempt to soften the utilities up and gain some leverage in the negotiations taking place outside the hearing room
governor continues to try to bring consumer groups into the negotiations with utilities
but consumer groups continue to resist and continue to oppose any rate increases
governor seems to be attempting to set up a situation where the commission absorbs the political heat for raising rates on the 0th
and the governor follows-up with a more comprehensive set of proposals as part of his state of the state speech on the 0th
thanks for the articles
well
not quite in pjs
but yes
working from home
which is some consolation
pg&e has said that a signficant share of gas suppliers have stopped transacting with pg&e due to credit risk
our exposure to pg&e is huge
both ees and ena
so i wouldn't be surprised if we've stopped transacting with them until the commission comes out with its decision on the 0th and we see how the ratings agencies respond
i can find out first thing tuesday morning
and a very happy and safe new year to you
too
best
jeff
steve
i'm going to give you a call
few things
got your message
as you'll see from the document
i likely spent too much time over the weekend on the
what's in it for consumers
messages
since it was one of the the
to do
items
i figured that it should get some emphasis
but sounds like that may not be the case
i've proposed a template for how to provide feedback on the gov's specific proposals
using direct investment in power plants by the state as the illustrative example
let me know if you think it works
i have ideas on each
but thought it better to await feedback from the commercial folks before filling out our comments in each area
i'm finishing up a bit more detailed proposal for how the gov might use
energy gurus
to help on the portfolio/procurment issues
and am also offering additional detail on the need for a
rate summit
got messages in to schroeder re
nordpool--expect to hear back from him today at some point and i can drop that info into the document soon as i get it
will talk to ees at 0 am cst to discuss their proposals
if you'd like to join that call
let me know and i'll forward along the call-in number
which i think you may already have in your email
have received a few comments from ena that i'll incorporate

yes
have talked to both stoness and sunde about it
thanks
another utility bailout should leave us cold george miller sunday
december 0
0
0 san francisco chronicle url
our current energy problems are urgent and serious
but before the governor and the public utilities commission cut yet another deal costing consumers billions of dollars
perhaps they should pause to ask the public what kind of system it wants and what it will end up with after investing billions more
failure of energy deregulation could speed real deregulation that might benefit consumers with real capacity and real competition
but this will not happen if the focus is only on california utilities and their shareholders
the original deregulation deal was designed
as i see it
to keep competition out of california
and to maximize the rates consumers would pay for every bad past business decision by pg&e and other california utilities
similarly
current bailout discussions are about forcing california ratepayers to pay for the failed deregulation plan designed by the utilities themselves
once again
the companies seek to maximize profits and socialize the losses
following on the heels of california's deregulation
the state's utilities came to the congressional delegation and urged us to protect the plan from federal deregulation efforts
they argued that the deal they cut was good for all parties
their executives repeated time and again that they might benefit from the plan's cap on consumer prices
and that there was a risk to them if wholesale prices were to go up
this
they told us
is the marketplace
they were willing to absorb the risk
this was the brave new world of free markets
but markets are never free
from the beginning
this deregulation plan was designed to buy the california utilities time and advantage
initially
consumers saw lower rates
but not as low as real competition might have provided when compared to the heavily sheltered market of the past five years
now
because this rigged marketplace has failed
the utilities want again to put their hands into the ratepayers
pockets
at first
pg&e and southern california edison asked the public utilities commission to have california consumers pay the entire cost of deregulation's risks
their idea did not pass the smell or the laugh test
now the utilities look for a way to repackage their old proposal
including a substantial rate increase
the rationale is that the utilities may collapse financially
this threat is supposed to inspire gov
gray davis and the puc to quickly put the ratepayer on the hook for the utilities
failures
during the past year
dozens of utilities have merged all across america
pg&e
for example
may not be worth much to its shareholders
but like at&t
it may be worth something to its competitors
this is the genius of the american marketplace
pg&e shareholders bought the stock
assuming the risk
why should the ratepayers be asked to insulate them from that risk
during this past year
tens of billions of dollars of market capitalization were lost by various silicon valley high-tech firms
their shareholders do not get the benefit of going to the puc and getting a taxpayer bailout
the ratepayer has already paid for this energy under a contract that utilities struck with the people of the state of california
any additional payment by the ratepayer is a financial bailout
any prudent investor would ask what the return will be before handing over billions of dollars
the ratepayer deserves an answer
as well as some equity or other consideration
george miller is a democratic congressman from martinez
thanks
i was literally just about to call the portland desk
you saved me the trouble
did they say whether they have any plans to cut pg&e off
from gas sales
in the near future
thanks
was aware of the power/gas split
but fyi
chris foster on the portland desk is a great source of information--midmarket electricity trader and a very straightforward guy
it could certainly use some doctoring
but it's getting there
i'm now shifting my focus to the
informal advisory group

in office all week
lamentably
i worked all week--no vacation time

together in one house---astounding
really fun

attached is the draft
i've attempted to capture everyone's comments
the only piece that is not likely to go this evening is the piece providing comments on the governor's specific proposals
that will likely go first thing tomorrow morning
you'll note that only one of the governor's proposals currently has any comments attached to it
comments on the governor's proposals are appreciated
the remainder of the materials will go to the governor's staff later this evening
so any and all comments on those portions are welcomed and appreciated
thanks to all for the assistance

with the comments on the gov's proposals
will try to work the other comments in
thanks again

at least there's some consistency in the world
how's the memo coming
this is material that i received re
nord pool from davies
one of schroeder's guys
if you want to take a wack at putting together a few bullets on what nord pool is
how it differs from cal model and why it's preferable
that would help me immensely and free me up to focus on 0
comments to gov's proposal and 0
more detail on demand buy-down
that possible
let me know
greatly appreciated

i told her that the rest will follow in the next hour
you're about to get from me the details on the buy-down proposal
i don't think that the bankers or the capital markets are going to swallow what loretta lynch issued today
will do
that glitch in his email address has truly been my nemesis throughout
i apologize
i thought that had been taken care of
i'll take care of it
if it's any indication
edison was down 0.0 today
not pretty
you get the 0-year block numbers from bob
hi sue
a very happy new year to you
mr kean has had me underwater since last thursday night

hope you had a great holiday and that all is well

why the heck aren't you in the bonus meeting
i forwarded this to you so that you could have a chance to take a peek at it before forwarding along to the rest of the group
if you'd like me to forward it along to the larger group
just let me know
jeff
fyi
when i sent kari dohn some additional materials today
i mentioned in passing that i thought the commission's draft decision fell short
she responded by asking why
attached is my response
and hers
perhaps there's a glimmer of hope for the ious between now and tomorrow
best
jeff
here's what we've delivered to davis
message points on the
big picture
reasons that the governor needs to broaden his information network
i.e
get better advice
and a proposal for how to do it comments on the governor's proposals detail on how to execute the
buy-down
proposal 0x0
peak and off peak prices for 0-year blocks of power the only thing left to send is the nord pool material
which jim steffes is help me to gather for delivery tomorrow
best
jeff
best of luck
you've got a tough job
guess you'll be working that much harder now that john stevens is on his way to san francisco
at last week's meeting
a request was made for peak and off peak prices
i've attached prices that we filed yesterday at ferc as part of its on-going proceeding of forward contracts
few comments
we'd appreciate it if you could keep the information confidential
particularly since the information is covered by ferc's confidentiality provisions
since we are not a
generator
we buy and sell in the market
which as you know is currently very volatile
consequently
the quotes that we provide customers change daily to reflect changing market prices
these prices were put together and filed yesterday
but you may have heard that prices were down today
so quotes we made today were lower
and quotes we makes tomorrow will reflect tomorrow's market conditions and will likely be different from today's
because these quotes were assembled yesterday
they are only
indicative
that is
if someone wanted to buy these products today
we'd have to recalculate prices
because the quotes established yesterday are no longer valid
for the reasons i mentioned above
hope this helps
if you have any questions
let me know
best
jeff
attached are the final versions of confidential materials provided to the governor's office
best
jeff
hi sue
hope all is well in the land of forward contracts
do we know who the speakers are
is dave parquet attending for us
thanks
jeff
greetings
well
hope your holiday was great
because i'm back with more questions
to change my direct deposit account
can i do that on line
or do i need to do it by other means
thanks
as always
and i hope you have a great 0
best
jeff
as you can imagine
the distribution list has almost reached the size of the entire company
if you folks could distribute materials to those in your group that need it
that would really help out a lot
let me know if that works
best
jeff
this touches the issues you and i discussed yesterday
seems important to have this sort of information flowing well in advance of the activity
have you or anyone else had a chance to peek at what sam intends to present to legislators
the more the right is aware of the left hand
and vice versa
seems the better off we'll be
no big deal
but if we get our internal process in order at the outset
likely make it easier when the missiles really start flying
your pal
jeff
ees
receivables related to px-credit payments that pg&e continues to withhold has grown dramatically ees is going to meet internally to re-visit the issue of putting customers back on utility service
but honoring the financial terms of our contracts
they will try to convene a meeting
as early as tuesday to discuss the switch-back issue w/steve
mark
blachman
sunde
etc
similar to the meeting held a couple of weeks ago given the market's negative response to the commission's decision
ees will immediately try to tie up bankruptcy counsel in anticipation of the fact that the utilities may be forced to file
which ees estimates will occur by end of next week
if it happens
jennifer
i will unfortunately not be able to make the call because i have to be at the california puc for the decision that they're issuing today
harry kingerski
in houston
might be able to join
though
the commission voted out the order 0-0
essentially as it appeared yesterday
three key changes
they clarified that the surcharge applies to direct access customers
but the entire
rate freeze
structure remains intact for now
the commission reversed itself and chose not to adopt turn's
netting out
of gen revenues and ctc collections
and said instead that the commission will consider it as an option in the next phase
a move likely made in order to lower chances of a successful utility appeal
the commission added to the decision language saying that it will study the pros/cons of securitizating the utilities
power purchase costs
they will submit a report on the issue to the governor and legislature
on this last point
wire reports are rampant about the possibility that legislation will be introduced as early as today proposing to securitize the utilties
power purchase costs
this action has reportedly been the result of discussions that occured through the night between the governor's office
the utilities and the ratings agencies in reponse to the fact that the decision issued by the puc falls well short of what's needed to keep the ious credit worthy and solvent
as a result of those wires stories
the utilities
stock has come back
edison was down as low as 0.0 and is currently at 0 0/0
pg&e was at 0 0/0 and is currently at 0 0/0
we're working with sandi mccubbin
who heads-up our legislative activities in california
to get more info and will report back
the hearing was dominated by highly charged anti-generator
anti-marketer rhetoric
which is likely to play a prominent role in the press accounts
only ferc was demonized more
each of the commissioners
including the most recent
interim
appointee
made strong statements regarding the undesirability of utility bankruptcy
the commission left open the possibility of
doing more
at their next meeting
two weeks from today
which means the negotiations with the utilities and ratings agencies are likely to continue
and if an agreement is reached
it could end up on the next agenda
yes
i'll get to mike day
you're a goddess
thank you
vicki
do we need to add the px letter to the agenda for tomorrow's 0 am call
if so
make sense to have bracewell
ron carroll
and mike day on as well
jeff
ron carrol works at bracewell and he handles a lot of our ferc-related px and iso activity
including tariff activity
ron works for dan watkiss
who also handles a lot of that work for us
man
you ain't kiddin
jeez
greetings
kari
today's installment includes
background on nord pool information on the status of de-regulation in pennsylvania
the rumors regarding securitization of utilities
power purchase costs had a very positive effect on the utilities
stock today
congratulations
theris conflicting information floating around
though
some wires stories say that a state senator will sponsor a securitizationbill
others say that it will be the governor's bill
is securitizationlegislation something that the governor intends to sponsor/support
though there are clearly some challenges to securitization
we think it offers a promising option
hope the information is useful
best
jeff
i sent kari dohn some more information today--thanks
jim
for the pennsylvania info
in the note
i asked her if the rumors about securitization are true
and whether the governor
indeed
intends to push it actively
i also mentioned that we viewed it as a very promising option
particularly if accompanied by significant concessions by the utilities
the response from kari is very encouraging
and will hopefully help the utilities
credit position
though i heard pg&e was downgraded to junk by at least one credit agency today
but haven't confirmed it
think it's prudent to keep kari's info very close to the vest--here's kari'her response
jeff
thank you so much for the information
re
securitization
i don't think the exact form has been decided in terms of legislation
but its fair to say there are very active discussions at the highest level regarding the best way to do this
with good support
between us
it appears
all major parties will need to be supportive
i hear you
feels like i haven't slept for about a week
congratulations--securitization would be an extremely constructive outcome
if there's anything at all that we can do to help
please don't hesitate to ask
since folks view us as
well
somewhat controversial
we continue to try to do productive things away from the spot light
talk to you soon
best
jeff
hmmm
sounds like the pressure's getting to mike a bit
a vacation might help
i think you're entitled to continue on
if that's your decision
you may not have the attendance you prefer
but i don't oppose moving the gas accord talks forward
jeff
greetings
thanks for all the help with information
here's what we've sent to the governor
best
jeff
you ain't kiddin
mike
this should offer a guide to developing legislation that narrows puc review of utility purchases to approval of the competitive solicitation used by the utility to procure the contracts
we have consistently argued against being prescriptive
i.e
the contracts should be of 0 years long
less than $0/mwh
etc
thanks
i'll touch base withjulee at iep
thanks
harry
i want to re-enforce the switching issue
since ees is likely to be very focused on moving customers back to the utility on tuesday
switching would certainly reduce ees
going-forward exposure to 0
growing
credit receivables
that the utilities refuse to pay and 0
the risk that the commission will end the rate freeze altogether---and the px credit with it--as part of the hearing process that commences with the pre-hearing conference on wednesday
reducing that exposure is clealry important to ees
but the utilities
ability to resist taking back customers is likely to be significant
particularly since 0% of the volumes that we serve are on enron meters
imagine the road blocks that the utility can/will construct over the
complex process
of changing-out the meters
in addition
when ca border gas prices spiked several weeks ago
many large gas customers tried to switch from noncore to core service on socalgas
system
socalgas submitted an emergency motion at the commission to prevent the switching and the commission granted it in the wink of an eye
it will be important for ees to drill down fairly deeply in its analysis of all the ways that the utility can frustrate any switching
otherwise
we may find ourselves confronting a lot of negative pr without having reduced any of ees
exposure
customers who have been unwillingly switched back to the utility have become very vocal about their displeasure and have turned negative on esps as a result
best
jeff
greetings and happy new year to you both
eve
has the sub-group met since things were put on hold a few weeks ago
if so
i'm very interested in hearing about what's going on
if the group is going to meet between now and the 0th
i'm also very interested in participating in those meetings
delaney
i'll be attending the meeting on the 0th
the angelides proposal has certainly spiced things up--just what we need
more david freeman
best to you and yours in the new year
jeff
delaney hunter
please respond to dhunter
sounds like a good idea
it might be a good idea to have a conference call to discuss the state treasurer's proposal released last friday
a summary is attached
if folks agree that a call would be useful
does noon pst
on monday
work

more info to follow
i'll give you a ring

thanks again
apologies for bothering you over the weekend

jeff please respond to stevebowen cc
subject
cpuc affiliate entity jurisdiction privileged and confidential attorney-client communication jeff
per your request
i am writing a brief note to follow up on our telephone conversation today
as we discussed
enron plans to change the structure of enron telecommunications
inc
from a regular c corporation to an llc
as we discussed previously
this change in structure will require the approval of the california public utilities commission
because it is a change of control under the definitions of the public utilities code
you indicated that someone inside enron was concerned that
during the course of the cpuc,s review of the request for transfer of control
the cpuc could get access to the books and tax returns of eti,s parent ebs or other enron entities
which enron would find unattractive
you asked me to discuss whether this was possible
at a general level
the cpuc in the past has asserted jurisdiction over entities affiliated with entities regulated by the cpuc
depending on the facts at hand
a variety of provisions in the pu code grant this jurisdiction
however
the cpuc rarely uses its jurisdiction to look into the books and tax returns of an affiliate of a nondominant telecommunications carrier
unless the affiliate is the entity seeking to acquire control of the carrier
for nondominant telecommunications carriers
the commission applies a fairly light regulatory touch
because such carriers have no market power
you should also be aware that there are other provisions in the pu code that protect carrier's financial information from public disclosure
thus
although it is possible that the commission would seek to review the books and/or tax returns of ebs or another enron entity in connection with the change to an llc
it is unlikely
eti is a nondominant carrier
and there is no real change in the ownership of eti
because ebs will still be eti,s owner
i.e
ebs will own an llc
rather than a c corporation
nor is there any change in the management personnel of eti
the one wild card is that enron's name is quite well known to the commission because of enron's presence in the energy market
while this logically and legally should make no difference
it could conceivably trigger increased commission scrutiny of the transfer of control
please let me know if you need more information or want to discuss further
fyi
it's been reported that the legislative committee intends to subpoena generators and marketers to testify before the committe
though nothing in this press release mentions any subpoenas
jeff
attached are my updates to steve's backgrounder and solutions documents
i've also attached
for rick
the summary of the ca state treasurer's proposal
best
jeff
fyi
see comments on keeping the utilities out of bankruptcy and timing
jeff
you've got my vote
fyi
today craig barrett
ceo of intel
publicly opposed the
state takeover
plan released by california's treasurer last friday
saying
i'm not a great fan of government getting involved in the private sector
especially delivering a key commodity to the private sector
sf chronicle
0.0.0
might be a good opportunity to try in earnest to enlist silicon valley in our efforts to get california moving in the right direction
despite itself
barrett said the answer is easing siting rules in order to get more power on line sooner and blamed officials who've opposed power plants for seriously exacerbating the problems in california
because of ca
power woes
barrett said that he'd build new facilities anywhere but in california
jeff
thanks
ginger
i'll be on the call
rick
if your schedule permits
could you participate in the first five-ten minutes of the daily ees call
0 am cst
to give those folks a brief snapshot of what happened
if so the call-in number is 0.0.0
code alternatively
since i'll be on the call anyway
you can leave me a voicemail
or call me at 0.0.0
and i can relay those points that you feel are most important to communicate
best
jeff
thanks
sandi
are the r's generally on-board with davis
approach
or do they intend to offer their own proposals
understanding that they are greatly outnumbered in both houses
i'm hearing that it's a mixed bag
best
jeff
i'll do my darnedest
is jan handling this poorly or well
thanks
mike
about the best we can hope for at this point and consistent with our approach
would be very beneficial if we could ride as much as possible in turn's public wake
and continue to
advise
them and work with others behind the scenes
hey buddy
i know that you're up in sacramento and have a much better lay of the land than i
but this looks a like a sure fire set up for
the man for all seasons
to make an appearance before the legislature
i have deep concerns about us sticking our necks out at these hearings
again
have much better info
but by all accounts
witch hunt
seems to be the operative term for the hearings
we are doing very well for ourselves working behind the scenes and the risks to us of having someone at a public leg hearing
with all the cameras
and all the politicians feeling the primordial urge to grandstand are very high
let's please discuss this one long and hard before making an decision
i'll be in sac on the 0th for an ab 0 group meeting and plan to attend the hearing
your pal
jeff
thanks
julee
sounds like a good idea
could you please forward me the call-in for the call
thanks
best
jeff
thanks
any way to observe remotely
cspan

i'll be on the call and i'll call you beforehand
mike day has every financial incentive for us to have a witness
and i'm still struggling to find the value
as for the
save the planet
crew
i'm as concerned as you are
i'll try to make sure that kaufman's on
who's a lawyer and is considerably more to our thinking than to mike's
roger's or stoness
best
jeff
sorry to hear that it was cancelled
thank you for keeping me in the loop
quite a way to start the new year
best
jeff
pg&e is saying publicly
and the news is reporting
that pg&e has $0 million in cash
and it's payables are $0 m
don't mean to keep the chain of emails going
but given the cameras and the grand-standing politicians
who seem to have an abundance of rhetoric and capacity for scape-goating
and a paucity of constructive solutions or the will necessary to do what needs to be done
seems worth considering the pros and cons of throwing anyone in front of any legislative committees
we may decide that the pros outweigh the cons and that there's discernable value having our outside counsel speak to the issues of supply and demand in california and the west
but seems worth spending 0 or 0 minutes on
best
jeff
scott
could you please see that sandi gets this
thanks
if folks would like to get sandi information
e.g
the load curtailment proposal discussed by gary yesterday
please send to scott
who's with our lobbying firm in sacramento
sandi
scott
stoness
would like to discuss this proposal on tomorrow's
friday's
0:0 am conference call
thank you
best
jeff
thanks
karen
and please thank marathon for the info
if this holds true
sounds like burton plans to make things pretty messy
also
diablo is also running
reportedly
at about 0% of capacity due to rough seas and difficulties that causes for cooling
not the retained assets case---wood wants to cap prices to qfs
jeanne
could you try to get any information you can from puc staff on how they intend to handle pg&e's advice letter re
we've stopped selling power from out retained assets into the px
i'm assuming that the puc would be sympathetic
since it should immediately lower the utility's bill for power
thanks very much
jeff
the playboy mansion
greetings mark
any interest
best
jeff
yes
the utilities can pass through the gas costs
they face an
incentive ratemaking mechanism
that includes a
market benchmarket
that they must meet or beat
the benchmark's a composite of spot indeces
so as long as they buy spot
they can meet the benchmark and pass everything through
ill-conceived procurement incentive
particularly in these days when prices are going north
but at least there's no price cap creating gas undercollections like there is on the electric side
if you need anything else
just holler
jeff
sort of a single-minded focus
harry
tamara johnson left me a voicemail stating that 0
she phoned bob weisenmiller requesting that he be our witness 0
there was disagreement internally about whether enron should have testimony 0
she nonetheless wanted to try to make sure bob was available and 0
she would call bob back to discuss further on tuesday
not sure that this is the best way to run a railroad
as you mentioned
it's quite inefficient to have ees folks contacting our lawyers and reg consultants directly
i did not respond to tamara's message--thought it would be better to pass along info to you
we can discuss further on tuesday

likely to go up
but whether it goes up by enough is unclear
they've got a very long way to go if they hope to keep the ious from filing chapter 0

i agree with harry
in particular
we'll need to make richard sanders and ena's outside counsel are aware
i have been concerned
and continued to be concerned about
the implications of being in the case
understanding that our interests--and the stakes--are very high
continues to seem important that we be in
but we'll need to discuss further
and make sure that jim and ena's attorney's are in the loop

was that you
i looked at it and thought
oh
well
they fucked up
that's hilarious
were you at tom's
dude
i'm very sorry about the check for the banjo
i spaced it
i'll have it to you as soon as i get back into town
apologies
someone from parquet's group is very likely to be there
government affairs hadn't planned to intend
i can give parquet a call and find out and make sure that there's good coordination with transwestern
or tw can call him directly
just let me know
best

dean tyson
it was a pleasure to see you again today
phil
it was a pleasure to meet yand i look forward to working together
since time is of the essence
i wanted to summarize where we left off at today,s meeting regarding califs energy crisis
that summary is attached
i've also attached three articles from the business section of today's chronicle that arguably bolster our arguments for adopting the approach that we discussed at today's meetin given the fact that the legislative process is moving rapidly
bankruptcy is a daily threat
and dean tyson will be attending the meetings in davos
itappears that our window of opportunity is very small
it seems that succesrequires a meeting of the principals by the end of the week
if not sooner.the chances of success are obviously limited
but i think that we agreed that all concerned have nothing to lose and everything to gain by taking a shot.your offer to help in the effort obviously increases the likelihood of success and is greatly appreciated
my apologies in advance if i have mischaracterized any of the points made athe meeting
it represents a
first cut,0 it will undoubtedly change as the details get worked out
and i,m sure i,ve missed something
so pleashesitate to edit the draft
please keep in mind that i have not had a chance to discuss this proposalinternally
as such
i can,t yet commit enron to the specifics of theproposal
but i,m confident that the company can support something akin to this structure and can let you and phil know first thing monday
in addition
given the political environment in california
enron has playea constructive role by providing low-key
behind the scenes advice and analysis to policy makers
that approach seems preferable in this effort awell
finally
dean tyson
i mentioned that linda robertson heads-up our washington d.c
office
if she can help in any way
please don,t hesitate to let mknow
both of you should feel free to call me at home over the weekend todiscuss things further

tyson has gotten a call-back from the governor's office
she's going to call him back shortly to try to sell him on the plan
i.e
private sector to the rescue
and ensure that he'll come to the party
she'll call me back as soon as she talks to him
curious--do we have any sense of whether there's much activity within the adminstration on this
or can we expect the wait and see approach to continue

here's the suggested list of business leaders to try to bring into the deal
all comments are welcome and appreciated
best
jeff
here's the list
comments
i'm going to go ahead and send it to her
michael tribolet
in response to your question
yes
edison did file in federal district court in l.a
the filing asks the judge to force the cpuc to 0
declare that the rate free is over and 0
raise rates to compensate edison for its undercollections
recall that this filing comes on the heels of the court agreeing to hear edison's case asserting that the cpuc must let edison pass through the power purchase costs to customers
the filing is apparently very large
the lawyers at the cpuc have a copy but said that it's much too large to make a copy and aren't willing to give it to us to make a copy for ourselves
question to the lawyers
do we have contacts in l.a
that can go to the courthouse and get a copy of the filing for us
probably a good idea to have that filing passed around to this distribution list
best
jeff
mary beth
thanks very much for passing these along to laura tyson
there are two documents
one is a word file with a suggested list of business leaders that we might bring into the discussions
please let the dean know that it's a first cut and that all comments
suggestions
edits
etc
to the document are welcome and appreciated
the second is a pdf file from credit suisse first boston giving csfb's analysis of what's going on in california
i think it provides further proof that california is still looking for
and ought to be very receptive to
a proposal like the one that we're working on
could you let me know that you've received this
thanks again

dear gang
i don't know about you folks
but i woke up to over 0 emails from telecom reports today
it seems to border on spam at this point
is anyone else having this experience
the info is very valuable
but i'm wondering if there's a way to get
say
0 emails a day rather than the 0 or more i'm currently receiving
wondering if the lights will stay on today
jeff
are we talking 0 hours worth of work for this pleading
if so
then $0 seems good
in the attempt to delete the millions of emails i've received from telecom reports
i deleted your western gov update before reading it
could you resend
your pal

most indebted
let's talk about these notes prior to your drafting
please give me a call
mary beth
for what it's worth
i've read this
and if laura tyson or larry summers sign it
i have serious concerns about the effect it would have on their ability to play the role that we envision in moving our proposal forward
understanding that our odds of success are somewhat meager
while i don't disagree with the language
it is strong and therefore very likely to make the governor and his staff very uncomfortable
i would recommend that they do not sign
best
jeff
i don't envy your position
at some point
the document must be finished and folks need to determine whether they'll sign or not
i greatly admire rich gilbert
but his comments
re
regulatory intervention is a good thing
and now this one
will surely create considerably controversy and could greatly upset the apple cart altogether
best of luck
jeff talked to tyson
she's really working it
which is great
and i continue to focus my efforts there
my company is squarely behind her efforts
thanks again for organizing the meeting last weekend
haven't received anything
sounds like we all agree that it would be a good idea to do it
i'll write the prof an email and ask him to email us the file
my preference
in order to actually learn something--i'm sort of thick
is to work on these jointly rather than have one person do it each week
but i'm willing to discuss
others have views on how we ought to write
em up
best
jeff
prof
bajaj
our understanding is that we'll need the electronic file you talked about on monday in order to do the first
optional
case
re
helpful questions and spreadsheets
but we haven't received the file yet
could you possibly forward it to us
we're leaning strongly toward writing the first case up and turning it in and are anxious to get started
thanks very much
best
jeff
tyson has had conversations with the governor's office
the governor's office wants more information about what the meeting would
look like
attendees
and has said that the idea sounds like one worth pursuing
but as we know
talk is very cheap with this governor
in response
tyson and her very able helper are taking the 0.0-pager that i sent around and modifying it to describe the meeting optics/logistics/attendee attributes
etc
they will forward it to me as soon as they've got it drafted
tyson hopes the document will seal the deal on the governor's participation
in the meantime
tyson is trading calls with doer and trying to line up other business face cards to assist in getting the business community to the table
any help/suggestions we can offer gathering up business folks would be useful
but seems that tyson's going to have to carry that water
tyson said based on her conversations with summers
he's squarely on board
the way we handled it last time was 0
have a quick chat about it
0
split up the pieces
0
once written
pass around the pieces to see if anyone has any strong feelings about what folks had pulled together
and then
for each case
0
designate one person as the
assembler
of the pieces
we designated who would be responsible for which cases at the beginning of the semester
and yes
all by email
save for
say
the preliminary chat
it worked well
but i'm flexible
if folks want to try another angle
best
jeff

could you please fax this text to steve and mark
thanks a million
jeff
the speaker introduced a bill that would
order the ca puc to establish a
rate component
to permit the utilities to recover its
net undercollected amount
over a period of ten years
sounds like there may be a haircut in there somewhere
authorize the state water dept
to purchase power on behalf of utilities and munis
order the ca puc to create a separate rate component to cover the dept.'s cost of purchasing the power
authorize the treasurer to issue debt
backed by ratepayers
to cover any difference between the price the water dept
buys the power for and the price that can be collected from ratepayers under the rate freeze
authorizes the state director of finance to
accept on behalf of the state any tangible asset of an electrical corporation
presumably the state is looking to get something from the ious
say
the hydro assets
in exchange for giving the utility it's
net undercollected amount
the bill is long and haven't yet had a chance to review it in detail
we're faxing the bill
the bill will be controversial and it is unclear who in the legislature has bought into it
though the governor signaled his general support for this sort of approach in a press conference last night announcing the results of the power auction
the assembly is scheduled to have a hearing on the bill later today
will pass on more info as we get it
jeff
could you please make sure that everyone in the office has this call-in number
it's a daily call to discuss california's electricity crisis
thanks very much

david
accusing market participants of
gaming
strategic behavoir
market manipulation
and the like will be extremely controversial
and
i believe
unconstructive
as you may or may not know
much of the criticism was placed on the utilities strategic bidding on the demand side
which many
economists
and
consultants
seem quite willing and able to conveniently ignore
jeff
yes
i'll put my mind to it
what's left of it
tomorrow morning
saturday
i'll take a whack at building on what mark's done and distribute to everyone
fyi
i'm in new york on monday so won't be in class
best
jeff
i've still got considerable work to do
but wanted to make sure all had a chance to review and comment well in advance of finalizing
i'm giving a talk at exnet on monday about california
attached is a draft of the slides
all comments welcome and appreciated
i'm continuing to work on it
thanks very much
best
jeff
one of the things that came out of the meeting i was at on saturday with the uc economists
including tyson and yellen
was a
manifesto
that they published today
i'll have the final to distribute soon
they're having a press conference in about 0 minutes at berkeley
in anticipation
they're quoted in a story in today's la times
that features greenspan's comments
and they focus their quotes on the need to raise rates
most of these folks in the group
lamentably
earn their living by consulting for incumbents
but there message here should be helpful
and there are a few
right-minded
economists in the bunch
i managed to get dr
michaels in the group
who was a great voice of reason in the debate over what to say in the manifesto
it wasn't appropriate for me to play a visible role in the design of the manifesto
though i attempted to offer some behind the scenes suggestions
jeff
apologies
i can't keep track of all the distribution lists
please let me know if you think that this will be helpful in your neck of the woods
rick relayed summers comments re
tyson

i'm forwarding to david lugar

happy new year
hope all's well with you and yours
could you please copy us on the ui details
they will be very useful in what we're up to out here in electricity disneyland
thanks a bunch
best
jeff
oh
please do fax
0.0.0
and we need some more details
in addition to what jim did
if possible
thanks
i'll be there
thank you so much
have a great weekend
fyi
one note
recall that with respect to market manipulation
one of the most common accusations focused on the problems caused by the px manipulation the utilities engaged in thanks to their monopsony
demand-side bidding
market power
jeff
please send me my login and password so that i can get into the system
also
please be sure that my account includes e0 and e0
thank you
i'm taking dylan's and mark's stuff
adding a bit
and putting it into memo format
as i recall in class
he doesn't expect or want us to turn in answers to questions
per se
just a 0-page
or so
memo
i have that right
i'll circulate the memo later today
or first thing tomorrow in the am
best
jeff
thanks
sandi
this tracks very well with my chat with barbara
barbara's charcterization of
irrelevant
arguably makes sense from a customer's perspective
but it's very relevant to us
though i didn't give barbara the details of why it's so important for us---just explained that some of our customers
given their contracts with us
would get hurt
seems that the important take away is that 0
they are actively negotiating the
end
of the rate freeze
0
customers get hurt from a retroactive
end
and 0
one
freeze
will the replaced with another
that is
prices will continue to be capped going forward
despite the
end
of the rate freeze
seems that the critical issue is whether the rate freeze
ends
next month
or next year
which is something that we're going to want to follow very closely
do we have any information on where the negotiations between customers and the utilities ended up this weekend
best
jeff
ok
jimmie and i duplicated effort just a bit
attached is the memo and the spreadsheet
note that in the memo
we have a dispute about whether $0k is adequate
therefore
i've left questions 0 and 0 attached to the memo for you folks to reconcile
if they take advantage of discounts and get a/r and inventory rates back in line with
0 rates
is $0 enough
also
i've included a common-size income statement in exhibit 0
a cash flow statement in exhibit 0
and i
too
completed exhibit 0
we may want to clean up some of the calculations in the spreadsheet
given that we'll likely need to turn them in as attachments
hope this helps
i'd do more
but i'm off for the airport and new york--won't be in class tomorrow
best

re
final version-manifesto dear jeff
sorry i didn't get back to you last week
i was sick on thursday and friday and only dealt with a couple of things
unfortunately
not much to report
letter sent to governor's office
not even a courtesy call in return
i spoke with lynn schenk on thursday
she told me point blank that the governor and his staff had already solved the energy crisis and that it was too late to convene a meeting such as ldt was suggesting
please do not pass on this informationto anyone else in the
berkeley group
we'll probably try to reach schenk again today

teece is the economist at berkeley who acted as the ringleader for the
manifesto
i'm fine and agree that it's more about the reasoning than the right answer
i don't feel strongly about the recommendation
just wanted to throw out something for folks to shoot at and to highlight that a/r and inventory turnover is big problem
though without a/r and inventory turnover convenants
i don't know if i'd do the deal
thanks for doing the finishing touches

da in pg&e and sce
is this statement correct
another flea on this legislation is the suspension of new direct access customers during the time that dwr is procuring energy
the bill states
the right of retail end use customers
to acquire service from other providers shall be suspended until the department no longer supplies powerhereunder
voila
not only do we get a rate increase
but our ability tochoose an alternative energy supplier is hereby waived
i would think theaverage californian would be outraged by that dictate
of course
most californians didn't know that they had a choice
therefore
the legislatiomade a grand leap forward by lowering our opportunity set to be in line witexpectations
i wonder what the legislature will do next week
on friday
i attended a meeting with ken lay and karen denne that mike peevand david freeman requested
mike peevey was president of southern california edison before founding nev
which he eventually sold to aes
freeman is general manager of ladwp
the governor hired peevey to be his chief energy advisor
freeman is thegovernor,s chief negotiator responsible for signing power contracts on bof dwr now that the legislature has passed ab0x and the governor has signedit
john burton
the leader of the state senate
is responsible for gettinthe freeman the job of chief negotiator
but peevey was clearly in charge
also at the meeting was vikram budraja
former svp of power systems and planning for edison
he,s now a private consultant that freeman hired thelp him with the contract negotiations
peevey asked for the meeting to urge enron to respond to dwr,s rfp issued on friday
peevey/freeman want to announce a package of deals on tuesday
thimplied that they,ve already got some deals done and expect to have 0+ dto announce on tuesday
though they gave no details other than to say thatthey,ve got a deal with calpine
as reported in the press
their plan is to announce on tuesday the names of the suppliers they,ve signed with
the total number of megawatts signed
and the average price per mw
they are concernthat the media will want them to make public the details of each individualdeal
which for obvious reasons they don,t want to do
peevey and freeman also said that they don,t want to sign too many long-term contracts though they recognize that there,s a trade-off between term anprice
ken lay told them that enron would respond
ena is preparing a response
he also told them that ees was working on a plan to reduce demand at our customers
facilities and that the plan would be completed and ready forimplementation very soon
i,ve summarized the points that ken lay made and the responses from peevand freeman
it would be difficult to enter into contracts without some assurance that dis creditworthy
response from peevey/freeman
ab0x provides dwr the funds necessary*beginning on friday
feb 0st*topurchase the power necessary to fill the utilities
short position
ken lay pressed them on this point and peevey insisted that ab0x provides the fundsneeded to pay suppliers
the rfp should give suppliers maximum flexibility in coming up with proposals
response from peevey/freeman
be as creative as possible
all offers will be considered
despite the language contained in the rfp
the only customers who have been protected from california,s failed restructuring law are customers who chose another provider under direct access
in addition
one of the quickest ways to help solve california,shortage is to work with customers to reduce demand and develop on-site generation
taking away direct access and access to customers generally*as ab0x does*is therefore a dumb idea and must be reversed
response from peevey
he agreed but said that it was impossible to remove it from the bill
heaffirmed what we already know*that the head of the senate oversight commdebra bowen*is working on a
clean-up0 bill to remove the prohibition
in response to ken lay,s points that california needed to make sure that utinterconnection and stand-by rates didn,t continue to impede on-site generation
peevey and freeman said that the governor understood the probleand was prepared to fix it
siting laws have got to be streamlined and california
i.e
the governor
has got to credibly commit to the swift development of new power plants inorder to push the forward curve down
response from peevey/freeman
the governor is scheduled to offer a plan this week that is targeted at expediting siting and development
dwr should accept demand reduction bids at the same time that it accepts supply-side bids
response from peevey/freeman
they agreed but said that there is extreme political pressure to announce the signing of some supply deals on tuesday in order to prove to legislators that dwr will be able to keep the lights on
and at a
reasonable0 price
they also need to sign some deals in light of the fact that the feds are very unlikely to extend the doe order forcing suppliers to sell to the ious
onthey,ve shown that they can manage the supply side
peevey and freeman said they want to quickly turn their attention to demand-side bidding
these are the highlights
i,d be happy to give more details on the mondmorning call

just to add
evie represents
largely
the oil companies
she represented that the suppliers that she represents are negotiating the terms of the agreement with pg&e
she finished by saying that she was fairly confident that those negotiations would result in the gas suppliers that she represents signing pg&e's agreement and supplying gas under those agreements

steve kean asked that i forward it along to you
could you please print out a copy and forward it along to ken lay prior to his departure for washington d.c
thanks very much
all the best

hi folks
since we have only one page
the write up for number 0 will have to be verybrief
before writing it
though
i wanted to offer a few bullets regardinwhat angle we might take
and let folks respond
comment
counter
etc
before writing it up
i'll clean and beef up once we've agreed to the approach we'd like to take to question #0
finally
i can work from my office on this this evening
which means that i can use the conference callcapability of my office phone to patch everyone in if we'd like to do a conference call
if that's what folks would like to do
i'd prefer to do thcall at around 0 pm
just let me know
best
jeff the question for #0 is
stock price is down 0%
significant debt has already been tapped to suppormassive growth and covenants on that debt restrict taking on a lot more debt
what should hd do w.r.t
current operations and future growth strategy
in the near term focus less on growth and more on getting margins and ebitgrowth back in line with results from previous years
management,s letto shareholders alludes to this
but it,s difficult to determine whethermanagement is just paying lip service to the need to capitalize on the growspurt and grown earnings
or continue on the growth effort
with respect to funding future
more moderate growth
the company does hasome room to increase long-term debt
e.g
current ratio for 0 =0d 0.0it seems that hd would get better terms and have increased flexibility byissuing additional debt rather than relying on lines of credit
as such
hought to look those sources of funding and fill in any
funding gaps0 with funds from the line of credit
given the significant drop in stock price
hd is likely better off in thenear term 0
moderating growth
0
improving performance to generate cashinternally
and 0
using long-term debt issuance to provide the funds needed
once performance and stock price improves
then hd should consider a stock issuance
how can company improve operating performance
reduce selling
store operating expenses and pre-opening expenses improve receivables turnover improve inventory turnover improve per store/sales consider closing poor-performing stores all of which will improve margins should company change its strategy
if so how
shift from meteoric growth to moderate
targeted growth
and focus on generating positive cash flow from operations focus on improving performance at existing stores
specifically focus on controlling costs and asset turnover and productivity consider another debt issuance rather than rely extensively on credit line in order to decrease cost of funds and increase flexibility
here is the gas settlement from california that we discussed on the conference call yesterday

jeff
ok

and al rap
very funny
indeed
whaddya mean
you mean software
gang
quick question
does the lease-buy-back free up $0m of funds for 0
mark
is that captured in the 0 cash flows
don't think that should change our recommendation
but ran across it in the case and was wondering if we captured it
best
jeff
yeah
but my name's not in it
i haven't heard that
but i was running around quite a bit yesterday
governor backbone has however been recently attempting to appeal to the nader
noisy
wing of the party
so it wouldn't be altogether surprising
we can poke around
best
jeff
i was thinking that it gives them $0m up front
the sale
and then they'll only have to make installment payments for the leases
sounds great
when do we sign up
best
jeff
in addition
we are pursuing sale-and-leaseback negotitations for an aggregate of approximately $0 million for ten of our stores
these sources of additional funds
along with internally generated cash flow
what internally generated cash flow
will provide us with an ample financial foundation to continue to underwrite our growth over the next several years

note that turn sez that the commission should use the enactment date of ab0x as the date that the rate freeze ended
here is the very quick and dirty that i did on the fly for justin yesterday
you should feel free to edit away
best

karen
harry's done some more recent work on the numbers we need to fill in
so he'll fill them in
harry
the numbers we've thrown around over the last couple of months are
from 0 to 0
peak demand increased by 0,0 megawatts
but only 0 megawatts of new capacity was added
meanwhile
electricity is growing over 0% per year
i'll be on the call as will mike day
out outside counsel who's been helping us negotiate a fix to the da prohibition in ab 0x
best
jeff
hey gang
i think that we should do the case
i'm willing to help draft
and willing to take a first crack at putting some bullets together about the direction i think the memo ought to take and distribute that by about 0 pm tomorrow
though it would be good for other folks to do same and then we could compare notes
makes sense
thoughts
suggestions
best
jeff
fyi
from my
buddy
verleger
no problem
just wanted to throw some thoughts into the hopper
if you've gotten them from vicky and tom
then we're set
good luck
best
jeff

jeff ps i'm listening to the leg hearings by phone
legislators are making bryson and mission head al fohr
steve
he was the guy at the meeting we had with the governor's staff
explain in excruciating detail all of the transactions that have taken place since ab 0 passed
e.g
midwest power plants buys
new zealand disco buy
also interrogating harold ray explain edison's purchasing practices over the past couple of years
i.e
staying short in the market
edison's not coming off looking great
bryson's trying to do some major triage---and blaming loretta for keeping edison short
hi
hope you're well
based on your note
i faxed my direct deposit change to renee kelso a week or so ago and wanted to check with her to see that she'd received it and that it was in process
but i can't find her name in email
any suggestions on how i can check in and see how progress is going
as always
thanks a bunch
best
jeff
hi justin
as we discussed
this is the most recent version of the proposed
fix
to the direct access prohibition included in ab0x that the coalition of customer groups have been working on
they intend to give it to debra bowen first thing next week
take a look at it and if you have any questions
please let me know and i can explain the concept and how it is intended to work
i have notified the coalition that it would be a good thing to include you on their distribution list
but i didn't want to do that until i checked with you
let me know if that's something that you would like to do
best
jeff
thank you
for what it's worth
this tracks well with what i'm hearing
best
jeff
thanks a million
please keep me posted

on the various matters currently before the california puc
the commission order stating that the utilities should absorb any difference between dwr's cost of power and the retail rate freeze is still technically in effect
the order only applies
however
to the power purchased under the governor's emergency order giving the state the authority to buy power
the utilities have petitioned to modify the decision telling the commission that the easiest way to remedy the problem would be to vacate the order altogether
but if the commission didn't want to vacate the order
it would need to change the decision so that the ious don't eat any shortfalls
the commission can act on the petition to modify whenever it chooses
in addition
it has a continuation meeting scheduled for this thursday and a regularly scheduled business meeting next week
so the opportunity to act and fix the order is there if the commission wants to take it
with respect to the cost of utility generation
i.e
retained generating assets and qf contracts
the commission has a set up a schedule that foresses a commission decision adopting an
interim
procurement charge on march 0th
there is another
workshop
scheduled for tomorrow to discuss the utilities
proposals
after which the utilities will be required to file formal
advice letters
with the commission
those advice letters will form the basis of the process that the commission will use to ultimately arrive at a decision on the 0th
everyone participating in the workshops takes the view that customers will see a separate line item on their bills to cover the going forward costs that dwr incurs to buy power
everyone participating in the workshops also takes the view that customers will be on the hook for dwr's costs and the commission will
if necessary
raise rates to ensure that dwr is made whole
unfortunately
the commission is not currently sending signals to show that it concurs with the folks participating in the workshops
and until there is clarity on whether the commission will agree to
pass through
those costs
enron and others will continue to have problems with dwr's credit as it applies to the rfp that we and others responded to last week
next week begins the hearings to address the issues that commission started to examine began in the emergency hearings held over the holidays
i.e
the utilities financial position
turn's proposal to
net out
the utilitities
generation-related revenues with the undercollection caused by the rate cap
the date on which the rate has
or will
end
etc
recently
turn modified its testimony in response to the passage of ab0x
turn's new position is that the commission should find that the rate freeze ended on february 0st
the effective date of ab0x
ees will need to quickly determine how and if it wants to respond to turn's latest stance on the end of the rate freeze
we continue to try to persuade stakeholders and the commission that da customers must be compensated for the fact that they paid for the utilities
stranded generating assets
that compensation could come in one of two forms
0
access to a proportionate share of the utilities
retained
cost-based generating assets
or 0
a credit representing the difference between the
market
value of the retained generating assets and the book value of those assets
we are not getting much traction thus far
the commission is scheduled to issue a separate decision addressing the rate freeze issue
the issue of whether to net out generating-related revenues against the undercollection
etc
on march 0
so both sets of issues
the procurement charges and the
end of the rate freeze
are scheduled to be
finalized
on march 0
albeit in separate orders
with respect to the block foward issue
our lawyers had a pretty good meeting on friday with the dwr general counsel and other dwr lawyers
however
it has become clear that despite those efforts
ferc's decision on
charge backs
will have a significant effect on the resolution of the block forward issue
best
jeff
hi tom
from our contact with the governor's office
seems that kari dohn
formerly in the governor's office
and recently appointed chair of the electricity oversight board
would be the hands-down best candidate
best
jeff
no problem
my pleasure
best
jeff
george
if you get a minute
could you call to de-brief on the meeting we had the gruma
just want to touch base in the event that there's any follow up
hope that it was helpful
best
jeff
don't even worry about it
thanks for being sensitive to the issue
good to see you guys this weekend
despite all the excitement
best
jeff
eldon sellers
please respond to eldon
you ain't kidding
i think that it would be best for the chancellor's office to make the contact/request
but if you need us to help
then steve kean
rick shapiro or i can make a go of it
but again
i think that it would best for the chancellor's office to make the invite
best
jeff
thanks
i'll take 0 magnums
and please order 0 cases of coastal zin
i think that we'll likely come by either before or after the dome trip this weekend
i can pay you then
i'm not looking to make money on the grapes
just looking for someone to finance the development of my land
and i'd have a vineyard to look at all the time
that'd be enough for me
thanks for all your help
on the 0st
tauzin and barton are holding separate meetings with executives from the respective stakeholder groups in southern california to have
frank
discussions about california
steve kean will attend for enron
at steve's meetings will be other gas and electric marketers
and generators
linda robertson would like to talk with us tomorrow about getting steve prep-ed for the meeting
she'd like to have the call at 0 pm california time
her assistant will be sending details very soon
best
jeff
you're a doll
thanks
on this one
feel free to control
even if cameron doesn't go up

hi leslie
the proposal that ena submitted to peevey/freeman includes a proposal to reduce demand by 0 mws if the state implements financial incentives for such reductions
i.e
if the state is willing to pay
say
0 cents/kwh to
produce
it ought to willing to pay 0 cents to
reduce
that proposal was distributed to the usual
company wide email distribution list last week when it was submitted
we can discuss further on the phone call this morning
best

remember we are
cautiously
optimistic
that qualifier is extremely important
given the lunacy that's underway in california

thanks
you done good
fella
how's life at 0 treating you
it was great to seeyou
and between you and me
i don't think that anyone would come close toguessing that you're fifty
i want you to know that i'm constantly trying to figure out how i can get down to s.d
to spend some time together
it's something that i very much look forward to
but i gotta tell you
man
working for enron and attending uc's evening mba program is kicking my buttthe good news is that enron has seen fit to promote me
senior director---onotch below v.p
and i didn't even have to move to houston
and crossyour fingers---if things work out i may sign a contract with a winemaker tobuy grapes from 0 acres of vines on the land that i bought on the sonoma/mendocino coast
vines ain't planted yet
way it works is you get thcontract from the winemaker and use the contract to finance the developmentof the vines
anything but a slam dunk
but i'm going to work hard
andhave fun
trying to make it happen
it was great to see you in oakland and thanks very much for the kind note
you will always be an very dear friend and you can count on me showing up oyour doorstep soon
give jessica a hug and a kiss
all the best
p.s
confidentially

but ken lay's been throwing your name around quite a bit as the
top choice
for a ferc position
also
and i'll tell you more when we get together

i believe that steve left you a voicemail describing the nature of the email
all the best
jeff
greetings all
first
i am apologizing in advance for any typos in this email
schedule ivery tight
but i wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing thismorning
with some back-up info that i've included below
attached is the email that was sent to ken lay's office yesterday evening for delivery to sen
brulte
it's of course confidential
few points
i don't have bev's email
so if you could please forward to her
that wouldbe appreciated
as we discussed
jim
mike
bev
scott
hedy
on our lengthy call on wednesday
i'm assuming that the plan is still to
wallpaper
sacramento wiour proposed legislation
this email does not contain the legislation
mike sent the
final
versionof our legislation out yesterday
except for the siting piece
which i believe brian cragg of mike's office is finalizing today
you'll note that we promise senator brulte in the email that we'll deliver to his office today the proposed legislation
again
based on our call on wednesday
i'm assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposedlegislation to the rest of the world at the same time
when we spoke on wednesday
we decided that the sacramento team would determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the sametime that we deliver the senator brulte
i'm assuming that you folks willhandle that end of things
please let us know at your convenience to whomyou've decided to circulate
this email does
however
include a
summary
of our proposed legislation
but i'm not certain that the summary included in this email is the appropriate language to distribute
to the world
or if we'll need insteadto tailor some new language
i think we all agreed that we need a
one pager
to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate thepackage effectively
we also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our proposals
we didn't finalize that plan
perhaps the sacramento team coulpropose a plan to do that
perhaps we could start with our friends in thedirect access coalition
we also talked about the need at this point to engage in pr and to get the pr machinery activated
also with the goal of effectively communicating our legislative package/message
we're in a meeting with folks today where wecan discuss getting that side of things going and karen denne has contactedmarathon and they're pondering some things that we can do in the near term
you'll note that there's a considerable amount of information about the dwrcredit issue
as i recollect
we discussed the issue in depth on the call.you note that attached to the email is a
legislative fix
to ab0x that cousolve the credit issue and an attached set of
taking points
related to asecond alternative to solving the credit issue
a puc order clarifying thadwr will get its money for power purchase costs
note also that steve kean reminded me that we've got to continue to push toget the utilities out of the merchant function
accordingly
i've put a brief paragraph on that issue in the note to brulte in the last section
legislative solution
under the topic
create a real competitive retail market in california
to the best of my knowledge
we don't have legislative language on that piece yet
and it seems that we'll need to discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so
if you have any questions about any of the materials in the email
pleasedon't hesitate to contact me or jim or sandi to discuss
i can be best reached to day by pager at 0.0.0
thanks to all for helping pull this together
best
jeff
looks like we'll be staying the night and leaving in the am
was travelling all week
would be happy to discuss this weekend
but i'd need to be by phone
since i'll be in mendocino
are the handouts from thursday that i need to get
best
jeff
will do
thanks
scott govenar
our outside lobbyist
0.0.0

our outside counsel
might also be useful resources for you
john
best
jeff
thanks a million
jean
thanks very much
let's keep trying
and congratulations on a great find in roger
best
jeff
we'll need to discuss further internally
but they may be correct in their assessment
best
jeff
i apologize
but i won't be in sf monday evening
and this week coming up will be a grinder
i have a lot of time to work on it over the weekend
though
i can provide a fax number tomorrow where the materials can be sent to me
and i assume that they are on the izio site
too
i'm going to go there now
tomorrow
i'll try to crunch some numbers and outline the one-pager and distribute to folks by the end of the day
then perhaps we can email each other on monday and try to make some progress on the memo by the end of the day
that should put us in pretty good shape to finish it up tuesday and wednesday
if i can't get the materials off of izio
i'll let you know
i'll report back in the am tomorrow with a proposed game plan
once i've collected all the materials and pondered things a bit
sound reasonable
thoughts
just let me know
mark
i hope that if you're in denver
that means you're skiing
best
jeff
got everything off of izio
i'll start messing with it and report back tomorrow
if others want to do the same
have at it
and we can compare notes
best
jeff
looks fine to me
what's your expectations re
freeman paying us what he owes us
best
jeff
fyi
i told chris that it looks fine with me
seems like a useful tactic
i.e
maybe if you pay me what you owe for power already delivered
i might consider doing a deal for power going forward
best
jeff
fax number
in la
is 0.0.0
i don't have the address
did we use the la address on the original response letter delivered on 0.0.0
i can't recall
let me know
i can call and get the address if necessary
best
jeff
fyi
here's the version that kean and i sent to ken lay's office for transmittal to brulte
ken lay may have chaged it a bit
i'll find out anlet you know
but wanted you to have what we forwarded to him
thanks agaifor all the help
best
jeff
i took a stab at drafting the memo
i pooped out on the last question
however and was only able to jot down some thoughts
caution
the memo ain't been proofed
i did it as a memo to the ceo of timberland
but we don't need to do it that way
also attaching files
one each for each of the scenarios asked for
so that folks could see what i did
have not constructed the
one-page attachment
however
let me know what you think
best
jeff
since it seems like folks may have only been sporadically receiving my emails
please let me know if you receive the memos and accompanying spreadsheets that i just sent
thanks
best
jeff
wow
thanks dylan
i thought that i was on the hook for this one
let me know what i can do to help
i've read it and will look at what mark's done and throw my 0 cents in
i'll be working on it tomorrow morning
best
i'm on the case
i'll look at what you folks did and take a crack at writing the memo
i'll shoot for writing and sending around at some point today
otherwise
it'll be tomorrow
best
jeff
greetings
i have left two messages on the voice mail authorizing the help desk to delete everything in my haas account
that should help
please consider this email authorization to delete everything in the account
thanks
best
jeff
i can
t thank you enough for organizing my business cards
i know it's a pain and i really appreciate it
thank you so much
also
i've got an entry in my bank account
edi payment
for abou $0
do you have the paper for that
do i have any other expense thing-ees coming
thanks
jeff
thanks so much for dinner
it was really
really good
and so sorry for beating the pants off of you in spades
tee hee
and i just put your check for the wine in the mail
have a great week
best
jeff
yes
check for 0.0 is in the mail
thanks so much for getting the coastal
and the champagne
and the opus
can't thank you enough
i've also mailed you a new bottle of oyster sauce
please turn comments around as quickly as possible
the folks in sacramento need them by 0 pm cst
thanks very much
best
jeff
in all week
except tomorrow
when i'll be in pasadena with steve kean at a meeting of republican congressional folks to discuss ca's electricity mess
linda
i will have the california update done for steve today
maureen
could i possibly get the fax # where steve will be staying this evening in the event that i need to fax it to him directly
what time will he be leaving for la
thanks
best
jeff
well
this would seem to indicate one of two things
either hertzberg's is now an absolute lost cause
or it's more urgent than ever to have ken lay talk to him
given the situation
it would still seem prudent to have ken lay talk to the speaker
best
jeff
carolyn
you're a star
thanks for the input
anil
for what it's worth
i'll take a final looksee this evening and tie up any loose ends
though i doubt that there will be any
i'll send around to all for one last peek in the morning
and i'll bring a copy to turn in
sound reasonable
let me know
best
jeff
thank you
i'll be picking steve up at the hotel and 0:0 am tomorrow morning
and thank you very much for paging him for me
best
jeff
sorry
mike

will try to turn it around pronto
our guy john neslage is trying to pull together exactly what you're requesting
he'll get it to you as soon as we've got it pulled together
best
jeff
thanks very much
rosalee
have a nice evening
best
jeff
man

thanks very much
this is really starting to get wierd
makes cuba look capitalist
best
jeff
we'll need to brief steve on the fed/state issues tied to the state buying the tx systems of pg&e and edison prior to his meeting with the congressional republicans tomorrow
i'll be driving with steve from la to pasadena
where the meeting is
tomorrow beginning at about 0:0 am pst
the meeting's at 0:0 am pst
could we put together a call-in number at 0:0 or 0 am pst so you could quickly/briefly brief steve on the issues prior to the 0:0 am meeting
let me know if this works
or if there's a better way to get him up to speed on the issues before the meeting
thanks very much for helping to pull this together on such short notice
best
jeff
fyi
we should discuss on tomorrow's call
best
jeff
dudes
my other team has now finished the case that's due on thursday
in another class
so i will spend this evening turning what's been passed around into memo format and distribute for review and comment by

this evening
i'm travelling tomorrow--back late afternoon--and can work on it more tomorrow night
best jeff
shmuel
flattered that you would ask
i should be able to participate
let's discuss further
give me a call

best

message points recent legislative proposals designed to have the state play a dominant rolin developing
owning and operating power plants in california
sb0x--burtoand buy pg&e and edison's electric transmission assets
sb0x--burton
aretaking california in the wrong direction and won't solve the state's electricity crisis
two new bills are equally disturbing
ab0x
hertzerg
would make plant certification contigent upon the developer agreeing to sell the power to thstate at
just and reasonable
cost based rates
sb0x
spier
would makepower plant owners public utilities the proposals represent a political solution
not a commercial
financial,economic or technical solution
as a political solution
these bills will not increase supply
decrease demand
or get the utilities back on their financial feet
in fact
it's worse than that
these bills will exacerbate california's problems
the transaction contemplated in sb0x is extremely complex
requiring approval by state and federal authorities
bondholders
creditors and others
california will be forced to spend an enormous amount of time andresources trying to achieve the deal
with no certainty of success
particularly in view of pg&e's public opposition
in the meantime
summerapproaches
and the gap between supply and demand remains staggering
thiscomplex
costly and litigious alternative will not lessen the serious threaof blackouts that california faces this summer
sb0x would have the state finance
develop
own and/or operate power plantsin the state
unfortunately
the proposal being offered will not solve the problem
rather
it,s a significant step backward that will make matters worse incalifornia
the reason
rather than remove california,s roadblocks to increasedgeneration and transmission investment
this proposal requires california tuse taxpayer dollars to get into the business of financing
owning and operating power plants and transmission
the best solution
recognized across the country and around the world
is for the state to allow private companies to site new generation immediately
once built
california could easily enter into contracts with private power plant developers and avoid using taxpayers
dollars
given government,s other failed experiments in other large scale participation into public power
like tva
bpa
nypa
it is highly unlikelythat a california state agency will succeed in doing something that privatecapital is better equipped and willing to do
in the short
the proposal is neither in the public interest nor rational
issuing debt to build power plants and take over transmission systems costs consumers money and takes money away from investments in schools and otherimportant priorities
we would be willing to work with the legislature to help craft a bill thagets more supply in california quickly
efficiently
and in an environmentally sound manner
but this draft achieves only one goal
creating more bureaucracy
three articles that folks might find of particular interest written in the past couple of days
best
jeff
fellows
ok
here's the beginning of the memo
i'm still working on it
but work cratered on me and i have to switch back to that now
i'll have a draft finished by tomorrow night and i'll redistribute
couple things
check the dupont
asset turn needed to be changed
because the pro form calcs hadn't taken the cash out of the assets
that bumps the roe up some
see my attached file
i decompose roe using an alternative method
mark
the one tasker used in class
just to do a check
and the numbers turn out the same
i also ran some turnover ratios for ahp and warner
understanding the limitations of one year's numbers
questions
don't we have to assume that covenants will force ahp to dump its divident payout
folks likely to get unhappy about that
should we care
or should we just expect a rotation out of the stock by dividend-loving investors and rotation in by capital-gains loving investors
could we persuade the new management to lever up with an argument that with all that cash on the books
ahp is ripe for takeover
anyway just some thoughts
i'll finish it up tomorrow and re-distribute
herr jackson
i haven't had a chance to review your comments
but i'll incorporate those in tomorrow as well
best
jeff
ah jeez
nobody tell timi and rory
sue
could you use your contacts with edelman to get on the phone with scott
mark and karen to jump start this thing
best
jeff
any intelligence from
closed door
meeting
nice smushing
ok
last call for comments
need them by noon
i'll bring copies to class for everyone
including ms tasker
best
jeff
hey folks
mr
jackson makes some very good points
which i'd like to include
however
before i work them in
wanns make sure that everyone agrees with his comments
since including some of his will require some modifications to the direction that the memo takes
we could discuss in a brief conference call if folks wish
also
please review what i've done--not major edits
but edits
with some questions and additions
nonetheless
best
jeff
sorry
to fill your in-boxes

if you concur
i'd like to send this around to the rest of the group right now

thank you very much
however
i still am counting the days

how quaint
i think that this is what sandi was referring to
if not
please let me know
best
jeff
sue
the way that i understood what loretta said
the utilities will not be forced to absorb the shortfall between the price cap and dwr's cost of power
instead
she said that dwr will be responsible for those costs
that ought to make dwr an even less creditworthy entity
i'll check in with mike day's folks to make sure that i heard correctly and get more details
will report back just as soon as we get more information
best
jeff
carol
steve should double check
as i understand it
they did vote out the decision implementing ab0x
however
the decision removed the language prohibiting direct access and made dwr
not the utility
responsible
for any shortfalls caused by the difference between the price cap and dwr's cost of buying power

the guy negotiating the bill on behalf of iep told me that there's a 0-0% chance that it will make it out of the senate by the end of next week

ok
here's what i propose
dylan
galant and much appreciated effort to quantify the value of the tax shield
however
my day's completely out of control and resolving now may be more than we can manage
i propose that i simply delete the one sentence quantifying the value of the shield and leave it as a qualitative statement
if you folks would like to mess with with it some more
that's great with me
it's just that--and i apologize--i just won't be able to work on it today
if you decide to do some more with it
go ahead and please bring copies to class
otherwise
i'll just delete the sentence referenced above
print out
and bring to class
just let me know
and dylan

thanks for a dee-licious dinner
i did steal a couple pieces of duck---curiosity killed the cat---and it was dee-lectible
couple things
very
very nice to go through all that to get reservations at la folie and i of course love the place
but i was thinking that maybe we ought to go somewhere that's a tad less expensive
i'm thinking that sean ain't even a big food person
that he's not working
that molly to bring down a king's ransom in her biz
and tom and karen are
after all
vegetarians
anywho
it's really kind of you guys to want to go there
but i'm just throwing out the notion that maybe we should go to another place that's just a wee bit less dear
maybe that other french place that's just one room that we went to out in the avenues
just a thought
whatever you guys want to do is fine with me
also
i'm happy to do a
whole family
thing----well
maybe
happy's to strong
we kid
i was actually trying to pull it together last xmas
but found out that my sister and her hubbie only do their big xmas party once a year
so had to scratch it
i ain't necessarily all that keen
though
on having all get together--particularly for the first time--with the focus being my birthday
so maybe we can have another event sometime soon where we can bring the thundering hoards together at one place----lord help us
finally
what's the plan for your dad
i just found out that i'm supposed to be in houston for an
all hands
meeting on--you guessed it--march 0th
but if there's something planned for that evening
i intend to tell my buddies at enron that i can't make the meeting
please let me know so that i can cancel houston in advance

today is the man in black's birthday

i'm getting him deck railing
a new pump
a new fire place
new skylights

greetings
please review the attached
it's a summary i've put together of a very lengthy analysis mrw did for us over the weekend
i've also attached theconsiderably lengthier mrw memo for those who'd like to see it
the tablesincluded in the summary are pulled directly from the mrw memo
the analysionly addresses the utilities undercollection
i.e
solvency
and doesn'taddress any additional increases that might result from dwr's buying activities
the bottom line =0 by raising average rates 0% over a 0-year period
california couldreturn the utilities to solvency
and 0
help close the supply-demand gap by providing customers with better price signals
=0 california could achieve these goals under this new rate structure and at the same time exclude one-third of residential customers from any increaseif california chose not to exclude any customers from the new rate structurcalifornia would only need to raise average rates by about 0.0%
=0 this level of increase is in line with increases enacted in other states
e.g
washington
0-0%
montana
0.0-0%
idaho
0.0-0%
nevada
0-0.0%
new mexico 0%
we'll need to look at it critically and try to shoot holes in it before going public with the numbers as part of our broader effort
but it offers a reasonable benchmark against which to judge alternatives
like spending thekids lunch money on crumbling
broken down transmission systems
please provide feedback as soon as possible
and perhaps
paul we concludethe mrw work on the agenda for discussion on tomorrow's daily conference cabest
jeff
agree
sounds like a very reasonable way to proceed
and consistent with what we've said all along
non

long time not chat

you seem like the right person to respond to this email

fyi
fyi
chris
any progress with freeman on creditworthiness issues
best
jeff
thanks
jeanne
couple of thoughts
0
if california wants to get out of this crisis
it's critical that dwr be creditworthy
bilas
proposal helps in that regard
we've been thinking pretty hard about the issue and working with dwr to try to fix creditworthiness concerns
christian
it might make sense to put together some comments supporting bilas
approach and perhaps give him some additional recommendations about what the puc needs to do to get dwr creditworthy
if so
see note below
we have an opportunity to provide those comments to the puc by this friday
0
scott govenar--on the direct access piece
seems like it would be very useful to get the da coalition we're working with in sacramento to jointly file some comments on friday in response to the bilas proposal supporting a ban on any puc action on the da prohibition since the legislature is still working on it
what are your thoughts
and if you and the rest of the sacramento team agree
can we work with jeanne to get some
brief
language put together and work to get the rest of the coalition to sign on
alternatively
we could work to get the other folks file individually
your thoughts on both approaches is appreciated
best
jeff
got sent back the first time
i'll forward this along
thanks
fyi

who the right person is to forward this along to

what's your fax number
i'll get a copy of the bilas alternate decision to you as soon as i can

could you please fax to me asap a copy of the bilas alternative
0.0.0
thanks very much
best
jeff
just faxed it to you
greetings catherine and roger
a puc staffer has called our outside lawyer saying that a high school in ontario
ca called to complain that we're turning back the school for credit issues
the staffer says that
a hospital might also be involved
can you provide any more information
the puc staffer does not seem to have much information
but has nonetheless seems inclined to write us a letter asking us to explain
sort of ironic
puc commissioner woods states that his goal is to drive all esps from the state
the legislature passes and the governor signs a bill prohibiting direct access
and now the puc is concerned that california might actually be succeeding in its efforts to kill choice
the puc is particularly concerned since they recently passed an order prohibiting gas customers from returning to the ldc---ironic indeed
any information that you folks can provide as soon as possible would be greatly appreciated
best
jeff
thanks
mike
given time constraints
might be more efficient if we agree internally prior to sending out to the coalition
could folks please provide any comments to mike day pronto so that scott govenar can start immediately to get the da coalition on board
scott
could you hold off until mike gets and incorporates any internal comments
thanks very much
best
jeff
thanks
catherine
we've had a conversation with the puc staffer and she's pretty ill-informed
we told her that we need specific details
i'll get back to you just as soon as
and if
i get them
best
jeff
here are some more details forwarded by our outside counsel
best
jeff
greetings jess
i work in government affairs in san francisco
i would like to discuss internally and think hard about this before we give any response to the staffer at the cpuc---not because we have any reason not to respond
but because this a problem created almost exclusively by the puc
and i don't want to give the puc the opportunity to shift bad decision making and actions onto us
there's a very easy fix to the situation
the commission can reverse the bad decision it made a month or so ago
and permit customers to return to utility service
i've forwarded all of the information to catherine woods and roger ponce
let's discuss more internally when we've gathered up all the facts and then decide whether and how we choose to respond to the staffer at the puc
my number's 0.0.0
feel free to give me a ring
thanks very much mike for helping to track down the info
hey buddy
see cover email to the brulte letter that was sent to the sacramento teamcouple of weeks ago when i was in houston
might be a good place to startw.r.t
getting our
constructive
message out
though i'm sure that there'splenty of other things that needed to be added

how's things
you get this
someone that i know forwarded it along to me
know anything about it
best
jeff
i'm scheduled to meet with kari at 0:0 pst tomorrow
ostensibly to talk about demand buy-down
also presume to message the letter from steve kean to the senators and our solution
perhaps in advance of meetings
phone calls that might take place later in the week with legislative leaders
but would like to add to agenda for discussion on tomorrow's daily call in the event folks have additional suggestions
best
jeff
thanks very much
scott
shouldn't be a big problem
our buy-down auction would require the customer to commit to a fixed reduction over an extended period
for a price
and the reduction would have to be verifiable
i.e
the customer would need to have the equipment necessary to verify
which isn't a problem for large customers
sounds like a misunderstanding on the part of the legislator and something that we should be able to talk through
i'll be there tomorrow
if it makes sense for me to meet with them
just let me know
who's the legislator in charge of demand buy-down
best
jeff
thanks
roger
we'll need to determine whether we've turned the customer back
any help that you and catherine can give in that regard is appreciated
then we can decide if
and how
we choose to respond to the puc staffer
thanks very much for your help
best
jeff
will call shortly
it's always darkest before the light
though it may not get light in our lifetimes
looks great
couple of points
0
despite promises to the contrary--common theme in this exercise--burton
as i understand
did not remove the condemnation
expropriation
language from abx0
i.e
the state can just take your power plant
or anything else
it seems
if it has the inkling
that's an egregious provision in abx0
0
i don't recall trying to amend abx0 to say
pay them their px credits
i understood the tactic to be--get a prospective
date certain end to the freeze in the bill
which then gives us very firm legal ground on which to seek and get the money owed to us
we could seek the additional language
but if putting date certain does the same thing without attracting a lot of attention
may be a preferable path
0
forgive me if i've just overlooked it
but i got wind of a bill by ms migden
abx0
that gives one whole heckuvalot of new power--power usually left to ferc--to the ca electricity oversight board
anyone know about it
we may want to get details for inclusion in the discussion with delainey
best
jeff
to jim's last point
i understand that the good
ol utility system was often operated with little regard for basic economic principles
but there's something in this that seems very odd and difficult to assess
and it seems to always be tied to this notion that
california is a net importer
even in the winter
i'm going to start with the economics and then let folks describe why it seemingly doesn't apply in western electricity markets
just about every theory of economics and trade would lead to one conclusion
if california closes it's doors the other western states will pay higher prices for power and/or face increased threats to reliability
i'm struggling to try to determine why these basic principles aren't applicable to western power markets
i understand that the pnw is a very complex place and that the reasons could be embedded in the arcane structure that has developed over the years
to keep it simple
though not necessarily accurate
i've confined the analysis to a world in which only the pnw and california exist
the basic situation
the pnw peaks in the winter
california peaks in the summer
let's take two scenarios
0
the west
less california
is so awash in electricity that even in its peak--the winter--it still has power to send to california
i.e
it has so overbuilt it's system that it has persistent surpluses to sell to california
irrespective
there have
to my limited knowledge
always been sales from ca to the pnw during the winter
when the pnw is peaking
the only conclusion that one can make
assuming that the pnw is awash in electricity
is that the pnw takes the power in california because it makes economic sense to do so
that is
during the winter peaking months
it must be cheaper on the margin for the pnw to buy from california rather than produce itself
otherwise
it's difficult to understand why it would buy from california during this month
particularly if they're long
as such
at a minimum
the pnw's electric bill will necessarily increase if california closes its doors
0
neither the pnw
nor california
has indigenous capacity to meet peaking load
therefore
the pnw must buy california's power during its peaking summer period
and california must buy power during it's summer peaking period
in this case
not only will the pnw's bill go up if california closes its doors
the lights are likely to go because they'll be short power
i realize that this is a simplistic model
and that there could be other legitimate economic factors driving the flows out of california to the pnw
e.g
transmission costs
and again
i also realize that economics may not have traditionally been a driver in the industry
but i thought it might be useful to get a common framework in place as a starting point for the question that jim asks
with that
i'll pose the question
understanding the simplicity of the model set forth above
given that california sends power north--even if the pnw is long---how can california closing it doors not increase the pnw's cost of power
best
jeff
christian
could you let me know as soon as possible if 0
the proposed decision that i faxed you yesterday is go to go
i.e
adequately addresses our concerns regarding creditworthiness or if 0
we want to recommend some additional provisions
if we want to recommend additional provisions
could you let me know what those are
i want to make a run at getting this deal done at the cpuc asap,and would like to push peevey to get davis to have the puc pass it out at their next meeting
but need to know if it's good as is or needs some tweeking
thanks very much
best
jeff
thanks very much for getting back to us
so if i understand the bottom line
0
the customer was mistakenly put back to socal
due to the dual service territory character of the customer's facilities
0
the customer will be returned to our service
0
the customer's contract with us expires on 0/0
and 0
the customer will have the option of re-signing with us
or returning to socalgas when the contracts ends on 0/0
if i've confused anything
please let me know
and thanks again for helping track down the info
best
jeff
har-dee-har-har
i mean
will we be celebrating in some fashion
i'm scheduled to go to houston--i'm not kidding--but if there's something planned
which i assume there is
then i'm going to cancel my trip to houston
like pronto
ironically
jeff
eldon said that you were making dinner on friday
the 0th
and that he was flying a plane to pick up cameron and rory in carmel
have you guys spoken in the last few months
kidding
and don't worry about my birthday--that's not the issue
it's eldon's 0th--that's huge
friday is the 0th
so i'm just checking in to see what's up
my very strong inclination--for a variety of reasons
but eldon's b-day is the biggest one--is to cancel
signed
confused
thanks
it would of course be easiest to make the calls and say
pass it out now
as is
but if more is needed to fix the credit issue
want to be prepared to tell them how the decision needs to be modified
if it's fine as is
all the better
best
jeff
thanks again
mike
here's the answer
please call me when you get a chance to discuss a response
if any
best
jeff
i understand that there may be a need to give no quarter on this
but given the circumstances--i.e
we talk every day and time and resources are extremely tight--is it reasonable to temporarily suspend filling this thing out for the next 0-0 days
lemme know
my sister just called and said that the earthquake in seattle was 0.0
that's big
best
jeff
sandi
apologies
i meant and forgot to mention on the 0:0 call that the pipeline group is having their annual customer meeting
vps of large energy companies throughout the west and midwest
at the santa barbara biltmore on april 0th and 0th
they would very much like to get bill keese to speak
preferably on the morning of the 0th
but the morning of the 0th would work as well
they'd like bill to discuss the energy situation in california
they can cover however much of bill's costs--if any--that the state of california allows to be covered
the folks at the pipeline group asked if we could make the contact with bill and see if he's available and willing
given your relationship
thought you might be able to check
they're anxious to get someone lined up as soon as possible
feel free to contact laura lantefield directly at 0.0.0
thanks very much for the help
best
jeff
hi
i was trying to get a fix on whether there's something going on on the friday of your dad's b-day to see if i need to cancel the houston trip
what do you think
apologies
the first version incorrectly left in some dwr credit issues and had a couple of other goofs
please discard and review and comment on this one
but if you've already reviewed the other
no worries
since the attached is extremely similar
less the couple of goofs
thanks
lad can play both roles pretty effectively
i'm assuming that the ious wouldn't be dumb enough to recommend something that would have an adverse effect on dwr's creditworthiness
but wanted to make sure you had a chance to review--just in case they're not as smart as i assume
thanks
jeff
i'd love to
have class from 0:0 to 0:0
minor edit
no big deal
check it out
thanks so much for responding
sally
very interested in exploring the possibilities with you
greatly appreciated
wow
that's the only other jeff dasovich i've ever heard of
no kidding
referred to you by lee green
don't yet have soil test or temp profiles
but am in the process of figuring out how to get them done
any suggestions are welcome and appreciated
i'll be around the weekend of march 0th
if that works for you
great
otherwise
we can try another date
again
can't thank you enough for responding
i don't know where it'll lead
but i've got a hunch that it just might work out
enjoy drinking your wine
had the syrah recently
and very much look forward to meeting you
all the best
jeff please respond to pacstar
fyi
well if she ain't sweet
fyi
looks like what we suspected is about to launch
i.e
an orchestrated effort by davis to go after the suppliers
just found out the following from sue mara
who attended the iso board meeting today
the iso is scheduled to release a
report
today claiming that suppliers are price gouging
the california ag has subpoena-ed generator-members of the wptf---very extensive questions asking for just about everything under the sun
likely that we can expect a loud call for regional price caps very soon

jeff
what kind of contract
laura
thanks so much for including me on the list
quick question
which committe is this and who's on the committe
is there an agenda for the meeting on the 0th
thanks again
best
jeff
yes
i would like to attend if that would be possible
thanks very much for the info
i assume that the folks on the committe are the energy managers of the companies
like k.c
mares
who i met when i met with justin a few weeks ago
jeff
here is the final version
i'll bring copies with me tomorrow to sacramento and can drop them off at hedy's office
i meet with kari dohn at 0 am and will be attending the ab 0 implementation group meeting at 0:0
i can drop off copies before i head out for the dohn meeting
if there's anything else
just let me know
thanks
best
jeff
in that case
definitely baloney
thanks
steve
that helps clear things up enormously
at least in my little mind
best
jeff
bill
in order to assess
i need to understand the structure
what's the contract structure look like now
what are we proposed to change
including counterparties
what part of the existing contract required any puc approval and why
what is edison saying needs to happen at the puc
thanks

greetings justin and laura
as we discussed there is a significant coalition of folks working at the legislature to try to remove the prohibition on direct access included in hertzberg's ab0x and recently signed by the governor
simply put
it is clear that the prohibition will only be removed if the business community communicates clearly and unequivocally and vociferously to the legislature that direct access is a priority for business
and that the legislature must amend ab0x to permit direct access
i've attached the media plan developed by the pr firm that's working with arm
alliance for retail markets
to increase the focus on the need to re-instate direct access
the arm coalition of energy service providers has been the focal point of the ever-growing coalition that has developed
and continues to develop
around the direct access issue
in order to succeed
it is critical to get as many members of the silicon valley manufactures
group to join in the effort and participate actively
particularly in the media effort
my colleague sue mara has been a key player in the arm coalition and in the development of the medial effort
she can provide you with any information and/or assistance that you need and can also get you in contact with edelman
the pr firm directing the media effort
sue's number is 0.0.0
her email is smara@enron.com
and
as always
you can contact me at any time
0.0.0
looking forward to any participation that you folks can offer
all the best
jeff
whaddya mean
fyi
you're very sweet
thank you so much
do we want to position this as
let the market do it
cuz it can do it better than socalgas
but the market ain't going to do anything if you don't create an hospitable investment climate
hi laura

jeff
just talked to peevey
he told me that he and freeman personally worked with bilas on bilas
draft decision--the decision designed to make cdwr creditworthy and keep the puc from touching direct access until the legislature has a chance to fix the ab0x prohibition
i made the pitch re
decision does what it takes to fix the creditworthy issue and the commission needs to vote it out immediately
he said he agreed but expressed his general frustration with the decision making process generally
and said that he is not certain right now if the decision is greased to get voted out at the next commission meeting
he said that he's going to be talking to the governor this afternoon and will push the issue with him
i asked him to keep me updated
he said that he would
i told him that it wasn't helpful that the governor named names in new york regarding alleged agreements about
haircuts
particularly when folks are trying to negotiate deals with dwr
he wasn't aware of that and asked me to fax him the merril press
which i did
i'll also fax him our letter supporting the bilas decision

at a loss to figure out how in the heck your name disappeared from this mega-list
mike
day
as you know from the work with the da coalition
uc/csu is extremely interested in ensuring that the prohibition on da included in ab0x gets
fixed
in sb0x
of couse we'd ideally like to make sure that the language providing the
fix
makes it crystal clear that customers retain the right going forward
there's some concern that the
fix
language that's been floating around thus far needs some tightening to wring out the ambiguities
in that regard
mike smith is going to try to craft some language and forward it to you
we'll need to try to get mike
smith's
language into the draft that you're putting together based on last friday's meeting
preferably before you circulate the next draft to the da coalition

uc pioneers conservation two decades of innovations prepared campuses for energy price crunch when the state's energy crisis hit
the university of california was not caught with its fans running full blast
across the nine-campus uc system
$0 million has been spent over two decades on energy-saving devices
including new lighting
variable speed fans
even a system to harness waste gas from landfills to run boilers
so
with gov
gray davis calling for every california household and business to cut electricity use by 0 percent
uc offers a good model of conservation
despite rapid growth in the 0,0-student system in recent years
most campuses have held electricity consumption steady
and the university will net about $0 million in savings from the projects
we are fortunate to have on the campuses people with the religion
they have been working on this agenda since the oil embargo
said gary matteson
uc director of energy and utilities planning
but uc will need to do more
facing a 0 percent increase in the cost of natural gas
which powers the co-generators that produce electricity
the university is now asking the state for $0 million to fund additional conservation efforts
that way
uc could offset the increase in natural gas prices
as a state institution
uc has to reduce its electricity consumption by 0 percent of its base load
which is 0 megawatts at peak
and by 0 percent during stage 0 alerts
when state electricity reserves fall below 0 percent
uc has already exceeded the 0 percent reduction and matteson said he expects the system to be ready to meet the 0 percent goal by june 0
before the summer peak hits
like little cities
the campuses run around the clock
but laboratory lights that used to blaze continuously are now going dark when not needed
those in hallways have been dimmed or shut off when possible and the thermostats have been lowered
i almost stumble through some of the hallways
it is so dark
said keith roberts
energy engineer at uc davis
there are a lot of people who really want to help out
we are trying to do what we can without impacting the mission of the campus
at many campuses
daily e-mail alerts remind students
as well as employees
to open their window shades to light and warm their rooms and offices during the day
and to shut off computers and lights when they are not in use
at uc berkeley
freshman jon clingan
0
said signs have been posted in the hallways and bathrooms of the residence halls
imploring students to save electricity in their rooms and even to cut short their showers
i try to keep my light off as long as possible until it is just not possible to do work
clingan said
in addition to conserving energy
uc protected itself against skyrocketing electricity prices by signing a four-year contract in 0
along with the california state university system
with enron corp to buy electricity at the 0 rate minus 0 percent
in 0
systemwide co-generation plants were installed to produce sufficient energy for most university buildings and to pump an additional 0 megawatts into the state's electricity grid
that approach saved most of the uc campuses from falling victim during the state's rolling blackouts
although uc santa cruz went dark one day in january because its co-generation plant was out
market prices ahead still
uc officials are asking the legislature for extra money
warning that a systemwide natural gas bill is expected to rocket from $0 million last year to a projected $0 million this year
a contract for low-priced gas is expiring and uc will soon find itself paying market prices
that means uc will face having to raise dormitory fees
cut back on night and weekend classes and turn down the air conditioners in the summer
leaving classrooms sweltering
saying that that would be unacceptable
assemblywoman elaine alquist
d
santa clara
chair of the assembly higher education committee
called a hearing on the issue last month
i really wanted to hear how they were going to cope with the crisis
she said
uc is already negotiating with the state department of finance to get about $0 million for an additional list of energy efficiency and conservation projects that could save 0 megawatts within three years
reducing electricity means reducing reliance on natural gas
john baca
manager of the policy and strategic planning program for the office of energy assessments at the state department of general services
said higher education facilities tend to consume a lot of energy
they have experiments that just can't go off and they have a lot of flue hoods
and things like that
baca said
they have to have power for a lot of different things all the time
so there is still a lot of potential at the higher education level
but i think uc has done a really fantastic job
systemwide changes the efforts have been made across the system
uc santa cruz undertook an extensive conservation project that reduced electricity consumption in academic and administrative buildings by 0 percent
uc davis has spent about $0 million on conservation renovations during the past 0 years
saving at least $0 million a year
at uc berkeley
more than $0 million has been spent since 0 to improve energy efficiency on the campus by modifying and reducing light fixtures in older buildings
installing centrally located automated controls that can run heating and cooling equipment on a flexible schedule
and improving efficiency around heating pipes
our usage is only 0 percent above what it was in 0-0
said paul black
a senior engineer in the uc berkeley physical plant department
and if you think of all the computers added and also the air conditioners we have added to cool computer rooms and labs
that is good

jeff davis announces first round of long-term power contracts don thompson
associated press writer monday
march 0
0
0 associated press long-term contracts and other agreements to keep power flowing to customers of two financially ailing utilities
gov
gray davis announced monday
the deals will supply an average of nearly 0,0 megawatts per year for southern california edison and pacific gas and electric co
customers over the next 0 years and let the state buy power for far less than it has been paying on the costly spot market
davis said in a written statement
one megawatt is enough power for about 0,0 households
for the first five years
the contracts provide power at an average price of $0 per megawatt hour
about 0 percent below recent costs on the spot electricity market
davis said
the price drops to an average of $0 per megawatt hour
about 0 percent below spot prices
he said
``these agreements are the bedrock of a long-term energy solution
davis said in remarks prepared for delivery monday afternoon in los angeles
``the provide reliability at a reasonable price
some of the contract negotiations will result in accelerated power plant construction
adding an estimated 0,0 megawatts to the state grid within the next two years
some by this summer
davis said
the contracts amount to 0 percent of the long-term deals the davis administration has sought under a new law that lets the state spend an estimated $0 billion over a decade to buy power for edison and pg&e customers
davis has pitched such contracts as one way to lift california out of its energy crisis
negotiations have taken longer than expected
however
as his administration and power providers haggled over how much the state should pay
the davis administration wants to stop paying for power on the expensive spot market
where desperation to keep the lights on leads to inflated prices
on friday
the state released another $0 million to continue making such purchases on behalf of the state's two big cash-strapped utilities
bringing its spending so far to some $0.0 billion since early january
the agreements announced monday include more than 0 power suppliers
including electricity giants duke energy
calpine
dynegy
enron and reliant
davis declined to release details on individual contracts
duke energy said it has reached a $0 billion
nine-year agreement to sell electricity to the state
the memorandum of understanding calls for duke to provide 0 megawatts starting next jan
0
that's enough power for roughly 0,0 households
that amount would rise to 0 megawatts jan
0
0
enough electricity for the equivalent of 0,0 households
the contract would continue through ``we believe long-term contracts provide the critical underpinning for a stable electricity market and are happy the state is moving in that direction
bill hall
head of duke's california operations
said in a written statement
the state is buying about one-third of the power used by the customers of edison and pg&e
both have been denied credit by suppliers who fear the financially troubled utilities won't pay for the power
california plans to recover those costs by issuing $0 billion in revenue bonds in may
with the rest of that money going to finance the cheaper
long-term power contracts
in addition to the long-term contracts
the department of water resources has reached 0 agreements letting it buy a substantial amount of power on the day-ahead market
cutting the state's payment of premium prices on the real-time market
davis said
a stage 0 power alert was called monday morning with reserves threatening to drop to 0 percent due to power plant maintenance and low electricity imports
said patrick dorinson
spokesman for the independent system operator
the iso manages the state's power grid
i'm worried about the commercial guys---they're in a
rock no boats
mode in anticipation of perhaps signing the 0-year deal
i'll let you know what calger sez soon as he gets back to me

best
concur with harry
i.e
continue to take the position that the program should be available to all
when i was in sacramento last week at a meeting of all the players
the utilities argument against including da customers was based on
double dipping
i.e
payments to customers/esps for curtailment
plus payments to customers/esps for the re-sale of power to the iso resulting from the curtailment
the utilities
double dipping
argument is off base
as important
the state is facing the threat of frequent and severe supply disruptions this summer and it needs to take each and every step necessary to try to avoid them
the utility position
apart from being incorrect
seems pretty short-sighted given the dire circumstances
so seems clear that california should include both da and bundled customers in the program
best
jeff
no rush
but thought i'd throw this out there just ot get the ball rolling
looks at this point like any of the presentation dates work for me
so i don't necessarily have a preference
options for project
and i'm really just throwing stuff out there to stimulate thought
analyze aol/time warner merger my company
enron
is accused by some analysts of being nothing more than a merrill-lynch
or a morgan-stanley
or a goldman-sachs
etc
these analysts claim that we should therefore trade at multiples that are in line with the investment houses
we differ in that view
for a lot of reasons that i won't go into here
might be interesting to analyze strategies
differences
etc
anyway
just some thoughts to get the ball rolling
i'm open to just about anything

san diego team call
best
jeff
sue mara was correct on the call yesterday
while the puc meets regularly on thursdays
it appears they are having a meeting today at which the
bilas alternative
is up for a vote
our information is that there is some likelihood that the decision will be approved----but please don't hold your breath
we'll disseminate information just as soon as we get it
best
jeff
the notion that it would have to be a monthly analysis sounds like pure roger
and could likely be correct
but we need to determine whether we can get what we need by doing a
less precise
annual versus a
monthly
seems that once we've made that call
we direct the scenario and they do it
thoughts
best
jeff
attached is a rough draft of some scenario development around the px credit and rate issues
few points
apologies in advance for any errors and inaccuracies
given time crunch
the model developed is quite crude and will need refinement
to be sure
the bankruptcy scenario is included
scenario 0
but
again
given the time crunch
has not been analyzed to the same extent as the other scenarios
tribolet should be able to provide good insights there
however
the exposure has not been calculated since ga does not have the numbers
but ees should be able---once there's agreement on scenarios and probabilities---to run the numbers very quickly
i've assigned my view of what the probabilities are
these are key inputs and the team will need to scrub them thoroughly
for ease of use by all
and given time considerations
i've done the conceptual model in word format
rather than excel
it will be simple to translate this conceptual model to a spreadsheet model
in excel
best
jeff
great
see you there
of course
the commission just voted out one half of the
bilas alternate
the decision that got voted out included bilas
dwr-based language stating that the puc 0
would not second-guess dwr purchases and 0
would pass through dwr costs to customers
however
in a move led by commissioner carl wood
the decision removed the bilas language on direct access
the decision therefore did not include the bilas language staying any commission action on implementing the direct access prohibition
carl wood called including direct access
the height of arrogance
the decision was voted out 0-0
with the 0 remaining republicans dissenting
that said
the commission has no proposal before it implementing the prohibition
and there was no talk at the meeting of implementing the prohibition any time soon
best
jeff
tell me it ain't so
bob
hostile would be a gross understatement
if you would like to chat further let me know
best
jeff
fyi

apologies if i've missed any
best
jeff
thanks
steve
alan
any word from tim re
resource availability
see you all in houston
best
jeff
no
the decision would have prevented the commission from implementing the legislation that prohibits direct access
at least during the time that legislature and the direct access coalition work together to try to come up with a compromise to continue to allow direct access
so all this means is that the prohibition still has not been implemented and there currently is nothing before the commission to implement
sure would have been nice if the commission had passed it
though
also
did i tell you that i'm in a meeting all day tomorrow in houston and therefore can't do an update call with edward's
i can
however
do it on best
i won't be in class tonite
i'm open

but to tell you the truth
mark
the thought of comparing us and european accounting standards/practices makes me break out in a rash
if there's any way that we can focus on strategy
valuation
or other sorts of financial analyses that we've focused on in the course
that would be preferable from my perspective
best

i'll anxiously await your return

jeff
thank you
this

feds hint at power bill refunds firms ordered to justify high rates david lazarus and lynda gledhill
chronicle staff writers saturday
march 0
0
0 san francisco chronicle url
federal regulators warned power companies yesterday that they may have to refund $0 million to california ratepayers for charging unreasonable prices during recent electricity shortages
however
the federal energy regulatory commission left the door wide open for the unnamed 0 generators to avoid refund payments if they could offer
further justification
for why their rates should be considered fair
consumer activists were quick to note that the commission's order was significant
they have acknowledged for the first time that there has been abuse of the marketplace
said doug heller
assistant organizing director for the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights in santa monica
it's an acknowledgment that the power companies have been ripping us off
however
consumer groups also pointed out that the order
issued late in the day
was partly a political ploy intended to make the bush administration look more sympathetic to california's plight
the proposed $0 million refund also represents only a fraction of the billions of dollars that utilities have had to pay due to rising electricity rates
the commission set narrow parameters for power charges in january that may be considered unreasonable
it is only considering charges above $0 per megawatt hour during the series of stage 0 energy emergencies that threatened statewide blackouts
william massey
the lone commissioner who voted against the order
noted that of 0,0 power transactions in january above $0 per megawatt hour
only about 0,0 fall within the regulatory commission's parameters for potential refunds
this order is arbitrary
capricious and unlawful
he said
eighty percent of the transactions have been excluded from refunds
but commission chairman curt hebert characterized the order as an aggressive effort to safeguard california consumers
today's refund order demonstrates the commission's commitment to ensure appropriate and reasonable prices in the wholesale electricity market given the supply and demand imbalance in california
he said in a statement
power companies not worried gary ackerman
executive director of the western power trading forum
an energy-industry association in menlo park
said power companies are not worried about the prospect of having to pay out millions of dollars in refunds
the people i've talked to said they can justify the costs for a majority of hours where ferc said there may have been overcharges
he said
we will be supplying supporting data to ferc
said richard wheatley
a spokesman for reliant energy in houston
we commend them for doing this review
we believe this can be resolved and we can all move on
jan smutny-jones
president of the independent energy producers
a trade group representing out-of-state generators
said the commission's order shows that the system is working
in my opinion
what has been identified is talking about potential refunds
he said
the generators will have a chance to justify their rates
i'm not terribly troubled by that
the california independent system operator
which oversees the state's power grid
welcomed the order
although it said $0 million is lower than its own estimates of potential overcharges
the iso had asked the commission earlier this month to review $0 million in january power charges that exceeded the regulatory commission's
soft cap
of $0 per megawatt hour
a soft cap means the price can exceed the prescribed amount as long as a supplier can justify the charge
refund orders are rare
the granting of refunds by ferc is not a common occurrence
said charles robinson
the iso's general counsel
we're treading new ground
considering the potential ramifications of the order
the commission was oddly furtive in issuing its press release at the very end of the business week
the commission's press office already was closed by the time of the announcement
and the commissioners had left for the day
reached at his home
massey acknowledged that the commission was all but inviting power companies to bury the commission in paperwork to support their wholesale rates
welcome to the hebert chairmanship
he said
hebert was appointed head of the commission last month by president bush
since then
the regulatory commission and the bush administration have maintained a largely hands-off approach to california's energy crisis
we have said from the beginning that obviously the state of california has to address these problems and these challenges
u.s
energy secretary spencer abraham said this week
e-mail david lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com and lynda gledhill at
quick question to joe and/or christian
john and mary
i'm assuming that any deal we sign with dwr that falls below the $0/mwh soft cap is free and clear of the order ferc issued on friday as well as any other refund risk associated with ferc's december order
is that correct
thanks
best
jeff
greetings mark
here is the latest
ena signed a short-term deal
0
week term
i believe
with dwr that goes through the end of the month
at which time we have the option to extend the deal to a five-year term
we are discussing other longer-term deals
too
as steve points out
we've had serious concerns regarding dwr's creditworthiness
dwr
the dept
of water resources
is the state agency that davis made the purchaser of power when the utilities hit the financial skids a few months ago and the market stopped selling them power
the problem has been simple and significant---while our brilliant governor and legislature gave dwr the authority to buy power on behalf of the cash-strapped utilities
they neglected to t spell out how dwr would recover its costs of buying the power
based on comments from us and other suppliers regarding the creditworthiness issue
the california puc issued an order last week establishing that 0
the puc would indeed pass dwr's power costs through to ratepayers and 0
the puc would not second-guess
i.e
impose
reasonabless
standards
on any contracts signed by dwr as a condition of passing the costs through to ratepayers
with the cpuc decision
and other language that ena's negotiated into the dwr contract
ena is close to being comfortable signing the 0-year deal
even in the face of the ferc order
that's predominantly due to the fact that the power price in the 0-year deal would come in well under the $0/mwh threshold that ferc has set up for any sort of
refund review
but other things could crop up between now and the exercise date that could muck things up
i'll keep you posted on developments as they transpire
the big problem
as steve notes
is that the state is on the verge of
some say hell bent on
taking over the entire electricity industry in california in perpetuity
our original proposal focused on getting price volatility and the utilities
financial position back under control
our contracting proposals have always been couched in the context of a temporary
stop-gap measure
that is
the state would do the minimum amount needed via contracts to stabilize prices while simultaneoulsly doing what was necessary to get de-regulation back on track in california
and once the situation had been righted
the state would as soon as possible exit the industry and let the market step back in
unfortunately
command-and-control
anti-deregulation policymakers have taken hold of the agenda
with the blessing
seemingly
of the governor
and are moving the state toward a
takeover
response
that's what we're actively opposing
if you have any questions
don't hesitate

i've modified the last sentence in paragraph 0 to be what i think is a more accurate statement

it could instead prohibit further direct access arrangements as of the issuance of the order

the u.s
senate on wednesday rejected a bid to force california utility companies to repay power generators for electricity they bought under a federal government sales order
even if utilities go bankrupt
in a motion on the senate floor
lawmakers killed an amendment to a broader bankruptcy reform bill that opponents said was a dangerous proposal that would have opened the door to involuntary bankruptcy filings by troubled california utilities
the utilities in question are pg&e corp.'s

electric and edison international's
nyse:eix

southern california edison
the amendment was sponsored by oregon democrat sen
ron wyden
montana democrat sen
max baucus and oregon republican sen
gordon smith
proponents said the measure would have protected the customers of the federally-owned bonneville power administration and other northwest utilities from unfair rate increases due to the california energy crisis
``i don't think it's fair for consumers in other western states to get caught holding the bag if california utilities take our power and then run into bankruptcy court to avoid their debts
wyden said
``the northwest has been more than a good neighbor to california during this crisis
he said
interestingly
the california senate delegation was split on the matter
democrat dianne feinstein opposed the amendment
while fellow democrat barbara boxer supported it
feinstein called the proposal a ``dangerous amendment
that would create two classes of creditors and ``probably force an involuntary bankruptcy
the broader bankruptcy reform bill is expected to be approved by the senate by the end of the week
separately
talks between california and its three investor owned utilities on a deal under which the state might buy their transmission assets continued this week with no deal in sight
the state is negotiating with pg&e and edison
along with sempra energy

unit san diego gas and electric
the deals are aimed mainly at pumping money into pg&e and socal edison to keep them out of bankruptcy after they recorded about $0 billion in red ink since last spring
paying sky-high prices for power in the wholesale market

under the terms of the state's disastrous experiment with market deregulation
have been able to pass on to their retail customers only a fraction of their power purchase costs

nokia expects to meet earnings forecast despite lowered sales

nokia corp
said thursday that it expects to meet its earnings target for the first quarter of 0

nokia estimates it is likely to earn 0 european cents a share in the first quarter

shares of nokia were up $0.0

the company said it expects year-on-year sales growth in its networks division during the first quarter to be 0% to 0%

total sales growth is expected to be around 0%
the company said
that is lower than the 0% to 0% sales growth the company forecast in january

nokia said it now expects global handset sales for 0 to be between 0 million and 0 million units

recall that about 0 weeks we got a call from a ca puc staffer asking whether we'd switched a particular gas customer
or two
back to the ldc
we looked into it and discovered that we'd mistakenly switched the customer back due to a mix up about the fact that the customer had two active meters behind two different utilities
we informed the puc staffer of the mix-up and explained that the situation would be resolved
the questions from the staffer arose because the ca puc made a bad decision a couple of months ago
when gas prices ran up at the california border a lot of large
noncore
customers attempted to switch back to the utility tariff in the hope of lowering gas costs
in response
socalgas filed with the commission asking the puc to prohibit customers from switching back
the commission agreed and put the prohibition in place
the commission is now concerned that if suppliers terminate their contracts with customers
for whatever reason
or choose not to renew the contracts when they expire
customers won't have the option of returning to ldc service
today
i received a letter from the president of the commission asking me to respond to the following
have you
stopped selling and delivering natural gas to any non-core customers with whom you have an existing procurement contract
or
notified any of your non-core customers that you do not intend to renew an existing natural gas commodity procurement contract
if your company has stopped or intends to stop serving non-core customers
the cpuc also needs to know how many contracts you have terminated or expect to terminate the natural gas volumes involved the location of the non-core customer
s
the reason
s
your company intends or has already acted to terminate those contracts
there's a good chance that the letter from the president of the commission is linked to the fact that we've recently switched our electricity customers back to utility service in california
prior to deciding whether and how to respond to the commissioner
i'm trying to get handle on whether we're re-sourcing any gas retail customers to the utility prior to expiration
choosing not to renew contracts once they've expired

great points
teece---and the lion's share of the folks on the participants list---are advocates of a minimalist role for government
particularly where markets are a clear and preferably option
as in the case of electricity
that said
i think we're going to have to make a fundamental decision about what the goal of this
study
would be
which will determine
to a large degree
whether we choose to pursue it
i'll throw out for comment the notion that the study should be designed to serve one purpose
to influence the policy decision currently under debate
to de-regulate or not
as such
i wouldn't see issues like
pjm or apx
or
competitive default supplier or not
or
divest generation with vesting contracts or retain the assets
being the focus
that debate over critically important implementation details
would seem to come in
round 0
once the initial debate over
deregulate or not
is won
to try to do both
i.e
resolve in the broad policy issue and make the case for the specific
right
implementation plan
would arguably bog the study down
perhaps interminably
and it seems that time is of the essence in the current environment
in addition
unless the fundamental policy issue is won--and won rather quickly--debating implementation may be moot
of course
it will be impossible to avoid some level of dicussion on
how to do it
but that would not be the emphasis
in sum
i'd suggest for comment that it only makes sense to proceed---particularly since time is of the essence---if we focus on the high level policy level question of
to deregulate or not
and address implementation in a second
or follow up
study
i think we should try to make a call on this swiftly
since the
go/no go
decision would seem to flow from resolution of this issue

state's power purchases costlier than projected tab is $0 million a day over davis
requests lynda gledhill
chronicle sacramento bureau friday
march 0
0
0 san francisco chronicle sacramento
california has spent about $0 million more a day buying electrical power than originally projected
according to a confidential document obtained yesterday by the chronicle
state power buyers spent $0.0 billion between jan
0 and march 0
averaging $0 million a day
that amounts to about $0 million a day more than lawmakers figured using gov
gray davis
appropriations requests
the confidential document was prepared by the department of water resources
which purchases power on behalf of the state
it was handed to a group of lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing wednesday by water resources director tom to the public
the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much california is spending on power purchases
although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed
it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and assembly members who saw it
i don't think it was a surprise
said assemblyman dick dickerson
r
redding
although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity
analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term
for example
the state's power spending could jeopardize new education programs and transportation projects
the nonpartisan legislative analyst warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in davis
proposed budget
also
california has already been placed on a watch list by several credit rating firms
because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the utilities become financially stable
the watch list typically precedes a credit rating drop
which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans to rise
this
power purchasing
has a dampening effect
said jean ross
executive director of the california budget project
an independent policy group that tracks state spending
nobody knows where the economy is going
and how the energy crisis will affect it
so no one will know what the revenues will look like in the future
the biggest day of power buying happened on feb
0 when the state spent nearly $0 million for electricity
or $0 per megawatt hour
the smallest day was march 0 when the state buyers spent $0 million
or $0 per megawatt hour
michael worm
an analyst with the investment firm gerald klauer mattison
co
said what the state paid was in line with current energy prices
that's where energy prices more or less have been for quite some time
he said
of course
they are dramatically higher than they used to be
the governor's office has refused to release information on how much the state has spent
said steve maviglio
davis
spokesman
maviglio said if generators found out how much the state spent the day before
they could force up the price the next day
but assemblyman tony strickland
r-thousand oaks
said the public had a right to know how its money way being spent
people need to know exactly what it is costing to keep the lights on
he said
we want to know the whole story
not just pieces
strickland
along with media organizations including the chronicle
have filed public records act requests to obtain information on how much the state has spent
along with the details of long-term power contracts signed by davis
the original bill that authorized the state to purchase power appropriated only $0 million
but allowed the governor to use up to $0 billion if needed for power purchases by notifying lawmakers
the governor's office has sent five letters since feb
0 to lawmakers notifying them that additional money was needed
based on these letters
which in total have requested an additional $0.0 billion
the news media and lawmakers estimated that the state was spending $0 million a day
$0 million less than the actual costs shown on the water resources document
since the state began purchasing electricity
the health of its budget has become dependent on a variety of things to come
making it as fragile as a house of cards
the money spent on power is taken from the state's general fund and is supposed to be returned through the issuance of state bonds
the bonds will be paid for with a portion of the rates that utility customers pay every month

folks please weigh in and add/subtract/modify if needed
the customer's glad to have had the option to take direct access service from enron because having the opportunity to take advantage of the offer has made the customer better off
direct access is an extremely important option that customers need
want and should have going forward
any
solution
that the legislature comes up with must therefore include the continuation of direct access for all customers
as such
the legislature should immediately fix ab 0x to make sure that direct access remains a permanent fixture of california's energy strategy
direct access customers should not be forced to pay for dwr's power purchase costs
since direct access customers aren't benefitting from those purchases

calif gop lawmakers ask puc president to resign los angeles
dow jones
california assembly republicans have called for the resignation of loretta lynch
president of the state's public utilities commission
saying they have no confidence that the state's top regulator will
play a constructive role in solving the state's energy crisis
assembly republican minority leader bill campbell
r-villa park
sent a letter tuesday to gov
gray davis on behalf of the assembly's republican caucus asking davis to call for lynch's resignation
with efforts to solve california's energy crisis floundering in the midst of unpaid bills
stalled negotiations and rolling blackouts
it has come time to ask for the resignation of your appointed president of the california public utilities commission
loretta lynch
the letter said
both lynch and a spokesman for davis were unavailable for comment
lynch
a former attorney
was appointed president of the puc by davis in march 0
she is the state's top regulator
in charge of regulating utilities
telecommunications
commercial transportation and water companies
before her appointment to the puc
lynch was head of davis's office of planning and research
the letter says the puc had a number of opportunities last summer to keep the electricity crisis from spiraling out of control by allowing edison international

nearly $0 lower than the new long-term contracts davis said the state entered into recently with generators
lynch's failure to
ensure that the commission's aug
0
0
emergency order on long-term contracts was quickly implemented has placed the state budget at risk for costs now at least 0% higher
the letter said
this hesitancy in a crisis will cost california's economy tens of billions of dollars during the next 0 years
the state has spent more than $0 billion since january buying power in the spot market
davis has asked lawmakers for another $0 million from the general fund to continue buying power
if the $0 million is granted
the state's commitment to power purchases will surpass $0 billion
state sen
steve peace
d-el cajon
however
said last week that the senate budget committee will deny further requests for funding unless the puc carves out a revenue stream for the state's department of water resources
the agency that is now buying the bulk of the state's power on behalf of the cash-strapped utilities
the puc was expected to release guidelines last week on rates the dwr can receive from utilities to pay back the general fund and to issue revenue bonds to pay for long-term contracts
but the guidelines haven't yet been released
last year
the puc said the utilities could enter into limited long-term supply contracts to hedge their positions against price spikes
but the commission also said it feared if the utilities signed long-term deals with generators
liquidity in the wholesale market would be reduced
the republican lawmakers said the commission is responsible for nearly forcing the utilities into bankruptcy
we have no confidence that loretta lynch will play a constructive role in solving the energy crisis in the weeks and months ahead
the letter said
with wall street nervous about repayment of the $0 billion in revenue bonds needed to cover the state's energy purchases
the cpuc has been unable to perform an adequate assessment of the investor-owned utilities

utilities
demand blocks bailout negotiations hit snag
pg&e
edison want end to price freeze if they sell transmission lines to state david lazarus
chronicle staff writer wednesday
march 0
0
0 san francisco chronicle url
california's near-bankrupt utilities are demanding that higher electric rates be a part of any deal to sell the state their power lines
the chronicle has learned
a rate increase
perhaps of more than 0 percent
according to earlier industry estimates
would certainly draw a firestorm of protest from consumer groups and force gov
gray davis to backtrack from earlier pledges that rates would remain unchanged
nevertheless
sources close to negotiations on the deal said pacific gas and electric co
and southern california edison are attempting to make higher rates a condition for agreeing to a bailout scheme in which they would sell the state their transmission systems and some land
the sources said the talks hit a new snag this week when state officials realized that fine print sought by the companies could require the public utilities commission to pass along all of the utilities
costs to ratepayers
the sources said this would end a rate freeze that shields consumers from runaway wholesale electricity prices
the inclusion of potential rate increases in the talks reflects the growing complexity of a deal originally intended by davis to stabilize the finances of pg&e and edison so banks would resume loans to the cash-strapped utilities
the negotiations subsequently have expanded to involve a state purchase of the utilities
transmission networks and acquisition of utility-owned land
including spectacular coastal property near pg&e's diablo canyon nuclear power plant
now they also have embraced further deregulation of california's dysfunctional electricity market
clearly
one of the terms being discussed is the regulatory environment
said joseph fichera
head of saber partners
a new york investment bank that is advising davis in the talks
the past situation has not worked well
he added
the utilities want some certainty about their future
tentative deal with edison to date
the governor has announced a tentative agreement with edison for the state to buy the utility's power lines for almost $0 billion
discussions with pg&e for a similar accord have dragged on for weeks
an edison official
asking that his name be withheld
acknowledged yesterday that an end to the rate freeze is an expected result of the power
line sale
once the details of the pact are complete
dominoes will fall
the official said
one of the dominoes is the rate freeze
a pg&e spokesman declined to comment
in fact
both edison and pg&e have been aggressively seeking an end to the rate freeze for months
the two utilities have a lawsuit pending in federal court demanding that the puc immediately raise rates so the utilities can recover almost $0 billion in debt accrued as a result of the freeze
they have been trying a lot of things to get the rate freeze ended in various forms
said carl wood
who sits on the puc
adding it to the present talks is consistent with past behavior
wall street has taken note that the negotiations no longer appear to be making progress
paul patterson
an energy industry analyst at credit suisse first boston
told clients on monday that the discussions
may have lost some momentum in recent days
he did not give a reason
for his part
the governor sounded unusually cautious about the course of the talks when asked late last week if a breakthrough was imminent
secret sticking points
we are going to take the transmission systems and the land that's deeded
and we will work out an agreement
davis said at an appearance in san jose
but there are a number of sticking points in the talks with pg&e that i'm not going to reveal
one of those sticking points apparently is an insistence that the sale of utility assets include a long-sought lifting of the rate freeze
sources said lawyers from both pg&e and edison had inserted the related terms into draft accords affecting each utility
and that the full impact of the additions was not realized by state officials until this week
one source said the language was just convoluted enough to slip beneath the radar screen of state negotiators
but the upshot
once the words had been parsed
was that the puc effectively would lose control over power rates
creditworthiness on the table in edison's case
the terms of the tentative deal include the governor asking the puc
to support the creditworthiness
of the utility
this would ensure that future investments in both utility distribution and utility generation plants are provided fair returns of and on capital
consistent with current authorized returns and capital structure provisions
it says
sources said the provision could be interpreted as a guarantee from the state that edison would be permitted to recoup all outstanding costs from ratepayers
there may be some assumptions about this language that the rate freeze ends if it is adopted
the edison official said
adding that he saw no reason to disagree with such assumptions
but fichera
davis
adviser in the talks
insisted that nothing is set in stone
and that the negotiations are proceeding without a hitch
this is a very complex transaction
he said
god and the devil are in the details

puc considers rewarding producers that sign long-term contracts greg lucas

sacramento
some cash-strapped producers of wind
solar and other alternative forms of energy will get long-delayed financial relief under a proposed order by state regulators
gov
gray davis said yesterday evening
a proposed order by the public utilities commission is designed to reward energy producers who sign long-term contracts with utilities at lower rates
alternative energy producers that voluntarily enter such contracts
which would start on april 0
would be paid within 0 days
said davis
who requested the order
those that do not would have to wait until the utilities that buy their power return to solvency
davis blasted pacific gas
electric co
and southern california edison for not paying the alternative generators
know as qualified facilities
or
qfs
even though the companies have been collecting money through rates
it is wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket and withhold the money designed to compensate the qfs
davis said
it's immoral and has to stop
alternative producers
ranging from massive co-generation facilities at oil refineries to tiny biomass plants
produce about a third of the state's supply of electricity
but many are shutting down because utilities have not paid them since november
the loss of some 0,0 megawatts from tapped-out alternative energy producers contributed to the blackouts that snarled california yesterday and monday
according to the independent system operator
which manages the state's power grid
the puc's proposed order
which will be considered at the board's tuesday meeting
offers the generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract at $0 per megawatt or a 0-year deal at $0 per megawatt
davis said
the order does not address the more than $0 billion already owed to the more than 0 alternative energy producers around the state
davis said to favor one creditor over another in past debt could bring on bankruptcy proceedings from other creditors
the legislature would also need to act to make the order work
it is critical to keep these facilities up and online
said sen
debra bowen
d-marina del ray
who estimates that edison has $0.0 billion in cash on hand
and pg&e $0.0 billion
the utilities owe it to the people of the state to pay them
edison said yesterday that it opposed any attempt to place alternative producers ahead of their other creditors
but tom higgins
a senior vice president for edison international
which owes alternative producers some $0 million
said his company was talking to the governor's office about possible payment structures
alternative energy producers
particularly those that use high-priced natural gas to fire their generators
say that without an immediate infusion of cash they must close their plants
we've been obsessed with the health of the utilities and
have
forgotten the health of everyone else
said v
john white
legislative director of the clean power campaign
which lobbies for alternative energy producers
calenergy operating corp
which operates eight geothermal plants in the imperial valley producing 0 megawatt hours for edison has sued the utility asking to be paid and to be temporarily released from their contract with edison which has paid them nothing since november
calenergy has a court hearing tomorrow on its edison contract
edison owes the company $0 million
and the debt increases by $0 million a day
we've lived up to our end of the bargain but edison hasn't
we're now not in a position to make a property tax payment on april 0 and we're the largest employer in the county
said vince signorotti
calenergy's property manager
unlike edison
pg&e is paying its creditors 0 cents on the dollar
we have offered over the past five days to prepay for future power not yet delivered to keep as many of them operating as possible
but the state needs to decide how its going to divvy up the limited money under the frozen rates
said john nelson
a pg&e spokesman
the puc's sudden attempt to recast the rates paid to alternative generators comes after several months of inaction
partly a result of waiting for legislative negotiations on the issue to conclude
those negotiations eventually failed to move forward

california governor blames utilities for blackouts by jennifer coleman
associated press gov
gray davis said the state's two largest utilities are partly to blame for this week's widespread blackouts because they failed to pay millions of dollars owed to environmentally friendly power generators
davis said the utilities took money from customers while failing to pay the alternative plants
which use renewable forms of energy like steam and natural gas to generate electricity
the state has been spending about $0 million a day since january to buy power for customers of southern california edison and pacific gas and electric co
which are so credit-poor that suppliers refuse to sell to them
it's wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket this money and not pay the generators
the governor said at a capitol news conference tuesday
they've acted irresponsibly and immorally and it has to stop
the state lost about 0,0 megawatts
or enough electricity to power 0.0 million homes
on tuesday from alternative energy plants that say they can't afford to keep operating because the utilities haven't paid their bills in weeks
davis said the puc planned to issue an order next week directing the utilities to pre-pay future bills to the alternative plants
pg&e called gray's statements
inappropriate and unjustified
adding that it was negotiating a payment plan with the suppliers
edison said it is intent on paying creditors and working with the public utilities commission to pay the plants for future power sales
edison and pg&e say they have lost more than $0 billion since last june to climbing wholesale electricity prices
which the state's 0 deregulation law prevents them from passing on to ratepayers
keepers of the state's power grid were cautiously optimistic that california might get through wednesday without another day of rolling blackouts after two idle plants were returned to service
never say never
but it appears we are going to be in better shape tomorrow
wednesday
and for the rest of the week
said patrick dorinson
a spokesman for the california independent system operator
which oversees most of the state's power grid
about a half-million customers were hit by tuesday's blackouts
which snarled traffic and plunged schools and businesses into darkness from san diego to the oregon border
on tuesday
assembly republican leader bill campbell called on puc president loretty lunch to resign
lynch was appointed by davis
lynch couldn't be reached for comment
but a spokesman for the governor dismissed campbell's complaints
meanwhile
a leading lawmaker on energy issues said the puc may soon have to raise rates by about 0 percent to cover the state's costs and its utilities
bills
my sense is that people will appreciate having some certainty and being able to plan for it
said assemblyman fred keeley
they don't have to like it
but i think they'll appreciate it
davis has said he is confident the utilities and the state can pay their bills without further rate increases
in the meantime
the iso is counting on conservation to avoid more rolling blackouts
dorinson estimated that conservation accounted for about 0 megawatts in savings during tuesday's peak usage
that probably was the difference today in helping us avoid any rolling blackouts late into the evening
dorinson said
tuesday's outages began at 0:0 a.m
and continued in 0-minute waves until about 0 p.m
when the iso lifted its blackout order
they were blamed for at least one serious traffic accident
the blackouts were caused by a combination of problems
including unseasonably warm weather
reduced electricity imports from the pacific northwest
numerous power plants being shut down for repairs and the loss of power from alternative generators
mike
here are my comments
apologies for the fact that they are quick and dirty
all enron's public statements that i have read
including
i think
statements made to financial analysts
state that our exposure in california is not
material
dennis
declaration says that the situation in california has been a
financial disaster
that
enron has lost over $0 million
and that
enron stands to lose millions more
the losses are described as
huge
perhaps this is information that has since been communicated to the market
but i'm not aware of it
and if it hasn't
it could represent a significant conflict with previous statements
seems prudent to run this by ir and perhaps others before releasing
regarding the statements about our hedging strategy
it would seem prudent to run this through the organization for comment and discussion prior to making public
very minor technical point--i don't think that ab 0 was passed
unanimously
i think that there was 0 nay vote
the statement is made that
the utilities were required to sell off most of their generating capacity
the utilities were only required to sell off 0/0 of their fossil-fired plants
which i think at the time may have amounted to about
0-.0 of their total gen assets
they chose voluntarily to sell of the remainder of their fossil-fired plants
it is stated that stranded costs are
investments in imprudent power generation facilities
these investments were in fact found in the past to be prudent by the puc
would therefore not seem accurate to call them imprudent now
is it now
virtually impossible to manage commodity risk
in california
just wondering if judge might view the statement as overstating the situation somewhat
from a pr perspective
i'm wondering if we want to characterize re-sourcing uc/csu in the following manner
it was actually a relatively easy decision to make
makes enron sound perhaps excessively hard-nosed

i have but one life to give for my industry
please see my comments on dennis
declaration---got some serious concerns
can you give me a ring when you get a minute 0.0.0
thanks
jeff
i'm available
i have another call at 0 am pst
jeff
when are comments due
i think that it's a good idea
the only red flag is the perception of marketers being in the same room together
however
from my perspective
though it's a significant concern
it's one that can be addressed
i would suggest running the notion by sanders and yoder to get their take
best
jeff
chapter five but i can't remember the name of the case
home manufacturers
or some such thing
have you checked the web site for the questions
hi professor
could you let me know if you receive this
i've been sending you emails lately and
having gotten no response
am concerned about whether there's some sort of problem on my end
your end
or both
thanks very much

class on thursday
something that we can talk about in mexico
i'm here
yes
we'll be talking about roi
too
i'll let karen know
figure that she'll likely bring a couple of people
mind if i ask trish and john
i agree with pat's suggestions
thanks very much for the great work
jeanne
particularly given the short notice
best
jeff
yes
that's the assignment
i don't have the questions with me to fax
or the case
questions might be on the website
fyi
just got a call from someone inside mckenzie
co
seems the good governor has figured out that the gas industry is a problem and want to talk to me about it
i'm scheduled to talk to them by phone friday at 0:0
i called kari dohn to try to find out more
she told me that they've figured out that the gas industry is a mess
that
mckenzie gets it
and she asked to tell it like it is
seems useful to get our view across to them
the name of the person from mckenzie that will be on the call with the davis folks on friday is daniel poller

see highlighted portion
we should throw this back at davis next time he points the finger
they must have realized that loretta could use some pr help
hi laura
is it possible to get a copy of the report
thanks
best
jeff
no
yes for pg&e
no for socalgas
agreed
i think that we can expect a strategy focused on saying
we don't owe you anything
you've illegally hiked prices
eeks
i'm sorry
what does this mean
i don't quite understand the code
greetings
unfortunately
i'll be in mexico getting the mexican version of hoof and mouth
bummer
of course
the highlight of the semester for me was seeing ms deepika at squaw last weekend
we should commit to a ski trip next year
best
jeff
will do
do you know yet who will be on the call from your end
thanks
best
jeff
hey
neville
fyi

mike kahn's best buddy
environmental issues and the permitting will be the biggest
and could be very big
obstacles---particularly given the santa barbara location
e.g
channel islands
etc
might be a good idea to have ga look into that side of things
if we feel that can be overcome
then the next big deal will be getting transportation agreements with socalgas
finally
the issue you raised steve---will davis want to be the counterparty
will loom somewhat large
overall sounds like an exciting idea/opportunity
best
jeff
that answers it
thanks very much

court gives green light to green generator to suspend edison contract
sell electricity elsewhere business wire
copyright
0
business wire
today that a geothermal energy supplier in the imperial valley can temporarily sell its electricity on the open market despite its long-term contracts with southern california edison
because edison has breached the contract by failing to pay for any output since nov
0
cal energy operating corp
operates a complex of geothermal plants near the salton sea
the plants filed suit feb
0 in imperial county superior court seeking back payment from edison and authorization to suspend their contracts with edison and sell power elsewhere in california during such time edison is unable to pay for power demand
david l
sokol
chairman of cal energy
said
we applaud this short-term solution that will provide us with a revenue lifeline and keep our clean
renewable power flowing to californians
it is unfortunate that it took court action to provide us some relief from an intolerable situation
sokol noted that the ruling did nothing to assure that the plants collect approximately $0 million edison owes them for power they have produced since nov 0
the geothermal plants will continue to pursue legal and legislative remedies to receive back payment
he said
that debt will continue to place a great strain on our operation
he added that edison has continued to collect tens of millions daily from ratepayers and has amassed approximately $0 billion in cash
on the open market
the geothermal plants will be able to receive on the spot market higher prices than renewable generators agreed to accept in negotiations with the state
edison and pg&e
that lower price had been incorporated in senate bill 0x
which stalled in the state legislature after edison withdrew its support
and has effectively been incorporated in the california public utility commission's proposed order
california taxpayers will pay the difference
because the state is buying electricity on the open market on behalf of edison and pg&e
it is unfortunate that taxpayers will now be paying more for our electricity
sokol said
that is the result of inaction by the state and bad faith by edison
we negotiated with the full blessing and knowledge of the governor and the legislature to arrive at long-term pricing that would assure reliable supply and save taxpayers billions
this pricing for our clean
renewable energy was less than the state is paying out-of-state fossil-fuel energy providers in long-term contracts
and less than half what we are allowed under federal law
sokol added that he was encouraged by the governor's march 0 announcement proposing legislation and action by the california public utility commission that would require edison and pg&e to begin paying current bills for electricity received from qualifying facilities such as calenergy
but
sokol cautioned
while we are hopeful that this legislative and regulatory action can move forward quickly
there are many details to be worked out in the governor's proposal
even with quick action
there is a serious question whether edison is willing to pay any of its current bills from qualifying facilities
he noted that
like today's court ruling
the governor's proposal provides no plan or schedule to require edison to pay the approximately $0 million edison owes for power calenergy has delivered to date
calenergy's geothermal complex employs about 0 workers and produces a total of 0 megawatts
enough to supply 0,0 homes
geothermal plants and other generation from renewable sources provide about 0 percent of california's electricity
enough for 0 million homes
geothermal plants produce environmentally friendly electricity from wells that tap superheated water 0,0 to 0,0 feet underground
magma rising in fissures in the earth's crust heats the water to 0-0 degrees fahrenheit
the generating plants convert the water to
live
steam
the pressure of which turns turbines to produce electricity
the plants then return the slightly cooled water to the subterranean reservoir for reheating as a renewable resource
calenergy is one of 0 members of the renewable energy creditors committee
a group of green power suppliers who formed the committee on feb
0 to explore options to collect back payments from edison
together
the group is owed more than $0 million by edison
note to editors
david sokol will discuss today's ruling in a media teleconference at 0:0 p.m
pst today
march 0
call 0/0-0 and enter code 0
identify the calenergy conference
yes
it's technically true
but it doesn't seem relevant
it's a technicality
that is
if at the end of the contract
uc/csu goes to another provider
the rules would require enron to
de-dasr
after which the new provider would submit the new dasr to switch the customer over
the utility stands in the middle of all this
i don't think this equates to what uc/csu is claiming the problem is
might be viewed as a bit
cute
by the judge
also
the legislation
fixing
the prohibition passed our of policy committee today in sacramento and is moving through the legislature
best
jeff
this is yet another
tangible case of why price caps don't and can't help
they can and will only make matters worse
caps are a policy chainsaw when a scalpel is needed
the result of the caps being imposed on qfs by davis and the legislature will be shut downs and bankruptcy
which will reduce supply and decrease reliability----the exact opposite of what the state needs to be doing
fyi
i listened in to sokol's conference call yesterday re
court case freeing calenergy from the qf contract
sokol blasted edison over and over
e.g
accumulated war chest of over $0 billion in cash
sokol said that
at least for the time being
this lessens the need for calenergy specifically to force an involuntary
be interesting to see if other qfs take similar tack
sokol also said that calenergy has sold the power to el paso---lot's of press questions about price and where the power's headed
i.e
in our out of state
he said he expects to get a
market price
from el paso and that if the
prices are higher out of state

i spoke yesterday with president lynch's gas advisor and the puc staffer who first got in touch with us regarding inquiries from our customer regarding whether we were returning customers to the ldcs
i described our activities generally
and explained that the originial inquiry from our customer stemmed from a mix-up
on our part
that has since been cleared up
both seemed satisfied
appreciated the call and the information and will get back to me regarding whether we'll need to submit a formal response to president lynch's letter
i said that our preference was not to respond formally
but would be happy to do so
i asked them to contact me directly should they receive any other inquiries from our customers
thanks to all for the help in responding
please keep me in the loop on our marketing activities

if i hear anything about customers calling the puc
i'll let you know

gas hearings ever resume
michele
i apologize

please forward my apologies to your colleagues and tell them i'm very sorry an any inconvenience that i caused
best
jeff
i'm on vacation next week
but would be happy to get together first thing the following week to discuss
also
in response to a voicemail that i received
wanted to let folks know that the cpuc did not hold gas hearings today
the legislature is
however
holding hearings
taking a
comprehensive view
of the industry
i.e
focusing on specific allegations of pipeline capacity
price gouging
they held their first hearing today
but it got cut short due to activities underway in the legislature
i believe that
prior to cutting the hearing short
the legislature only made it through two panels of customers
who told stories of skyrocketing bills and associated hardship
one panel participant
anastacio andrade of sunrise mushrooms
i believe
waived an ees bill and described how it tripled between november and december
i have a feeling that the legislature's actions may be prompting the puc to appear that it's doing something
i'll report more on the legislative hearings as they occur

davis faces dire political consequences if power woes linger byline
by daniel borenstein body
walnut creek
calif
_ as democrats prepare for their first statewide convention since the electricity crisis erupted
some elected officials and strategists are warning of dire political consequences if gov
gray davis fails to clean up the power mess
all of us should be thinking about the effect the energy crisis is going to have on our chances of maintaining control of both houses
and the effect the governor will have on the ticket up and down
said state sen
don perata
d-alameda
if he has not performed well and he has a d after his name
that could be problematic
garry south
the governor's top political strategist
said thursday that the state's electricity woes probably won't be over soon
but the voters understand davis didn't create the problem
it won't be solved in six months
south said
this is an immediate problem that is not susceptible to an immediate solution
this is a several-year process to get this situation back under control
as for the governor's critics
i think they should be asked to produce their own plan
it's awful easy to take pot shots
but most of those who i read about in the newspapers have no plan
the intraparty sniping on the eve of the party convention highlights the frustration democrats are feeling about the crisis_and its potential political damage
four months ago
this weekend's convention in anaheim seemed certain to be a davis fete
although democrats had lost the presidency
al gore easily carried california and the party was in firm control of the legislature and the state's congressional delegation
davis had led the gore effort in california and the governor was personally and politically popular across the state
this would have been the convention for him to showcase his achievements for education
the issue he had promised to make the hallmark of his first term
but electricity now overshadows everything else
to be sure
the governor will tout his policy achievements during a saturday morning speech to the convention delegates
and he is not shying away from the spotlight
tonight
he will host a party for the delegates at disney's california adventure theme park
that prompted one democratic consultant from sacramento who won't be attending to quip
we're in fantasy land here
thank you
we don't need to go to disneyland for that
some are shaking their heads in disbelief at how the governor has handled the events of the past week
in many ways
he appears to have gone politically tone deaf
said sherry bebitch jeffe
political analyst at claremont graduate university
his instincts are not serving him well
while his top aides were meeting with legislators last week to warn them that a $0 billion bond package won't be enough to get the state out of the crisis
davis was at a $0,0-per-person palm springs golf tournament to raise money for his re-election campaign
when his hand-picked members of the public utilities commission this week approved an electricity rate hike that experts have been predicting for months
davis claimed that he didn't know about the plan before it was announced and that he thought it was premature
other democrats
however
thought the commission action was overdue
i'm glad to see the puc stepping out and doing something along the lines that some of us have been talking about needing to be done for the last six or eight weeks
said state sen
tom torlakson
d-antioch
there's a high level of frustration
there haven't been clear answers to what the solution is
south
the davis political strategist
said a lot of factors are outside the governor's control
no one can predict with any certainty where this is going to go
and no one can predict when this situation is going to be brought under control
we don't control the generators
we don't control the ferc
federal energy regulatory commission
we don't control what wall street is going to do
as for the potential political fallout
south said the governor and democrats remain in a strong position
after all
he said
the deregulation plan was pushed through by a republican governor and republicans in washington are blocking efforts to cap prices
jack pitney
government professor at claremont mckenna college
predicted davis could weather the electricity crisis
people who are following it know it's roots run deeper than the davis administration and the republicans don't have any plausible alternatives
he said
my read of public opinion is people don't think there's a simple and easy solution and they're not expecting one
they may be impatient but they won't necessarily take it out on
davis
it's too early to predict the political outcome
said mark baldassare
pollster at the public policy institute of california
the impacts won't be clear until people have gone through a few billing cycles and we've gone through the summer blackouts
until we see what the personal impacts are so we know what the political impacts are
he said
that's the really crucial period for gray davis
political future
after this summer

the church is on a square
there's a lot of very nice cafesand restaurants
and it's the site of the famous

fashion centerwhile you're over there
wander to the montparnasse neighborhood and stop iat the
rosebud
bar
hemmingway and the gang drank there
it's small
thwaiters where little white coats and they play real vinyl records of the best jazz anywhere
best of all
it's not pretentious
it's hip
also there is a cemetery where many famous folks are buried
including serggainsbourg
cemeteries are of course a big deal in paris
the most notabbeing the pere lachaise cemetery
where jim morrison is buried
they're interesting enough
but i don't know if i'd go out of my way
in the latin quarter
0th arrond
check out
l'ecluse
right on the riverat the quai les grands augustins
just off boulevard st
michel
little wibar with tasty things to nibble on
great place to take a breather in thelate afternoon
somewhat
in style
the picasso museum in the
marais0 neighborhood is an absolute must
and while you,re there be sure to cruise the neighborhood
very gentrified these days
and it,s the gay neighborhood
but been renovated into a lot of vimpressive art galleries and fashion houses---very neat
while there
in the same neighborhood
go to the
place des vosges.0 unreal big old square from way back when---great to look at and there,s shops acafes
architechturally magnificent and the exhibits inside are modest and very impressive
rue de la roquette is now extremely hip---on the east side of the bastillebehind the
new opera0
if you get a chance go an opera there---very populist experience and fun
roquette is where the clubs and the musique are
general hip-dome
and if you,re inclined to do some real people-watching
go to boulevard st
germain and sit outside at les deux magots or caf
fleureand watch away
find on your map the church st
eustache
walk around east of it for somevery cool neighborhood viewing*used to be big wholesale butchers and suc
extension of les halles
which is now a big shopping mall but used to beparis
outdoor market
from there walk to
place des victoires
or place des notre dame des victoires
i can,t remember
and look for gallerievivienne

and finally
while your over there
go to the palais royale
by the louvre
which is where louis xiv grew up as a boy---fantastic courtyard

hi jason
per my voice mail
here's the package of materials for customers to use to make sure key policy makers know that maintaining customer choice in california is critical
as i mentioned in the voice mail
the legislature's likely to move this week on a variety of fronts
so it's important that the business community make its voice heard immediately and clearly
if you could forward this along to the svmg members
it would be very helpful to the fight for cusomer choice and greatly appreciated
information on how to contact the key legislators is included
also included are
form
letters that folks can print out
sign
and send
if you have any questions
don't hesitate to give me a call at 0.0.0
best
jeff
fyi
she's forwarding around the valley
and i'll follow up to make sure that she's having chambers sign and send
best

my understanding is that it's languishing but still has a decent chance of getting through
the question is when
i'll try to get some more firm information and get back to you later in the afternoon
best
jeff
any news from the litigation front with uc/csu
this should help prentice's chances for employment come the fall
you guys should have a huge phone bill on your room charges

politicians seek shelter as energy armageddon looms
published april 0
0
there's been a subtle but unmistakable shift in the political atmosphere that envelops california's energy crisis
politicians have concluded that the crisis is largely beyond their control and the die is more or less cast
whatever fate decrees
massive summer blackouts
soaring utility bills or even the bankruptcy of the state's utilities
will happen
and politicians from gov
gray davis downward are scrambling to insulate themselves from voters
anger and single out rivals for blame
no one is saying that publicly
of course
but the fatalistic mood is very apparent in the capitol
whose denizens have dropped their preoccupation with energy and moved to other matters
legislative committees are working on the hundreds of bills that had been stalled for three months while the special committees that had been holding almost daily sessions on the energy crisis have gone into semihibernation
last weekend's democratic state convention in anaheim was dominated by fears that when the crisis hits home
the party's dominance of the capitol will backfire
just remember jimmy carter
state controller kathleen connell warned fellow democrats
adding that they will have
no excuses
for perceived failure to deal with the crisis forthrightly
we will be accountable on election day 0
she said
next year's elections are very much on davis
mind
since he'll be seeking a second term and polls indicate that his approval ratings have declined sharply in recent weeks
he devoted much of the weekend to defending his actions
saying
i believe we've moved at warp speed to address this problem
and trying to pin blame on republicans
republicans
meanwhile
sense that the crisis gives them an avenue of escape from the dungeon of irrelevancy to which they had been exiled by heavy losses in the last three elections
the only remaining statewide gop officeholder
secretary of state bill jones
is running for governor by accusing davis of mismanagement
and republican assembly members dumped their leader
bill campbell
on grounds that he had been insufficiently aggressive vis-a-vis davis
the political positioning reflects the reality that the crisis shows every sign of worsening
although davis
office is distributing a brochure entitled
meeting the energy challenge
to defend the governor's actions
it's apparent that none of the steps the governor has taken is bearing much fruit
the state is spending at least $0 million a day on emergency power purchases
but what was supposed to be a short-term program has evolved into a monthslong drain on the state's rapidly shrinking budget reserves
the long-term supply contracts that were supposed to replace daily spot purchases have bogged down
and without firm contracts and a revenue stream to pay for them
wall street is reluctant to market the bonds the state wants to float
many authorities now believe davis
decision to step into the power purchase market in january was a strategic error because it gave power suppliers a deep new pocket to tap just as the utilities themselves ran out of credit
davis
meanwhile
is refusing to embrace a rate increase approved by the state public utilities commission
which sends a mixed message to wall street
and efforts to resolve problems with unpaid bills from power generators and have the state acquire the utilities
intercity transmission grid have stalled
perhaps permanently
the crisis may careen totally out of control as summer arrives
raising the specter of elderly and/or ill californians dying from having their air conditioners or medical equipment shut down
and the utilities are closer to bankruptcy now than at any other point in the nearly yearlong crisis
plan a isn't working
and there is no plan b
except for bankruptcy
with armageddon looming
politicians have retreated into the bunker
hoping to protect themselves from what could be a firestorm of anger

the iso would especially like to thank the participants that submitted bids that included back-up generators into the first drp rfb and encourages those participants to submit bids for this revised rfb
as mentioned in the march 0 market notice for the second drp rfb
for loads not using back-up generators
the design of the back-up generator program has changed somewhat since the issuance of the first drp rfb
loads using back-up generators will still be dispatched after the drp load blocks but will be available for 0 hours per month
similar to the load portion
successful bidders will start in the program either june 0 or july 0 depending on how quickly contracts and logistics can be finalized
bids are due to the iso on may 0 in accordance with the attached rfb

it was a great time and there's just no reason for you guys to absorb the other costs
particularly when the rest of us have the means to help out
thanks again for a great time
despite the spades
i need to check more
but here's my take
politically---very popular with legislators
very easy to pass
etc
however
it would be so complicated to implement and is very likely in conflict with so many federal laws
that i think they'll have an extremely difficult time pulling it off
in addition
the utilities
whose retained generation collected a big portion of the
windfall
selling through the px
would be subject to a big tax hit
would that push them into bankruptcy
in short
easy to pass politically
pretty difficult to make stick legally
this help
you still have your pcg position

jeff enron turns internal credit-risk tool into new product 0-0-0 0:0
new york
by christina cheddar new york
dow jones
with the number of corporate bankruptcies on the rise
knowing the creditworthiness of one's customers is becoming more and more important
for enron corp
ene
the world's largest energy trading company
keeping track of credit risk has always been part of doing business
that became even more true with the company's launch of enrononline
its internet-based commodities trading network
in order to deal with the accelerated volume and speed of transactions on enrononline
the company developed a tool to help its own commercial traders manage the credit risk
early last year
enron rolled out this tool
enron credit
on a limited basis
gradually
the company expanded its use and scope
last month
the company re-launched enron credit in its current format
enron credit tracks more than 0,0 companies
giving each a rating known as the
enron cost of credit
the rating is expressed as an interest rate
the web site also provides news
a company's expected chance of bankruptcy and other related information
while much of this information is free to registered users
enron also has turned the product into a new revenue stream
users may download data into a spreadsheet and receive periodic updates for a fee
the site also can sell a user a
digital bankruptcy swap
which is a way to hedge against credit exposure
the price of the swap is determined by a rating enron's staff assigns to a company and the amount of credit exposure a company needs to protect against
for a supplier
the main advantage of a swap is that if a customer is unable to pay due to bankruptcy
the supplier will be paid immediately
according to enron europe president john sherriff
the goal of enron credit is to create a more efficient credit market by increasing trading liquidity
the tool is important because
in just a short amount of time
a company's credit can go from stellar to bad literally overnight
at present
some analysts haven't factored in revenue from enron credit into their earnings models
however
as the commodity markets enron trades in mature
it is possible the need for products such as enron credit could increase

based on latest info hear's latest assessment of gov's talk
i'm in charge
here's all the wonderful things i've done thus far to address the crisis
likely to include edison tx talks
since it seems he has no choice but to continue that charade
it's bad and getting worse and we've got to pull together as a state to get through it
rate increases are a necessary evil that---painful as they are
and they will be painful---must be part of the solution
and future increases may well be likely
blame ferc and the generators
because it's their fault
windfall profits is a good idea

ucla forecasters see national recession as inevitable in 0
california will not be immune
with bay area very susceptible los angeles
economists with the ucla anderson business forecast see even more clear indicators of a recession for the nation in 0 and project a 0 percent chance that the nation's longest economic expansion will come to an end no later than the first quarter of 0
the year 0 is a transition year that will take the u.s
economy from the internet rush of 0-0 to a lower level of sustainable economic growth in 0
said edward leamer
ucla anderson business forecast director and anderson school professor
however
getting from here to there will involve some painful adjustments
he warns
and
monetary medicine
from the fed won't stop the pain this time
according to the econometric model used by ucla's forecasters
the probability of a 0 recession has increased nearly 0 percent since december 0
just three months ago
dr
leamer's forewarning of a recession was the most pessimistic
and
as it turns out
the most accurate forecast made that quarter
the expansion of 0-0 was driven by
new economy
investment opportunities
firms rushed pell-mell to be the first kid on the block to have a cool website
fear was a big motivator
internet firms feared losing first-mover advantage
bricks-and-mortar firms feared they would lose out to pure internet business models
almost every enterprise in the u.s
invested heavily in it equipment and software
and hired the associated personnel
said dr
leamer
things are different now
the national recession and slowdown in investment in information technology and software has different implications for the principal regions of california
a recession is quite likely for the bay area
while southern california will experience many economic stresses though skirting an outright recession
dr
tom lieser
author of the california forecast
expects to see a
high-tech
recession in california that will have a disproportionate impact on the san francisco bay area
we will most likely see not only a slowing of demand for electronics
communications equipment and related products
but also a weeding out of the less well-capitalized firms in these industries
said dr
lieser
the ucla economist also expects a weak expansion in employment through 0
with a corresponding rise in unemployment rates
a substantial slowdown in the california service sector
a mainstay of the state's economic growth
is also quite likely
the strong increase in residential building permits seen during the november-january period will likely be short-lived
said dr
lieser
we expect to see declining home prices in the bay area this year
southern california will also experience slower home sales and a lower rate of price increases
higher energy prices
the economists argue
may pose a greater problem for other states than for california
because of the state's lower per capita consumption
on a per capita basis
california ranked 0th out of 0 in electricity consumption and 0th in natural gas consumption
both in 0
even with the state's notorious dependence on the automobile
it still ranks only 0th out of the 0 reporting states in per capita gasoline consumption
and while the recent brownouts and blackouts may not perceptibly affect california incomes and employment in the short term
a prolonged electricity crisis could discourage business expansion significantly in the longer run
the ucla anderson business forecast is the most widely followed and often-cited forecast for the state of california
and was unique in predicting both the seriousness of the early-0s downturn in california and southern california
and the strength of the state economy's rebound since the forecast was presented at an all-day conference at korn convocation hall at the anderson school at ucla
in addition to providing the outlook for the state and national economy
the conference examined the economic impact of california's energy crisis through a series of panels led by some of the nation's most prominent authorities
speakers included loretta lynch
president of the california public utilities commission
mark bernstein
senior policy analyst at rand corporation
barry sedlik
manager

to determine that piece
poll thus far
aron thomas

he made the decision after talking to edison
who told him that edison is going to suggest in its filing that the surcharge be applied--get this--to the px credit
thus

can you say
poor quality receivables
aron feels that the issue should be figured out in work shops and the commission should not decide it in the policy phase
bill booth

keith mccrae
cma
is going to say that 0
the surcharge should not apply to direct acces customers and 0
the governor stated publicly that he supports direct access
jeanne's checking with the industrial users group to see what they're going to say
since cma is going to ask for clarification
i would suggest that we remain silent and focus on the other rate design/cost allocation issues
e.g
equity
no cross subsidies

energy supply setback
big generator can't be forced to sell emergency power to the state
a u.s
court rules
by denny walsh and carrie peyton bee staff writers
published april 0
0
in a development that does not bode well for california's energy supply
a federal appellate court thursday halted enforcement of a lower court order that a big electricity generator must sell emergency power to the state without guarantee of payment
state energy officials said the ruling wouldn't have any immediate effect but could precipitate a power emergency if the generator decided to take a plant off-line for maintenance
on march 0
citing
rolling blackouts
that have
darkened the california landscape
u.s
district judge frank c
damrell jr
imposed an injunction against reliant energy services inc
one of the nation's major generators
houston-based reliant controls approximately 0,0 megawatts
or about 0 percent
of the gas-fired generation capacity in the state
and damrell found that loss of that production
poses an imminent threat
but thursday
a three-judge panel of the 0th u.s
circuit court of appeals granted an emergency stay of the injunction
saying reliant has shown
a high likelihood of success on the merits
of its appeal
while not spelling it out
the panel apparently bases its finding on the question of the courts
jurisdiction over the energy market
the panel directed that a hearing on the appeal be scheduled for the second week in july
the decision leaves california's electric grid more fragile
at least temporarily
according to the state independent system operator
which maintains and controls power transmissions
it gives the agency no immediate recourse if reliant chooses to shut down any of its plants for maintenance
said iso vice president jim detmers
it's not going to change anything overnight
and it's not going to change anything over the weekend
said detmers
but if reliant decided on a unilateral action to take their units off for maintenance
we definitely could have a system emergency
reliant officials
when told of the ruling
took a conciliatory tone but declined to specify their next move
reliant
has pledged to keep the lights on in california
said company lobbyist marty wilson
and
is still of a mind to want to cooperate
without further comment
the appeals court judges cited a 0 u.s
district court decision
in that case
0 cities sued florida power and light co
alleging that it was violating a number of laws in its sales of power and production of electricity
the judge found
however
that the federal power act reserves oversight of interstate utilities exclusively to the federal energy regulatory commission
he ruled that only the commission may bring an action involving energy sales into federal court
unless it is a request to review a commission order
and that goes directly to an appellate court
the lawsuit before damrell was brought by the iso to force reliant and two other generators to respond to iso's emergency orders for power
even though the agency is buying on behalf of two retailers that are broke and hopelessly in debt
because pacific gas and electric co
and southern california edison can't pay their bills
about $0 billion
some wholesalers want to cut off sales to the utilities
the other three defendants in the iso's suit
dynegy power corp
of houston and tulsa-based aes corp
and its marketer
williams energy marketing
trading co
have entered into written agreements with iso to continue supplying emergency power until the ferc decides whether they are required to sell to companies that are not creditworthy
but charles robinson
iso general counsel
points out that the generators can rescind those agreements with 0 hours
notice
my hope is this is a temporary setback
said robinson
he added
however
that the practical effect is
at least for now
we don't have a tool to compel them to do what we believe they're obligated to do
respond to emergency demands for power
reliant has insisted since the suit was filed feb
0 that damrell has no jurisdiction over the rate schedules that govern dealings between generators and the iso
and that the federal power act mandates that the ferc must settle any disputes about terms of those tariffs
in issuing the injunction
damrell acknowledged that the ferc has special expertise concerning agreements between generators and iso
absent the extreme exigencies of the california power crisis
the court agrees that a stay pending further action by the ferc would be proper
he said
but those are not the facts here
electricity is in critically short supply
the health and safety of the people of california are potentially at risk
immediately upon receiving the 0th circuit's order thursday
attorneys for the iso asked damrell to set an accelerated schedule for its motion to amend the suit
the agency apparently has crafted a new complaint stressing its view that the matter is an ordinary contract dispute over which the judge has jurisdiction
damrell scheduled a hearing on the motion for thursday
in a further development that could complicate the state's dire need for energy
an alternative supplier won a court fight thursday to bypass the big utilities and sell its power on the open market
timber giant sierra pacific industries
which operates four biomass plants that produce power for pg&e
obtained a temporary restraining order in sacramento superior court that says sierra pacific is not required to sell its power to pg&e
the ruling means pg&e and southern edison could lose power as alternative energy generators
fed up with months of nonpayment
sue to be able to sell their comparatively cheap product elsewhere
including outside the state

enron to cut one-fifth of jobs at broadband unit
reuters english news service
c
reuters limited 0
houston
april 0
reuters
energy trading giant enron corp
said on friday it will eliminate some 0
or roughly 0 percent
of the jobs at its broadband telecommunications unit
detailing a move which it has previously described as an internal redeployment of staff
enron broadband services spokeswoman kelly kimberly said the company is cutting jobs at the unit
which now employs 0,0 people
because it has completed the build-out of its 0,0-mile
0,0 km
fiber-optic network and because of slow demand for streaming media products delivered to personal computers
the network is substantially complete now
so that means fewer people are required for technical positions
she said
the job cuts also reflect enron broadband's decision to play a less active role in the market for streaming media services
such as video of corporate events delivered to personal computers
where demand had been slower than expected
she said
however
kimberly said enron broadband will continue to pursue entertainment-on-demand services actively
kimberly said employees whose jobs are being eliminated will be eligible for redeployment to other positions at enron broadband services or other enron units
although there could be some involuntary terminations
previously enron officials had dismissed rumors about job cuts at enron broadband services and had spoken instead of an internal redeployment of staff within the unit without detailing its impact on overall employment there
the company's stock
which peaked at just above $0 last year and was trading in the $0s as recently as mid-february
has recently fallen into the $0s in line with broader weakness in the stock market and among technology and telecommunications stocks in particular
on friday it was up 0 cents at since early last year enron has been building a high-speed broadband communications network that it plans to use as a base to build a bandwidth marketing and trading business similar to its huge natural gas and electricity trading operation
excitement among investors about the broadband business and about enron's success in developing a strong internet-based trading platform for energy and other commodities drove an 0 percent rise in the company's share price last year
outpacing a gain of 0 percent for the s&p utilities index
kimberly said enron's bandwidth trading operation is continuing to perform strongly
with more than 0 trades carried out in the first quarter
exceeding the total for all of 0
despite the jobs cuts at enron broadband
she said
the unit is recruiting to fill some other positions

kern gets speedy ok
breathitt questions action ferc moved with record speed to issue a certificate last week to kern river gas transmission for its 0 mmcf/d
mostly compression
expansion to the natural gas-starved california market
but not all of the commissioners were happy with the expedited manner in which the project was approved
the speed with which the commission has acted in this proceeding is something which will no doubt be touted as a great effort
but the
precedent we have created could be a double-edged sword
warned commissioner linda breathitt in a partial dissent of the decision
although she voted in favor of the certificate in the end
she questioned whether ferc
should
be willing to sacrifice careful review for speedy action
breathitt further said she seriously doubted the so-called california action expansion of the 0-mile,wyoming-to-california kern river system merited the
extraordinary regulatory treatment
that the commission gave it
critics claim that the $0 million project will not flow any more gas to the wheeler ridge interconnection in california than is currently available there
she noted
adding that it would simply displace existing gas
i
t will not necessarily result in any net increase of natural gas in the california marketplace
this makes it difficult to understand just how our approval of kern river's proposal is going to assist in increasing electric generation in california this summer
breathitt said
if anything
she noted the project could make the congestion problem at wheeler ridge even worse than it is
there should have been a
fuller airing of this issue
at ferc before the project was certificated
she noted
it would be counterproductive for this commission to act precipitously on projects related to california without ensuring that they will
in reality
benefit specific markets
and more importantly
that they will cause no further harm
the commission majority
however
readily dismissed protests of pacific gas and electric
pg&e
southern california gas and other california customers
that claim the kern river expansion would degrade service to existing customers
they requested that existing customers be given priority over expansion shippers
we conclude that the california action project will not have undue negative impacts on existing shippers or competing pripelines
the order said
cp0-0
for starters
the record does not show that pro-rata allocations of primary firm capacity have been a problem at wheeler ridge
kern river reports that the aggregate primary firm delivery rights of its shippers at wheeler ridge will increase to about 0 mmcf/d from 0 mmcf/d as a result of this project
at the same time
the design delivery capacity at the wheeler ridge meter station will be increased to about 0 mmcf/d from 0 mmcf/d to accommodate existing shippers
new expansion shippers and mojave pipeline shippers
it noted
therefore
the expanded delivery point capacity at wheeler ridge will be greater than the sum of the combined kern river and mojave contract volumes
the commission recognizes that this does not factor in the volumes attributable to both pg&e and local production that are also delivered to wheeler ridge
however
our emphasis is on kern river being able to provide sufficient delivery point capacity for its customers
the order said
the solution to the problem of pro-rata allocations of any services at wheeler ridge lies not with the interstate pipelines
but rather in fixing the problem with the take-away capacity and the lack of firm transportation path rights on socalgas
a matter which is beyond our jurisdiction
the project would increase the
limited-term
incremental transportation capacity
of kern river by 0 mmcf/d from wyoming to california to help address the urgent need for additional gas in the west
an estimated 0,0 horsepower would be added to the pipeline
including three new compressor stations
and upgraded facilities at three existing compressor stations and an existing meter station
the project
which has been fully subscribed
has a targeted in-service date of july 0 of this year
kern river plans to use a mix of permanent and temporary facilities on the project
with the temporary facilities intended to be subsequently replaced by permanent 0 california expansion project facilities
which is pending at ferc
and the permanent facilities to be incorporated into the design of the pipeline's 0 and 0 california expansion projects
the 0 project recently went through an open season

the impact of retail rate deregulation on electricity consumption in san diego
april 0
pwp-0 by james b
bushnell and erin t
mansur retail electricity rates in the san diego gas
electric service territory more than doubled over a period of three months during the summer of 0
much of this increase was subsequently rescinded through a retroactive rate freeze
we examine the impact of these events on overall consumption levels in san diego
we find that average electricity consumption decreased by roughly 0 mw
or 0.0%
between mid-july and the end of august
demand was reduced by over 0% in the late afternoon and late evening
because of the uncertainty about the duration and the credibility of the rate increase
these results should be viewed as a lower bound on the demand reductions that could be achieved through pricing incentives

folks in sacramento said that they haven't heard anything about it and aren't inclined to inquire

invited
to appear before the committee that's doing the wholesale price investigations

i'll stay on top of it and let you know just as soon as i do

here's how i think this thing has played
is playing
out
pg&e was very tactical
they knew that the edison deal was imminent
they see the edison deal as extremely adverse to their interests
they feared that the pressure on them to do the same deal would be enormous once the governor announced the edison deal
thus
in an incredibly dramatic attempt to pre-empt the possibility that they'd have to accept the edison deal
pg&e threw itself into bankruptcy
preemption seems to have been very successful
at least at this point
so i think that they wanted everyone to know
including wall street and the governor
that the decision's been made---they're going the way of ch
0
not the way of j
bryson and edison
this make sense
best
jeff
fyi
pcg is up $0.0 as we speak
hi
any word on the mower
very sorry
hang in there
here are the components as i see them
0 numbers for c&i are fine
i'd do 0%
0%
0% reductions
assume c&i takes its proportionate share of the dwr's net short
i.e
if c&i is 0/0 of load
then 0/0 of cdw purchases should go to c&i
you can use the average price used in the dwr presentation to legislators to the $ amount
the copy i've got sez that the average price for the first 0 years is $0/mwh
that seems like the # we ought to use
now the hard part
the state reportedly sez that they aren't buying the entire net short---only that part that they feel like covering
so how do we factor that in
not sure that we can get detailed data
but check with alan comnes
who might be able to provide iso real time prices
which is where the net short
of the net short
is being filled iso---the iso then sends that bill to pg&e
an easier way might be to use pg&e's numbers
in their bankruptcy announcement
pg&e sez that it's been costing them $0mm per month
$0mm * 0.0 * 0.0 =~$0mm
we could scale this number up to account for summer purchases
alternatively
we could use ena's forward curve
this is very quick and dirty
apologies
and i may have gotten something very wrong
if i've got any fatal flaws in the thinking
which happens often
please point them out
and if you have any questions
don't hesitate

best
jeff
thanks
fyi
the negative px credit language in the mou reads
on p.0
the cpuc implementing decisions shall include orders resolving the responsibility of sce to provide credits to direct access customers in respect of electricity deliveries after december 0
0 in respects which do not result in any material financial detriment to sce
could go several different ways
but arguably could be read to say that sce will make good on credits up to 0.0.0
if that were the case
i'm assuming that about 0-0% of our exposure would be covered

ouch
so it could be one way or the other

sue landwehr will be sending around a more comprehensive summary of what happened at today's ferc hearnig in boise but asked me to pass along the following
each state was only allowed to have two people at the table
for california it was assembly speaker hertzberg and geoff brown
newly appointed ca puc commissioner
hertzberg did a credible
matter-of-fact job of explaining what california's doing to resolve the crisis
nice to know that there's someone out there who can explain what the heck california's doing
hertzberg then asked that ferc do
its part
by imposing price caps in western wholesale markets
hertzberg didn't mention the pg&e bankruptcy or davis
deal with edison
overall
the
no price cap
message won the day
though breathitt seems to be under considerable pressure to give in to caps
the governor of arizona
jane hull
had a staffer deliver a letter signed by 0 republicant governors opposing price caps
sue will be distributing the letter

high electricity prices pose a ``looming disaster
for many states in the west
a federal regulator warned tuesday
as pressure grew on the government to consider temporary price controls on wholesale power
officials from 0 western states
including energy-ravaged california
engaged in sometimes passionate exchanges with three members of the federal energy regulatory commission over how to contain soaring power prices that are expected to go only higher this summer
``something has to be done to tame this market
geoffrey brown
a member of the california public utilities commission
told the three ferc commissioners
california anticipates paying $0 billion for electricity this year
almost 0 times its power bill in 0
but after the daylong session
the ferc seemed to be not much closer to imposing price caps than before
although one commissioner
linda breathitt
said she now wants to look the issue more carefully and might be swayed
ferc chairman curtis hebert
a strong free-market advocate
reiterated his fear that price regulation would drive off investors for new power generation
under ferc rules
it would be hebert's discretion when or if to propose a price cap for deliberation
commissioner william massey
who has been in the minority on the commission in recommending price controls
said the ``passion for markets must be tempered with common sense
``we face a looming disaster
he declared
if wholesale electricity markets are allowed to continue on a path that has wholesale power in many parts of the west selling for 0 times what it cost just a year ago
hebert insisted that the ferc ``is doing everything it can
to ensure just and reasonable prices and cited the commission's action to seek $0 million in refunds on california power sales
he also said the commission plans soon to approve a new system of tracking market abuses
the chairman noted that state officials at the meeting were sharply divided over whether the government should regulate electricity prices
keeping tabs as each participant gave a presentation
he said three states were for them
five against and three uncertain
hebert's anti-controls position drew support from vice president dick cheney in a telephone interview with associated press reporter david ammons in olympia
wash
``the problem with price caps
cheney said
``is that they don't solve the problem
just look at california
where they had caps applied at the retail level that
coupled with the requirement to buy power on the spot market
has driven pg&e into bankruptcy
pacific gas
electric
california's largest utility
said last week it had debts of $0 billion and filed for protection from its creditors under chapter 0 of federal bankruptcy laws
california
whose electricity problems have unleashed soaring power prices throughout the west
urged ferc to immediately impose an 0-month cost-based price cap in the western markets
``we have done our part
we cannot do it alone
said bob hertzberg
speaker of the california assembly
he cited state actions to boost conservation
increase retail rates and speed up power plant construction and said there is ``no earthly reason
why energy prices should be 0 times what they were a year ago
still
california officials expressed little optimism after the hearing
``it would take a dramatic
unprecedented change of direction
for the ferc to adopt price controls
said fred keeley
speaker pro tem in the california assembly
who was in the audience during the six-hour meeting
breathitt
the ferc's third commissioner
who has not come out in favor of price caps
nevertheless indicated she might be inching toward some controls
she said she wants the commission to ``seriously discuss a price implementation plan
the issue may end up
however
being decided by two new commissioners recently nominated by president bush
pat wood
now head of the texas utility commission
and nora brownell
a pennsylvania regulator
both are viewed as free market advocates
but pro-controls commissioner massey said he believes they might be swayed to accept temporary price restraints if the electricity market reels further out of control
neither nominee has yet been confirmed by the senate
while divided on price controls
most of the state officials at the unusual ferc meeting expressed worries that the federal agency was doing too little to address problems in the power markets
the chairman of montana's utility commission
gary feland
who opposes price controls
criticized ferc for lack of aggressiveness in challenging unreasonable prices
ferc is legally mandated to ensure ``just and reasonable
wholesale power prices
``montana is taking a hell of a hit
from electricity prices
feland said
``politically we're getting beat up
steve ellenbecker
a utility commissioner from wyoming
urged the federal regulators to come up with a ``reasonable measure
short of a price cap to deal with the troubled electricity market
many of the state officials said the full impact of the high wholesale power prices have yet to hit consumers
in many cases state officials must still give permission for utilities to pass them on to retail customers

judge orders enron to deliver electricity to universities san francisco
saying that enron energy systems inc
may be in breach of contract
a federal judge wednesday ordered the houston company to abide by its agreement to sell cheap power to the state's public universities
enron was attempting to get out of delivering power for the final year of a four-year deal with the california state university and university of california systems
enron
which buys power from producers and sells it on the market
said the contract would cost the energy concern $0 million a month because of skyrocketing wholesale power prices
enron said the state should free enron from its obligation and taxpayers should pick up the tab
it's our economic interest to provide a service with the least amount of dollars we can provide it for
enron attorney a
william urquhart said
he later described the case as being
all about money
it's all about money
enron said it would file an emergency appeal to the 0th u.s
circuit court of appeals in san francisco to overturn u.s
district judge phyllis hamilton's ruling in the suit brought by the state's two university systems
appearing in federal court
state attorney general bill lockyer argued that enron wants out of the contract so it can engage in a
marketing game
with the universities
promised power and sell it on the open market for 0 times more than what the electricity cost enron
he said lawmakers may have
left the keys in the car
when they approved california's failed energy deregulation scheme that has prompted the energy crisis
but it is still theft to steal the car
the judge issued a temporary injunction against enron
forcing it to continue providing service as the suit brought by the universities proceeds
when the judge issued the order
she also said there is a likelihood enron will lose the suit
i am persuaded
in the end
there is a very strong likelihood of success on the breach of contract claim
the judge said
uc's annual electric bill is about $0 million and its natural gas bill is about $0 million
csu annually pays about $0 million for electricity and $0 million for natural gas
the case is uc regents vs
enron energy systems inc

fea's asking for a uniform percentage increase on top of existing rate allocation structure
clfp proposes the following changes to medium and large commercial and industrial customer tariffs for electric service provided by pacific gas and electric company and southern california edison company
clfp proposes the commission establish an optional summer on-peak
peak period consisting of a continuous 0-hour period during the current summer on-peak period for both utilities
the 0-hour period would be selected by the customer
specifically
service eligibility
customers served as medium or large commercial/industrial customers on time-of-use rates and metered customer eligibility
electric customers processing
handling
distributing or processing perishable food and agriculture products
as noted below
since no revenue shift occurs within the class
the commission may consider opening the option to others
customer charge surcharge
a surcharge of $0 per meter per month for the initial summer period
0
to offset the utilities cost for changes to billing procedures
in the case of optimal billing period service customers the surcharge shall correspond with such billing period
optional summer on-peak period
any continuous 0-hour period during the summer-on-peak period of time
hours may be designated by the customer consistent with metering capabilities of the customer or changes to metering capability
the reason for designation by the food processor or agriculture commodity processing customer is in order to take into account the many factors involved in load shedding
labor
harvesting schedules and coordination with growers
delivery schedules
inspection activity
etc
all bear upon such an effort
rate for optional summer-on-peak period service
energy rates for the 0-hour period would be two times the otherwise applicable charge for summer-on-peak energy
the other 0 hours of the 0-hour on-peak period would be billed at the non-peak rate and equalized for rate/revenue neutrality
in the event partial peak periods are retained
the rate for the non-optioned 0-hour period during the on-peak period would be adjusted to retain revenue neutrality
these rates would apply
as now
workdays of monday
friday
notice and service
an eligible customer must notify the utility in writing
by fax
email
or hand delivered
to both the appropriate account representative and the customer billing department of the request for optional summer-on-peak period service
the 0-hour period of optional service and the start date for such service shall be specified
start dates should coincide with billing cycles
with a minimum of seven days notice prior to such cycle
optional optimal billing period customers would be treated accordingly
except as currently provided
a two-day advance notice
implementation issues
tou meters and billing
it appears the number of customer meters and billing changes potentially required by optional summer on-peak period service is relatively small compared to the total number of meters of the utilities
in response to clfp's data request by pg&e and sce
attached
the following is observed
for sce
sic 0
food and kindred products
customers account for approximately 0 meters out of about 0,0 meters
of the 0
all but 0 can be managed locally by the customer data acquisition system
the 0 would appear to require a field visit
for pg&e
out of 0,0 tou meters on e-0 and e-0 service
0 or 0% of the total are sic 0
of the 0 nearly half
0
are hourly interval meters
the remaining 0 presumably would need a field visit for reprogramming
conclusion
based upon the data supplied
metering and billing changes required by an optional summer on-peak period program for processors of perishable commodities
there does not seem
in clfp's opinion
to be a significant barrier to establishing the program
this is unreal
if tw ain't on the a list
who is
i'll look at it and get back to you first thing monday
i'll be getting you stuff tonite or tomorrow
best
jeff
dudes
here's my my comments to mark's answers to the questions
and suggestions to jimmie's model
i don't answer the bottom line question
since we have some talking to do on the model
jimmie
your model is great except we have to value the company on cash flow
as opposed to ni
i've take a stab at setting up the discounted cash flow model
all my stuff is highlighted in yellow
it's the capex that's screwy
see assumptions given in questions
i get at 0% of 0 revs
not 0.0% as indicated in the assumptions
i also assume that when it sez working capital is net zero
we don't factor those balance sheet line items into the dcf model
others agree
anyway
it gives me a $0.0 share value
so i think the model's got some work
take a look and let me know what you think
best
jeff
guess i was lazier still
agree with your assessment
i just neglected to recalc your model in order to determine growth rates necessary to get cash flows high enough to justify $0 and $0
0% and 0% growth rates are
i would argue
wildly unrealistic
in addition
the capex numbers would
presumably
have to bump up substantially in order to get you there
therefore
i would argue in the memo that the numbers don't add up for a $0 price
though
irrational exuberance
may permit netscape to pull it off
unless other folks have comments on the model
i think you're good to go for the memo
am ready to look at it when you've got a draft
great job on the case
thanks
best
jeff
no problem
give me a call and we can go through your list
best
jeff
ok folks
it's about 0% of the way there
my brains are oozing out looking at cells
so i want to get this around so mark can get started on refining assumptions and other folks can examine as well
i'll continue to check it and de-bug it
mark
you and i should talk
too
you'll note that at this point
the valuation is in the $0s
so there's work to do
apologies in advance for any errors
and i'm sure they're there
if anyone has any questions on the model
just let me know
i think we ought to get together to meet this week as much as possible to start getting the power point presentation together
and perhaps we should think about meeting this weekend
in the meantime
i'm pulling together the data on buffet
berkshire hathaway
stock performance
etc
and will also do the financial ratios
including dupont
for oat
does this work for folks
other thoughts
best
jeff
these slides look very good and good to go from my perspective
i have no comments
best
jeff
apologies
my dead just fell into a million pieces
i won't have a chance to review jimmie's fine work
nice name for the cfo
by the way
and i've just been informed that i'll need to have dinner with our bankruptcy guy this evening
turns out we're on the unsecured creditor committee for pg&e's banckruptcy
so i won't be able to be in class tonite
again apologies
great job jimmie
particularly in light of the easter holiday
best
jeff
we'll be at the party
overture
or no overture
the squaw thing ain't a problem
no worries
but let's settle soon
my accounts are a little wacky these days---i'll explain later
thanks for letting me know
with the playing
there's a lot of little issues that i think are no big deal
but from our weekend at squaw
it seems that there are some major fucking huge issues that you and the mighty c needed to work out
if you've got those worked out
then i'm all fer playing again
though the next 0-0 weeks are pretty fucking ugly
best
jeff
prentice and i talked
she's going to come back from the sports gig for the dinner party
don't worry to much about the ganged-up-on-thing---prentice is cool
she's ready to play
she and i have been playing together
though our respective repertoires
as designed by avram
diverge more than they converge
we're getting pretty hot on earl's breakdown
though
p.s
comes a point in one's life
like
when you're an adult
that you take personal responsibility for your actions
my dad made me do it
must simply give way
and
my dad made me an exquisite perfectionist
must really really give way

fyi
this is an internal email of the svmg
please keep confidential
i'll be monitoring
thanks
best
jeff as you know
the svmg energy committee plans to discuss variable pricing
specifically severin borenstein's proposal
at its next meeting on monday
a copy of his proposal is attached
as i indicated at last week's meeting
i believe the svmg should consider endorsing the proposal
with certain conditions
for the following reasons
it provides the broadest
most transparent incentive to reduce consumption precisely during hours of shortage
thereby reducing the chances of involuntary curtailments
blackouts
it creates a demand response to high prices
thereby reducing the market power enjoyed by power sellers
this may be one of the only factors contributing to a more reasonable
stable wholesale price environment if there is no federal intervention
it offers a financial opportunity for those users who are able to reduce their demand overall or shift their demand to off-peak periods
the following is a
strawman
draft of an endorsement by svmg for discussion monday
i would point out that the strawman is silent on the question of whether customers who choose to opt out of variable pricing must be interruptible
an issue of concern to some
also
i hope to have additional input from barbara barkovich before monday's meeting
thanks
peter evans power prices paid by customers must create the incentive to reduce demand during specific hours of supply shortage
and high prices
this gives the greates possibility of getting through this summer without running up a staggering dwr bill and suffering through frequent blackouts
getting people to reduce demand in response to higher prices would also reduce the market power of sellers
we therefore endorse the proposal to price power use above historical levels
and rebate for power use reductions below historical levels
at the real-time energy price
our support for this concept includes the following conditions
0
historical consumption levels
which would be served under regulated rates
would be based on last year's use
taking into account the customer's historical load profile
adjustments would be made for increases/decreases in number of employees or number of square feet per electrical meter to account for changes in business volume
historical consumption served under regulated rates could be adjusted by a ratio
say 0% to 0%
to build in some expectation of conservation
0
participation all customer classes would participate
in the absence of real time load data
i.e
residential customers
monthly consumption deviations from historical levels would be priced at the monthly average spot price
0
alternatives for above-baseline use it must be explicitly clear that customers have completely unfettered ability to procure power for their above-historical power requirements on their own if they choose to
this could include self-generation
bilateral forward purchases
or purchasing at the spot price from the dwr
0
sunset this approach should automatically terminate at the end of 0
requiring government or regulatory action to extend it
rtp proposal 0.doc
our schedules make it messy
i can come over tomorrow during the break if anil and carolyn want to meet
mark
if you want to hunker down with the model tomorrow
you should feel free
the only thing about thursday is that carolyn's got a commitment with dian
can we talk about meeting this weekend
i can be flexible
best

the agenda for the legislative oversight committee's gas hearing tomorrow includes two brattle group consultants
paul carpenter and matt o'loughlin
they will make up the first panel
titled
california's high natural gas prices
market power and other factors
in california's gas wars
edison hired these folks--carpenter in particular
to show that socalgas has considerable market power in california and abuses it
edison was a long-time
very unhappy gas customer of socalgas
until it sold off its power plants
the animosity remains
however
should be interesting to see where the committe goes with that panel
ca puc lawyer
harvey morris
is the sole witness on the second panel
harvey is zealous in his assertions regarding market power in interestate markets serving california and is the puc's lead attorney on such matters at i plan on attending the hearing
it's likely that i will also be attending a hearing on price caps at cma's offices in the afternoon
best

i tried to log in and the system told me that i'm not authorized to use the system

jeff
i'll actually be in sacramento tomorrow

i think she's already gotten a helluvalot better--a marked and very positive change
reflection and realization are powerful things

it was fun as hell

jeff proposal to alleviate california,s electricity shortage through incentives to reduce demand objective =0 provide consumers with financial incentives to reduce demand in anticipation of summer 0 electricity demand proposal =0 the california puc should require the utilities to immediately conduct on-line auctions for demand reductions totaling at least 0,0 mws =0 alternatively
dwr could run the auction and implement the buy-downprogram
however
if it is determined that dwr requires additional authorito execute the auction
the state should avoid any further delays and directhe cpuc to order the utilities to implement the buy-down program immediatethe auction process
assuming the utilities implement the program
=0 businesses and large consumers willing to commit to sustained reductions through november 0
0 would submit bids indicating the price they would be willing to receive for a given quantity of permanent reduction =0 if the
supply0 of available reductions offered in the auction exceeds 0,0 mws
the utility should accept them
or explain to the commission whythey chose not to accept them =0 businesses should be permitted to include in their bids the continuepayment of wages to compensate employees for hours of employment foregone dto demand reductions a single price approach =0 a single price approach to a demand buy down program has two key disadvantages
=0 first
customers who would be willing to reduce demand for a lesser price will be overpaid
much in the same way the single price auction in the pcoverpaid lower cost generators
the state would overpay for reduced demandunder the single price approach
=0 second
the single price may not attract sufficient demand reduction=0 further
the single price approach does not provide greater certaintregarding the cost of demand reductions
by conducting an auction the statwill be able to observe all bids and pay on an as bid basis
starting withthe lowest bids necessary to provide the required demand reductions up to the cost the state is willing to pay
=0 a single price approach
however
could work if targeted at customers who would not participate in an auction
i.e
residential customers
a well publicized program of rebates to residential customers who use less than last year would further reduce demand in the state
thus the auction and the single price could be structured in a complimentary fashion
=0 the costs of the incentive program should be paid for by all consumers
since all consumers will benefit from the decreased risk of service interruptions caused by the demand reductions =0 if dwr implements the program
dwr
would recover its costs through rates
similar to the cost recovery mechanism used to recover power purchase costs=0 if the utilities implement the program
the california puc would incprogram costs in rates collected from customers =0 the auction should be conducted online which will increase transparency and reduce the time required to complete the process hazards to avoid =0 avoid allowing lengthy utility and/or puc review to delay implementation of the reductions _ any unnecessary delay increases the chance that california will fail toachieve the reductions needed to help avoid severe shortages in summer 0 _ there are numerous firms offering moderately-priced on-line auction services that can quickly provide auction services to the utility _ the utility should immediately contract for on-line services and presentthe contract to the california puc for prompt approval _ the utilities should also include in their submittal to the puc a simple,streamlined set of pre-qualification criteria that would apply to bidders _ the pre-qualification criteria should be designed with the goal of makingparticipation as easy and expansive as possible _ pre-qualification will encourage legitimate offers and reduce transactiontime _ once the puc has approved the auction process
the puc should not apply aadditional review to the auction results _ auction
pre-approval0 will ensure that the utilities are actively and constructively engaged actions =0 governor,s office directs puc to initiate auction and residential program =0 cpuc directs utility to submit auction proposal within 0 days _ establish abbreviated schedule _ provide parties with abbreviated opportunity to comment _ finalize decision approving auction proposal within 0 days of utility submission =0 cpuc rules in advance that results of auction are prudent
and utilities conduct auction by may 0
thanks very much

jeff
thanks
man
karen
see highlited section of story below
pg&e's got it right
recall that dwr was only buying power that it determined was
priced reasonably
consequently
the net short wasn't getting picked up
that meant that the iso would have to go to the real-time market to close the gap
the iso would then charge the utilities for the power purchased
recall that bob glynn referenced the $0 mm/month that continued to pile up on pg&e's balance sheet as one of the several reasons that pg&e put itself into bankruptcy
now that pg&e's in bankruptcy
the state is now responsible for the full net short
and can't continue to sluff it off onto pg&e's balance sheet
so it's therefore no surprise that the state's daily bill for power purchases has increased dramatically---just not for any of the bogus reasons cited by governor backbone

delainey/whaley buy off on the approach
i mean on the approach for dealing with edison re
alternative structures for payment
when's the drop dead for getting edits to jennifer's
solution
piece
you looking at it
best
jeff
not a problem
my concern is less about you and me---we both have views and are comfortable with the back and forth banter
i'm actually concerned about carolyn
she has worked hard on this
and i think wants to be involved and participatory
i had the sense that she was feeling that she'd done a bunch of work that was ending up on the cutting room floor and that she wasn't getting a real opportunity to participate in the shaping of the analysis
the presentation
or responsibility for taking a piece of the presentation for thursday
i was sensing that she was frustrated
anil is also less extroverted
but based on discussions with him
i think that he is less concerned because he has some other pretty cosmic things on his plate right now
my real concern is that everyone feels comfortable
understanding that working in groups is all about compromise
and that one should really expect to get about 0% or less of one's views included in a final product
given the nature of group dynamic
i think we're getting close to something that everyone will good about
which is a pretty good goal to go after
thanks a bunch for the note

i'm the lower right hand corner of the matrix
which i think

which i think translates to anarchist
please include sue on the call-in info
thanks

i wanted to apologize for the way the group dynamic has shaped up
it's clear to me that you're a bit frustrated
and if i've contributed
i apologize
you've done the most work on this project
your contribution has been very significant
and i personally am not satisfied about the way that the stuff you've pulled together
and your views
have been included
at some point
though
it gets tough beating one's head against the wall
seems to me that
in a group
everyone should have some of their views included---that's what groups and compromises are all about
after all
it's school
we've made a lot of sacrifices to do it
and the point is to learn
anyway
i hope you'll still comment on the presentation
and i'm glad that you've agreed to do part of it on thursday
for my part
i felt that i pushed yesterday about as much as i'm prepared to push and at this point
i'll put the ratios tables together
offer a few edits
buy don
t see much use going to the mat
overall
i think it'll be an okay presentation
though getting there has been
well
bumpy
but thanks very much for all the work you did
it was important
and the presentation is better off for it
best
jeff
in all week
as best i can tell right now
u still on call w/edison
jeff
when u get a chance
can you call and let me know how it went
thanks
jeff
dude
two things
first
in the midst of the craziness on friday
my black
northface parka ended up getting put someplace at sarah's that i wasn't privvy to
and consequently i couldn't find it
my house keys are in it
so it would great to get it back
could you check with bob/sarah and see if it's floating around someplace over there
muchos gracias
second
could you do me a favor
could you pay me the full amount for squaw and then collect from cameron for what she owes you
sorry to be a pain in the ass
but i think logistically
it'll be a whole helluvalot easier to manage it that way
at least from my end
and to be an even bigger pain
since my schedule's a disaster with school coming to a close
could you stick the check in the mail
my address is
0 dolores st
#0 sf
0 sorry for all the hassle
happy birthday
man
best
jeff
do you have a copy of the order
here are my comments
great job
i think that the rate design table is a little impenetrable for folks who ain't close to it
it might benefit from an addition bullet of explanation
best
jeff
you have specific questions about the order
perhaps the best thing to do is jot down the specific questions
then we can route them to folks in the know
which is likely to be more than one person
that make any sense
fyi
her take on the senate going after the creditors
dedicated rate component as the first
and most important
change is on target in my view
best
jeff
fyi
from our folks in sacramento
ab 0 is aes
competitive default provider bill
it's not an emergency bill
so it will be dealt with throughout the remainder of the spring and summer
ab 0 is a legislator's suggestions on how long-term contracts should be
regulated
also no an emergency bill
ab0x is an emergency bill and it would create a core/noncore split in electricity similar to the one that exists in california's gas market
best
jeff
my apologies for getting the sponsor incorrect
i'll notify folks
we'll need to discuss tomorrow on the call what position
if any
we
enron
takes vis-a-vis new power's attempts to get default provider
thanks very much for the info
best
jeff
apologies
the competitive default provider bill is actually being sponsored by our brave compatriots at the new power company

if you'd planned on making a chart similar to the one that you did previously

best
jeff
you available to talk today
i'll be going to everything
whether it makes sense or not
and spending a lot of money
thanks
man
up until the trauma and the drama
the genesis of which remains a mystery
i had a great time
please thank sarah and bob---great food
great company
etc
tell them sorry for leaving all my stuff lying around
thanks for sending a single check
$0 is the amount
talk to you soon
best
jeff
my apologies
it ain't proofed
let me know if this is what you're looking for
best
jeff
while i
too
am frustrated at how things turned out
i'm glad your content overall with the course
definitely one of the best--if not the best--classes i've taken
i really think that we need to get together tomorrow nite to finalize
but i don't feel like pushing it too much
your thoughts
best
jeff
hi
is there a reason i keep getting this stuff from these guys
sincerely
clueless
i'm available
nice job
you take a self-promotion course over the weekend
i love you very much and of course want to be together
but some things need to be worked out because there's too much depression and pain associated with those incidents
they have to stop
i have never been embarrassed to be with you
i'm as proud as can be
i think that's something coming from within you that you need to work on
but i'm willing to help
i don't want to end anything
but we need to fix it
or we'll have have to end it
i love you and miss you
fyi
bob williams should be touching base with you
or it would be useful for you to touch base with him
edison appears to be staking out it's negotiating position with us through their filing
in short
they
recalculate
the px credit post-jan
0
when dwr took over procurement
that recalculation turns our $0 mm dollar px credit claim into $0mm
so we're pretty far apart
we agreed at this point to oppose the filing and say
0
through the end of the rate freeze
or end of 0.0.0
the status quo remains
px credit
based on market price
dow jones index
0
however
if you want to go
utility purchase
price as the basis for the credit
then it must be the utility's full cost of power
retained gen+qfs+dwr+iso real time
0
negative credit during the transition can still occur
0
edison's proposal should be rejected
best
jeff
the
big
meetings
which happen about every quarter

big
meeting is an absolute must
and generally very fun
i'll be there
hope you're there
too
best
jeff
plz look up decision no
0-0-0 on the commission's website
it has to do with interruptible and curtailment issues and rotating outages
i.e
blackouts
thanks a million
jeff
carpenter is saying that prices went up due to manipulation
pure and simple
we're saying that it's the reasons listed on the 0 0/0 pager that i sent
give a call and we can discuss further
best
jeff
greetings
could you email me the final version of the stipulation
thanks a lot
best
jeff
fyi
fyi
might be useful to have the bill forwarded to the larger group
in addition to gavin
best
jeff
thanks
please also fax copies to jim and rick in houston at 0.0.0
best
jeff
the interim settlement never got voted out
therefore it ain't official
so there's no requirement yet to refile anything
welcome to california
in fact
folks are still trying to get the commission to reject the is and approve the one that we worked on
though the chances of that are not huge
at this point
give a holler if there's anything else
best
jeff
greetings all
i'l have the financials and any other comments/suggestions done and sent to all this evening
i have a conference call at 0 am tomorrow
apologies
but i think it's very important that we get together one last time to ensure that we're all on the same page
that folks understand clearly what slides they're responsible for presenting
etc
what about lunch tomorrow
we're all in the city
or at 0 pm
before the ball game
lemme know
best
jeff
could you send my the slides that you put together on saturday
muchas best
jeff
greetings ms hunter
i'll be participating via conference call
best
jeff
works for me
vicki must be tired of me being the perpetual bearer of bad tidings
you bet
you want to call me at my office
best
jeff
actually
could you call me on my cell phone @ 0.0.0
best
jeff
i cleaned this up a little bit
best
jeff
merci
can't wait to meet the little bundle of joy
last week
i distributed a presentation that the brattle group gave before the california inquisition
i.e
legislative gas oversight committee looking into the gas price spikes at the cal border
the brattle group is a consulting firm that edison has long used to beat up on socalgas
recall that edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned power plants
edison
arranged
for the brattle group to be the star witness at the cal leg gas hearing
their job was to set up el paso and dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day
their message was simple
and simplistic
el paso and dynegy have market power
they have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas at the border
to
obscene
levels
that
in turn
has driven up electricity prices
ken lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow
and rob bradley asked that i provide the alternative view to the edison/brattle rant
in the event that he gets any questions on the topic
it's attached
apologies
it's quick and dirty
but it provides the basics
obviously no need for us to defend el paso or dynegy
but might be useful to offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the california legislature is peddling
finally
we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing
the california puc ferc lawyer claimed that ena and tw colluded to drive up basis when ena controlled a portion of the capacity
but the overriding goal of the hearing was to go after ep and dynegy
best
jeff
presume we'll talk tomorrow re
cal solution
jeff 0.0.0
harry
per my voicemail
let's talk first thing in the am to discuss
best
jeff
here's the ratio analysis
let me know if you'd like me to put it into a text table for the presentation
best
jeff
it was only a draft
the commission has to vote it out for it to become effective
they've delayed doing that
therefore it's status quo on the socalgas system
apologies
my schedule's been difficult to control
i am in fact in the office this morning
so you can call me here at 0.0.0
best
jeff
yes
i can do the call
wanted to make sure u knew
s&p downgraded ca rating--two notches--from aa to a+
only louisiana is lower
and s&p kept ca on cred
watch--could go lower
it's slipping thru davis
fingers
jeff
also
talked to m
day
those one-pagers should be coming in the next hour
i have one
houston's coming to town for a meeting on friday
the 0th
i'll be there about ten after 0
here are some minor comments i have on the presentation
i'm going to try to go thru the rest and give any final comments by 0 pm tonite
or maybe we can do that over lunch
best

here is the list thus far
there may be additions
i've also suggested dates for the meetings
may 0rd in sacramento

republican's point person on energy issues
house minority leader david cox senate majority leader john burton senate minority leader jim brulte may 0th--morning
in los angeles john bryson
ceo edison international governor davis

thanks again for your help
best
jeff

jeff
make sense to do this if sanders can't make it
jeff

best

also attaching a word doc of additional info for everyone for use during the presentation and q&a
also attached is the deal comps table

jeff
hey buddie
our stock's up
so ferc order ain't so bad
w/the lay thing
vickie's memo's gotta wait
you concur
best,jeff
thanks
jeff
poor thing
what else is there after dual 0s
looking at it right now
one minor edit---it's the px
not the iso
that's taken itself into voluntary bankruptcy
see redline version attached
only other comment
i'm not sure that
technically/contractually
we entered into transactions with the px
in the same way that i don't think that folks enter into transactions with nymex
see opening line of last paragraph
we have exposure to thepx based on our commercial activity that took place through the px
and that exposure depends on how the px
ferc decide particular issues
in short
we have transactions with the utilities
and exposure to the px based on transactions that we entered into with other counter parties via the px market mechanism
that said
seems to me that
for the purposes of the disclosure
the language is fine---just want to raise the flag
might be useful to run it by richard sanders
hope this helps
best
jeff
i thought that you're going to be at pacbell park all weekend
greetings folks

give me a call and we can have a calmer
more detailed discussion without all the noise
best
jeff
thank you
nice job on the call today
fyi
this is the presentation that the brattle group---a consulting groupthat edison has long used on gas issues in california---gave last week to the legislative committee investigating wholesale gas prices at the californiaborder
the day following this presentation
which was followed by a presentation by the california puc's ferc lawyer
the committee called elpaso and dynegy to respond to brattle's and the cpuc ferc lawyer's presentations
also attached is the best synopsis of the hearing that i'veseen in the press
best
jeff competing evidence clouds calif
investigation prompted in part by the california public utilities commission
the california assembly has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in thestate,s current energy crisis
in the efforts to find a smoking gun
legislators have leaneheavily on a report prepared by the brattle group
a consultancy commissioned by utilitysouthern california edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse
but the state,s biggest transporter of gas to california
el paso natugas
is not ready to take the rap
the pipeline has commissioned its own study
which irecently presented as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation
as reported in both the trade press and national media
socal ed and the cpare pointing the finger of blame at el paso for alleged manipulation of california bordeprices through affiliate deals and capacity hoarding
and exhibit a in their case against el paso is the brattle group,s study of the california market
richard zeiger
a spokesman for assembly member darrell steinberg
chairmanof the california assembly judiciary committee
told gas daily that the brattle group,s market study proved that the surge in gas prices at the california border was notcaused by normal market forces
gd 0/0
his remarks followed an oversight hearing duringwhich assembly members questioned dynegy and el paso officials about their involvement inthe california market
el paso presented a different version of events to the assembly
in a reporpresented to legislators
a research group hired by el paso concluded that a convergenceof factors
not a conspiracy
caused the price run-up
lukens consulting group
a houston-based consultancy
was retained by el paso to conduct work on several fronts
in its study of the california market
lukens concluded that the increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of themain culprits in the california gas price imbroglio
assemblyman john campbell
a republican member of the oversight committee,said he
didn,t see any smoking gun
in either report
we had our committee hearing
and we certainly had a lot on the brattle study and a little on the lukens study
to some degree
i,m not sure that the california legislature is the best place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies
campbell said
i believe ferc is looking at this situation
and it would seem to me that that,s theappropriate place
campbell said that the cpuc had been prodding the california legislature togive support to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines
it,s being pushed basically by the public utilities commission here
which believes that there was collusion
by pipeline companies to push up gas prices in california
he said
the cpuc
campbell suggested
sought satisfaction before the california assembly when it had failed on the federal level
there,s a concerted effort
not just on natural gas but on other things here in california
for entities and organizations here to point thefinger elsewhere for the problems that we,re having in this state and i think you,re seeing some of that with the public utilities commission
whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas prices is a different matter entirely
in the meanwhile
the dueling california market studies seem to have taken on a life of their own
the brattle group study
for instance
has become the center of a heavilylitigated effort to force ferc to compel the release of market data by california market participants
following on a request by socal ed
which said it needed additional data to round outthe brattle group report
ferc chief alj curtis wagner issued subpoenas to the other three major pipelines that serve the state as well as to sempra energy trading
several parties resisted ferc,s call for market information
saying therequested data contained commercially sensitive information
ferc allowed the discovery process to move forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restrictingaccess to evidence critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in theircase
the commission recently dismissed the cpuc,s claim that el paso rigged the auction of alarge block of pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate el paso merchant energy
in addressing the california assembly
representatives of dynegy said that ferc,s recent ruling on thcalifornia border controversy obviated the need for more investigation
the controversy
however
is far from over
ferc last month also ordered ahearing into whether el paso natural gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to drivup the price of gas delivered into california
gd 0/0
that hearing is likely to take placethis summer
rp0
just for the record
i just reviewed my
jeff's goals for 0

i was hoping that kl could meet with bryson on the 0th

hi
i'm going to call you in a bit--i'm on a conference call right now
we need to coordinate just a wee bit
landwehr's all over rosie
and we're getting mixed up between her rga meetings and the ca meetings
i talked to her a little this am and expressed a concern that we not get poor rosie all wrapped around an axle and confused
we may have several points of contact here for various issues
no big deal
but i want to make sure things don't get more complicated than they need to be
i'll forward you a note from sue to rosie
and me
that you weren't on
also want to talk about your voicemail last night--i.e
i may need to travel with kl
which is fine by me if that's necessary
best
jeff
thanks
we need to reign sue in just a teensy bit
oh man

for immediate release governor davis signs executive orders to provide power to california governor gray davis has signed three executive orders to increase stabilization
conservation and generation of power in california
executive order d-0-0 many numerous and complicated statutes
regulations
policies and procedures are delaying deployment of the energy conservation funding outlined in sb 0x and ab 0x signed by the governor two weeks ago
executive order d-0-0 will speed up implementation of the measures
together
the two bills provide over $0 million for energy conservation and distributed generation programs designed to save over 0,0 megawatts this summer
with the executive order
the energy commission will not have to go through the cumbersome process of guideline adoption to approve funding
the programs in the demand reduction program that will be streamlined included
public agency loans and grants

municipal program
and cool roofs/building materials executive order d-0-0 governor davis signed executive order d-0-0 to extend the conservation rebate of the
0/0
program to the customers in the territory serviced by the san diego gas and electric company
the program is designed to help the state avoid the likelihood of blackouts this summer and reward consumers who significantly conserve energy
in addition
it could save the state up to $0.0 billion in power costs by reducing the amount of electricity the state must buy during expensive summer peak periods

i'm going to spend the day working on it---adding to what's already been passed around
dylan
i'll look at the numbers and perhaps send you
and others
thoughts regarding the crunching
since you've already starting crunching
i'll try to do as much of the write-up
building on what others have done
and send around by cob today
once everyone's had a chance to comment
etc
i'll finalize tomorrow night
i have to fly to houston at the crack of dawn on monday and therefore can't go to class
so i'm hoping that someone else can turn it in
let me know if this works for folks
best
jeff
thanks

here's the gov's analysis of the mou
have a good weekend
best
jeff
left you a voicemail last nite
i get on the plane houston at 0:0 am pdt
so you'll have to do it solo
i'll get to the office around 0-0
i'll come to your office and you can fill me in on how it went
best
jeff
ok gang
well
i,ve been crunching numbers all day
and haven,t yet gotten to the writing
i've attached dylan's original responses for reference
figureit'll be a memo from time's ceo to the time board
i,ve leaving now for mendocino
but will be back early tomorrow to finisthis up
please check out the spreadsheet
the case is sort of confusing*how do time,s analysts value time at $0when they,re trading at 0 the day before the announcement of the deal with warner
that doesn,t jive
are they saying that
absent synergies
thecombined time/warner is worth the enterprise value of time at 0-0 plusthe enterprise value of warner at $0-0
again
the analysts valuation
that just seems ridiculous
give where they,re trading
anyway
here,s where my analysis is heading----tell me if i,m smoking crack
the deal isn,t really $0 per share
it,s $0 less the taxes that will have to paid
since it,s a purchase deal
plus the value of the tax shiecreated by the net increase of $0.0b in new debt that paramount will takeon
does this seem right
could folks look at my spreadsheet
i,ve got it conceptually set up
but i,m not quite sure how to calculate the taxes paid under the purchase method or the value of the tax shield
assuming that thiis correct
if i,m just completely out of it with this angle
just let me know
in any case
seems that there,s some value in the tax-free
time-warner
versus the taxable
time-paramount
deals
presumably
we could take the total enterprise value of time-warner
nontaxed
and compareit to the total enterprise of paramount-time
taxed
and compare the two
ve got a hunch that the time-warner number may win the day
but i haven,gotten that far in the crunching yet
in any case
i,ll be back around noon tomorrow and will crank the puppy out
best
jeff
thanks to all for your comments
i've tried to weave together the various
and insightful
comments i received from folks with the great stuff that dylan put together initially and the stuff that i whipped up
they're attached
please proof the thing---i fear that there's a typo
or two
since i'm off to beatiful houston at the crack of dawn
dylan has graciously agreed to take any further comments
integrate them
and print the final thing out to turn in at class tomorrow
thanks a million
dylan
you folks should discuss whether you want to include the excel exhibits as i've included them in the memo---no pride of ownership
so don't be timid
dylan
they are formatted for printing
so all you should have to do is print away
see you all soon
best
jeff
i'd vote to let hap do it
ms fleming
no apologies necessary
anybody would be confused with what we've thrown at you
just to be sure
it's david cox

can't thank you enough for you help
hope you had a nice weekend
jeff

if there's anything else
don't hesitate to contact me
best
jeff
yep
so was his angle
the shareholders should take the $0 and run
there was a strong case for that
only thing preventing was the internal dcf of the time-warner deal being 0-0
or something
so why didn't the market put that value on it
i went with what i thought the flow of the group was
but it was a tough row to hoe
where were you on it
thank you

i might be called away
at this point
though
i'm clear and will plan on meeting
my apologies for the uncertainty
best
jeff
thanks for the note
we'll need to to discuss this a bit further
since it could be a very sensitive issue for us
e.g
enron's answer to the electricity crisis in municipalization
if spun right
could provide an interesting opportunity
however

received a call this afternoon from gordon smith
ceo of pg&e
i met gordon when he was cfo of pg&e and i was a bureaucrat at the puc working on the blue book
he was following up from the meeting this morning with bob glynn
he was very positive about the comprehensive solution that ken lay described to glynn at this morning's meeting
he was particularly positive about the core/noncore proposal
he asked to meet to discuss it further
i have an appointment to meet with him monday afternoon
he offered--as a board member of the california chamber of commerce--to help bring the chamber along
and he also said that he can help with the silicon valley manufacturing ass
i'll report back after the meeting
and may have already mentioned that i have a meeting scheduled in sacramento monday with the ceo of the chamber and the president of cma
will report back on the meetings
have a good weekend
best
jeff
hi folks
well
i ended up traveling all week
which i wasn't happy about
worse
some nimrod enron it person in houston
where i was for part of the time
deleted my entire *&$*
*-ing hard disk
which stupidly
i hadn't backed up
year's worth of work and school gone
kaputt
anyway
if there's any chance that someone has all of the cases that we did and could email them to me
i would be greatly indebted
sorry for the inconvenience
and see you on monday
best
jeff
seems that fergus
folks should be able to get their hands on it
folks
let me know if this captures the results of the conversation on friday
best
jeff basics of proposal something akin to the mou
that adequately addresses the solvency issue
for the ious
the state and qfs
but without the transmission component direct access for all customers
transitioning to a core/noncore market structure in 0-0 months
this can be accomplished without stranding cdwr's contracts
concessions
ious
mou modifications
generators
past due amounts
investigations package to finance the deal
bond issuance backed by rate increases to permit securitization
message this is the last best chance to achieve a comprehensive settlement we have developed a comprehensive solution and are meeting with everyone that will see us
we have thus far received positive feedback on and a willingness to work with our proposal we intend to work tirelelessly to gain support for a total solution---it's vital
and time's running out corporate leader strategy---karen denne meetings with legislators in sacramento---sandi mccubbin wptf
iep
arm---sue mara
agreed
great idea on characterizing it as a
melding
need to fill you in on the
investigation
discussions with the republicans in today's meeting with lay
you still around
best
jeff
this is real helpful
thank you
greetings laura and marybeth
laura
if you have the time and the inclination
i'd like to spend a half-hour briefing you on the energy situation
i apologize for the brevity of this note
but can fill you in more if you think that there's value in chatting
in a nutshell
there's a concerted effort underway----one last big push----to try to get a comprehensive solution in place for california that works for the majority of constituencies
i.e
broad coalition right and left of center
the deal would be bi-partisan
if successful
the deal would
put rates in place that reflect and cover costs
repay debts
send the right price signals for efficiency
but fall short of
shock therapy
return the utility to creditworthiness as a result of the new rates
use the minimum amount of state
and utility-backed bonds to finance the solution turn the procurement role back over to the utilities
and away from the state
once creditworthiness is established---0-0 months following the rate changes
establish the competitive market structure that california was promised but never got---consumer choice for all customers
0-0 months later
large industrial would be required to procure electricity needs from the market
not include government takeovers of the industry
e.g
sale of utility transmission assets to the state would not be part of any deal
include a contribution from large players
e.g
utilities and suppliers
resolve the myriad lawsuits
investigations
etc
those involved still believe that there is a need for a group of
wise persons
to help get the deal done
l
summers is willing
others are being considered
your name has come up
but that issue can be addressed later
the goal of a phone call would be to bring you up to speed on the events
which are breaking quickly
hope all is well and hope to talk to you soon
congratulations on haas

greetings
steve kean and i met today with jack stewart
pres
of the california manufacturer's and technology ass
and alan zaremberg
ceo of the california chamber of commerce
jack stewart was happy to hear about our efforts and is generally supportive--particularly regarding direct access--but wants more information regarding the core/noncore proposal
we have a meeting set up for thursday morning at 0 am in the sf office to discuss it further
stewart will bring keith mccrea
long-time lawyer for cma to the meeting on thursday
zaremberg was extremely happy to hear about our efforts and the overall package
and was much more receptive to the core/noncore proposal
though he
too
would like more details
turns out the he and bill hauck--former wilson administration official and now head of the california business roundtable---have been walking the halls of the capital urging the same thing we've been urging
i.e
d's and r's need to get together
read
grow up
and do a comprehensive deal
steve and i had an impromptu meeting with hauck
and then i followed up with him in the afternoon---he
too
is very supportive
we stressed how important it is for business leaders to aggresively support and pitch
0
the idea that both sides of the aisle
and the governor
need to resolve this now
and 0
the framework for a comprehensive solution along the lines that we've described
they agree
and while we have a good bit of additional work to due before they are vociferous advocates for the core/noncore proposal
they certainly didn't reject the idea
will report back on the thursday follow-up with cmta
best
jeff
i'm serious
are you referring to the proposal that no one knows about that everyone knows about
we going to celebrate
marybeth
my apologies
but steve's going to be in a meeting with the governor from about 0:0 to 0 pm today and then is likely on a plane directly thereafter returning to houston
likely best to try to arrange the call for tomorrow
if that works with laura
i'll check steve's schedule and forward the information to you
best
jeff

jeff

house guests from la jolla
how did that happen
great
glad to hear sue picked it up
i'll touch base with her
best
jeff
some additional information beyond duh would be useful
shoot
we're going to see tom and karen on saturday
fyi
ken lay asked to have the pitch that he's been making california be quickly put into a few power point slides for use in meetings he's having this week at the gathering of the business council
back east
with a group of california ceos
e.g
sun
chevron
amgen
bechtel and others
this is the version that we gave to lay's office
he may have modified it
will check with rosalee to get the final and distribute that version if changes were made
best
jeff
met early this morning with jack steward
pres
of cma
and keith mccrea
lawyer for cma
to follow up on the meeting that steve and i had with them regarding the proposal ken lay was pushing last week
they like taking tx out of the mou
they like getting dwr out of the power purchase business
and they think that edison's mou needs a little haircut
mccrea pushed back initially on core/noncore
why should it be mandatory to go the market
but after much discussion they agreed that our idea for core/noncore has a lot of merit
our idea is that 0
the core/noncore would take effect in 0-0 months
when the markets settle and prices come down
0
everyone
core and noncore
should pay for dwr's
past
purchases
since everyone consumed it
0
core customers should take iou generation
qfs and dwr contracts
which eliminates the core's
net short
position
and 0
noncore would go to market and would not have to pay for any of dwr's
going forward costs
since core gets them
in exchange for getting all the low-cost iou generation
i told them we are still crunching the numbers to see what the rate effects would be and would share it with them when we're done
while they are supportive of this approach and agreed that it would be useful to continue to flesh it out
they are not convinced that it will get the necessary support to get passed
they are also withholding final judgment until they see all the numbers
i.e
we've still got some work to do
they are very cynical about anything getting solved in california
and are extremely upset about the puc's proposed rate decisions released by the judge and loretta lynch
they place very little trust in the governor or the legislature
interestingly
the rate increase decisions
coupled with calls in sacramento for an immediate move to core/noncore
makes our proposal very attractive to cma
nonetheless
they said that they will continue to engage and are willing to commit to continue meet to try to get california's mess resolved
don't know how i got on the list
but just got my invitation to the western conference of pucs meeting june 0-0 where the guest speakers are frank wolak and gary locke
oh dear
best
jeff
hi
please add $0 of tolls for each day that i went to sac this week
thanks
jeff
wednesday works next week
but i warn you
i have no control over my schedule these days
but i'm putting it on my calendar
lemme know if that works for you guys
best
jeff
yes
can we have a call tomorrow to discuss status
etc
0 am houston time work for folks
best
jeff
yes
this is a very good
easily digestible summary of the ferc order
alan zaremberg
ceo of the chamber and located in sacramento
asked if we had a summary that we could provide him
zaremberg is convinced that no one in california understands what ferc did and wanted to try to educate them
if we sanitize it to remove anything sensitive
are folks comfortable providing it to zaremberg
thanks
best
jeff
your call
baby
hey
when are you scheduled to go in for your attitude labotomy
why
touchee
yes
in fact
i suggested it
be great to book jim
thanks
marybeth
i apologize
as i mentioned
this situation is extremely fluid
i also mentioned this morning that in yesterday's meeting w/the governor
it was agreed that the meetings would continue
every day
until the thing got resolved
i was just informed that i've been elected by my management to be on today's call
steve kean and i will be our representatives
it starts at 0pm
we are scheduled to talk at 0:0 pm
i'm hoping--but not altogether hopeful---that the call will end before 0:0
i can't apologize enough for the scheduling problems
particularly since i'm the one who originated the request to chat with laura
we can do it one of several ways
it's completely your call
0
play it by ear
and i can let you know around 0:0 if i think the call's going to wrap up by 0:0
0
we can reschedule
i would of course very much like to brief laura on what's going on
0
you can decide it's too much trouble and throw up your hands
which i would understand
let me know how you
d like to proceed and please give my sincere apologies
and best
to laura
i have to get on the call right now
so if you need to speak to a live person
give joseph a call at 0.0.0
best
jeff
hi alan
in our ongoing analysis of the mou
and in our attempt to put together a solution for california
we need to do a reality check on the implied curves the governor's consultants are using to arrive at their rate proposals
to ensure an
apples to apples
comparison
we're hoping to get our curve data for 0x0 power
averaged on a quarterly basis
from 0-0
hoping that you can get that for us
that possible
let me know
thanks a bunch
best
jeff
0
if he's got 0 minutes
then he should join for 0 minutes
0
quite urgent
since the analysis needs to be done pronto
0
if he can't join
that's ok
we can fill him after the meeting
i'm trapped
could i impose upon you to buy me my usual burrito from downstairs before i pass out
greatly appreciated
thanks a bunch for your help with this
we should distribute our comprehensive proposal to this group
marybeth
the call's ended and i'll be available for the 0:0 call
best
jeff
good job
it's got traction
can you call when you get a chance to
ok
i apologize
i've been trying to lock myself to the computer and crunch some #'s
but can't seem to get control of my schedule
wanted to lay out the core/noncore model that's been pitched
and that cma showed keen interest in this morning
to see if we're all on the same page
but perhaps this is the analysis that you're already working on
split takes place either 0.0.0 or 0.0.0
core and noncore are responsible for the
dwr past purchases
spread over 0 years
core will keep iou gen
qfs and dwr contracts
which would eliminate the short for the core
noncore
in return for giving up the lucrative iou gen
effectively accepts the short position
i.e
goes to market
and does not get sacked with dwr's going forward costs
with
forward costs
defined as all power costs attributable to the
post-core/noncore
transition date
let me know if this tracks with where we're headed
thanks
best
jeff
hi maureen
could you ask steve if he will be able to make the 0:0
cst
with laura tyson
i think you
ve got the call-in number
tell him it's not big deal if he can't--i can handle--but if he can
it might be useful for him to be on the line
thanks a bunch
best
jeff
fyi
silicon valley manufacturing group ain't happy about the rate increas
surprise
so does this mean we're right where we left off with respect to status of bills like wind-fall profits
jails for generators
etc
you are so sweet
thank you
what are you doing working so late
see riordon note below
thank you
will do
great
thanks
i intended
and will be sure
to include karen on the stuff that i pull together today
karen
if there's anything else i need to do to coordinate
best
jeff
take a look
interesting stuff
i'd say it further adds to our momentum
i don't have an attachment
plz see email for hertzberg talking points for phone call
turning to ceo materials now
jeff
this looks fantastic
i apologize profusely
i've got a dozen assigments to finish by cob
but having read this
you obviously needed no help from me
let me know how the call with riordan goes
best
jeff
got message re
letter from sherman to opic
i'm in all day monday
best
jeff
hi maureen
could you please make sure that steve gets these
thanks a bunch
best
jeff
michael
did we decide to use the puc's load numbers
i would worry about that
particularly since we use the mou qf/iou gen numbers
i suggest that we use the mou load numbers for the three utilities
since the puc numbers seem real screwy e.g
they have pg&e's load being smaller than edison
best
jeff
fyi
another arrow in our quiver
moody's has put california's credit rating under review for another downgrade
sources report that moody's
s&p
and mbia have all informed california that
the only way the state will improve its credit rating and look better to investors is to get out of the power business and resolve the
yes
please submit my name
thanks a bunch
i'll be talking about everything
bibi's the man---he's the guy i mentioned when we discussed the other night
can we use the mou total load numbes
e.g
0 gwh for pg&e
and divide it up using the proportions in the pg&e numbers
greetings piper
my name is jeff dasovich
i'm in enron's san francisco office
i think you've spoken with karen denne
scott asked for some background materials on our proposed solution to california's electricity crisis
i'll be forwarding those to you sometime between 0 and 0 pm pdt
does that work for you
best
jeff dasovich enron corp
agreed
nancy rivera-brooks of the la times just called
said she'd heard that ken lay and governor are in frequent talks discussing the possibility of enron buying edison's transmission system
i told her that enron is not in the market for transmission systems
next thing you know
we'll want to buy the nukes
best
jeff
amen
please
please keep dave out of it
note to follow
it'll be to you in about 0-0 minutes
chk vmail when you get a chance
best,jeff
you're much too kind
thanks for the feedback
my brains just about spilled out end of the day friday
spent the weekend in a haze
best
jeff
coincidentally i did see governor backbone on the show
i don't think that we can count on him toning it down anytime soon
which will not be helpful in getting a solution out here
best
jeff
i'll be on the call
hope all's well on your end
best
jeff
i saw
the event
re-reun on local cable access tv
randomly viewed on saturday
it was not pretty and jeanne did a great job of remaining calm and exceedlingly professional---and what a camera presence
unfortunately
i wasn't thoughtful enough to send flowers
but a large bouquet is certainly in order
best
jeff
thank you very much
best
jeff
hi piper
the email i sent on friday to scott mcnealy's address
listed below
got bounced back to me
just wanted to make sure that you folks received the materials
best
jeff
greetings
as folks heard
ken lay met with some california ceos last friday back east
as a result of that meeting
mcnealy
ceo for sun
asked for some background and more detail on what ken lay proposed as a solution for california during his meetings in california over the past couple of weeks
mcnealy and others have expressed a willingness to make phone calls to policymakers
etc
to try to advance the ball
i pulled this together very hastily on friday and take responsibility for all errors
omissions
ramblings
etc
wanted to distribute
however
to make sure that all had the info that is getting distributed
know folks are busy
but this will likely get distributed to other ceos this week
so any comments
suggestions
etc
about how to improve are welcome and appreciated
best
jeff
i'll assume that you'll follow up with piper on this
best
jeff
greetings
can we meet at 0 pm cdt/0 pm pdt to see where we are on the analysis

fyi--unless i'm mistaken
the assignment that steve gave mike was a very quick and dirty analysis as i recall
i.e
should by no means be the tail that wags the dog
p.s
i eye-balled mike's numbers
below
looks like about $0k for three months

i can do tomorrow
thanks a million

received loud and clear
i'll await paul's email and proceed according to that plan
best
jeff
enron will very vigorously support the cs and i would hope that we could get as many people as possible to do the same
let's face it
california's gas industry is a mess for the same reasons the electricity industry is a mess
despite
and perhaps contrary to
the substantially more narrow reasoning offered by the brattle group
the cs is a well-thought-out
well-designed program for moving forward
unlike the
interim
which takes two steps back
can we split up the names of all the people who signed on and call them and try to get them to show up in support

i'm on a litigation call
on which i mentioned the plan b
which i got only because i searched out scott governor yesterday
on the call sandi said
jeff
there's a response from the governor to the plan b
which i faxed to steffes yesterday
i want you to know that i took a deep breath
and asked sandi to fax it to the san francisco office
unreal
best
jeff
thanks robert
one caution
it's important that the first-cut analysis be
simple
and uses
to the maximum extent possible
the mou numbers and modeling
this allows us to explain a complex situation to people who aren't necessarily
numbers oriented
and to do so with an
apples-to-apples
comparison
that's not to say that we won't be doing scenarios--we will--but it's important to have
at the outset
the cleanest
simplest version of
here's what core/noncore looks like when we apply your numbers to your model
that said
i understand that even with the simple base case
some tweeks are likely
talk to you in an hour
thanks again for the help
best
jeff
i am on back to back conference calls

best

thanks for the commnets
lynn
i've faxed you a copy of
plan b
i'll let others chime in
but ideally it seemsthat we'd want to start the meetings next week and have at least the rough outline of a proposed
comprehensive solution to put on the table for discussion
but at a minimum we'd want to get
the process
nailed down by very early next week
best
jeff
thanks very much
i won
plan b
as folks know
there's a group of moderate democrats in the ca assembly that has been working on a
plan b
they've been working on it because they're not satisfied with the governor's mou with edison
the plan b group has been talking to a broad array of stakeholders
including republicans
to get input into how
plan b
can improve upon the mou
first the good news about plan b
a fairly bright group of legislators is rolling up its sleeves and attempting to come up with a centrist solution to the problem
and they're at least creating the appearance of trying to be bi-partison about it
there is at least one idea in plan b that is attributable to a republican--keith richman--that ken lay met with a couple of weeks ago
so the beginnings of a process to resolve california's crisis may be emerging
now the bad news
because they are trying to build a consensus
plan b is a mish-mash
isn't focused
includes some pretty bad ideas
excludes some good ideas
like re-establishing direct access immediately
and is going to require a lot more work to get right
update on efforts to achieve a settlement in the meeting with the suppliers that steve kean and i participated in yesterday
one of the financial consultants hired by the governor criticized several of the plan b proposals as unworkable
on today's call with the governor's staff and suppliers it became somewhat apparent that the governor isn't going drive a resolution
but will leave it to the legislature to take the lead role
the staff emphasized repeatedly that the lawsuits
investigations
etc
were not on the table for discussion in any global settlement talks
and that attempting to bring them in to the negotiations was a nonstarter
instead
the governor's staff said that the group should focus on the size of the discount that suppliers would be willing to take
the suppliers pushed back
stating that including haircuts in the talks while excluding the lawsuits
investigations
etc
is one-sided and unworkable
the staff urged the group to begin negotiations with the legislature
but made it fairly clear that the governor would not be the one to pull the necessary principals together in a room to hammer out a solution
his staff implied instead that it's up to others
i.e
the suppliers
to get the process of negotiations underway
next steps if the governor's financial consultants are prepared by friday
they will brief suppliers on the ways in which the administration is attempting to resolve the state's creditworthiness issue to encourage suppliers to do power deals with cdwr
it they are not ready by friday
the suppliers will meet separately to discuss next steps
finally
there's been some confusion
my apologies
sandi faxed to jim and harry yesterday a copy of
plan b
sandi mentioned that the governor gave the plan b group an analysis of the plan
for those that have a copy of plan b
see the 0-page memo dated may 0th
attached to the back of the plan
the memo is from joe fichera to john dutra
fred keeley and joe nation
0 of the plan b democratic legislators
joe fichera is the head of saber partners
a financial consulting group that the governor hired to advise him on the crisis
if anyone has not yet received a copy of plan b
please let me know and i'll get it to you
best
jeff
no problem
we will fax it to you

hi maureen
steve should have received via fax from scott govenar a letter to hertzberg and burton from the republican leadership in the ca legislature
the letter 0
conveys a strong willingness on the part of the republicans to work together to solve the problem and 0
provides an outline of the key components of a comprehensive solution
could you please get a copy of the letter to rosalee
and rosalee could you get a copy of the letter to ken lay
thanks very much for your help

just got off the phone with michael hoffman
who's one of two key outside financial advisors to davis on the electricity crisis
the administration is trying to get a legally binding agreement between the puc and dwr to ensure that the puc doesn't muck around with the money
via utility rates
dwr requires to be creditworthy
they were shooting for this friday to have a draft of the document read for folks to review
but it now looks like it won't get resolved until
at the earliest
next week----seems that the one puc lawyer who can actually do the work is on vacation
go figure

only comment is that the crazies in california now find market power under every rock and in every pipeline

0 by noam levey mercury news sacramento bureau california's spiraling energy crisis
already menacing the state's economy and sucking billions of dollars out of the state treasury
has dramatically shaken californians
confidence in their future and their governor
a new poll shows
nearly half of the state's residents now believe california is headed in the wrong direction
a stunning reversal from just five months ago
when nearly two-thirds believed the state was headed in the right direction
according to the poll conducted by the public policy institute of california
and bearing the brunt of this new pessimism is gov
gray davis
whose approval ratings have plummeted to 0 percent
down from 0 percent in january
when the san francisco-based institute conducted its last poll
``we have seen slow deteriorations in public attitudes during tough times in the past
said mark baldassare
who directed the survey
``but what is most surprising is the speed at which this change has occurred
it is very indeed
the energy crisis now dominates all other issues confronting californians
according to the survey of 0,0 residents statewide
forty-three percent of respondents listed electricity as the most important issue facing the state
compared to just 0 percent who identified growth and 0 percent who identified education as the next most important issues
in recent years
californians have consistently ranked education as their top issue
and nearly two thirds of respondents said they fear the issue of supply
demand and cost of electricity will hurt the california economy ``a great ``without electricity we can't do much of anything
especially work
and without work the economy will continue to tank
said maria griffiths
a 0-year-old juvenile court clerk in san jose
results dismissed the governor's top political adviser
garry south
dismissed the findings as predictable
``the voters are in a very bad mood
they are not happy with anyone in this drama
south said
``but these poll numbers need to be taken in context
people don't understand what he's done because it is very hard to communicate that in this state
south emphasized that he believes californians will understand the extent of davis
efforts by the time they go to the polls next year
davis is expected to run for re-election next year
and several republicans
including secretary of state bill jones
are already lining up to challenge him
davis also has his eyes on the presidential election in 0
the survey found that most californians do not blame davis for the current electricity crisis
only 0 percent say he and the current legislature are culpable
compared to 0 percent who blame the utilities and 0 percent who blame former gov
pete wilson and the legislators who passed california's landmark deregulation five years ago
``he didn't make the deregulation disaster
i think that's pete wilson's legacy
said john putica
0
a bank loan officer in san jose
criticism for davis but there are nonetheless troubling signs for the man charged with leading california out of its power troubles
sixty percent of those polled said they disapprove of how davis is handling the power crisis
much to the delight of republicans who have hammered the governor for not doing more
davis has emphasized that the solution to the state's electricity crisis involves more power plants
more conservation and federal intervention to control the price that california is being forced to pay for power
the state has approved 0 new power plants since davis was elected
but for the past several weeks
the governor has been fighting an escalating war of words with the white house over president bush's unwillingness to support price caps on electricity
bush's energy plan released last week again rejected price controls and focused instead on rapidly boosting the nation's supply of power
the public policy institute of california's survey found that 0 percent of californians believe that new power plants offer the best solution to the crisis
but there is far less support for either conservation or price caps
0 percent identified conservation as the most important solution
and just 0 percent favored federal price controls on generators
that news was warmly received by a representative of power generators
who have been accused by davis and others of artificially inflating the price of power to mine the california market for excessive profits
``i think the public is skeptical of the actual benefits of trying to cap the price of power
said jan smutny-jones
executive director of the independent energy producers association
electricity generators argue that price caps will discourage the construction of more power plants
backing re-regulation meanwhile
consumer groups
who have been advocating for re-regulation of the electricity market
were left to hope that support for more controls will come when californians
power bills start rising next month
``people don't yet understand that generators are responsible for cutting off the juice
said harvey rosenfield of the santa monica-based foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights
``but in three weeks
california is going to face a catastrophe
this is going to hit supernova status
once people understand what the causes are here
i think they will understand that the only solution will be re-regulation
whether they will trust the state to come up with a solution is unclear
however
``the electricity problem has not only had major consequences on how people view their leaders and their short-term future
said baldassare of the public policy institute of california
``there is less confidence in the state's ability to plan for the long-term future
and that is giving people worry
``this crisis and the general economic uncertainty have severely undermined public confidence in california's future and its leaders

no problem
let's talk
i'm really comfortably having you and me and your mom and keith talk about
i'm very interested in buying jay's property
but i don't even the details yet
here's my suggestion
if they want to come up that bad
they should
my agent is a very cool person up there
here name is sharon burningham
she is with coldwell banker
her number is 0.0.0
ext
0
you should feel free to tell your mom that prentice and i have always have the intention of buying jay's place
and we've had a sort of unspoken agreement that he'd give us the first
head's up
when he decided to sell
to be honest
we didn't expect it to be this quick
but hey
it is what it is
you can also tell your mom that i'm very happy to talk about partnering with her
but it's way to early right now
as we discussed
i need to spend some time with jay---the other very important thing for me is that jay's a very good friend
and i want to protect that
too
in the meantime
i think that it would be great for your mom and keith to have sharon take them around and show them some killer million--plus--dollar homes and have some fun cruising around and seeing what the area has to offer
i'm real happy to call sharon
too
that sound like a plan
where can i call you

hertzberg called
we very briefly discussed the scenarios that he asked us to build for him
i've attached the file
the supporting spreadsheets are not included
if folks would like them
let me know
please keep the file confidential
hertzberg wanted to see what happened to rates for large
noncore
customers if the small
core
customers
share of past utility debt is shifted to noncore customers
our analsis shows that noncore rates approach loretta's recent rate increases when approximately 0% of core's share of utility past debt is shifted to businesess
i.e
to noncore
in fact
edison's rate in this scenario is below the lynch rate
while pg&e's is modestly above
increasing the cost shift above the 0% level would start to push rates significantly above the lynch rates
note
however
that in its recent submission to the puc
dwr's asserts that it's revenue requirement is substantially higher than the revenues support by the lynch rate increase
suggesting that lynch will have to increase rates again soon
in addition
loretta's rates also do not reflect past utility costs
which will require yet additional increases
i expect to have another conversation with the speaker later this evening or tomorrow to discuss the scenarios in more detail
he would still like to put 0% of the ious past debts on noncore in exchange for getting a competitive market and out from under loretta
i will report back after we've spoken
all ideas
suggestions
etc
regarding the attached spreadsheet are welcome and appreciated
best
jeff
so far there's wild goose
but there in northern california--have to go through the wheeler bottleneck--so that likely won't hunt
lodi's a possibility
but it's well inland
unlike the significantly more strategic storage assets on the coast
in addition
lodi's in the process of selling
so there's some uncertainty in the short run
bottom line
folks are trying to build competitive storage
but it's in the
emerging
phase in a very hostile environment
we should discuss further
though
very interesting idea

i'll have joseph clean up the letter and send you the email/fax #'s etc

the advocacy ad blitz has started
i don't know if i have the title correct
but the d.c
based arm of the democratic national committee has started an ad campaign against republicans
in san diego i believe
the head of the committee was quoted this morning as saying something to the effect of
the republicans in washington aren't doing anything to solve the problem and
we
want to make sure that they're held accountable

plz call as soon as you have a second
thx

i spoke again briefly with hertzberg last night and had a lengthy discussion late last night with the guy from csfb who's been providing hertzberg with pro bono financial advice on the crisis
hertzberg is still hot on putting all of the utility past due on the noncore
though his consultant and i agreed that
politically
the number is more likely to end up somewhere south of 0%
if this thing gets legs
hertzberg asked for
and we provided today
a
fifth scenario
which shows how the numbers work out if 0% of core's share of utility past due is shifted to noncore
it's attached
will report back with any further developments
note
please discard the file that i sent you yesterday and replace it with this one
that file accidentally had the same cents/kwh
noncore rate for both edison and pg&e
edison's rate should be 0.0 cents/kwh not 0.0 cents/kwh
it's the line that reads
total cost to noncore under cpuc's recent decision
best
jeff
here it is
sigh
greetings hap
hope all's well and edison's paying you
please be absolutely sure in the future to email or phone me with a head's up on filings like these in california prior to filing
as you know
it's crazy in california
with a lot flying around in numerous forums
even ken lay's frequently been to california over the past couple of months trying to educate and advocate rational
detailed solutions
want to make absolutely sure that we don't step on each other in our many attempts to get this ridiculous state back on track
not trying to slow you down
or dictate content
rather
given the high-stakes nature of the california situation
coordination is critical
thanks much
best
jeff
congratulations sweetie
everything ok
so glad to hear
all the best to all three of you

we'd leave earlier--gotta go to napa to pick up the suburban

duly noted
i'll send you the latest
i'll include you from this point on in the distribution list
if it gets to be too much in your in-box
just let me know and i'll try to pare it back
here's the bottom line
folks have asked me to coordinate california to some degree and there'll be an expectation that we're well coordinated
again
this is not at all about making your life more difficult
just a case of being well-informed
and my apologies for not having included you on the email distribution list sooner

thx,jeff
to get from the california border down to mexico
you would get service off of socalgas
and sdg&e's tariff
i.e
you have to wheel through socalgas and sdg&e to get there
there may be a single tariff for that service
however
rather than taking service off of two tariffs
i'll try to get the tariff numbers and get back to you
all the tariffs are on sempra's website

i guess
i'll call you tomorrow and we can discuss
thanks for asking
best

i don't recall lay saying that the increase should apply to da customers
we should discuss further just to make sure that we're all on the same page
best

i agree
seems to have riordan written all over it
i say
no big deal
we're talking to everyone
no secrecy involved
we'll keep talking
being constructive and trying to help develop solutions that work for ca
your thoughts
pager
best way to get me
= 0.0.0
fyi
greetings
forgive the delays
the meeting can largely be summarized by the cec presentation
i'll have joseph email it to you
in a nut shell
there's more interstate pipeline coming to the california border than there is intrastate capacity to take it from the california border to the consumer/business
the cec's forecasts show that things will be tight in california
the thrust of the workshop is that
just like power plants
intrastate pipeline capapcity is lagging demand in california and california needs to make a concerted effort at revitalizing the in-state gas infrastructure and do it quickly
hope this is helpful
and again
sorry for the delay
best
jeff
i'd blow it off
your batting 0.0
in anybody's book
that's phenomenal
don't look back
and pr
under the circumstances
is doing a stellar job overall
vacation was nice
thanks
bad thing is it made me realize how much more of it i need
and likely ain't gonna get soon
best
jeff
oh come on
you're kidding
right
i thought i'd ostracized him from teh enron ranks
are you sure
i've got your glasses case with your sunglasses
clip-ons
and a letter to you of some sorts
may be other stuff
too
but that's all that i've found thus far
best
greetings
have you seen this
any view on whether there's a group of economists who think otherwise and might be willing to express their views in a response to this letter
p.s
talked to tyson re
trying to get economists back in the middle of this
but i wasn't altogether successful
best
jeff
from kirsten's second report
sounds like the core/noncore is getting longer legs and moving more quickly
i'm concerned about bev speaking on our behalf---only because her knowledge base is quite low---and plan on phoning her to ensure that she has the message down pat
thoughts
also
i've forewarded the econ letter to teece to see if we can get the
manifesto
group to respond
best
jeff
just calling them as i see them
i wish that i were glad to be back
but who knows
this core/noncore thing just might work
please keep all fingers and toes crossed indefinitely
best
thanks
talked to rob
he's going to find out timing and cost to do a bigger american ass
of economist number on wolak
co
while i work the manifesto gang
best
jeff
the bad news is i left my bag with clothes and toiletries at the dome
the good news is it's a great excuse to have to go up again this weekend
thanks again for everything
really nice with only the principals---smaller
more intimate
less mess---and the ping pong table is a huge hit
i hope you enjoy my loving ribbing as much as i enjoy yours
best
jeff
yeah
tell me about it
payback for what
so that means you don't enjoy my loving ribbing
p.s
my butt still feels like there's all these rubberbands wrapped around it
fyi
for future reference
you need to worry less about cameron
because i think that it's one of those very deeply rooted mom/daughter things
and will take time to work out
and i sense a phase that she's going through that is just like the one that my older sister went through with my mom around the same age
which i wasn't particularly happy about
but i think it's normal
sort of
i'd be happy to talk about it if you want some time
i think part of it is going to be that primordial thing where she's starting her own gig with scott and it's going to be like a second
breaking away
the one that comes after teen-age-dom
so it's less about you and much more about her
and scott
to some degree
too
i hope i'm not confusing matters more
hugs
jeff

status of core/noncore proposal buzz about the proposal in sacramento is still significant and growing
our name is being tossed about
but in the context
apparently
of
some parts of enron's core/noncore proposal
hertzberg is slated to meet with his caucus this evening to discuss the plan
conversation with governor's financial advisor talked to michael hoffman today
one of governor's financial advisors
they've run hertzberg's version of the core/noncore model
i.e
noncore eats iou past due
using their mou numbers
they said that the model
can work
if noncore can contract for $0/mwh
this is pretty consistent with our analysis
hoffman's guys are doing a final scrub on the numbers and hoffman will fax me the results tomorrow am
hertzberg is coming up with
additional
twists
however
the twists include increasing the bond issuance to ~$0b
to keep core rates down
hoffman and co
are concerned that the market can't/won't swallow $0b of additional debt
the mou would issue about $0b
in addition
hertzberg wants to stretch it out for 0 years
the mou would issues 0-year paper
hoffman and co
are concerned that the market won't buy 0-year paper
hoffman
co
continue to work on the dwr creditworthiness issue
if not done by july
they'll lose the contracts they've signed
which have out clauses in the event that credit isn't in place by july
conversation with the chamber the chamber of commerce called and i re-iterated
again
the key features of our core/noncore proposal
as opposed to other features being tossed about
they were very appreciative
liked the features of our proposal
again
and we agreed to stay in close contact
finally
i have a call into hertzberg to see what else i can learn
best
jeff
for some reason
the sites not opening
i'll keep trying and keep you informed
best
jeff
you are most welcome
indeed
what time's the show
do we know what station
here are my points
stop the blame
stop the political rhetoric
if there's evidence that manipulation has occured
produce it--the investigations have been going on for a year
stop the mccarthyist tactics
californians want a real
comprehensive solution that is bi-partisan more supply less demand no state takeovers
state out of procurement now
a real energy market place
competition and choice
creditworthy utilities
prices that reflect the true cost of power
i've received a copy of the powerpoint presentation hertzberg made to the his caucus
unfortunately
it's a fax and hardly legible
i can make out
however
that it is the core/noncore plan
i'm attempting to get a better copy and will distribute as soon as i get my hands on it
please keep confidential that we have a copy
thanks
best
jeff
folks
here is a rewrite of the power point presentation referenced in the previous note
again
please keep confidential and do not distribute
it's the copy that hertzberg used to present to his caucus.thanks
best
jeff p.s
our numbers show that noncore for edison would be about 0% of load
hertzberg has it at about 0%
u won't believe this
o yes u will
karen just called and told me that the event's been cancelled
but don't cancel anything until i get a chance to talk to her live first
thanks
jennifer
to my knowledge
there's been no decision made to date on this issue of exit fees
either at the puc or the legislature
but it's my understanding that the rate increases just imposed by the puc will not apply to da customers
what happens to customers who switch today
i'm not sure
jeanne
any thoughts
fyi
i'll be overnighting to you the analysis done for core/noncore by the gov's finance people

plan would have biggest customers pay edison's debt greg lucas
sacramento bureau chief thursday
may 0
0
0 san francisco chronicle url
sacramento
legislative leaders are drafting a new rescue plan for southern california edison that would put the utility back on its feet financially at the expense of its biggest customers
the plan would leave manufacturers
refineries and other big industrial customers with the burden of paying nearly all the utility's $0.0 billion back debt through a dedicated charge
residential and small commercial users would be on the hook for only a fraction of the back debt
big users say it is unfair to saddle them with all of edison's debt
but supporters of the plan say it's these users that wanted deregulation and should shoulder the costs it created
we're trying to put something together in a way that solves all these problems
and if people are to be pigheaded about it
we won't solve any problems
said assemblyman fred keeley
d-boulder creek
santa cruz county
although the plan is an alternative to gov
gray davis
proposed deal to put edison back on its feet financially
it could be used as a model to help restore pacific gas and electric co
to solvency
democrats say the plan contains some elements desired by republicans
but gop lawmakers object to saddling large business users with edison's debt
the plan is based on the way gas customers are divided into
core
and
noncore
users
separating
core
users under this proposal
electrical users would be divided the same way
core users would be customers who use 0 kilowatts or less a month
noncore would be those using more than 0 kilowatts
out of edison's 0.0 million customers
only 0,0 would be noncore customers
but those 0,0 customers use about 0 percent of edison's demand for energy
core customers would get their power from generators owned by edison
long
term contracts and alternative energy producers
such as wind farms and solar panels
on contract with the utility
that would mean those customers would no longer be subject to the whims of the spot market
which has far higher prices than other sources of electricity
large users
the noncore customers
would be given the right to negotiate to buy their power directly from generators or build on-site power plants to make themselves energy self-sufficient
the plan would be phased in through january 0 to give large energy customers time to prepare for buying power on the open market
during that period
residential
small business and large industrial users would all share in paying off edison's debt
but in 0
that burden would shift exclusively to the big users
republican lawmakers and those same large users have been clamoring to be given what is called
direct access
to generators so they can negotiate cheaper rates
enron is also backing the idea of cutting loose the largest electricity users because that would create a built-in market for the energy the company sells
large users who want to remain on the grid could do so
sources said edison officials met with lawmakers over the weekend to iron out details of the plan
a spokesman for edison said he was
encouraged
by the talks
i haven't seen a finished product or a plan
said bob foster
a senior vice president with edison
they're approaching this in a spirit of goodwill and trying to find a solution
big businesses complain that the plan does not work because right now
there is nowhere they can buy cheap electricity
we're very concerned that separating the core from the noncore means we will experience extreme rate hikes over the next two years
said d.j
smith
a lobbyist for the california large energy consumers association
when you add blackouts
the multiple interruptions of production and another potentially huge rate hike
the result would be catastrophic to the economy
smith said
added dorothy rothrock
a lobbyist for the california manufacturers and technology association
what's the rationale for the noncore to be paying the entire edison undercollection
it sounds to me like just pure politics
they don't want voters to pay because they vote
consumer advocate smells a rat harvey rosenfield
head of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights
said he thought the plan would eventually turn into a bailout as business interests muscle lawmakers into pushing some portion of edison's debt onto residential and smaller commercial customers
i think it's a trick
we've seen this same tactic used at the public utilities commission
where what were supposed to be rate increases for big business end up costing more for residential and small businesses
rosenfield said
the new plan also does not include the outright purchase of edison's part of the transmission system that loops electricity around the state
davis backs buying the lines for $0.0 billion
democrats have insisted that for the state's financial help
taxpayers receive something of value
republicans have insisted that they will back no proposal that includes state purchase of transmission lines
in the new proposal
the state would have a five-year option to buy the transmission lines for $0.0 billion
the book value of the asset
in addition
the utility would make $0.0 billion available to the state to either purchase other assets
such as edison's hydroelectric facilities
for example
or use it in partnership to build new power plants

municipal utilities warned governor says he'll seize excess electricity if prices don't come down david lazarus
chronicle staff writer thursday
may 0

sacramento
gov
gray davis threatened last night to seize excess power generated by california's municipal utility districts
which he said have charged even higher electricity prices than out-of-state generators
davis said in an interview with the chronicle that some municipal utility districts have charged the state as much as 0 percent more than the average wholesale cost demanded by private power companies
the governor's tough talk came as california suffered through a stage 0 power alert and faced the prospect of a long
hot summer of rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity prices
so far this year
the state has paid more than $0.0 billion to buy power for its cash-strapped utilities
in a variation on his threat to seize power plants from out-of-state generators if they continue gouging california ratepayers
the governor said he would use his executive powers to claim excess juice from the locally owned utilities if they do not lower their prices
he said he is ready to go to court if they offer resistance
we're going to get that power one way or another
davis said
municipal utilities are city-owned power companies
in northern california
there are municipal utilities in alameda
palo alto
redding
sacramento and santa clara
los angeles has the largest municipal utility in the state
0 days till contract details for the first time
the governor also gave a time frame for releasing details of more than 0 long-term electricity contracts california is signing with generators since the financial meltdown of the state's two biggest utilities
he said that after about six more contracts get nailed down
he expects full details to be made available within 0 days
although the contracts involve nearly $0 billion in public funds
davis and other state officials have adamantly refused to divulge their contents
insisting that secrecy is needed to remain competitive during negotiations
the chronicle and other media outlets have filed suit for access to the contracts
arguing that the public has a right to know how its money is being spent
rude awakening while going toe-to-toe with the out-of-state generators
the last thing davis needed was for municipal utilities
the home team
as it were
to emulate the texas big boys and dig deep into california's pockets
yet the governor's negotiators have been struggling for weeks to convince municipals that they are obliged to provide power at cost
which davis insisted they are required to do by law
he met last week with the heads of a dozen municipal utilities and told them explicitly that he would not tolerate gouging from within the state as california faces a summer of potential blackouts
the governor said after the meeting that the municipals had agreed
to make most of their excess power available this summer
at prices significantly lower than those being charged on the spot market
apparently
however
little progress has been made since that declaration
davis told the chronicle last night that he is still
trying very hard to promote this notion that we're all in this together
while unwilling to specify which municipal utilities have been most aggressive in their pricing
and refusing to place a dollar amount on how much the utilities charged
davis said he is prepared to seize up to 0 megawatts of output if the they do not change their ways
eight hundred megawatts is enough power to light about 0,0 homes
representatives of the various municipal utilities could not be reached for comment
nor could a spokesperson for the california municipal utilities association in sacramento
i told them that they will either
reduce their prices
voluntarily or involuntarily
the governor said
uncertain future it remains to be seen
however
whether the municipal utilities will play ball
to date
they have shown a firm inclination to go their own way
in march
lodi's municipal utility district and a northern california municipal utility cooperative that includes palo alto
santa clara and alameda told pacific gas and electric co
that they will not participate in rolling blackouts during power shortages
i won't arbitrarily screw my customers
so 0,0 pg&e customers can turn on their lights somewhere else
said alan vallow
director of the utility serving lodi's 0,0 residents

as was expected
very unhappy about that portion of the plan that would stick them with all of edison's debts
they view it as unfair and punitive

dow jones newswires los angeles
california lawmakers are mulling yet another set of ideas for rescuing embattled southern california edison
and this time businesses would be on the hook
in an attempt to deflect charges of a bailout that have thus far stymied efforts to restore the utility to solvency
legislators are now considering ways to shift the burden of financing the rescue from residential ratepayers to the state's largest businesses
aides to key state lawmakers said this week
the ideas being worked over by senate president pro tem john burton
assembly speaker robert hertzberg and assemblyman fred keeley have yet to take shape as formal proposals
but an aide to burton said some key lawmakers are so
desperate
to keep edison international
eix
utility southern california edison from following pg&e corp
pcg
unit pacific gas
electric into bankruptcy court that they are willing to consider anything that will takse residential consumers out of the equation
the idea is that the large industrial customers are the ones who pushed for deregulation in the first place
so they should be responsible for bailing out edison
the aide said
we're looking to take the burden off of residential ratepayers
the premise of a plan discussed by lawmakers on a conference call thursday is to designate southern california edison's largest commercial ratepayers as non-core customers
those customers
some 0,0 users of more than 0 kilowatt-hours a month
would be responsible for financing the cost of power the utility must purchase or have purchased for it in the wholesale market
the non-core customers would also help the utility recoup most of its $0.0 billion in unrecovered power costs through a surcharge on their bills
core residential customers would be protected from the wholesale power market as the primary beneficiaries of the low-cost power the utilities generate themselves or have locked up in long-term contracts
enron pushing access to customers separately
enron corp
ene
has been lobbying lawmakers for several weeks to win approval to sign power-supply contracts with southern california edison's largest commercial customers
leaving the utility to serve just its residential customers and small businesses
aides to gov
gray davis
messrs
burton and hertzberg said
an enron executive confirmed that the company sent a four-page proposal to mr
hertzberg proposing that southern california edison's large industrial customers sign so-called direct-access contracts with enron
enron also has recently made a presentation about direct access to some members of the california chamber of commerce
under the proposal
heavy users would be required to contract directly with companies like enron for their power
direct access was a key part of the state's 0 deregulation plan
but was scrapped early this year when the state started buying wholesale power in place of the utilities
the core/non-core proposal is one of several being discussed by lawmakers as alternatives to a memorandum of understanding mr
davis struck with edison in april
the mou
which doesn't vary much from an agreement in principle reached in february
has been called dead on arrival by some lawmakers
who have been mulling various alternatives rather than moving the agreement forward
state sen
debra bowen
a redondo beach democrat and chairwoman of the senate energy committee
said there are so many
plan b's
floating around the legislature that
we're going to need to hire an apiculturist
steve maviglio
a spokesman for the governor
said the davis administration is still dedicated to seeing legislation to enact the memorandum of understanding move through the legislature
but said separating the utility's
core and non-core
customers would be at the forefront of new discussions
it was too early to say whether the governor would support the plan
he said
dominic dimare
a lobbyist with the california chamber of commerce
said the chamber has told the davis administration that shifting the burden of the southern california edison bailout to businesses is
a very bad idea
that could cost the state billions of dollars in economic activity
this
plan
would really screw businesses
mr
dimare said
we just got hit with a 0 to 0% rate increase
we're dangerously close to losing our businesses to other states

greetings senator
i'm informed that mr

in the meantime
i am attaching a document that ken lay distributed to business leaders at meetings in silicon valley and los angeles about 0 weeks ago
it is the document referenced in the dow jones wire story and does include the company's view that a core/noncore market structure is the right answer for california
though the document has not been shared with speaker mr
lay discussed the core/noncore proposal extensively during his trip to sacramento several weeks ago when
as you recall
he visited sacramento and met with a variety of legislators from both sides of the aisle to discuss solutions to california's electricity crisis
but unlike the speaker's core/noncore proposal that i read about in today's san francisco chronicle
enron's the proposal does not shift all of edison's past due amounts from small consumers to california businesses
the company believes that all customers should be responsible for the costs that have been incurred on their behalf
i will be in sacramento on monday
june 0th and would like to discuss our proposal with you further if you would find it useful and if your schedule permits
i'm also available to discuss the proposal further by phone if you would like to talk before monday

municipal utilities lambaste davis threat to seize power david lazarus
chronicle staff writer friday

0 san francisco chronicle url
california municipal utilities reacted with shock and anger yesterday to gov
gray davis
threat to seize their excess power if they did not slash prices to below-market rates
i feel totally betrayed
said george fraser
general manager of the northern california power agency
an association of 0 municipal utilities
it's clear to me that the governor doesn't understand the power business
this new dimension to the state's energy woes came as authorities issued their first one-hour warning of imminent blackouts in the bay area
only to cancel the warning an hour later when additional power supplies were found
davis told the chronicle in an interview wednesday that some city-owned municipal utilities had charged even higher electricity prices than the out-of
state generators he has accused of gouging california consumers
he said he was prepared to use his executive authority
to get that power one way or another
if the utilities did not lower their prices
the state so far has spent more than $0 billion buying electricity on behalf of cash
strapped pacific gas and electric co
and southern california edison
what the governor said makes no sense whatsoever
said jerry jordan
executive director of the california municipal utilities association
he was definitely off-base
jordan said most municipal utilities already provided all surplus power to california's electricity market
however
he said
the municipals buy power at market rates to meet their own shortfalls
and thus have a responsibility to their customers
local city residents
to sell any excess supplies at the same sky-high price levels
our utilities are going to do what they can to help the state of california
jordan said
but they aren't going to do that at the expense of customers
davis
threat followed a meeting last week with the heads of about a dozen municipal utilities
participants said the tone of the discussion was generally cordial
and it was understood the governor's office would work up a plan for future electricity purchases
davis
threat came out of the blue
they said
we're willing to sell our excess power
said john roukema
assistant director of silicon valley power in santa clara
but we have to deal with the same market conditions that the governor does
davis doesn't see it that way
he believes that many municipal utilities are exploiting california's power shortage in the same way that out-of-state generators are walking off with billions of dollars in windfall profits
the governor's top energy adviser
s
david freeman
said in an interview yesterday that davis
threat to seize the municipals
power was intended as a reminder that the state expected prompt action on the issue
we want to be sure that the municipals are not just talking the talk but doing what they say
freeman said
he said municipal utilities should be selling surplus power at the same level it cost to generate electricity
plus a reasonable markup of about 0 percent
freeman finds himself in a somewhat awkward position on the matter
before signing on with the davis administration
he was head of the los angeles department of water and power
by far the state's largest municipal utility
the los angeles department has been accused by both federal and state officials of charging some of the highest prices of all for electricity
earlier this year
it was asking as much as $0,0 per megawatt hour for its output
frank salas
the department's chief operating officer
said such prices were necessitated by high production expenses
we were just recovering our costs
he said
for his part
freeman insisted that no such pricing had occurred on his watch
there was tremendous pressure on me to charge more
he said of urgings from los angeles mayor richard riordan and other local officials for higher profits
demands that freeman said he had resisted
that pressure may have increased now that i'm gone
he said
i don't know what they're doing now
the department of water and power's salas countered that freeman should know exactly what his former colleagues were doing
we have the same pricing structure now that we had when he was boss
he said
fraser at the northern california power agency said it was strange that davis would be so aggressive in his dealings with the municipals
which provide only about 0 percent of the state's power needs

i've had several phone calls with large customer groups over the past 0-hours
mostly explaining our noncore/core proposal
in contrast to the one that the assembly democrats have launched which would saddle business with 0% of the utilities
past debts
as folks know
the cost shift provision of the dems plans have been erroneously attributed to us in some cases
the business folks have been very appreciative of the discussions and have recognized that
generally
our proposal is a fair and reasonable one
they are going to try to set up direct negotiations with hertzberg and have requested that i be part of those negotiations
they are not sure that hertzberg will go along with the idea
but they're going to try
they will get back to me when they find out
i'll report back soon as i hear something

please keep this note
and the information contained in the note confidential
as folks are aware
we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to california's electricity crisis
in the room are the major large customer groups
environmentalists
small customers
turn
independent energy producers
labor
the western states petroleum association
and enron
the negotiations were convened by the speaker of the assembly
bob hertzberg
when hertzberg convened the meeting
he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure
similar to the structure in place in california's gas market
i.e
large customers are required to buy gas from the market
with direct access available to all other customers
in effect
core
customers
rez and small business
would be served by the utilities
retained generating assets and qf contracts
and large customers would go to market
the core/noncore structure would begin 0.0.0
the negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks
but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in californis
but who pays for the utilities
past debts and the costs of dwr power purchased between january and today remain very contentious
unfortunately
with the release of the information regarding the dwr contracts last friday
it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts
the problem is that
if core is served by utility gen and qfs
and large customers are in the market
there is no
or very little
need for the dwr contracts
instead
they look like a signficant stranded cost
hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to enron for creative ways to address
the dwr contract problem
in order to prevent the contracts from 0
killing the core/noncore deal and 0
forcing california to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by david freeman that does not include direct access
christian yoder and steve hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any
out clauses
that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions
my cursory review of the contracts suggests that
outs
for the state are minimal or nonexistent
in addition
we've started batting around ideas about how the state might reform the contracts
all this said
want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights
we'd like to have a quick call tomorrow
0-0 minutes
to brainstorm some options that we can offer hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive
we'd like to try to have the the call at 0 pm pdt
please let me know if this works for you
and if it doesn't
please let me know if there's a time after 0 pm pdt that works for you
thanks
jeff
glad to hear that there's a meeting set up
my apologies again
i'm very wrapped up in trying to help solve california's electricity crisis
don't hesitate if there's anything else that i can help out with

but it's going to be best for you and me and colleen and scott and tony blair and oprah winfrey and sammy soza
and everyone else
if my contact with the wonderful ms silva is minimized in the immediate future
don't worry about it
no big deal
just want and need you to know
and please keep it very confidential
thanks
best
jeff
anyone in the market for a $0 hammer
alan
i'd like to use the info
i.e
we think the contracts are $xx billion out of the money
in the context of the negotiations that i'm in and i'd also like to tell hertzberg---it will provide a powerful and compelling case to do something about the contracts in order to 0
save the state's rear end and 0
ensure that the core/noncore structure remains alive
i wouldn't hand out any paper showing any analysis
how long would it take to refine
best
jeff
recall that at 0:0 pm on wednesday
june 0th
we are scheduled to see the giants clobber the bums
please don't use this yet
refinements are underway by alan comnes
but wanted to give you a flavor for how underwater the dwr contracts are
if marked to market today

he got a pie in the face
jeffrey skilling
chief executive of houston-based enron corp
was nailed with a pie by a protester at the beginning of his speech at the commonwealth club of california
enron has come under fire after accusations from gov
gray davis and state officials that it and other energy companies forced electricity prices skyward by holding back supply
enron has denied such claims
and joined other power producers in arguing that the state and utilities owes them billions in unpaid bills
davis acknowledged that pacific gas
electric co
which has declared bankruptcy
and southern california edison together still owe generators such as enron
duke energy
mirant and reliant energy about $0.0 billion for past electricity sales
state officials countered that wholesalers charged as much as $0 billion in illegal overcharges dating back to may 0
the feuding groups are to meet in a single room next week under a federal order to try and work out agreements that could determine how billions of dollars will be divided

davis trying to spin out of energy crisis energy advisers have ruthless reputation ken garcia saturday
june 0
0
0 san francisco chronicle url
no matter how much you try to spin the facts
the truth usually topples out
this will explain why gray davis is suffering from a reality blackout
because no one spins harder or faster than our opaque leader
who
quite equitably
is suffering his own power crisis
why do you think they call him gray has an unrelenting black-and-white problem
how can he explain away his indecision in grappling with the energy crisis sooner
his inability to hammer out a deal with the utilities and power suppliers before they had the state handcuffed and his frantic response to spend $0 million in public funds to purchase future electricity without offering consumers the details of the pact
the truth is
he cannot
although he has tried mightily
and to that end he made one of his biggest mistakes yet
no small feat when you consider he is at the center of one of the sharpest economic tailspins in california's history
rather than tackle the issues head-on
davis did what he has always done
use consultants and polling data to try and navigate the minefield of public opinion to put himself in the best possible light and blame others for his problems
it's a game bill clinton perfected but at which the governor is a mere weekend hobbyist
davis
decision to hire two former clinton-gore spin doctors to explain away his role in the energy crisis has been as predictable as this summer's threat of rolling blackouts
if only
in this case
he could have kept his critics in the dark
while the state's taxpayers were hit with record electricity bills
davis was pointing his finger at every official in the federal government who might conceivably have played a role in the crisis and especially those power suppliers in the lone star state who have been soaking california ratepayers dry
it is obviously true that the bush administration has been reluctant to help the nation's most populous state because it voted for al gore in november
and time will probably show that the power companies in texas and beyond were being snopes-like in their dealings with the golden state
but there is no getting around the fact that davis severely exacerbated california's energy plight through his own inaction
as evidenced by our sweltering soul mates in san diego who were experiencing blackouts and spiraling electricity costs early last summer
yet why suffer the facts when it's so much easier to just scramble them
when the energy crisis hit its peak this spring and davis
popularity ratings began short-circuiting
he brought in chris lehane and mark fabiani
who had been as ubiquitous in the scandal-ridden clinton administration as the stain on a certain intern's dress
the pair became so adept at parrying the thrusts of truth directed by the press each day that they earned the label
masters of disaster
which may be why davis thought of them when he considered the calamity beginning to envelop him
if only he had considered the accompanying stink
lehane and fabiani are considered by the political cognoscenti as nothing less than ruthless
partisan hired guns
happy to attack anyone standing between them and a monthly paycheck
unfortunately for davis
the rhetorical hit men's salaries are being paid by california taxpayers
who are none too happy that they will be socked with billions of dollars in extra energy charges as a result of davis
lack of leadership
so although lehane and fabiani's $0,0 monthly consulting fees may look paltry to a governor who has contributed to california's lost billions
it looks quite a bit different to those little people in the bleacher seats
sometimes known as california's 0 million-plus residents
the hiring of the disaster duo has led to a lawsuit by an anti-tax group from sacramento that alleges lehane and fabiani are violating the state political reform act because the gunslingers have also worked for southern california edison as consultants
a generally accepted no-no for public officials
even those who worked in washington
and state controller kathleen connell
a fellow democrat
has rightfully refused to pay state funds for the clinton-gore castoffs
because she said it is inconceivable that the two men are working on state policy
not politics
as required by law
until obfuscation and misdirection become part of the official state code of ethics
it's fair to say connell is on pretty firm ground
or as one member of a tax protest group put it
we are adding insult to injury to have the governor who feels the pressure of this crisis to spend this kind of dough for damage control
damage control is not supposed to incite more damage
but right now davis is a metal helmet in an electrical storm
his arrogant treatment of state voters
his refusal to shoulder responsibility and his efforts to spin his way out of trouble has left even die-hard democrats searching for a more palatable replacement
that decision will come next year when davis is up for re-election
and the millions of people who chose him because he seemed a safe but dull choice will now realize that there is little solace in gray areas
since the governor is involved
it seems apt to call it a cautionary tale
but by the time the spin doctors are through
it may start to sound more like an urban legend

jeff officials criticize energy report posted at 0:0 p.m
pdt thursday
june 0
0 mercury news california's energy crisis is expected to increase unemployment
reduce production and aggravate an already weakening economy
according to researchers at the university of california-los angeles
the impact
however
will likely depend on how state officials choose to deal with the failed deregulation scheme
the authors of the report released thursday come down heavily in favor of lifting price controls and dramatically increasing the price consumers pay as a way to reduce the economic fallout
``california's economy is sufficiently large and dynamic that it will weather the current power crisis without being derailed
the report says
``however
our analysis reveals that this impact can be moderated by an approach that does not shift today's problems to tomorrow
the study
``short circuit
will the california energy crisis derail the state's economy
came under fierce criticism from gov
gray davis
office
steven maviglio
davis
spokesman
said many of the assumptions used to produce the report are either outdated or flat wrong
``it deserves its rightful place sitting on the shelf gathering dust
maviglio said
``like any crystal-ball report
it's essentially irrelevant
edward lamer
a ucla professor
and christopher thornberg
a visiting professor at ucla
collaborated on the report with a team of researchers from the cambridge energy research associates
the study concludes that california's gross state product will be cut by anywhere from
0 percent to 0.0 percent in 0 as a result of the energy crisis
in addition
energy problems will increase unemployment by
0 percent in 0 and 0.0 percent in 0
the report predicts consumers can expect 0 hours of rolling blackouts this year
however
the report argues that the impact could be dramatically reduced if the state would raise the price consumers pay for energy to match the wholesale costs
this could reduce blackouts to 0 hours
lower the debt and interest the state will have to pay for electricity and encourage investment in the state to increase energy supplies
but peter navarro
a management professor at the university of california-irvine
was skeptical of the report's findings
he said it was almost impossible to build models complex enough to take into account all the factors that affect energy prices in the state
in addition
he said the report seems to assume that there is no manipulation of the current market
which navarro argues could be distorting prices as well
``how do you justify raising retail rates to 0 cents for power that costs a nickel to generate when there is some evidence that the market is flawed
navarro said
``this report seems to have an industry point of view and an industry agenda

should be back in town around 0 pm
best

let's discuss further
i've been in close contact with chris on this
i'm not sure that we necessarily need a
presentation
on the issue
speaking only for california
policy makers and industry participants know a
that there's a problem and b
that the magnitude of the problem is significant
and there's not a heckuvalot of leg work that needs to be done on that front
i would suggest that we continue to work on analysis internally
and spend some time discussing further the extent to which we need a presentation for external consumption
as everyone's aware
this issue is a very complicated one and sensitive one for enron and we need to be very careful w.r.t
how we approach it

in case you haven't heard about the likely cpuc delay and px credit off the table we're hearing the vote will be delayed until july 0
no final confirmation yet
and now both draft decisions have been modified to defer action on the px credit issue
a major victory on that issue
sue mara enron corp
fyi
my understanding is that the decisions would actually go out prior to aug
with
effective date
in aug
thus providing time for the appeals process
do others have a similar or different view
do we intend to stay in touch
in view of the fact that there's been some
breathing room
provided by the puc delaying its da vote
and given the heavy lifting that is still needed to get the core/noncore agreement teed-up and through
happy 0th to all

greetings
hope everyone had a pleasant 0th
i've read the respective burton and hertzberg language on amending ab 0x
the burton language looks cleaner and simpler
though there may be reasons to include some of the hertzberg language
too
i'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill
i would appreciate your feedback
the amendments would be as follows
customers who were on direct access when dwr started buying power
jan
0th
and are still on direct access when the bill passes
should be exempt from paying for the bonds
in short
customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their esp
and once from dwr
since these customers receive power services from their esp
they never consumed dwr power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it
customers who have been utility customers since dwr started buying power but subsequently switched to direct access should only pay for power provided by dwr that they actually consumed
no more and no less
for example
if a customer was a utility customer when dwr started buying power but switched to direct access on may 0st
then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing dwr for power deliveries that took place from jan
0th thru april 0th
i believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 0-0 weeks
or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks
they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now
and rather than leave the issue hanging
which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers
i suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers
obligations are
your thoughts are appreciated
in addition
we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get california out of the energy hole that it finds itself in
providing
0kw and above
customers with an incentive to switch to direct access as soon as possible could 0
reduce the net short position that the state
and ultimately consumers
have to finance
thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility
0
reduce electricity purchasing costs
and 0
reduce the burden on the state budget
with this in mind
i'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to direct access by september 0st
finally
it seems odd that the language directing the puc to suspend direct access is still in the bill
if a dedicated rate component is created
that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend direct access
and if that's the case
would it make sense to delete that language from the bill
look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the
core/noncore
proposal

jeff financial california changes stance on refunds
two sides far apart in energy talks peter behr the washington post final page e0 copyright 0
the washington post co
all rights reserved california officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity
saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $0 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year
gov
gray davis
d
said part of the $0.0 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts
whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for davis
we've made suggestions
we've offered various ways in which people could get us $0.0 billion
davis told the san jose mercury news in a report yesterday
you can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money
however you want to do it
it's just got to net out close to $0.0 billion
the new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a california settlement being conducted in washington by federal energy regulatory commission judge curtis l
wagner jr
according to sources close to the negotiations
yesterday
wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if california officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise
what i'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood
wagner told reporters
in the event we're unable to do that
friday
at some point i may offer a preliminary assessment
the settlement conference is set to conclude on monday
wagner
ferc's chief administrative judge
has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy
mountainous energy prices have bankrupted california
s largest utility
drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on
last friday
wagner rebuked davis's chief representative
michael kahn
chairman of california independent grid operator
the state's power grid manager
indicating that the state's demand for nearly $0 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high
sources said
wagner's settlement conference
which has involved more than 0 lawyers for all sides
is closed to the public and media
wagner complained last month that kahn was following a political agenda
and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a
joke
that the parties might as well wear
clown suits
according to a dow jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks
but he has also criticized the generators and power marketers
led by reliant energy inc
williams energy services
duke energy and southern co
for failing to make serious settlement offers
these sources said
the suppliers have offered to refund $0 million
provided the state is able to call off various california lawsuits demanding far larger refunds
sources said
wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to ferc's commissioners
ferc has tentatively called for $0 million in refunds
but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of california
s electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure
some energy analysts believe
davis's tactical change
offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement
comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals
california
s energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan
which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile
spot market
prices
when energy costs shot upward last summer
so did the state's electricity bills
in response
davis's aide
s
david freeman
and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers
the $0 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $0 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 0 years
that's well under the average of $0 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year
but above current power prices
and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade
energy analysts say
a new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $0.0 billion refund
davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a
refund
because the deals were reached
under commercial duress
according to sources close to wagner's negotiations
industry supporters say davis's refund figure is impossible to justify
there's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be
said michael zenger
california director of cambridge energy research associates
the state's advocates counter that if ferc enforced a
just and reasonable
standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit
the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $0 billion figure
it's not rocket science
but it does require the regulators to regulate
said frank wolak
a stanford university economist who heads an oversight committee for the california grid
those polar-opposite views have left both sides in wagner's conference room
billions of dollars apart
as the talks approached their final weekend
sources said
gee
tough break

company statement
san jose

july 0
reuters
independent power generator calpine corp
said on friday that its contracts with pacific gas and electric co
will be altered
ensuring that calpine will continue to supply power to the bankrupt california utility and that it will get paid more than $0 million for power already sold
calpine stocks rose more than 0 percent
or more than $0
to $0 after the announcement
as part of the contract modification
the $0 million
with interest
that the utility
a unit of pg&e corp
owes calpine in past due receivables under the contracts
will be elevated to
administrative priority status
a claim which is paid before any other general unsecured creditors
calpine will get the money
in a lump sum
as soon as pg&e has a confirmed reorganization plan
which can take as long as four to six months from now
calpine said
the move is also a step in the process of untangling california's energy crisis
which stemmed from a flawed deregulation plan that has hit the state with a series of rolling blackouts
under the agreement
calpine will continue to receive its contractual capacity payments
but it has also set up a fixed rate contract for the next five years of about 0.0 cents per kilowatt-hour
the contracts are known as qualifying facility contracts because calpine's power plants are qualifying facilities
these types of facilities represent more than 0 percent of the state's power supply and sell power generated from renewable energy sources to the regulated utilities
calpine is the first power company to modify its qf contract with pg&e to ensure that northern california consumers will continue to benefit from these affordable and reliable energy resources
calpine senior vice president james macias said in a statement
see you on sunday with language on direct access

california power-buying data disclosed in misdirected e-mail by daniel taub sacramento
california
july 0
bloomberg
california governor gray davis's office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electricity market
information davis has been trying to keep secret
through a misdirected e-mail
the e-mail
containing data on california's power purchases yesterday
was intended for members of the governor's staff
said davis spokesman steve maviglio
it was accidentally sent to some reporters on the office's press list
he said
davis is fighting disclosure of state power purchases
saying it would compromise negotiations for future contracts
this week
davis appealed a state judge's order to release spot-market invoices
purchase orders and confirmation sheets for power contracts signed through june 0
the state is buying electricity on behalf of utilities
which are burdened by debt
``it's an internal document
maviglio said of the e-mail
``we have a meeting every morning where we discuss issues of the day
the e-mail contained minutes of today's meeting
he said
according to the e-mail
the state bought 0,0 megawatt
hours of electricity for $0.0 million yesterday
one megawatt
hour is enough electricity to light 0 typical california homes for an hour
prices ranged from $0 to $0.0 a megawatt-hour
maviglio said the information in the e-mail is accurate
power for next-day delivery during peak-use hours averaged $0.0 a megawatt-hour on the california-oregon border yesterday
according to bloomberg energy service
california paid an average of $0 on the spot market
according to the e-mail
prices on the spot market tend to be higher than on the day-ahead market
the governor has proposed releasing data on spot-market purchases once a quarter
arguing that the state uses power-buying strategies tailored to each season
lawyers for the media and republican legislators say state law requires disclosure of contracts within seven days after they are signed

i.e
section 0
of the agreeement
see you later today
best
jeff
below is an update from the weekend's activities
the group negotiating the core/noncore proposal met over the weekend to attempt to put the proposal into legislative language/format
the product produced thus far is generally sloppy and ill-drafted and the individual facilitating the group is working tonite to integrate the comments provided and discussions that took place today
he will distribute a new draft by noon tomorrow
pdt
the plan as it currently stands is to deliver a product to hertzberg by cob tomorrow
monday
as expected
some in the group are attempting to
recontract
certain portions of the original deal
but those attempts are generally at the margin
the dwr contracts remain a key impediment to any deal
senator burton has still not definitively committed to a conference committee to produce a bill to deliver to davis
in addition
the legislation to create a dedicated rate component to service the bonds to repay the state budget for power purchased by dwr
and de-link the bonds from the dwr contracts
may be on a slower track than folks thought initially
will have more information tomorrow on where burton and the bond legislation stand
best
jeff
since it was only friday since delainey directed me to send info directly to him
i included him and the others on the last note in order to avoid looking like i was disobeying direct orders 0 hours after receiving them

transcript of a bizarre and unusual telephone call from the iso here is the transcript of the iso's real-time desk asking enron real-timetrader ryan slinger to help the iso
set
the market-clearing price
mcp
for replacement energy
the iso wanted enron to help set the mcp for replacement energy at $0.0
because the iso was upset that the mcp had dropped to a penny
and now market participants were buying the iso's excesenergy a penny
after having sold it to the iso for $0 the day before
there are two phone calls
the first call is the iso calling to ask us tohelp it to set the price
the next call occurs three minutes later and isthe iso calling because we didn't put in the bid
our trader told the isothat he had to
talk to his boss
because he
didn't want to do anything wrong
note
i have just learned a complicating detail
coincidentally
our deskdid put in a bid for $0.0 for hour 0
which was what the iso had requested
however
the bid had been formulated before the iso called ourdesk

um
iso
allen
this isn,t on a recorded line
but we wanted to do that because of some of the things that we are seeing
it would be good to keep it
themarket clearing price for replacement energy
at a higher price
it doesnmatter how many megawatts you put it at
but we want to clear it at a higher price

wait
you said we,re not on a recorded line
or we are
iso

we,re not
no
we,re not
okay
we already talked to the day-ahead research guy and myself

if it,s possible
to continue to set that
whether it,s 0 mw or whatever you want to put in there
enron
ryan
okay
um

we want to clear it at that because of some issues we are seeing as far as others that are taking advantage of the market
enron
ryan
oh yeah
because it had been clearing like at $0
hadn,t it
iso
allen
not replacement
enron
ryan
oh
not replacement
iso
allen
no
what happened is that we bought it back
see
the day-ahead was purchased at like $0 and then what happened is that the hour-ahead
a bunch of these people were buying it back for a penny over the
inter
ties
they were faking it
so we wanted to keep the price uphigh
allen and ryan
unintelligible
enron
ryan
so they were selling it
oh
in the day ahead
and buying itiso
allen
buying like 0 bucks
trying to make money off of it
thebasically they are trying to buy it back at a penny
enron
ryan
oh
that,s ridiculous
iso
allen
that,s really ticking us off and right now
enron
ryan
that to me signals
that,s probably powerex
isn,t it

allen
there,s about four of them right now
enron

shit
iso

and for the day-ahead for tomorrow
we didn,t
we didn,t
we took them out
basically
we,re not allowing anything over the ties
enron
ryan
i didn,t submit one for 0 or
iso
allen
that,s fine
they,ll probably go to a penny and theyprobably get excited and do a bunch
and we,ll hopefully cut them off if you can get the next price and the next market at 0 or 0

okay
all right
well
i,ll see what i can do

best

folks
here are my edits
for simplicity
i accepted all the other changes and put mine in strike-out-underline
they are confined to the direct access section
and to the provisions regarding
spot market service
in particular
based on our negotiations
i think it's accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as
an option to elect
instead
the language in the agreement states that it is a
backstop
in the event that on any given day a customer's esp doesn't show up with the power
in effect
it retains the utility's duty to serve
like the gas side
but does not expose the utility to any risk of cost recovery for the spot service provided
i've also added provisions which obligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at the outset of the program
i.e
the transition date
the customer
for whatever reason fails to elect term service or direct access service
in both cases
the spot services lasts for a maximum of 0 days
after which the customer must choose term or direct access service
please take a look at the language
while i haven't put any
stakes in the ground
up till now
i feel strongly about these changes
for reasons i'm happy to discuss
and if folks have issues with incorporating it into the document
i'd request that we have a very brief call to discuss
i believe that the language as proposed captures my conversation with dorothy
in addition
i've also taken a stab at language requested by delainey
i.e
what to do about da in the interm
there may be better ways to craft the language
but i took a shot nonetheless
finally
i'm assuming
based on yesterday's call
that
by delivering this document to the speaker today
no one is giving their approval
support
or anything else for each and every provision
i'm not prepared to
and cannot
do that at this time
thanks again to all for all the effort
and to dorothy for her patience in hearing me out earlier

the bond legislation the democrats in the assembly and sentate have agreed to language to create a dedicated rate component to repay the budget and de-link the bonds from the dwr contracts
but the republicans have still not agreed to go along
the bill would require a 0/0's vote to keep the bond issuance on schedule
so republican votes are necessary
the republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to go along
the conference committee senator burton does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the core/noncore proposal
using the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill than using the conference committee structure
but how much longer is uncertain
no sense yet of when hearings on the core/noncore proposal---in conference committee or otherwise--will take place
though burton continues to say that he wants to

only couple brief comments on the version that includes edison's comments
under the definition of
spot market service
it now reads
this service is available for large customers and medium customers whose service from a direct access provider has been interrupted
or who have failed to elect or be deemed to elect either direct access
core service or term service
i don't understand the meaning of the phrase
or be deemed to elect
if inserting the phrase serves an important purpose
then perhaps it's appropriate to leave it in
but we haven't discussed any reason for needing it
as such
given the last-minute nature of the change
it should be deleted
there is one heckuvalot of detail in the rate-related language that edison provided that we didn't have a chance to discuss in our negotiations
it may turn out that it's all fine
but i frankly haven't haven't had the chance to adequately wrap my meager mind around the language
so i just want to let folks know that many more comments on those pieces may pop up from my end in the near term
finally
i just want to raise a flag on section 0
a
0
regarding the green portfolio standard
we never discussed/analyzed those additional percentages and consequently we never established a
zone of comfort
around including those numbers
that may become an issue
and may not
just wanted to briefly flag it
thanks again for all the effort

it was a quick turn around
at hertzberg's request
to get the original
negotiated agreement into legislative language
i.e
martian
as soon as possible so that hertzberg could try to move on it in the legislature as soon as possible
in addition
the commission is likely to come out with its proposed
rate agreement
sometime this week
and is likely to release dwr's

next week
i heard from the gov's financial advisor that edison and dwr each want 0 cents out of the puc's recent 0 cent rate increase

ladwp
run by davis adviser
cashed in on calif crisis dow jones capital markets report via dow jones by jason leopold los angeles
dow jones
on a single day in june 0
the los angeles department of water and power
the largest municipal utility in the country
raked in $0 million selling california surplus power for $0,0 a
about 0 times the average price the utility charged the month before
that sale
reported by the california independent system operator and confirmed by the ladwp in an interview last june
was one of many instances in which the municipal utility cashed in on california's power crisis
on monday
the department of water resources
the agency that has been purchasing california's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's utilities
released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing the ladwp charged the state an average of $0 a megawatt-hour for power from jan
0 through may 0 this year
that price is about $0 higher than those charged by most of the out-of-state generators gov
gray davis has criticized repeatedly as price gougers
potentially embarrassing for the davis administration
however
is that the ladwp was formerly run by general manager david freeman
who in april became davis
top energy adviser
steve maviglio
press secretary to davis
said texas-based generators are primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's two largest utilities
anywhere they wear cowboy hats
they probably have handkerchiefs across their face
because they are robbing us blind
he said
the bad guys are clearly the out-of-state generators
freeman's trademark is a white stetson
the former ladwp chief
who last september quipped that a
blind pig could make money
under california's faulty deregulation setup
didn't return calls for comment
freeman took a leave of absence from the ladwp in january to negotiate long-term power contracts on behalf of the state
power to sell according to the dwr report
the ladwp brought in $0 million selling power to the state between jan
0 and may 0 this year
the ladwp
which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and which isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators
also cashed in throughout 0
the utility has 0,0 megawatts of generation capacity but only needs about 0,0 mw to serve its retail customers
freeing it to sell as much as 0,0 megawatts to the iso at prices comparable to what the generators were charging
the ladwp did so well that it was able to pay down $0 million in debt and will reduce its customers
rates in 0
it just shows you that enterprise is where you find it
freeman said in an interview last year
last july
ratings agency fitch concluded that california's electricity shortage provided ladwp
an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at favorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers
according to a report by the iso
manager of the state's electricity grid
the ladwp overcharged california for power from may 0 through february 0 by as much as $0 million
maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the utility
on tuesday
an ladwp spokesman defended the utility's power prices
saying the costs of producing electricity were extremely high
the iso has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $0 billion for electricity sales in the 0 months ended may 0
on monday
settlement talks between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down
other municipal utilities
including the sacramento municipal utility district and private companies like bc hydro in canada
have also racked up enormous sums selling surplus power to california at the last minute

davis plays in a virtual world while the energy reality continues
published july 0
0
california still has a very real and very severe energy crisis
to wit
the state is still running up massive debts as it pays more for power than it can recover from ratepayers and is having trouble borrowing billions of dollars to cover the debt
there is a strong possibility
perhaps a probability
that when summer's heat truly descends
there will be severe power blackouts as air conditioners demand more juice than california can generate or buy
one major utility
pacific gas and electric
has filed for bankruptcy protection and a second
southern california edison
is on the brink of joining it
there is
however
a virtual energy crisis consisting of political spin
media leaks and made-for-television buzz words
and it is rapidly becoming dominant
while the real situation fades into the background
this week's comic opera proceedings before a federal energy regulatory commission administrative judge in washington had little to do with reality and everything to do with the virtual version
gov
gray davis and other officials demanded $0.0 billion in refunds from the generators and brokers who have been selling california power for the past year
alleging that california is
in davis
words
being gouged and ripped off
but the number itself was more or less plucked out of thin air
an arithmetic exercise by the state power grid's traffic controller not intended for a refund proceeding
and while judge curtis wagner saw it as unrealistic
davis and other state officials insisted on its validity
there are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a billion dollars
wagner said as a final negotiating session collapsed
but that's a far cry from the $0.0 billion that davis insists is due
if you think california is going to settle for $0 billion in refunds
we will see you in court
davis said tuesday
why is davis being so belligerent
because it's good politics
ever since he began berating out-of-state generators and accusing them of ripping off california
davis
approval ratings have been climbing
if he settled for substantially less
the power generators probably would agree to a couple of billion dollars to rid themselves of the matter
davis would be embarrassed
politically
he's served by continuing to portray himself as fighting for california and against the out-of-state generators
that it's more political construct than reality is indicated by another event this week
davis
release of state power purchase data from early in the year
numbers that were made public only because a judge told him he had to do it
davis and his minions have been accusing texas-based generators and power brokers of particularly egregious price gouging
clearly playing on californians
instinctive mistrust of anything texan and implying that texan george w
bush is a co-conspirator
but the power purchase records
which were released only to journalists willing to pay a stiff fee
indicate that less than 0 percent of california's power purchase dollars were going to texas and the private sellers
in general
charged the state less than such publicly owned utilities as the los angeles department of water and power
the clearly adverse position being taken by ferc and the purchase data that undercut his jingoistic sloganeering are not
however
deterring davis from continuing to operate
at least for public consumption
in the melodramatic virtual world
one cannot
however
ignore reality forever
the likelihood of a pro-generator decision from ferc means that there will be no easy out for davis
or for his pending deal to prevent southern california edison from slipping into bankruptcy court
the legislature has refused to act on the edison rescue plan while it awaited an indication of whether the utility's debts would be slimmed down by ferc
this week's farcical events make it more likely that the edison deal will stall out permanently in the legislature and its creditors will force the utility into bankruptcy court later this summer
that's part of that nasty old reality that cannot simply be wished away

you may have read that calpine is close to reaching a deal with the state on its overcharges
about $0mm
note from structuring's analysis that alan sent around that calpines share of the stranded costs is about 0% of the total amount of stranded costs arising from the dwr contracts
that is
of the $0.0b
present value
of stranded costs
the calpine contracts account for about $0.0b so
in exchange for settling on $0mm
calpine gets $0.0 b

please forward to others who need this information
as you know
enron's been involved with a group of business customers
small customers
labor and enviros trying to hammer out a core/noncore proposal that would act as a key modification to edison's mou with the governor
today
the assembly leadership released a bill
ab 0xx
that modifies the mou but does not follow the core/noncore proposal negotiated by the group
the bill just came out
is about 0 pages long
and thorough analysis has not yet been completed
the url for the bill is attached
based on a meeting attended this morning in sacramento,the key features of the bill
which is attached
are
direct access suspended until 0.0.0
suspension presumably effective on the effective date of the bill
transmission sale at 0x book
approximately 0%
or greater
of edison's undercollection absorbed by customers 0kw and above
create a trust to address the money owed to the generators and offer the generators 0 cents on the dollar
but does not do away with the suits
investigations
etc
the bill is completely silent regarding who will pay for the dwr contracts and what the payment structure will look like
reaction and timetable very chaotic
with considerable uncertainty about where
if anywhere
the bill will go
leaving many to believe that bankruptcy remains a strong possibility
business customers
and of course enron
are strongly opposed republicans are strongly opposed labor has big problems with the tx sale unless they get assurances that tx labor jobs are guaranteed
which is not yet included in the bill we are working with business to remove the direct access suspension we are also working on the senate side to attempt to get the senate to include direct access in their version of the modified mou
but the senate has been more hostile than the assembly to direct access
senate democrats still intend to run a bill that delinks payment of the bonds to repay general fund for power already purchased from the dwr contracts
ab0xx does not address this issue
senate democrats also intend to craft their own version of a
modified mou
word is that the senate will release their bond language and their
modified
mou this weekend or early next week
the assembly will hold an
informational
hearing on the bill tomorrow
saturday
to get members up to speed the assembly will have a committee hearing and vote on the bill on monday
with the intent of sending the bill to the full assembly for a vote on tuesday
the legsilature is supposed to have a month-long recess beginning friday
july 0th
which requires that both the budget and the energy issue get resolved by then
or suspend the recess and continue working will continue to provide updates as events unfold
if folks have additional comments on the bill
please direct them to harry kingerski and leslie lawner
who will ensure that they get into the hands of our lobbyists in sacramento

california power-price boost not needed
agency says
update0
by daniel taub sacramento
california
july 0
bloomberg
california regulators won't need to raise electricity prices for consumers to cover a planned $0.0 billion bond sale
said a spokesman for the agency that buys power on behalf of the state's utilities
the california department of water resources
which has spent more than $0.0 billion on power this year
is expected to recommend a rate increase of as much as 0 percent
dow jones reported today
citing three unnamed members of the state's public utilities commission
oscar hidalgo
a spokesman for the agency
said no rate increase is expected
``our folks are stunned by this revelation because it is nowhere near what our numbers show
hidalgo said
``in fact our numbers show that there is no need for any increase beyond what's already been done
the department of water resources will submit a report to the california public utilities commission today or monday with the state's revenue requirements for repaying a planned $0.0 billion bond sale
hidalgo said
the bonds are to be repaid by customers of utilities owned by pg&e corp
edison international and sempra energy
the bond sales
the largest municipal offering in u.s
history
are scheduled to begin in september
governor gray davis has said repeatedly that he believes the bonds can be repaid without further rate increases
his position hasn't changed
spokesman steve maviglio said today
previous increases in march
the puc voted to boost rates by 0 cents a kilowatt
hour at the state's two largest utilities
rates at pg&e's pacific gas
electric
the largest california utility
would rise by as much as 0 percent and southern california edison rates would rise by as much as 0 percent
the puc said at the time
the average consumer-price increase would be 0 percent
the puc said
the increase
the second this year
was intended to help the state pay for power purchases
the puc voted in january to raise rates about 0 percent
california treasurer philip angelides has said that the bonds will let the state cushion the immediate rate impact on residents and businesses by spreading power costs over time
the debt will be repaid over 0 years
investors have said they can't predict how the bonds will be received without knowing how much cushion is built into the revenue pledge backing the debt
legislation that paved the way for the bonds allows the state to raise electricity rates as needed to cover debt repayment
that pledge
typical for revenue bonds
usually entails a promise to raise a specific level of money annually to cover interest and principal payments on the debt and provide an added cushion
that formula
known as a debt service coverage ratio
must result in investment-grade ratings for california's power bonds
according to the legislation
investors want assurance that an issuer will raise rates to maintain the promised cushion
even if increases aren't needed at the time of the bond sale

we are looking for a similar resolution or decision for sempra

but we believe they have been given similar authority
here's the latest that we have on the legislation
0xx
released on friday
the assembly energy committee will hold an
informational
hearing on 0xx at 0:0 pm pdt today
informational
means that there won't be a vote today
attended a meeting this morning with the business groups with assemblyman dutra
self-proclaimed pro-biz democrat
who's an
author
of 0xx
hertzberg's chief staffer
and hertzberg's outside legal consultant
the dwr contracts continue to be the roadblock to a rational solution
dutra is unhappy with the process thus far----claimed he wasn't familiar with the
more recent version
of the bill
and was unhappy that there would be a hearing today---informational or otherwise--before he and the bill's other authors had agreed to final language from their perspective
dutra said that he was working to remove the direct access suspension and asked the biz groups to hold their fire until the amendments come out tomorrow
puc president lynch continues to oppose striking a deal in which the commission gives up all review of dwr's
revenue requirement
and simply flows all dwr costs through rates
but davis and his administration are putting her under enormous pressure to buckle under and agree
as a result
details of any
rate agreement
between dwr and the cpuc
and any public announcement by dwr of its
revenue requirement
is could be postponed until next week
unless there's a breakthrough with loretta
the governor's consultants now claim
and will reportedly testify at the hearing today
that there is enough room in the 0 cent rate increase to cover both edison's and dwr's revenue requirements
they cite lower gas prices and ferc's price cap as the driving force for the newly-found headroom
though many remain very skeptical
however
if the deal is applied to pg&e
it is unlikely that the 0 cent rate would be sufficient
according to the same consultants
the plan
at this point
is to have the bill--with amendments--discussed in the same committee tomorrow
and voted out of the committee
the bill would then be taken to the full assembly for an up or down vote on wednesday
it is unclear whether
at this point
there is agreement among assembly democrats to vote the bill out of the full assembly on wednesday
in addition
senate democrats continues to work on their own version of an edison
mou
and the working relationship between the assembly side and the senate side appears strained
the republicans in the assembly are staunchly opposed to 0xx and are generally being ignored by the democrats
since the democrats need no republicans to get a majority vote to pass bills
meanwhile
edison continues to twist
will report back after the 0:0 hearing today

this is the bill to de-link the bonds from the dwr contracts
recall that the argument to end da by the gov's finance folks
the bond folks
and angelides
the treasurer stems directly from this linkage
though hertzberg was initially a supporter
his legal consultant has been scared off by the gov's people
i.e
to de-link would
impair
the contracts
triggering breach
liquidated damages and the end of western civilization as we know it
the senate ain't buying that line
as a result
it's now a senate play
but they need republicans to get the 0/0's necessary for passage
which ain't likely to be easy
we urging brulte to go along
but only in exchange for deleting the
no da
language in ab0x and for legislative language assuring that da will continue
best
jeff please respond to sgovenar
i've taken a quick look at the bill and have attached for easy viewing
few questions
mike
i understand from our conversation yesterday that your following this on behalf of questar
do we know if the other pipelines have been active in any discussions on this bill
what about the generators
have then been involved
since presumably
their in need of lots more capacity
and they're referenced in the bill
what about large customers
they been screaming for more infrastructure
too
and many have blamed socalgas
and the puc
for not delivering it
do we know if pipelines
generators
large customers are supporting or opposing the bill
i'll try to check around
too
in between the electric mayhem
there doesn't seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the interstates from building into the state
if that's true
wouldn't the puc take those projects into account when doing its analysis and only require the utility to construct
and noncore to take
capacity that isn't already being met by others
i.e
interstates
bringing pipe into the state
any info you can provide on these fronts would be very useful
don't want enron too far out in front of opposition until we find out a bit more regarding 0
whose fer and agin it and 0
analysis of what the bill actually does/does not do

interview-enrononline sees volume growth
ceo says

reuters
as most players in a shrinking pool of online energy trading platforms struggle to stay alive
leader enrononline has a simple philosophy
if it ain't broke
don't fix it
the internet arm of the energy marketing and trading giant enron corp
enrononline predicts it will increase its volume and says it can coexist with the intercontinentalexchange
ice
the chief executive of enron networks told reuters on tuesday
the innovative company is always evaluating its business environment
ready to remold itself according to market demands
but it is not pursuing mergers or aquisitions for now
according to greg piper
i would never say never
but we're not proactively looking at aquiring an ownership position in any other exchange platform
piper said
with an average of $0.0 billion in trades every day
enrononline enjoys the highest volume of all energy electronic platforms
most energy trading platforms launched last year have failed to generate profits
its closest rival is ice
which routinely exceeds $0 billion a day
but while ice is a many-to-many exchange that matches bids and offers
on enrononline one can only trade with enron
it's a tool that supercharges our market-making business
piper said
enron is the no
0 natural gas and electricity marketer in the united states
about 0 percent of its transactions are captured through the electronic platform
as long as we show good prices to our customers
our volumes will continue to grow
piper said
the company is looking to grow online volume in products such as metals
steel
weather
petrochemicals and plastics
we're trying to remain the leader in energy and help our other markets get more traction
piper said
there is a huge amount of growth that we haven't even tapped into yet
piper said he is not worried about ice's recent success
the atlanta-based exchange recently took over london's international petroleum exchange and plans to transfer its open-outcry business online
significantly boosting its trade volumes
maybe six to 0 months from now
the story might be a lot different
piper said
but right now
there is room for the both of us
he added that enron traders do not shy away from trading on ice
many of the energy giants that founded ice and provide most of its liquidity are also enron's biggest clients
enron will seek out a good deal on ice when there is one
piper said
innovation key to success recognized as one of the most innovative companies in the united states
enron is constantly evaluating its position in the market and thinking of ways to become more successful
the right thing to do in november 0 was to launch enrononline
piper said
but we look at it every day and if it made sense to do something different
you can bet that enron would do it and we wouldn't be emotional about it
one of the company's advantages is the fact that its software is a flexible application that allows enrononline to easily go in an out of different markets and regions
it constantly adds new products to its trading arsenal
but piper said that enrononline has no plans to turn itself in a many-to-many exchange
we want to focus in providing our markets to others
he said
in the near term
we're not changing that
the company is considering licensing the application itself
but would not elaborate on who wants it and how much enron would ask for it
enrononline has been so successful that even its competitors take their hats off
i've been hearing for two years now that a one-to-many exchange wouldn't work
but enron just keeps proving people wrong
said frank getman
chief executive of online energy exchange houstonstreet
if you're willing to make tight two-way markets and be the best price in the market
then people will continue to use your site
enron's stock rose 0 cents to $0.0 a share on tuesday in trading on the new york stock exchange

dear john
you're opening my flood gates
and i'm going to refrain from getting entirely upset
please read the attached letter
which is the one that we sent to dunn last week
to wit
according to the iso's own calculations
enron represents four tenths of one percent--that's four-tenths of one percent---of the alleged
overcharges
john
combined
the government sellers
including ca munis have
by the isos own calculations
overcharged
california by a factor of one hundred times what enron has alleged to have
overcharged
see letter from winters to burton and ose
so notes like this
are ill-informed
i'm looking forward to mr
marcus and others directing their invective at smud
glendale
pasadena
burbank and ladwp
nettie hoge is now being quoted as saying
well
it's not the gouging
that's not the problem
it's the
profit motive
we've set up that's the problem
so munis are victims of a disease
profits
they can't control
everyone else is blood-sucking scum
in addition
please inform bill that sempra's contract with dwr is a drop in the bucket compared to others
it's easy and perhaps even good politics to go after sempra
but getting sempra ain't going to come within a light year of solving our dwr contract problem
sorry for the flame
but it's gotten extremely tiresome
and it ain't personal
but the emperor has no clothes
which will increasingly become increasingly apparent
all that aside
we've got other work that's more important
and i look forward to continue working on it
best
i owe ya
i think that you'll be fine for what you need it for on thursday with the camper shell on
trust me
fyi
new amendments out on da that keeley's accepted that i'm faxing to you right now
also
it's 0xx we're talking about
not 0xx
0xx is the bill that wright's authoring with the rs
also faxing to you reliant's

calif iso cuts power refund estimate to $0.0b from $0.0b by mark golden new york
dow jones
california's estimate of how much the state was overcharged by power suppliers dropped to $0.0 billion from $0.0 billion whan adjustment requested by a federal energy regulatory commission judge wastaken into account
according to data submitted to ferc last week
the california independent system operator's estimate fell when the grid operator excluded power bought by utilities not under its purview
and itsestimate could fall again as it works in other recommendations made by thejudge following the conclusion of 0 days of talks between power suppliersand the state over potential refunds last week
even as the iso continues to recalculate its refund estimate
however
thestate is sticking to the original $0.0 billion figure
which has been callearbitrary by critics
the $0.0 billion estimate merely establishes
a potential framework for settlement discussions
eric hildebrandt
the iso'chief analyst on the matter
told the ferc
ferc administrative law judge curtis wagner
who has dismissed the $0.0 billion figure as baseless and criticized california's delegation for notnegotiating in good faith
estimated in his report on the talks that refunddue may amount to about $0 billion
power suppliers offered just over $0million
wagner has recommended ferc hold a 0-day hearing to set the level of refunand has told the iso to revise its estimate of what california is owed
the iso's original $0.0 billion figure included electricity sales to municipal utilities and alternative energy suppliers that didn't go throughthe iso's wholesale markets
the california power exchange or the california department of water resources
without direct knowledge of the prices of those purchases
the iso made estimates
we know the volume
of the bilateral deals
hildebrandt said
the refunamount was based on extrapolation of observed prices in the spot market
resetting the baseline wagner told the iso to recalculate its figure using only sales through theiso and calpx markets
which were set up by the state's deregulation law for california's three investor-owned utilities to purchase power
in additionto sales to the california department of water resources
the dwr has been buying power for the utilities since pg&e corp

electric co
in arriving at his new estimate
the iso's hildebrandt also recalculated faprices
the baseline against which refundable amounts are determined
byretroactively applying the price controls ferc imposed june 0
those controls set prices by the operating costs of the least efficient generatorneeded to meet demand each hour
but last week
after hildebrandt completed his $0.0 billion estimate
wagnerecommended to ferc commissioners that the june 0 price control formula bemodified when used retroactively to determine refunds
those modifications
if applied to the iso's estimate
would cut refunds mufurther
for example
ferc's price limits are now based on a monthly averagof natural gas prices covering supplies throughout the state
wagner recommended using power producers
actual gas costs
since gas is considerably more expensive in southern california
using actual prices woucut potential refunds sharply
also
wagner said that refunds should be ordered on sales only as far back as oct
0
which would reduce the total amount claimed by california by aboutone-third
according to hildebrandt's previous monthly breakdown
iso staff is again recalculating the refund estimate to reflect some of wagner's recommendations
but the iso will still include sales back to may0
said spokeswoman stephanie mccorkle
the reason we're not going back just to oct
0 is that all of the overcharges going back to may should be repaid
mccorkle said
we just maintain that position
ferc baseline questioned in addition
hildebrandt argues in his recently released estimate that whenfair prices are calculated retroactively using ferc's new formula
the priccap should be based on the least efficient generator the iso knows to havebeen available
not the least efficient generator actually used to meet demand
that's because the ferc's new price controls require all available generators be made available to the iso at any time
hildebrandt said
applying that rule would raise the iso's revised estimate substantially
to$0.0 billion from $0.0 billion
one of the ways generators managed to manipulate prices higher
hildebrandtsaid
was to not offer cheaper power from more efficient units
consideringonly the least efficient generator actually used would make permanent therewards for such withholding
he said
the judge is in error to suggest that the actual
least-efficient
unit uswould have been called on if the must-offer requirement were in effect
hildebrandt said in an interview
in arriving at his estimate
hildebrandt determined the difference betweenactual sales prices and what prices would have been for every seller and foevery hour since may 0
0
had price controls been in effect
the iso released only the total potential refund
not the company-specific shares.hildebrandt took issue with generating companies that have complained hisnumbers aren't justified
these are based on very tangible records
he said
the idea that it's ablack box is misleading

the senate
the assembly and the governor are either poised to engage in very difficult negotiations
or the three are about to crash and burn and edison's going to be left dangling
in the senate
the senate bill 0xx is with about 0% likelihood going to be voted out of the senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee
burton announced during one of the two
informational
hearings that
this is it
despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won't prevent edison from going bankrupt
the key features of the bill are
banks and qfs get paid in full
edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers no direct access
there are conflicting reports about whether the senate will take up the bill tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the dwr contracts and whether the republicans will go along with it
in the assembly
the committee is hearing the wright and hertzberg bills as we speak
with hertzberg's the likely winner
that bill now provides for direct access under certain conditions
the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today
we're attempting to get the
july 0
date changed to
the effective date of the bill
or later
the assembly likely won't vote the hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest
the problem
the assembly and senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem---in short
the bills are two ships passing in the night
the democratic leaders
governor
hertzberg
burton
aren't talking
and burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody
the likely outcome given the circumstances
burton says he's done what he needs to do
i.e
passed out a
fair
bill
the assembly and senate can't agree
they finish the budget
time runs out
they leave friday
and edison's left twisting
that said
there's still a chance that the governor could call burton and sit down with burton and hertzberg and work something out by friday
or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out
but given burton
the chance of that happening seems very slim
in short
little has changed since yesterday

the wierdness continues
in the senate
after burton's
proclamation
yesterday afternoon that senate bill 0xx was
all edison was getting
period
the bill was voted down in committee and never made it to the full senate for a vote
the bill will be
reconsidered
i.e
voted on again
today in the same committee
in the assembly
hertzberg's bill
0xx
got voted down initially
until rod wright switched his vote and let it get out
0 xx then went to the appropriations committee
where it was voted out
and now it's scheduled for a floor vote this morning
0xx
the bipartisan bill led by wright

was also voted out of committee and will go to appropriations today

need to get the cameron's guitar so you guys can take with you to colorahdee

needed to get cameron's guitar fixed so i can use it during the competition in colorado
had to get it fixed at peacock
but need to pick up today
and prentice's

which is getting fixed
where can i call you
anything can happen
but hedy just talked to the executive offficer of the senate rules committee who told her that it is very unlikely that the full senate would vote on any contempt report before the senate leaves for recess
that is
they likely wouldn't vote on anything until they return in august
other info from the conversation
with respect to fines
sanctions
etc
he said that
they're making it up as they go
any vote on fines
etc
would only a require a simple majority to pass

here are two alternatives to the language in ab0x
the language does two things
0
ensures that da customers
costs are shifted to utility customers
0
ensures that da customers
don't unfairly escape any costs
e.g
bond payments
etc
we're assuming that you'll shop these with lenny and we'll work the reps on sb 0
lemme know
best
jeff
correction
0
ensures that da customers
costs are not shifted to utility customers
the republicans are currently on the senate floor arguing
noisily
repeatedly and passionately
that california
and the senate in particular
is being hypocritical and intellectually dishonest in attacking and investigating private companies and ignoring munis
one senator specifically identified prices charged by ladwp and smud and compared those prices to enron's
0/0 to 0/0 less than ladwp and smud charged
best
jeff
in the senate
today the senate passed out of committee sb0xx and is expected to pass the bill out of the full senate sometime today
the bill would de-link 0
payment for bonds issued to repay general fund dollars used to buy power from 0
payment for power contracts signed by dwr
the senate has thus far failed to get its version of the
edison mou
sb0xx
out the necessary committees in order to get it to the floor for a vote by the full senate
it is unclear at this point whether the senate will try to vote the mou bill out of the senate
or focus solely on sb0xx
de-linking bonds from dwr contracts
prior to leaving for vacation
dunn got a resolution passed that permits his investigative committee to take depositions of individuals
in the assembly
the assembly has thus far failed to get an
mou
0xx or 0xx
voted out of the full assembly
though expectations are that the hertzberg bill
0xx
will get voted out of the assembly today
man
you ain't kiddin
will do
sue mara
my colleague in the sf office
will join the call
tom
what's your number
best
jeff
having failed to resolve either the budget or the energy issues
the legislature is likely to postpone its recess and work through the weekend
at a minimum
in sum
though many claim that the legislature will
vote for something
it still doesn't appear that the
something
will include a measure that will keep edison out of bankruptcy
the senate and assembly remain extremely far apart in their approaches to amending the governor's original mou
which is dead
the ranks of politicians that view bankruptcy as the best alternative is growing
in the senate
sb0xx---bill to de-link the bonds from the dwr contracts in the only bipartisan move to date
sb0xx passed out of two committees yesterday
but has not yet been voted on by the full senate
the bill de-links payment of the bonds needed to backfill the state budget from payment of dwr contracts
the bill is being driven by increasing concerns over the volume and price of the dwr contracts
the dwr contracts are being held up as the reason california must suspend
or end
direct access
republicans on the assembly side are supportive of 0
but hertzberg--the speaker--has joined with the governor's people in the view that the bill would impair the contracts
consititute a breach
and expose the state to substantial damages
as a result
when the bill passes the senate and gets over to the assembly
its chances of passage there are low
the senate's version of the mou--sb0xx--limped out of its final committee yesterday before going to a vote by the full senate
but its chances of passing the full senate at this point are 0-0
the problem is that many democrats believe they will be attacked for voting for a bill that will likely drive edison into bankruptcy
while many other democrats fear it will look like they bailed out edison----the courage and leadership is awesome
in the assembly
the assembly two versions of the mou---ab 0xx and ab 0 xx
now ab 0xx
the assembly is severely divided over how to address the energy issue
the speaker is having a very difficult time getting democrats to support his own bill
0xx
many moderate democrats support a bipartisan bill developed by a democrat
rod wright
who has broken ranks with repbublicans
and assembly republicans
in the end
the speaker's bill is likely to prevail
things are complicated by the fact that the assembly is having a very difficult time getting a budget passed
as noted above
the assembly democractic leadership opposes sb 0xx and is trying to cobble together an alternative to 0
dude
thanks a million for getting the instruments
sorry to burden with the chore
see you in cah-lo-rah-dee

wilson says davis ignored warnings about energy former governor defends himself carla marinucci
chronicle political writer friday

0 san francisco chronicle url
former gov
pete wilson
who signed the controversial 0 energy deregulation bill into law
blasted his successor gray davis yesterday for failing to aggressively use the governor's most forceful tool
emergency powers
to contain the state's energy crisis
there are people who have ignored the supply and tried to blame the crisis on everyone else
the republican former governor told nearly 0 academics and reporters at the public policy institute in san francisco yesterday
arguing that davis ignored early warnings about brewing problems and
put in jeopardy parks
schools and other capital needs
wilson said the democratic governor has skillfully engaged in finger-pointing and public relations to blur perception of the current energy troubles
they've sought to blame me
and have done so with some success
and they've found a much more profitable and exciting target
president bush
said wilson
who wryly pronounced bush's recent trip to california as
a triumph
for davis
but davis
strategy
he said
doesn't create one watt of new power
wilson's speech
his toughest public remarks to date on the energy crisis
came the day the public policy institute
a nonpartisan think tank
released polls showing californians now believe energy ranks far and away as the state's most pressing problem
many of those voters blame wilson
not davis
for the power shortages and rolling blackouts
the poll shows
the former governor's sharp words were rejected by davis
senior political adviser
garry south
who said wilson is trying to
revise history
if there is one shred of evidence that pete wilson said one thing or raised one red flag about energy supply
let him produce it
south said yesterday
pete wilson accusing gov
davis of being responsible
for energy
is like herbert hoover blaming fdr for the depression
we're trying to clean up his mess
the gop former two-term governor spoke on the issue of california energy as members of the bush administration fanned out across the nation
including a california trip by energy secretary spencer abraham
to push the white house's energy policy
but even the president appeared to point the finger at wilson for some of california's problems
they hadn't built a power plant in 0 years
in california
bush told reporters wednesday
and guess what
when you grow your state the way they have
it creates problems
such words chafe wilson
who produced california energy commission figures that
he said
showed that small plants were built during his administration
in fact
he argued
the 0 deregulation bill encouraged energy producers to seek state approval for new plants
while acknowledging the 0 bill he signed was
flawed
wilson said
i thought the flaws would be addressed
we knew it was not a perfect free market mechanism
said wilson
adding that he had strong reservations about the utility rate caps included in the legislation
that
was a gamble
but it was one that paid off for while
but
he insisted
the bill
which critics say kicked off california's energy woes
had benefits for the state
wilson said it was believed deregulation would spur private industry to build new plants that would fuel industry and
lots of jobs for californians
deregulation was also seen as a means to balance power companies
concerns about a lengthy
nightmarish
process
which he said dated to the early 0s
to build large power plants
davis
is now posing in front of those plants
opening because of decisions made before he took office
wilson noted
i hope that he's pleased with our handiwork
wilson
also lambasted davis for failing to heed 0 warnings from the california energy commission about coming blackouts
and
wilson said
as the state faced rolling blackouts
job losses
and skyrocketing energy costs
davis failed to use one of his greatest tools in a crisis
emergency powers
wilson noted that after the 0 northridge earthquake
estimates suggested it would take 0 0/0 years to rebuild downed freeways and overpasses
he used his emergency powers to offer incentives to contractors that rebuilt the bridges within 0 days
south
noting that davis has used his emergency powers to deal with the energy crisis
said there is no comparison between an earthquake and a full
blown statewide energy crisis

senate approves edison rescue deal
assembly measure stalled by jennifer coleman associated press writer sacramento
ap
the state senate approved a bill that significantly alters the plan negotiated by gov
gray davis to help the struggling utility southern california edison
the bill approved friday
authored by democratic sens
richard polanco and byron sher
lets edison issue $0.0 billion in revenue bonds to pay debts amassed when prices for wholesale electricity reached record-high levels in the last year
i believe it's a measure that gets us to the goal of getting the state out of the business of buying electricity
and to bring this entity to creditworthiness
said polanco
d-los angeles
approved 0-0
the bill now goes to the assembly
the assembly adjourned friday night without voting on a similar measure
the polanco-sher plan shifts the burden of repaying the bonds to commercial and industrial power users and has been opposed by business interests and by edison
which says it won't help the company escape bankruptcy
davis
plan
announced in april
offers edison $0.0 billion for its transmission system and lets it sell revenue bonds to repay the rest of its estimated $0.0 billion worth of debt generated when it had to pay skyrocketing wholesale power prices
under the plan by polanco
and sher
of stanford
the state has a five-year option to buy edison's grid
that
said republican sen
ross johnson of irvine
gives edison a bailout it
neither needs nor deserves
i am tired of this projection of edison as a victim
they have their legion of lobbyists here telling us ad nauseam that they didn't support deregulation
johnson said during floor debate
the idea of edison as the victim goes down in the annals of real whoppers
edison paid their lobbyists bonuses for the successful passage of deregulation
during the 0-0 deliberations that led to deregulation
edison officials helped create the current system in meetings with business interests and then-gov

lawmakers are set to go on summer break friday night until aug
0
a schedule that conflicts with the deadline in the memorandum of understanding between davis and edison
that says the legislature must approve the deal by aug
0
it's a firm deadline
which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior to the end of the legislative recess
davis said friday
for that to happen
either the senate bill or a proposal by assembly speaker robert hertzberg
d-van nuys
and assemblyman fred keeley
d-boulder creek
has to reach davis
i have problems with both bills
davis said
i am heartened by the fact that there's a bill moving in each house
the keeley-hertzberg plan trims at least $0 million from the governor's offer
it also allows edison to issue the bonds
which would be repaid by edison ratepayers over 0 years
the plan also attempts to increase the state's use of

energy resources and allow edison customers to opt for cheaper direct-access energy service
the assembly didn't vote on the keeley bill friday
because hertzberg is considering forming a working group with the senate and the administration to
iron out the bills
differences
said hertzberg's spokesman paul hefner
davis said he wanted any working group to continue working over the summer break to devise a compromise by the aug
0 deadline
i don't want people to go out fishing for 0 days and come back and worry about it on aug
0 because i know we're going to have reapportionment and other major issues to deal with in that last month
the governor said
on the net
read the bills
ab0xx by keeley and sb0xx by polanco
at read the governor's memorandum of understanding at
summary of the activities since friday
overall
it's 0-0 or better that the legislature will finish up the budget and recess until august 0th
without having passed some form of an
edison mou
will have a better view of the chances of getting an mou agreed to and passed through both houses by cob monday
in the senate
the
edison mou
as previously reported
on friday
sb 0---the senate's version of the edison mou--passed out of the full senate and was sent to the full senate
the bill sticks 0% of suppliers
debts with edison's shareholders but pays qfs and other creditors
the authors believe that suppliers can't force edison into bankruptcy because the claims are with the px
not edison
which in their view means that the suppliers can't reach edison
our lawyers need to assess whether the tactic is strong from a legal perspective
the bill creates an option to buy the transmission system
but rejects the goernor's mou
which buys it outright
though there's some uncertainty
the bill appears to end direct access
information we have indicates that the assembly does not support and will not pass sb 0 in its current form
enron
and the marjority of market participants
opposes 0
the
dunn investigation
dunn released his report regarding contempt charges against enron on saturday
the report recommends that the senate fine us
beginning with $0,0 the first day
and doubling everyday thereafter until enron
complies
dunn announced on saturday that he would attempt to bring the report to the full senate for a vote on saturday
in response
our lobbyist in sacramento spoke to a leader of the republican party in the senate
ross johnson
and persuaded johson to negotiate the date of the vote with burton and dunn
she was successful---johnson went to burton and got him and dunn to agree not to vote on the report until the senate returned from its recess on august if the senate returns early
it could vote prior to the 0th
but the likelihood of that happening appears low at this time
the budget
the senate passed the budget at about 0 am sunday morning
the senate adjourned for recess after the vote and is not expected to return until august 0th
that leaves the assembly alone in sacramento to do its part regarding the budget and the edison mou
the assembly in short
leadership within the assembly is extremely weak and without much influence over its own party--the democrats
the speaker is viewed as having botched both the budget and the energy issue
unable to do a deal
the assembly recessed saturday night and has not reconvened
it has therefore not taken the votes needed to finish up with the budget
the assembly also has not passed its version of an edison mou
which it says it intends to do
best information we have right now is that the assembly does not plan to go back into session until tuesday morning
late saturday night
the assembly speaker released yet another version of his edison mou
ab 0xx
but it does not appear at this time that he has enough votes among assembly democrats to pass it
enron--together with business customers--opposes the version of 0xx released on saturday night because it does not adequately ensure direct access

not-so-golden state looks like a recession economy on the edge sunday
july 0
0
0 san francisco chronicle url
california
the world's fifth largest economy
the global capital of technology and entertainment
is teetering on the brink of a serious recession
unemployment is rising
job creation is falling and respected forecasters are painting a bleak future for the state
california is not alone
nationally
the employment picture is also troubling
income is flat
industrial production has been shrinking for nine months
only the mighty consumer has kept the economy going
the key problem is the slowdown in information technology spending
so important for california
once the engine of productivity growth
and the source of rising standards of living
the double-digit pace of those spending increases slowed dramatically
beginning in the second half of last year
since then
silicon valley companies have experienced sales declines of 0 to 0 percent
not calamitous drops
but compared to the 0 percent growth they had been used to
an enormous gap
hence these companies have been cutting back on everything from production to personnel to facilities
the
new economy
it turns out
is not immune to the basic laws of economics
nationally
the most respected
blue chip
private forecasters believe we will avoid a recession
they see the economy growing just over 0 percent this year and by 0 to 0 percent next year
having been more optimistic for some years
i became more pessimistic last year
and remain so despite the federal reserve's interest rate cuts and the bush administration's tax refunds
whether we skirt the technical definition of a recession
two consecutive quarters of negative growth
will be a close call
we should see a modest recovery late this year
and a pick-up of steam in 0
the california economy is in for a rougher time
at least in the short term
and this time
unlike the early 0s
when southern california bore the brunt of the severe downturn in the defense industry
the bay area will be hit much harder
while the region grew much faster than the rest of the state in the
0s
most of the symbols of that growth
full employment
exploding property values
shrinking commercial vacancy rates
are already history
workers who just a short time ago were getting bmws as a signing bonus are now being laid off
statewide unemployment
0.0 percent last month
is likely to increase another percentage point or more as layoffs continue in high tech and aerospace
still
and here's some good news
bay area unemployment
even in santa clara county
which took a major hit in june
is still below the statewide rate
in per capita income
the san francisco and san jose metropolitan areas are ranked first and second nationwide
0 percent above the national average
what of the longer term
california faces serious problems
not the least of which is the energy mess
which has exacerbated the current slowdown
our recovery will probably lag several quarters behind the rest of the country
but the long-term picture is brighter
information technologies have brought about permanent productivity improvements and transformed virtually every major industry in the so-called
old economy
such enhancements will themselves result in renewed information technology spending
if not at the frenetic pace of the late 0s
the main concern is whether california will degenerate into an even more anti-business climate
we are already viewed by the business community as an overtaxed
over-regulated state
gov
gray davis
rhetoric
and some of his actions
during the energy debacle have only added to the impression
while davis deserves credit for using the bully pulpit to encourage energy conservation
his demagogic attacks on
outside
energy companies
and the suggestion that california should go it alone
are not only poor policy solutions but suggest a degree of economic illiteracy on his part
his plan to have the state play an expanded role in energy production and transportation will require the expenditure of billions of dollars
do we believe the state government could make those investment decisions wisely
efficiently and devoid of politics
california would be better off if the governor got out of the energy business
the state will also continue to pay for the financial mishandling of the energy situation
the initial refusal by davis
appointees on the public utilities commission to allow utilities to enter long-term contracts worsened the shortages and sharpened the price spikes
then
at the peak of the market frenzy
the governor's office negotiated long term contracts that lock the state into paying unnecessarily high prices
and by keeping prices to consumers unrealistically controlled
he has passed the burden for energy costs on to the taxpayers
current and future
with all the problems and missteps
however
there is great reason to be optimistic about california's economic future
we are still a beacon of opportunity
we still attract the best and the brightest
we are still the best incubator of new ideas and businesses
however
our current woes should remind us not to take economic growth for granted
with better state policy
lower tax rates
less regulation
reforms to improve our schools
and a more efficient energy and transportation infrastructure
california will reemerge as the leader of a strong national economy
providing opportunity
mobility and still higher standards of living

quick update to jim's note
still appears that the assembly only has enough left in it tonite to deal with the budget and then recess
and it is still unclear if they'll get enough republicans to go along tonite
or be forced to come back tomorrow to try again
if the legislature does get the budget done and recesses without addressing the energy issues
then decision-making on some key issues---direct access in particular---will fall back in the puc's lap
the legislature is scheduled to be out until august 0th
the puc has scheduled a vote on whether to suspend da
the rate agreement with dwr
dwr's rev
req
and other issues on august 0rd
puc president loretta lynch has said that she wants to issue a proposed decision on these issues sometime between now and the first week of august
as jim points out
we continue to try to hammer out favorable outcomes for direct access and cost allocation in both forums----the legislature and the puc
best
jeff
the assembly passed the budget late last night
the assembly recessed without passing out any energy bill
there is some talk of a working group being convened beginning next week comprised of legislative staff and industry to continue to try to work out a deal
for now
however
the free world is safe from the ca assembly and the senate--they've left and all legislative activity is on hold until the 0th of august
unless leadership
or the governor tries to bring them back early
the activity now moves to the puc

jeff figures show state lost big on extra power posted at 0:0 p.m
pdt monday
july 0
0 by john woolfolk mercury news state figures show california may have lost about $0 million this month selling surplus electricity for less than it cost
the mercury news disclosed last week that some power was being sold at a loss
but the new figures provide the first indication of just how much excess power the state bought in its desperate effort to avoid blackouts
and how cheaply some of that power was sold when it turned out not to be needed
a republican lawmaker said monday the loss also shows democratic gov
gray davis
energy policies are needlessly costing consumers
``this whole thing is a mess
said assemblyman john campbell
r-irvine
who requested details of the state's surplus power sales
``the government needs to get out of the power business before it costs californians even more a state spokesman didn't dispute the $0 million figure outright but said it is an approximation based on average prices and that the actual loss probably is less
``it's a number i'm sure he likes very much
but it's definitely an estimated number
and it could be far lower
said oscar hidalgo
spokesman for the state department of water resources
campbell responded that the loss also could be higher
the state has spent $0 million on power so far this month
state officials last week confirmed that cool weather and consumer conservation have left california holding more power than it needs
the revelation was a stunning turnaround for a state that months ago was paying top dollar for power
expecting shortages this summer
price that was paid the state bought 0.0 million megawatt-hours of electricity for july at an average price of $0 per megawatt-hour
according to a response friday by the department of water resources to campbell's inquiry
the state has sold 0,0 surplus megawatt-hours in july at an average price of $0
the department said
based on those average prices
the state paid $0 million for the surplus power
which it sold for $0.0 million
$0.0 million less than it cost
a more precise calculation of the state's loss is difficult because purchased power is acquired at different times and prices and pooled as a purchases included long-term contracts that averaged $0 per megawatt-hour as well as cheaper spot-market buys
state officials last week said they were selling surplus at $0 to $0 a megawatt-hour
while some traders cited unconfirmed sales as low as $0
hidalgo noted that the surplus sales represent just 0 percent of california's july purchases
which totaled $0 million
the $0.0 million from sales will help lower the state's power bill
he said
adding that utilities routinely sell some extra electricity
``despite the fact that we're in somewhat of a surplus
any power-buying operation in the world is going to have to plan for these types of situations
hidalgo said
``it's not unique
and in fact it's normal operating procedure for any utility
other western utilities
including portland general electric in oregon
have said they
too
are selling some surplus power at a loss and describe it as a cost of doing business
the suppliers buying the state's surplus electricity on the cheap include the big out-of-state energy companies that the governor has called price-gouging ``snakes
among them are duke energy
dynegy power and marketing
el paso power services
mirant
reliant energy and williams energy
hidalgo said the state took the best offers it could find
``it's only reasonable to get the best bid you can
he said
campbell said the $0 million loss is troubling because ratepayers or taxpayers will have to cover the cost
whereas a private utility could be forced to eat the expense if regulators determined it was unreasonable
state officials say what's more important is that the overall cost of power is dropping
from an average daily tab of $0 million in may to $0 million this month
in part because the state has so much power

blame game over california's energy crisis will continue for years
published july 0
0
the wrestling match between politicians and enron corp
moved into a more intense arena over the weekend when a state senate investigating committee sought contempt penalties because the huge energy company has refused to turn over internal documents
although houston-based enron owns no major power plants in california
it has adopted the toughest stance of all energy companies against the multiple investigations of why wholesale energy prices spiked so high
and it has become
in turn
a whipping boy for california politicians
at one point last spring
state attorney general bill lockyer said he wanted criminal charges against enron and its chairman
kenneth lay
i would love to personally escort lay to an 0-by-0 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says
hi
my name is spike
honey
lockyer said
with less colorful language
gov
gray davis has often castigated texas-based companies as price gougers
even though texas firms have been fairly minor suppliers to california
some of it is just buzzword politics
lockyer and davis know that californians dislike anything associated with texas
and lay has been one of president bush's major political supporters
enron
meanwhile
cites the rhetoric as evidence that lockyer
davis and legislative investigators are interested less in finding the truth than in seeking scapegoats
enron also filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of the senate's subpoenas of trading data
most other energy companies have complied with the demands
creating sacramento repositories of the data under elaborate confidentiality agreements worked out with the special senate committee headed by sen
joseph dunn
d-santa ana
but enron has refused
and on saturday
dunn submitted a report asking the senate for
an appropriate coercive sanction
does enron have something to hide
or does it sincerely believe that what's happening in california is political scapegoating
are the companies
fears about the confidentiality of the data sought by the senate justified
would data be selectively leaked to show the firms in the worst light
would data be used by competitors
or could the information find its way into the hands of class-action attorneys
dunn
a prominent trial attorney himself
insists that confidentiality will be protected and that the information being sought is only for legislative purposes
but enron and the other companies have some reason to be wary of turning over confidential information to politicians
similar information was leaked
without penalty
in last year's investigation of former state insurance commissioner chuck quackenbush
and there are indications that private lawyers are working closely with investigators
mike aguirre
the san diego attorney seeking a
smoking gun
to prove collusion among energy companies
supplied dunn's committee with a few dissident duke energy workers who alleged
in highly publicized hearings
that the firm had manipulated production at its san diego plant to create artificial shortages and drive up spot market power prices
duke then refuted the charges by releasing some excerpts from the records of the independent system operator
the controller of california's power grid
indicating that iso had ordered the plant operational changes
aguirre subsequently asked the governor's office to pressure the iso
now under davis
direct control
to release all of the duke-related documents that would show
he says
that the firm actually manipulated the situation
duke and other companies insist that the iso-held documents are proprietary
aguirre pleaded with one davis adviser in an e-mail that
we need your help in properly getting this information out
but aguirre
in an interview
said he had not yet obtained cooperation from davis aides
the political and legal struggle to affix blame for california's energy woes will continue for months
perhaps years
the crisis will cost ratepayers at least $0 billion
and they'll want to know why as they make out their utility bill checks

your thoughts
best
jeff
bizarre as it sounds
we've now heard that they are calling the assembly members back
so it appears that the assembly leadership will at least make a run at this
we are getting more information and mobilizing industry
some key considerations
the governor is putting immense pressure on the legislature to get something done
the legislature is fearful of getting blamed by the governor for having
done nothing
becauase the assembly has thus far
done nothing
the only thing it has in front of it is 0
the assembly could not agree to the speaker's bill because it felt the bill was too far to the left
but 0 is even more one-sided
so there's a reasonable likelihood that 0 would have to be amended considerably in order to get the support necessary to get voted out
once voted out of the assembly
it would have to go back to the senate
where the senate would have to approve it
again
the senate has adjourned
so burton would have to round them up and call them back for a vote
and there's no indication at this time that burton's inclined to come back
in addition
burton has said that he's not interested in making any changes to 0
that
it's 0 or nothing
consequently
for the sentate
i.e
burton
to vote it out
it would first have to agree to the assembly's amendments
thus far
the assembly and the senate have not seen eye to eye on the issues
all that said
this legislature is far from rational
and nothing can be counted out
we're therefore operating under the assumption that 0 could move
will report back as information becomes available
best
jeff please respond to sgovenar
thanks very much

jeff please respond to
ken smith
karen regarding the one-pager we discussed today and for discussion in a later call
i wanted to offer a suggestion on an approach
i,d like to see something simple that uses headings to show what enron has done
what concerns remain
and the steps you expect to take in the future
i've put together some very rough sample bullet points
below
as a start tget everyone thinking and as an example of a format that could be effectivea short preface should also be added to set up the bullets
possibly something that says enron has been working diligently to meet elements of the committee's subpoena despite remaining disgreements
what enron has done
delivered x number of documents spent x man-hours compiling information requested by the committee retained a depository in sacramento for documents negotiated in good faith on a continuous basis with the committee enron,s concerns regarding delivery of additional documents
the committee has failed to implement an acceptable confidentiality agreemethat includes sanctions for anyone who breaches the agreement confidential documents held by the legislature
such as in the quackenbuscase
have historically found their way to the press or made public
oftein a selective manner the broad nature of the committee,s request and whether requested documeare relative to this inquiry whether a state legislative committee has jurisdiction over activities thatinvolve interstate commerce what enron will do
bullets on planned steps
interesting points
however
i don't ever recall you agreeing with every commission decision on disallowances
and i know you wouldn't establish differing standards for ious and state water agencies
i just hope that this isn't the tip of the iceberg
you really think that campbell is a dim bulb
a republican
yes
but i haven't heard anyone else describe him as a dim bulb

just phoned
been asked to attend a meeting in sacramento at 0 pm today to discuss his latest attempt to craft a compromise solution to the energy mess
am leaving for sacramento now
will report back from the meeting
best
jeff
yes
adding to kristin's update
here's the summary of a meeting that just occured with assembly leadership staff and industry on the assembly's latest version of an
edison mou
the speaker's staffer said that if he had to bet at this time
he would bet that the assembly would not convene on friday
he also said that
if it doesn't happen on friday
nothing will happen until they get back from recess on the 0th of august
the assembly will let folks know by tonight or first thing tomorrow whether they intend to move forward with a vote on friday or recess
from the most recent proposal released today by the assembly leadership
it appears that the centrist democrats are prevailing
the proposal
retains direct access
though they said that they are continuing to be pressured by the treasurer
who wants da suspended due to the bond issuance
places 0% of edison's past debt with large customers
leaving 0% with small customers
which business customers or strenuously opposing
eliminates all references to any purchase
or option to purchase
edison's transmission
they said there simply ain't the votes to buy
or consider buying
edison's transmission in the assembly
maintains the senate provision
which would pay the banks
pay the qfs
but place with edison the risk of figuring out how to pay the $0billion owed to suppliers
even the munis are begining to complain about those provisions
creates a tradeable
renewable portfolio standard
conceptually similar to the one created in texas
the new bill is created by 0
amending sb0 and 0
gutting a different bill passed from the senate to the assembly
sb0
and replacing it with the new version of 0xx
the two would go together to create the assembly's newest proposal
if this bill gets voted out of the assembly
it will likely have a difficult time getting the votes necessary to pass in the senate
since the senate has considered and rejected several provisions currently included in the assembly version
will report back on whether the assembly's going forward or adjourning for recess as soon as we hear

come back on the 0th
and try again
since the legislature has adjourned without resolving the edison/energy issue

direct access suspension

not good
john white has a similar view
i.e
loretta doesn't have many choices given that the legislature hasn't executed
john did say
however
that if we can provide the legal analysis to support doing something other than
suspend
loretta is likely to be amenable
seems like it would be useful to try to get the analysis
assuming that there's legal analysis to support an alternative to
suspend

the price caps have added uncertainty
said scott simms
spokesman for enron corp
ene
unit portland general electric co
if we look forward to this winter and you see a diminished supply scenario
you can see why we have concerns about regional reliability
that could put us in a position of having rotating outages in the region
about two weeks after the federal energy regulatory commission imposed limits on western power prices on june 0
portland general halted installation of a new 0-megawatt gas-fired peaking turbine at its existing boardman power plant
the utility was developing the extra generation both to meet its customers
needs and to sell some output to other northwest utilities left short of hydroelectric supplies due to this year's drought
a turbine that size could power about 0,0 homes
you can directly attribute that to ferc price controls
simms said
after the ferc order
at least two utilities in washington state ended negotiations with nrg energy
nrg
for supplies from new plants that nrg was ready to build in time for winter
both utilities
tacoma power and snohomish county public utility district
experienced significant supply shortages in the past 0 months
paid very high prices in the spot market and had to raise customer electric rates by as much as 0%
but both utilities told nrg
and later dow jones newswires
that they had no reason to sign long-term contracts to guarantee new supplies
because the ferc had practically eliminated the financial risk of relying on the spot market
nrg
as a result
scuttled plans to build peaking plants in washington that could have added 0 megawatts
ferc's price controls
as well as supply-demand fundamentals
have dramatically changed the economics of selling power into the west's open market in the past few months
the current western u.s
electricity price cap of $0 a megawatt-hour covers the costs of generating power from easy-to-install but inefficient peaking turbines
but not the capital costs of buying and installing new peakers
in addition
the current price cap may soon be recalculated to a much lower level
the cap is based largely on natural gas prices
which have been cut in half since the cap was first formulated in june
not everyone blames ferc the average monthly price for on-peak hours in the northwest from august through march is $0 a megawatt-hour
a fraction of what it was three months ago
many in the western electricity industry think that's because ferc's price controls have kept prices artificially low
a smaller group thinks the market is appropriately signaling that not all the planned gas-fired plants are needed
because some power plants are already under construction and consumers are conserving electricity
jim kemp
a senior executive for the canadian utility transalta's
ta.to
merchant power group
transalta
ta.to
for example
doesn't attribute the cancellation of projects to price controls
i see it as due to demand-side control and new units
kemp said
the market is sending out a signal that we have enough
maybe this winter we will find that we don't have enough
but that's not the signal the market is sending now
the spot market for power has been far below the federal price cap for two months
mild weather
a slowing economy and conservation efforts throughout the west have made power from expensive peaking plants unnecessary except for a few hours so far this summer
prices started to come down before the ferc mitigation plan started
said tacoma power supply analyst david lucio
who was negotiating with nrg
the need to try to execute a contract wasn't as great with the prices falling
lucio said there should be enough capacity to get the northwest through the winter
barring abnormalities like a long
extended freeze
construction of dozens of peaking plants in the west is going forward in cases where developers sold supply contracts in advance
transalta is continuing construction of a 0-megawatt peaking plant in washington
because much of the plant's capacity was sold months ago
the number of announced projects is far and away more than what is needed within the time frame we're talking about
said dick watson
a director with the northwest power planning council
still
several western utilities have asked the ferc to raise the price cap
puget sound energy
psd
told the ferc the cap
undercuts the commission's efforts to ensure adequate supplies of electricity
as previously reported
some small oil-fired generators
which are even more expensive to operate than the permanent
gas-fired peaking plants
have even been taken off line permanently after being installed over the past six months
and orders for new generators have been canceled

public power working for california
power delivery efficiency questioned
output at low-cost generating plants has been cut while costlier ones continue to operate
by carrie peyton bee staff writer
published july 0
0
california is sometimes deliberately cutting output from low-cost power plants while running more expensive ones
utility and grid officials say
the sporadic episodes haven't cost much yet
but they illustrate a potentially troubling disconnect in the system that has quickly grown between two agencies that help deliver electricity to a power-strapped state
we seem to be building this inefficiency into the system
and it doesn't seem to be getting better
said mike florio
a consumer advocate who sits on the governing board of the independent system operator
the trouble is that the iso
created in 0 to manage the power grid in a deregulated electric market
tries to run the grid by auctions that
in theory
provide the cheapest electricity for the state's consumers
meanwhile
the state department of water resources
which in january stepped in to buy power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities
isn't bidding at some auctions because it believes it can provide cheaper power if it doesn't
we have an inefficient market and an inept government entity
it's sort of the worst of both worlds
florio said
criticizing his agency and the dwr
iso staffers decline to discuss the situation in detail
saying it involves confidential bidding behavior
but pete garris
chief of operations for the power-buying arm of the department of water resources
confirmed that the iso has been asking his agency to take part in more auctions
but the state has declined
the state's role is to buy electricity for customers of utilities whose credit was no longer good enough to buy on their own
he said
we're not in it to do those kinds of marketing functions
he said
it's not necessarily a good fit
some of the iso auctions are used to lessen congestion on transmission lines
others are used to stabilize the grid by slightly increasing or decreasing output when demand doesn't match forecasts
generally
the highest-cost power plants should be the ones cutting back
a process the industry calls
decking
but since may
on iso orders
southern california edison has repeatedly throttled back on the mohave generating station
which produces some of the cheapest power available to california today
costing as little as $0 to $0 a megawatt-hour
edison
which owns a majority share of mohave
has cut its output by 0,0 megawatt-hours between may and july
about one-half of 0 percent
at the iso's behest
according to data edison provided to the bee
the iso could probably have saved the state's consumers $0,0 at one plant if it had asked a higher-cost gas-burning plant to cut back instead of mohave
a coal-burning workhorse in laughlin
nev
florio said
the amount sounds like
small potatoes
but in some ways it is more alarming than the $0 million the state lost recently by selling excess power for less than it paid
he said
industry experts agree that such below-cost sales are common in a business where power needs fluctuate dramatically based on the weather
by contrast
this is a dead weight loss
higher costs are being incurred for no good reason
florio said
the question is
why is the iso calling on mohave and not
cheaper
gas plants
the answer is
the gas plants aren't bidding
probably because they're contracted with dwr
he said
four corners
another low-cost coal plant partly owned by edison
has also been throttled back at iso request
edison officials said
in addition
so few bidders have shown up at iso auctions to ease stress on transmission lines that the system has fallen into disarray
with the iso instead ordering across-the-board power production cuts that are boosting costs
florio said
for its part
the iso will say only that
we are making the most economical decisions we can based on the bids available
said spokeswoman stephanie mccorkle
dwr's garris said the state and the iso have been meeting repeatedly on bidding and other coordination issues
and he hopes to have a smoother-running system in place by next summer

gouger gray davis california's petulant governor ignores reality as he overpays for electricity lance t
izumi mr
izumi is a senior fellow in california studies at the san francisco
based pacific research institute
on the surface
things seem to be going pretty good for gov
gray davis with regard to california's electricity crisis
the governor has scored some nice publicity by switching on some new power plants
the weather has been unseasonably cool
his poll numbers are edging back up
yet beneath this optimistic picture lie troubling problems
for example
davis's argument that out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis has been falling apart
for months
davis has been claiming that private generators have overcharged california by $0.0 billion and demanded that this amount be refunded to the state
however
after a two-week mediation between state officials and the generators
curtis wagner
the federal government's chief energy regulatory judge
rebuked davis's claim saying that such a huge overcharge
has not and cannot be substantiated
further
while the generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state
perhaps $0 billion
wagner said that generators are owed more money by the state than they owe the state in refunds
can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller
the chief judge thinks not
davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a
raw deal
and by urging the federal energy regulatory commission to ignore the lack of evidence and the judge's conclusions and to
step up and provide the refunds we've asked for
davis's position
as usual
is motivated purely by politics
indeed
dan walters of the sacramento bee says that davis is operating in a
melodramatic virtual world
de-linked from reality
davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly released documents showed that
on average
major out-of-state power companies such as enron
duke
dynergy and mirant charged less than the average prices paid by the state during the first three months of the year
california government utilities
on the other hand
such as the los angeles department of water and power and the sacramento municipal utility district
smud
charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state generators
for example
while texas-based enron
a favorite davis whipping boy
charged an average $0 per megawatt hour
smud charged an average $0 per megawatt hour
davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion
a davis spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at
the generators who wear cowboy hats
and that
just because there are other entities that are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from houston
tulsa
atlanta or charlotte
yet
for all davis
feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off
it turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business consumers are ripped off by state government
davis has signed $0 billion in ill-advised long-term purchase contracts at rates above-market-price
the state must
therefore
ensure that enough business customers remain in the current state-controlled distribution system to pay for high-priced state power purchases
this is especially important to davis since the high prices are borne disproportionately by business
thus
davis
regulators are set to eliminate
direct access
which allows businesses to shop for cheaper power
who's the real gouger
no matter how much davis points the finger
californians are paying dearly for his political opportunism and bad policies
thanks
looks like one thing good has happened for them today
i don't think maviglio will be able to stay

a few thoughts
conference calls on issues of this size don't generally seem very constructive
and i'd suggest that we push for a face-to-face with edison
if the legislature doesn't get the mou out well in advance of september 0th
edison won't be focused
and i'd suggest that we try and reschedule
no matter the forum
the proposal will be tough to get through
even though it makes alot of economic sense
it's a big change
and big changes don't come easy
no matter the benefits
that said
no shots
no ducks
we ought to make a push
the proposal may not be contingent on legislation
it might be possible to make it happen at the california puc
assignment to dwr would be significant and might require legislation
need to ask a qf lawyer
the proposal makes sense for both the ious and dwr
since both want as much
headroom
as possible in rates to cover their respective revenue requirements
given the pending rate agreement between the ca puc and dwr
and the utilities
messed-up financial position
dwr is clearly the preferable counter party from credit perspective
all that said
none of the above matters much unless the utility
a critical mass of qfs and the puc's consumer advocate
ora
buy into the idea
i'd propose that we continue with edison
if edison bites
then go jointly with edison to persuade the qfs
if the qfs bite
then go jointly with edison and qf to try to persuade ora
on the issue of sleeving through the iou or dwr
it seems useful to remain flexible on that
though absent general support from the ious
qfs and ora
the entity will be academic
some preliminary thoughts
happy to discuss further
best
jeff
apologies
forgot to mention that the
consumer
groups generally don't have a problem allowing edison to pay off its debt to the qfs
no problem
thanks for re-forwarding

edison bailout plan is oddest piece of legislation in recent m
published aug
0
0
senate bill 0xx may be the most unusual legislation to hit the capitol in decades
in terms of both its content and its convoluted political dynamicsthe measure is the latest incarnation of months-long efforts by gov
gray davis and some legislators to rescue southern california edison from joining its larger cousin
pacific gas and electric
in bankruptcy court
that is odd unto itself
since state legislation to openly provide billions of dollars in benefits to one private corporation may be unprecedented
literally dozens of versions of legislation to bail out edison have floated around the capitol
ever since davis announced last spring that he had reached agreement with john bryson
chairman of edison international
the utility's parent corporation
the edison deal was announced just a few days after pg&e rejected davis
overtures and took itself into bankruptcy court
both utilities ran up many billions of dollars in debts buying power in the last six months of 0 because the state rejected their pleas to raise retail rates
edison's
or perhaps bryson's
fear of bankruptcy is another puzzling aspect of the issue
given the almost cheerful manner in which pg&e placed itself in receivership
edison has spent millions of dollars on lobbying
advertising and other forms of political persuasion
trying to nudge the legislature into passing a rescue plan that lawmakers are clearly reluctant to do
is avoiding bankruptcy a matter of personal pride for bryson
or
as some suggest
does it stem from edison's tardiness in erecting an impregnable financial fire wall between the utility's assets and those of the parent holding company
edison international
edison scrambled to build a fire wall after bankruptcy loomed
but financial analysts are uncertain that it's as strthe dynamics within the capitol and among various interest groups are equally odd
following none of the patterns that usually explain why politicians do what they do
legislators of both parties are all over the map on the edison issue
and factions that are ordinarily allied find themselves at odds
one example
liberal consumer groups are strenuously opposing any bailout for the utility
while liberal environmentalists like the current scheme because it would bring thousands of acres of edison-owned sierra watershed under state control
perhaps the most mysterious aspect of the edison situation is why davis
ordinarily the most cautious
commitment-averse of politicians
is making such a crusade of keeping the utility out of bankruptcy court
why would davis put so much of his gubernatorial prestige behind such an iffy proposition that exposes him to leverage from lawmakers seeking other favors from the governor and
polls indicate
is not popular with voters
harvey rosenfield
the consumer gadfly who has established a
war room
near the capitol to fight the edison scheme
believes that davis
unusual efforts stem from a desire to run for president in 0 and a fear that wall street would blackball him if edison follows pg&e into bankruptcy court
another possible explanation is davis
decades-long relationship with bryson
the two served together in former gov
jerry brown's administration
bryson was brown's public utilities commission president
and both have strong ties to the democratic political organization in west los angeles headed by reps
henry waxman and howard berman
who
in effect
allowed davis to launch his career by winning a west side state assembly seat in 0
the most influential member of edison's board of directors is warren christopher
a democratic elder statesman and former secretary of state
bryson and christopher flew to sacramento late last year to plead with davis to take command of the energy crisis
allow utilities to raise rates and staunch the red ink
davis refused
and nearly a year later finds himself trying to keep edison out of bankruptcy court
we may never know why davis is going to bat for edison
but we will know
very soon
whether he can pull it off or will wind up with egg on his face.the bee's dan walters can be reached at

late last evening the assembly committee passed its version of the edison mou
sb 0
despite attempts by consumer groups to weaken and/or eliminate the da provisions in the bill
the bill passed with the da provisions intact
the da provisions in the bill that passed out of the committee are essentially the same as those discussed previously
see previous note attached
the assembly will now attempt to get the bill out of the appropriations committee today or tomorrow--the expectation is that the bill will make it out of that committee
when and if the bill makes it out of the appropriations committee
the assembly will attempt to pass it out of the full assembly
if it makes it out of the full assembly
it will then go to the senate for approval
where the leader of the senate
john burton
continues to say publicly that the chances of passage in the senate are slim
on the puc front
efforts are underway to stop the puc from passing the proposal it issued last week
the current puc proposal would suspend da retroactive to july 0
in conversations with the governor's point people in charge of getting the bill passed
they indicated that they are aware of the problems with the puc proposal and are working to resolve it
we'll continue to provide updates

energy deals discount power contracts deemed unfair to consumers bernadette tansey
chronicle staff writer sunday

thousands of california businesses may reap cost breaks on electricity while other utility customers live with record rate hikes if the state lets stand a spurt of last-minute contracts with private power suppliers
more than 0,0 firms
including big retail chains and industrial plants
signed discounted power contracts in july and august as market prices dropped
state officials are incensed
saying the private
direct access
contracts with electricity providers could shift the burden for millions of dollars in state power purchases onto households and small businesses
state treasurer phil angelides said the same companies that benefited as the state depleted its budget surplus to keep the lights on now want to escape paying their share of the billions spent to ensure power supplies for california
i think it's wrong and it's immoral
angelides said
state officials argue that the summer contracts can still be canceled retroactively because california businesses were on notice that their option to shop around for better deals on electricity was about to be suspended by the state public utilities commission
the puc is set to consider the retroactive ban thursday
but energy firms say the summer deals were perfectly legal because the puc had not yet taken action and made a series of draft decisions that put off the effective date of the direct access ban until as late as yesterday
the drafts were not consistent
said tracy fairchild
a spokeswoman for alliance for retail energy markets
a consortium of generators and energy suppliers
which one were we supposed to take seriously
the energy trade group is threatening to sue to protect the summer contracts
angelides fears that a prolonged court fight could block a $0.0 billion state bond sale to reimburse the treasury for california's emergency power purchases
the burgeoning conflict is part of a continuing fight by energy firms and some of their business customers to preserve direct access
a core provision of the state's 0 deregulation law
deregulation supporters predicted energy consumers would enjoy lower prices if private generators were allowed to compete with the utilities as power suppliers
but the direct access program was thrown into disarray last year when wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed and the state stepped in to buy power
to make sure the state's outlay would be paid back by all ratepayers
the legislature in january directed the puc to suspend direct access
by that time
most direct access customers were fleeing back to the utilities to benefit from a rate cap that protected them from the soaring market power prices
the puc postponed action on the direct access ban while some legislators were sponsoring bills that would have allowed the program to continue under certain conditions
but by july
market prices had come down
and energy providers like enron energy services
aes new energy and strategic energy were again offering direct access contracts
businesses were looking for relief from the record rate hikes imposed on utility customers in june
said phoenix energy consultant gina coleman
coleman said she helped five retail chains with
a significant number
of stores in california negotiate contracts with strategic energy this summer
business is business
and if you can get a better price for something
you should
said coleman
who declined to name her clients
she said the lower costs will help the stores keep doing business in california and hold their prices down
daniel douglass
an attorney for the alliance for retail energy markets
said any attempt by the state to cancel contracts retroactively would violate the constitutional law
he said energy firms have purchased power to serve their customers under the contracts and would suffer losses if they were canceled
angelides said the same firms that ran to the state for protection when their market contracts became too expensive now want to take advantage of lower power prices he attributes to the stabilizing effect of the state's long
term power contracts
you can't take advantage of the state's stabilizing the rates
then say
thank you very much
and stick everyone else with the bill
angelides said
state officials have not tallied the total number of customers who signed up in july and august
nor have they estimated the revenue loss that would have to be covered by remaining utility ratepayers
figures compiled by the puc show that commercial and industrial firms signed more than 0,0 new direct access contracts in july alone
a rough calculation suggests that
as a result
the firms might contribute as much as $0 million less annually to the repayment of state costs
the loss might not be significant enough to risk a court fight that would delay the bond sale
state officials said
bu angelides said the same power firms that helped create the energy crisis by charging exorbitant rates are now threatening a bond issue desperately needed to restore funds needed for education
health care and children's services
what they're talking about doing
he said
is holding us hostage until they get what they want

fyi
i'm starting to get concerned about this
a
i didn't pick the time
b
i talked to sue on friday and she will be out of church at 0 am pdt and on the call shortly thereafter
sue seemed more concerned about having a call at all then on the time
if she expressed a view that the time was set up so that she couldn't be on the call
i'd like to discuss
since that didn't factor in at all
as you know
having gone through sandi
i'm extremely sensitive to inter-group relations
if you feel there are issues that we should discuss
i'd really like to do it
i react very strongly to any view that i am intentionally doing anything to get in sue's---or others---way
from my perspective
i feel strongly that i haven't behaved that way
and don't in any way intend to
i simply have no desire to
compete
with colleagues
sue in particular
there aren't enough people to do all the work
and there's plenty of tasks
recognition
blame
etc
to go around
these are extremely challenging times and we won't get anywhere unless it's truly a team effort
i know that the sf office has a history of challenges with respect to california leadership
i have no interest in returning to the very un-teamlike atmosphere that existed previously
particularly since the atmosphere has changed so positively in the past few months
for a variety of reasons
i have been asked to take on alot of tasks over the past year
i've tried very hard to perform well
while at the same time working hard with paul and sue to advance a significantly more healthy
inclusive
open and collegial working environment in california and the west
i care alot of course about your perceptions
and if you have the preception that relations in the office is becoming an issue
i'd like to confront it head on
and if sue is expressing any concerns about how things are going generally---which she expresses to me from time to time---i'd like to sit down with you and sue to discuss
if you think that would be useful
forgive the lengthy note
but having just gotten through the experience with sandi
i'm not anxious to repeat
in any shape or form
talk to you at noon your time
best

seriously
i'd be happy to
the senate rules committee just met
during the hearing
senate leader john burton stated that
the senate intends to rewrite the version of the mou that the assembly approved last thursday night and sent over to the senate for final approval
sb0
the version of the mou that will emerge from the senate sometime this week will look much more like the bill that originally passed out of the senate prior to the july summer recess
that bill was unacceptable to edison and davis
which led to the version that the assembly developed and approved last thursday night
if the senate proceeds as burton suggests
the chances are very low that an mou will make it through the legislature and get davis
signature
burton generally sticks to his word
but there is still time for additional negotiations and sb0 could squeak by
however
burton's comments in the rules committee certainly don't help 0's chances for survival
finally
the assembly is currently debating the last surviving windfall profits bill
and the bill is having a hard time getting the votes necessary for passage
more information on the windfall profits bill as we get it

here is a brief summary of the latest da proposal floating around the senate
the provisions could--and likely will--change
the leader of the senate
burton
is still expressing opposition to da
so its fate remains unclear
no suspension of da
all customers must pay edison undercollection
whether they've been da or not
customers going da must first clear any payables to dwr for power previously consumed but not full paid for
customers going da must pay for dwr's stranded power costs caused by the customer leaving
unless dwr has a net short position
in which case there would be no stranded costs and therefore no fees
the bill allows customers to file a complaint with the puc regarding dwr's claims of stranded costs
customers who choose green da power
defined as 0% renewable
will be exempt from stranded cost fees so long as green da load does not exceed dwr's net short position
this is the last straw
peace just called to thank us for resolving the contempt issue
he then went on ad nauseum--and i mean nauseum--about just about everything in the world

which is true
there were about 0 votes for the mou in the senate

a corporate bailout
and a bad deal for consumers

jeff governor davis comments on failure of senate to approve edison legislation will call 0rd special session to keep edison from bankruptcy governor gray davis made the following comments after legislation designed to restore southern california edison to creditworthiness failed to win approval in the california state senate
i am proud of the work done by the assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring edison to creditworthiness
unfortunately
however
the senate has not gotten the job done
it is critical to keep edison solvent so that we do not lose 0,0 megawatts of power from renewable energy and small power producers
we worked hard to bring this energy
which was crucial in avoiding blackouts
back on-line earlier this summer
i will call a third extraordinary session
which will begin in approximately two weeks
so that edison can avoid bankruptcy
edison has assured me that it will not seek bankruptcy and that it believes that its creditors will continue to show restraint
california senate adjourns without voting on plan to save struggling utility jennifer kerr

the state senate adjourned early saturday without voting on a plan to rescue southern california edison from bankruptcy
and gov
gray davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility
as the california legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 0 session
a $0 million program to help the state's neediest schools won approval
so did bills to give driver's licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds
but senators remained cool to davis
idea of bailing out southern california edison
they failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the assembly
which also adjourned early saturday
we didn't take it up because we didn't want to embarrass the governor
said president pro tem john burton
it would have been a rip-off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation
the deal's quiet death closed more than five months of work since davis first announced the plan in april
saying the state would pay $0.0 billion for edison's transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bonds to repay the rest of its $0.0 billion debt
without the deal
edison faces bankruptcy along with pacific gas and electric co
the state's largest utility
the company filed for chapter 0 bankruptcy protection in april
after amassing about $0.0 billion in debt due to last year's sky-high electricity costs
edison says it has accrued $0.0 billion in debts
the special session is meant to take another shot at saving edison from sliding into bankruptcy
i am proud of the work done by the assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring edison to creditworthiness
davis in a statement after midnight saturday
unfortunately
however
the senate has not gotten the job done
the new school-improvement program would provide grants of $0 per student to schools with the state's lowest test scores
they will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school
the shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law
those include a 0-minute rest break for every four hours of work
tools paid for by the employer and toilets
lights and water in housing
it also would put into state law a $0,0-a-month minimum wage for sheepherders
while legislators toiled
tuesday's terrorist attacks were never far from their minds
davis joined the assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks
the legislature approved sending $0 million from the california victim compensation fund to a similar program in new york to help victims of the terrorist attacks
the letters will be printed in a special assembly journal
here in california
our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance
said davis
0 associated press
unless there's an issue
i'll call fielder first thing this morning
i'm not seeing any upside to us rattling any sabers regarding bankruptcy
however
we'd likely take a very significant reputational and political hit by taking them in---or suggesting that we would take them in
for that matter
reliant and mirant have been rattling theirs for a very long time---with no concrete action to back them up
they would of course love to have enron
lead the charge
i would recommend that we not play that card right now and let reliant and mirant go forward if they choose

here's the proposal
there is no reason for the puc to suspend da since 0

all davis has to do is sign the bill

at least for the next several months
and 0
the senate passed a resolution on friday night stating that there is no reason to continue the
state of emergency
put in place by davis on jan
0 and that the state of emergency should therefore end
the puc should therefore keep da intact and begin putting the ratemaking in place to enable da
while achieving other important objectives
e.g
no cost-shifting
make sure bonds get serviced
etc
if
however
the puc rejects this rational
sensible proposal and decides to suspend da
then that date must not be any earlier than sept
0th

closing out both the regular session and the second extraordinary session
the assembly adjourned a few hours later
closing the regular session
but not the second extraordinary session
the legislature's options
0
the governor calls them back in two weeks
they continue with the second extraordinary session
and pick up where they left off with the bills they were working on up till saturday morning
0
the governor calls them back in two weeks
the assembly ends the second extraordinary session
they begin a third extraordinary session
and the bills that were left hanging on saturday morning must start the process from scratch
however
they can pass a
waiver
which effectively would allow them to start a 0rd session and then pick up where they left off on saturday morning
0
the governor calls them back in two weeks and the legislature meets briefly and shuts down without doing anything
i.e
the govenor can call them back
but he can't make them vote
in short
the legislature has a significant amount of discretion to do what they please
where to from here
through its actions on saturday morning
the senate has sent a strong signal to davis that the senate is not inclined to vote out an edison bailout that differs from the version it passed prior to leaving for summer recess last july
just before closing down on saturday
the senate also passed a resolution declaring that
the condition of electric service in california no longer consitutes a
sudden and severe energy shortage
and
that the state of emergency proclaimed by the governor on january 0
0
is at and end
the resolution seems to send an additional signal that the senate does not see any great need to bail out edison
the assembly did not pass the resolution
however
given the senate's view
and the open hositility between davis and burton
davis
only remaining option seems to be to threaten the senate with vetoes unless the senate first passes the davis
edison bill
it is unclear at this time whether davis would play it that tough
with the legislature gone
the action turns to the puc
where a vote on da suspension is scheduled for thursday
we are working with customers and providers to stop da from being suspended
or at a minimum
to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive
finally
burton held a news conference this morning at which he said
burton and senator bowen
bowen's been taking the lead on da in the senate
will ask the california puc to do a study on how da can be retained without
adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses
he doesn't know why
the governor would waste taxpayers
money to hold a special session
with all the troubled businesses in california right now
he doesn't know why the state would bail edison out and not the others
if all this sounds ridiculous
it is
we'll report back with additional information as we get it
best
jeff
called fielder to confirm and he said that he needed to cancel
as you know
the legislature closed without doing anything with edison's bailout legislation
the governor has said that the will order them back into session in two weeks
that has fielder and everyone else at edison scrambling to continue their attempts to stay out of bankruptcy
which means that fielder won't be focused
and can't focus on
anything else for the next couple of weeks
let's regroup
dave
perhaps we should just go ahead and start with pg&e
thoughts
best
jeff
sounds good
how about first thing tomorrow morning for a call

going down to fielder's for a bar-b-que tonite
watch a little tv and get this thing settled
seriously
he and i have traded messages today
when we hook up
i'm going to ask him when we can meet and get this settled
i'll let you know what he says as soon as i hear back
best
jeff
left a message for mark
he's out today and will call me back tomorrow
best
jeff
talked to fielder
he's willing to meet
jeff
no problem
if you need anything else
just let me know
thanks
look forward to talking soon
don't work too hard
best
jeff
thanks
see you tomorrow night in the tah moh
fielder agreed to sit down and talk as soon as we'd like
he said that his
legal and tariff guys
told him that
they're on solid ground
but john admitted that doesn't mean that edison
is right
i told him that his lawyers and tariff people may think they're on solid ground with the puc
but that in no way means that an appellate or
god forbid
bankruptcy judge will concur with either edison or the puc
i stressed that we weren't interested in meeting to re-hash our respective positions and that we wanted a meeting where we and they come to the table with constructive
good faith options to resolve the issue
he said that he'd be willing to do that
though most deeply discount anything edison says these days
he suggested that we start without lawyers
i said that we could do that
but that i'd have to check
i told him that we'd try to get back to him sometime today regarding what we'd like to do
possible to discuss briefly
best
jeff
thanks
jeff
ross
when you get a chance
give me a call at 0.0.0
best
jeff
send what
nothing was attached
jeff
ross is out for the week
is there someone who ross works for that i could contact
thanks much
best
jeff
that ain't gonna do it
in my view
we're going to need to be creative
figure what number we'll take and how we'll take it and get out
note that edison is going to be very wary of showing any
preferential treatment
lest another creditor get wind of it and yank them in on an involuntary
i'm going to call tribolet and get his thoughts
i'll let you know what he says
best
jeff
greetings
we ever hear back from richard regarding whether we agreed to any time frame for delivering documents
best
jeff ps remind me to thank forbes for that great article
not
we better get tickets now
dude
please let me know all the various costs that you've incurred on our behalf and not been compensated for
i know we owe you $0
dollars for the guitar
is there anything else
let's play soon
best
jeff
thanks
is it safe to say
from you notes
that dealbench is
winding down
best
jeff
yes
but i'm not sure what it is
any time
just call
sigh
i just talked to kip lipper--works for byron sher
but burton relies on him alot
he's drafting the letter that burton will send to loretta re
what to do about da
i've given kip the quotes from angelides re
state's fiscal position will remain strong through july 0 irrespective of whether the bonds are issued
kip was not aware of the quotes and was anxious to get them
i reminded kip that the only reason anyone's given to suspend da is the urgent need to issue the bonds
but now
even the treasurer has admitted that there is no urgency to issue the bonds
i told kip that the letter to loretta should say 0
there is no longer any need to suspend da whatsoever
0
the puc should commence ratemaking proceedings immediately to ensure that there is no cost-shifting to small rez and biz customers as a result of da and 0
the puc should deliver to the legislature a study recommending any enhancements
modifications
etc
that should be made to the program to ensure that da is maintained while ensuring that granny is not harmed
he said he would see what he could do and said that he would likely get back to us
there is a concerted effort underway to get the puc to reject outright at tomorrow's meeting the rate agreement between dwr and the puc
and dwr's proposed rev
req
the reason
no urgency anymore
let's take a little time and get it right
best
jeff
if it's possible to talk around 0 pm california time for about 0-0 minutes
that would be great
would need to get jim and rick on the call
too
don't break your back
but would be very good if we could arrange it
just let me know
thanks a million
best
jeff

give my best to tina
best
jeff
yes
send through
fyi
attemps are still underway to persuade the california puc not to suspend da at today's meeting
however
the best information we have at this time is that the puc will suspend da today
but will not suspend da retroactively
as best we can tell
if the puc suspends
it will suspend da effective today
september 0th
in addition
there is a considerable effort underway--from both ends of the spectrum--to persuade the puc to reject 0
the proposed rate agreement between the puc and dwr and 0
the proposed
revenue requirement
that dwr submitted to the puc
we'll report back with the results of the puc business meeting as soon as we hear them
best
jeff
greetings colleen
i'm not sure who's still working on this and who's not
but sometime back
we did a very extensive effort with tim hamilton and the rest of the ees team to get all information compiled regarding ofos behind pg&e and socalgas
i'm hoping that that information still exists so we can hopefully avoid recreating the wheel
if
for some reason
the information is lost
the good news is that all ofo tariffs are compiled and easily retrievable on the socalgas
and pg&e's websites
please let me know how else we can help
best
jeff
greetings
did you folks ever send a letter to the puc
if so
is it possible to get a copy
best
jeff
given that 0
the puc has quite a few important issues on its agenda and 0
the puc meeting will likely coincide with our regularly scheduled meeting time
we'll reschedule our 0:0 am pdt call to 0 pm pdt for today only
with the legislature adjourned
thankfully
we'll re-assess the need for a twice-weekly call and get back to folks
the potential for a 0rd extraordinary session may affect what we do
if you have any questions
don't hesitate to call
best
jeff
you should contact tim directly
there is a tariff section on each website and a search function using key words
the utilities issue reports on ofo incidents
and tim should have those as well
let me know if there's anything we can do
best
jeff
fyi
you know if tim's still at enron
i haven't heard from him for quite some time
best
jeff
can you reschedule this to 0 pm our time
mucho appreciado
best
jeff
oh joy
will do
code 0
talked to mark
first thing he has to do is convince davis
lawyers that his companies
client list
which includes tw
shouldn't conflict him out of working on dwr gas deals
he should have that figured out by this week--sounds like he may have to make some decisions about his current client list and working for dwr
i told him that we'd like to sit down as soon as possible to discuss opportunities for us to help out dwr with its gas needs
he said that he'd be happy to do that
once he's got all conflict issues worked out with the governor's office
he's going to get back to me to set up a meeting
and if i don't hear from him by monday/tuesday of next week
i'll call him back to set up a meeting
i'm assuming that you'd be part of that meeting
i asked him what sort of deals they're working on
as you likely know
some of the contracts permit dwr to either 0
provide gas to the plant providing dwr power under the power contract or 0
manage the plant's fuel supply
so they're looking to get
soup-to-nuts
supply service for those contracts that include a fuel-supply option
best
jeff
u wanna go
thanks
we do not have internet access here
would you please see if they post a more detailed version of the proposal
and
if so
distribute
thanks
this is going to blow the roof off in california
best
jeff
fyi
this is likely to create a considerable stir in california
let the games begin
best
jeff
fyi
sounds good
best
jeff
thanks alot
best
jeff
getting alot of inquiries
the puc has not yet voted on suspension of da or related matters
likely to get to those items on the agenda within the next 0-0 minutes
looks as if the decision will 0
suspend da beginning sept
0th and 0
include contract renewal in the suspension
in addition
it appears that the proposal would give the commission some latitude to enact retroactivity back to july 0 if deemed necessary
this is unclear and we're trying to get more details on this provision
three key senators have sent a a letter to the puc asking the puc to provide recommendations to the legislature on the conditions under which da should be re-instated
since the letter is dated september 0th--though sent only yesterday--it appears that the senate had an idea that the puc was going to suspend
keep in mind that the decision has not been voted on yet and the provisions listed above may change
we'll report back as soon as something happens
for folks who want to listen in
the number is
best
jeff
i got the
joke
is there an attachment
you interested in these messages
wood say issue of contract renewal put off for further examination
jeff
plz call
didn't get whether renewal is covered or not
jeff 0.0.0
voted out date of 0.0.0
trying to determine ability to go back to july 0 and whether renewal is clearly covered
jeff
will let you know as soon as we get it figured out
best
jeff
the commission suspended direct access effective september 0th
the decision orders the utilities to stop accepting dasrs for contracts executed after 0.0.0
but astonishingly
the language in the proposed decision states that the commission will take more time to consider whether the effective date should be pushed back to july 0
in short
that battle continues
how the commission will proceed in continuing to consider retroactivity is uncertain at this time
the commission held over until its next meeting the decision regarding the rate agreement between dwr and the puc
best
jeff
thanks very much
please thank mark
best
jeff
the commission also delayed a decision on whether contract renewal will be included under the suspension
jeff
dan
you might want to amend
the decision puts everyone on notice that the commission is going to consider taking it back to july 0---no info on what the decision process would be
best
jeff
please email joseph alamo with your fax number if you would like a copy
best
jeff
will get back to you
i figured that's what happened
faxing as we speak
best
jeff
will do
you mean to hold it
apologies for missing the call yesterday
as i'm sure you're aware
yesterday the puc voted to suspend electric direct acces in california
as a result
it was an extremely hectic day
i do intend to make the weekly calls
best
jeff
hey
when do regional directors begin reporting to steffes
any sense of the reasoning behing the org change
thanks for coming over last night
very fun
great to see you
really glad you guys joined in
best
jeff
that's exactly right
but i would say that loretta
not brown
was the winner
and will continue to be the winner
best
jeff ps can you give a call when you get a minute at 0.0.0
thanks
mike
does that legislation that passed a couple of years ago
that gives the governor the power to appoint the puc president also give the senate advise and consent rights on the appointment of the president
i don't recall that it gave the senate advise and consent rights
but sure would be interesting if it does
thanks
best
jeff
an svp from edison just informed us that edison will be sending out by email information on dasr acceptance/rejection
he said that all dasrs submitted prior to midnight on 0.0.0 will be accepted
irrespective of whether edison subsequently rejected them for inadequate information
adminstrative or other reasons
he said that they will also be asking esps to provided a list of all contracts executed prior to midnight 0.0.0 and for which dasrs have not yet been submitted
when the dasrs for those contracts are submitted
he said that edison will accept them
so long as they track the list previously submitted
i asked if edison would be lobbying to have the commission issue a subsequent decision clawing the suspension date back to july 0
he said he didn't believe they intended to do that
but he said that they did intend to lobby the commission to make sure that newly-minted da customers don't escape any costs they're responsible for
please forward this along to anyone else who might need the information
best
jeff
eldon called me this morning informing me that it's their anniversary this weekend
as such
i sort of tossed any other plans out the window and told him that we'd definitely be around
as such
i was wondering if you guys planned to do the same
and if so
following up on your note scott
it would be totally fucking cool to play golf sunday morning
particularly since i have not desire to sit around a and watch football
you guys up for golf
you plan on doing the anniversary thing
best
jeff ps where's my email ms perfect
the puc's decision 0
suspending da and 0
signaling the puc's intent to continue to consider nullifying da contracts signed after july 0 is full of holes
we haven't detected any downside in joining with coalitions
and trying to get other coalitions
to appeal the puc order
sue mara is working with the arm coalition to appeal yesterday's order and is taking the lead generally on the effort to reverse things
the appeals that we would join
and attempt others to persue on their own
would focus principally on two issues
0
disabusing the puc of the notion that it has the legal authority to nullify contracts retroactively
and 0
lifting the suspension on da altogether
let me know if i've missed anything here
sue
please let us know if folks have any concerns that would cause us to reconsider pursuing these challenges

steve
here's our assessment of wright's performance in california
on the plus side
he is generally pro-business
and has opposed bills that threaten economic growth
e.g
he opposed the windfall profits
and related
bills
he sided with the california assembly republicans to craft an alternative to the
mou
for edison that included direct access as a core feature of any mou
his decision to work with the republicans helped move the political
center of gravity
albeit marginally--more favorably toward direct access in california
on the negative side
in each and every case that rod has had to make a choice between the market
customers and competition on the one hand
and the utility on the other
he has never waivered in his decision--he always put the utility first
here are three examples
and there are more
0
during this extraordinary session
he sponsored a bill that would have explicitly created a
stranded cost charge
for utilities
yet by most accounts
californians have already paid off the utilties
stranded costs
how many times must californians pay
we worked with consumer and business groups to oppose the bill
0
in the
alternative mou
that rod worked on with republicans
the replicans told us that rod insisted on suspending direct access until january 0
0--a demand that most believe originated with edison
0
rod sponsored a bill two years ago that would prevent any market participant other than the utilities to provide metering and billing services
today
this issue is less important to us
but it was very important to us at the time
and rod remained unswervingly in the utilities
camp
despite our efforts
hope this helps
if you need any other information
just let me know

jeff
i have one tomorrow

here are the foundations that arm will use in its appeal of the puc decision suspending da
and threats to make it retroactive to july 0
you should feel free to share with the business folks but under the condition that they keep it confidential
and of course
we'd be thrilled if they'd sign on
if you have any questions
just holler
best
jeff the primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are as follows
the decision violates procedural due process guarantees
the failure to hold hearings violates public utilities code section 0.0
f
the commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process
the decision violates the commerce clause of the united states constitution
the threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the commission's authority
the commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority
the decision's purported findings are not supported
the commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding
you have a sense that the alan departure was coming
too bad
nice
very capable guy

jeff
for this week
we'd like to cancel both the tuesday and thursday calls and instead reschedule to wednesday at 0 am pdt

sac bee did a very big story recounting its version of how ca's electric market got upside down
cites enron scheduling a large block of power over a
small
tx line as an indicator
also cites the dinner davis had with generators leading up to the crisis
where
the paper says
the generators warned him
but davis took the money and did nothing
best
jeff
fyi
on the call today with jeremy blachman
co
today
we decided to the do the following
sue will make sure that ees legal
mike smith
reviews arms petition to modify the commission's order suspending da
sue will send jeremy a one-page summary of the petition and jeremy will use it to solicit participation from enron customers
i.e
see if any are willing to sign the petition
jeff will work with karen denne to start drafting a couple of one-page letters that customers would sign and send to legislators in the event davis is successful in calling them back in october to work on energy matters
let us know if you have any questions
best
jeff
u read it
will do
ain't got a chance to call him yet
but will do so by cob today
agree we need to get it nailed down
period
i was trembling
i mean
it read like a chilling cold-war spy novel
can barely write
i'm quivering all over
fyi
you're a better consumer advocate than apologist
i'll resend the document first thing in the am
best
jeff
so i'm assuming that you support the plan
best
jeff
that makes at least two of us
hope you're doing well
we intend to continue to fight vigorously to re-instate direct access in california
hope we'll be able to work together to get choice back

anything interesting

come out of yesterday's meeting

not a problem
will call in about 0 minutes

if you can get it to the da coalition that would be great
i'm also sending to delainey to distribute to the other biz folks

here it is
if you could get it to all the usual suspects
that would be great

jeff
i'm back from the doctor
i'll just take the time against lunch

i'll work through lunch
so no need to worry about any time accounting
if there's any issues with that approach
just let me know
thanks a bunch
best
jeff
talked to pat mason
give a call when you get a chance
jeff
i thought that you said it was $0/person
i'll keep that in mind
thanks
two things
when aleck said that he was leaving
effective immediately
does that mean one can't use email to send him a note to wish him well
if that's the case
do we have a forwarding telephone number for him
also
just wanted to make sure you're aware that calger continues to express concerns about us having any fingerprints on any attacks on the contracts
his concerns are two-fold
generally
he thinks it would be very damaging to our commercial reputation
since many of the folks holding the lousy contracts are folks we regularly transact with
and specifically
we're tied up with allegheny
sp
i've told him that we don't like the contracts
that we're talking to folks about how bad they are
but we're
staying under radar
and stating publicly that we never support the unilateral abrogation of anyone's contract rights
thanks
did i tell you that fawcett left for greener pastures
you saw my previous email
it appears that davis has officially called the legislature back to try to address the edison issue
appears they'll reconvene beginning next tuesday
we'll report back when we get additional information
there are some rumors going around that they might meet and simply appoint a
task force
comprised of legislators to continue working on the issue
burton is reported to have said that he's telling senators who are on vacation that
this isn't worth cancelling a vacation over
best
jeff
really appreciate it
i'll be up there this weekend
if you
or one of your guys
want to drop by
i think that we could pencil it out in about 0 minutes
let me know if that works for you
and thanks again
really appreciate it

state completes history's largest municipal-bond sale california's treasurer executed the largest single sale of municipal bonds in u.s
history tuesday
a $0.0 billion offering aimed at covering cash shortages linked to the state's energy crisis
the sale
coming in an environment of record-low interest rates
also proved to be the cheapest such short-term financing by the state on record
and it provided a backdrop for a warning from state treasurer phil angelides that continued delay in the long-awaited $0.0 billion energy-bond sale could wreak havoc with the state's budget in the next fiscal year
with the sept
0 terrorist attacks delivering a blow to an already shaky economy
there is concern that state revenues may drop even more precipitously than they have in the past year
leading to a crunch for the fiscal year that begins july 0
0
the slower state revenues coupled with increased expenditures and the added burdens of the ongoing energy crisis
could force
draconian
budget cuts
angelides said
we were already facing tough budget times in 0-0
he said
and that was before the tragedy of sept
0
now
if falling revenues are added to the
$0 billion hole
we'll have deficits akin to the early 0s
angelides said
noting the dramatic effects would be on people who depend on state services
earlier this year
the state advanced $0.0 billion in general-fund money to buy wholesale power for customers of pacific gas and electric co
southern california edison and san diego gas
electric co
repayment to the state general fund depends on successful sale of the $0.0 billion in energy bonds
a transaction angelides said requires key approvals from the state public utilities commission
the huge energy-bond sale initially was proposed for this summer and then moved to late october or early november
but the plan before the puc has drawn heavy opposition from state utilities
with utilities and others threatening lawsuits at every step of the way
regulators have needed time to build a legal record for each of the seven decisions the treasurer seeks
puc president loretta lynch said tuesday
this year
we've been taken to court probably five times more than we've been taken to court last year
partly because the commission has been making historic decisions and partly because it's been trying to make them so fast
she said
but angelides said that given the delay in puc action
he is doubtful an energy-bond sale can occur before 0
besides raising the budget concerns
that also could mean that california misses an opportunity to capitalize on the very low interest rate environment
i do not see a way now that this bond issue can happen this year
he said
citing the minimum 0 days of public notices and appeal periods that would follow puc action
tuesday's bond sale to meet the state's cash-flow needs involved what are known as revenue anticipation notes
the notes are fixtures on california's cash-flow landscape
in 0-0
for example
the state sold $0 billion through multiple offerings
no such sale was held last year because the state had an adequate surplus
but a year earlier
in fiscal 0-0
$0 billion in notes were sold to meet cash-flow needs
besides being the largest municipal-bond sale on record
tuesday's sale was also the largest muni
and corporate-bond issuance since the terrorist strikes
tuesday's debt issuance was viewed widely as a success because the vast majority of the securities found buyers
it speaks to overall quality of the state's credit and the way the state is perceived
particularly in light of sept
0
said peter taylor
senior vice president in the los angeles office of lehman bros
as senior manager on the sale
taylor and lehman bros
coordinated participation of more than 0 investment-banking firms
there was wide acceptance from a range of investors
retail
buyers
mom-and-pop buyers all the way to mutual funds and corporations
taylor said
the level of orders exceeded the offering by more than $0 billion
that allowed yields to be lowered through negotiations from the 0.0 level initially proffered to the lowest ran on record in the state
an annualized 0.0 percent
the notes mature june 0
0
overall yield
counting the variable-rate portion of the issuance
is only 0.0 percent
had the $0.0 billion in general-fund money been repaid
angelides said
the need for tuesday's short-term debt issuance
would have been substantially less
if not eliminated
even so
angelides said the state was fortunate to
move into the market and get extraordinary interest rates
and we will be able to make it through this fiscal year
sue has informed me that since she has most recently drawn the short straw
i'm next in line for meetings with brown
i've asked mike day to set up a meeting with brown
me and mike to begin our efforts to rehabilitate mr
brown
best
jeff
see what a good night sleep can do
we'll set up the meeting and determine the attendance list
if u and others are trying to get on ca call
pls call my line at 0.0.0
jeff
hmmm
my understanding is that prentice has a full plate this weekend
but don't know her precise schedule
so i was going to the dome to meet with dottie's cousin and the apple tree guy
and try to make some more progress finishing the cabin
thanks
we'll report back with any additional information that we hear
reports are that davis is expected to issue today whatever it is that he would issue to call the 0rd x session and call back the merry band of
probably very grumpy
legislators
best
jeff
just so we're clear
to say that it would not be a problem for very large tranches of customers to leave the system as part of
community aggregation
and then say it would be a problem for individual customers to do the same
is
well
ridiculous
in short
if you can work out the terms and conditions under which potentially huge tranches can go da
then it is certainly feasible to do the same thing for individual customers
finally
we're checking
but it seems that it will be be extremely difficult to say that its legally kosher for the puc to permit da under 0x
but suspend all other da
very interesting
best
jeff
can you send the draft letter tracy refers to re
letter to legislators
thanks

orange county register editorial
davis hurting state in an editorial
the orange county register blasts gov
gray davis and his board picks for the california puc
which
the paper asserts
have nullified the only good to come out of california's energy deregulation
consumer choice
with commentary from lance izumi
an electricity policy analyst at the pacific research institute
the register says a puc policy that requires customers to buy power from their local utility company is forcing ratepayers to fund davis's overpriced energy purchases
the negative impact on california businesses
some already in a slump
could force the state's economy into a recession and discourage businesses from relocating there
the editorial said
it's reminiscent of the 0's when government policy caused an economic bust and state unemployment shot to 0%

good talking to you
congratulations on your new role
sounds exciting
in addition to exhausting
based on our call
i contacted perfect commerce
the two folks from their shop that will be in houston are
ian sullivan svp
professional services and all implementation of the product cameron sellers vp
business development they'd like to meet sometime during the week of october 0th
let me know if that works for you and brad
or if you'd like to contact them directly
just let me know and i'll get you their numbers/emails
i ran across perfect when i was doing an mba project--we were required to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy
i've since found out that perfect's doing a pilot with ees--acting as the e-procurment platform for products tied to ees
outsourcing deals
from what i hear it's going well
and ees is enthusiastic
the technology is very interesting
soup to nuts e-procurement platform developed by paul milgrom
global auction guru and economist at stanford
glad you guys can meet with them
i think it's definitely worth the time--the technology may fit very well with networks
best
jeff
you got it
thanks
sue
just talked to the chamber
add them to the petition for rehearing
cmta will be back to me soon
if they don't sign it's only because they'll file separately
but i think they're likely to join arm's
best
jeff
the meeting will happen
will only be a matter of who attends
i'll let you know what i hear back
good luck with everything else
best
jeff
greetings eve and bill
this has been forwarded to delainey and dorothy
it's originating with arem
delainey's distributing to some
i'm distributing to others
the chamber's already agreed to join
if we're to have any hope of a
maintaining da and b
eliminating any chance of a retroactive date
seems that we'll need as many folks signing on as possible
please see attached
we hope that you can join
all the best
jeff
now for that bad news
call me
0.0.0
anything of note from the ferc/iso/generator meetings
could you check and see if the roundtable would like to sign on
thanks albest
jeff
sounds like some pretty good movement
congratz
fyi
latest word is that assembly
senate and administration staff have been locked in a room with orders not to emerge until they've struck a deal on the edison mou
word on da is not good
thus far it appears that the puc
study
outlined in the letter from burton
co
to lynch is as far as the senate wants to go at this time
but folks continue to push
seems to be a possibility that
if the legislature does reconvene
there may be a push by
green senators
to pass a
green only
da bill
in addition
lynch is setting the stage to have the puc reject the rate agreement between dwr and the puc on tuesday
this despite the governor calling to vigorously lobby each of the commissioners
despite the strong arm tactics
it appears that brown may be the only aye vote at this point
the idea is that
if the puc votes down the rate agreement
the only thing davis will have left is 0xx
we'll report back with news as we get it

riordan edges out davis in field poll
a survey finds lingering damage from the governor's handling of the energy crisis
by amy chance bee political editor
published sept
0
0
gov
gray davis survived the summer without the widespread power blackouts his opponents predicted
but voters remained dissatisfied with his job performance and disinclined to re-elect him
a field poll released tuesday found
the poll showed davis narrowly behind in a trial general election matchup against former los angeles mayor richard riordan
0 percent to 0 percent
riordan's strength in los angeles county
rare for a republican candidate
as well as lingering damage to davis from california's energy crisis were factors in the findings
said the poll's managing director
mark dicamillo
it's an interesting situation for a sitting governor
he said
it's very unusual for a sitting governor to be denied re-election
but here we have a unique candidate coming out of a democratic stronghold
and also we have this issue that is kind of hanging around the neck of the governor that the public is not very pleased about
and that's the energy and the electricity crisis
in a hypothetical republican primary
riordan led by a large margin over secretary of state bill jones
0 percent to 0 percent
businessman bill simon trailed with 0 percent of the vote
while 0 percent was undecided
the poll surveyed 0,0 californians
including 0 registered voters
sept
0-0 and is subject to an overall error margin of 0.0 percent
davis political adviser garry south said reporting poll results taken before the sept
0 terrorist attacks on the east coast was
horribly misleading
these kinds of watershed events that shake the national psyche always have an effect on job approval
he said
these kinds of things have effects on the way people feel about incumbents in general
dicamillo said he found it notable
however
that views of davis
performance continued to lag even as voters worried less about the electricity crisis
in may
at the peak of concern about potential power blackouts
voters said they disapproved of davis
performance
0 percent to 0 percent
in the latest survey
they continued to disapprove
0 percent to 0 percent
voters also said they were not inclined to re-elect davis
0 percent to 0 percent
now we're in a situation where the energy crisis mentality has receded
yet the public's image of the governor has not changed
dicamillo said
he has not benefited from the easing of public concern about the issue and is in the same situation that he found himself back in may
no matter what the political temper of the times internationally
there will be issues that are particular to the governor's race
this issue is what the public has focused their attention on in evaluating davis
and it's still negative
dicamillo said he also was struck by the fact that the poll found riordan leading among voters in los angeles county
0 percent to 0 percent
he said the survey showed similar results in may
los angeles county accounts for one-quarter of the state's electorate
and democrats typically carry it and the bay area by large margins
making up for losses in virtually every other area of the state
riordan adviser dan schnur said the numbers pose a strategic difficulty for davis
it's clear from this poll result that the voters who know dick riordan best support him most
he said
unless gray davis plans on winning the bay area by a voice vote
there's no way he can get re-elected unless he turns l.a
county around in a very big way
south said riordan
who held a nonpartisan office in los angeles
will fare far differently in a statewide partisan contest
and he recalled that then-gov
pete wilson was trailing democrat kathleen brown by 0 points as he prepared in 0 for re-election
we all know how that turned out
he said
a sitting california governor hasn't been defeated for a second term since 0

i'd like to fax you something that edison sent in support of their argument that

da customers contributed to edison's undercollection

just heard from michael rochman of spurr/remac
he wants to sign on
got it
sounds reasonable
let me know what time you can meet this weekend
after noon on saturday
and anytime before 0 pm on sunday works great for me
understanding that it's a t&m job
would you nonetheless be able to give a ballpark figure once we've spoken this weekend and you've had a chance to think about it
also
i've got some longer range plans
barn
house
etc
for the property that i'd like to run by you
too
but that's longer off
really want to get the deck done before the rain starts
thanks again
best
jeff
you should have it already
give me a call when you get a minute
thanks
jeff
i'll forward to them
you should have this
i sent it out yesterday
the scapegoating continues
haven't heard anything about it
though sue's been closer to these issues
congratulations and best of luck
hope you'll be able to hire someone to replace you
given your new responsibilities
big country to cover
all the best

for what it's worth
i concur with mike
option 0 is the most prudent
and preferable
path

talked to karen
thought we'd do bolinas weekend after your b-day
and we're around the weekend of your b-day
it's just that i've got class all day that saturday
i think if karen's overly uncomfortable
we should just do the four of us
we can always do dinner with david and nina
how's things
attachment
babe
if they get back to me with a date that week
i think that you ought to just have the meeting
understanding that the meeting with execs may not have occured yet
nevertheless
you'll have a darned good idea by that time whether its working well or it's a flop
non
anywho
let's see what response i get back
maybe they'll want to push back
her hair looked really good
it was pretty all over the place previously
now
with a few professional flourishes
she look even more gorgeous
if that's possible
best
jeff
meet for a drink after work
fyi
don't think it's anything that raises any concerns
but since you're signing on
thought you might want to peruse
best
jeff
couldn't agree more
was just kidding
you rock
cleca signing on
really don't want to write anymore notes
while he's a friend
and i've known him since he was a lowly vp
sending lots of emails to ceos
even in a flat org
like enron
is
well
bad form
let's see what happens
just let ian know that there's a chance that the meeting might take place prior to the ees debrief
the cooking thing is great
the funniest thing is that prentice has always said that she hates rice
and therefore risotto
so i'm psyched
yes
dear
no
what's your phone number
need to fill you in on some stuff
best
jeff
no kidding
however
it's safe to say that all concerned believe that your comparably quality and well-equipped to fill his shoes
hope to see you on the golf course soon
slight correction
if
in fact
they actually come back next week
we'll likely stay with tues/thur
if they end up not coming back
we may cancel regular call altogether
and continue for rest-of-year on
as needed
basis
but we're still figuring and will get back to you
we'll know more when we know more about what the heck the legislature is going to do
or not do
best
jeff
i asked scott and hedy to fill ken in on the change for this week
looks like ball got dropped
poor ken
you're not billing by the word now are you
no problem
your sense that the commercial folks going to be ok with this approach
though there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding whether and when davis will call back the california legislature to address the edison mou
here's the latest information we have
faced with horrible polling
an unwilling legislature
an uncooperative california puc
and a wily leader of the state senate
burton
davis is now considering delaying any action to call back the legislature
rumors of a delay come despite davis
statements that he would call them back next week
we received the information about a likely delay from an edison svp who's working with administration staff to come up with a deal that the legislature can finally swallow
it's edison's view that the earliest davis would now call the legislature back is end of next week
with early the following week being most likely
at this point
the chance remains that davis may be forced to throw up his hands and call the whole thing off
leaving edison to follow pg&e into chapter 0
in the meantime
negotiations between davis
staff
and staff from the senate and assembly continue
we'll report back with information as we get it
best
jeff
dorothy has informed that cmta will file solo
keith's got kids in expensive colleges

davis spokeswoman hilary mclean said
southern california edison
california's second-largest utility

the latest edison measure may let the utility sell $0.0 billion to $0.0 billion in bonds to pay off its debt
secured by existing rates on about 0 percent of its largest commercial customers
davis aides said last week
maybe the best thing for you to do is take a cab from the hyatt to the burbank airport monday morning
my flight arrives on southwest
from oakland
at about 0 am
i've rented a car
then we can drive to edison from there
it's about 0 minutes from the airport

sce's problem is that no one except davis and edison are for the bailout

article criticizing enron
not bad
really appreciate the note
great working with you
best
jeff
i love it
unfortunately
ena would likely go bonkers since many of the folks whose deals we'd be bettering also happen to be big ena customers
if there's a way to finesse it
e.g
enron offers state big power deal for 0/0 what state contracted for
it would really bring the house down
but i think that ena would get damn queasy about doing it
i.e
sign up
or else
i love it when you're tough
you're b-day
if you guys would like to go there
that's just peachy with us
really
i'm hooting just thinking about it
could we get someone else to do it
problem is just about everybody who could do it is in the soup because they're holding one of those stinking dwr contracts
thanks
you're call
might be a good idea to talk with him in advance
let me know what you think
or
given the time crunch
just contacting his office to find out what his angle will be would be helpful--i also assume he'll spend his time 0
singing pa's praises and 0
claiming that da can work
if done right
both of which are great messages

talked to fielder
let me know when it's good to take 0 minutes to debrief
thx,jeff
fyi
talked to john fielder
svp at the utility
this morning in an attempt to determine if edison will come around and pay us the px credit they owe us
summary of our offer
edison pays us 0% of what they owe us as of 0.0.0
payment structure
edison pays us 0% immediately
with an agreed to
speedy
payment schedule for the remaining 0%
in return
we drop our complaint against edison at the puc
in return
we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to march 0 to replace the current px credit/residual ctc framework
fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal
but had to check back on his end
however
there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal
some agreement regarding payment of edison's undercollection
this would cover any of our da customers who were bundled services customers pre-january 0
we agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the legislature and/or the puc agreed that edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates
some agreement on dwr stranded costs
john expressed the view that dwr bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone da would be there to take the power
and now that they've left
they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs
i told john that this issue is a hornet's nest
that we were better off leaving it out
but we'd consider his proposals
some agreement on forebearance
i told john that if edison agrees to pay us
it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table
we agreed to touch base at the same time wednesday morning
the idea is that he'll get back to me with edison's reaction to our proposal
and we'd get back to him on edison's proposals
might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions
while john seemed very inclined to work something out
all signals are that the legislature isn't inclinded to bail edison out next week
in which case
edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks
which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them
on the other hand
if the legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat
an agreement might have real value
any comments folks have on 0
edison's proposals and 0
whether it makes sense to continue discussions on wednesday are appreciated
seems that
at a minimum
if we agree to consider edison's proposals
then our payment should go from 0 cents to 0 cents on the dollar

california retailers association supports pg&e reorganization plan sacramento
calif
oct
0
prnewswire
california retailers association today released the following statement on pacific gas and electric company's proposal to emerge from bankruptcy
the california retailers association supports this plan because of the many benefits it offers to california
its consumers
and its businesses
we are pleased that this proposal would allow pg&e to pay the tens of thousands of small businesses who are owed money
in full
with interest
these firms
through no fault of their own
have been hurt by this energy crisis
and should be made whole
and will be
under this proposal
we are particularly pleased that pg&e's plan does not include any kind of rate increase
with our economy hanging in the balance
the last thing california consumers or small businesses need is higher utility rates
the plan also will provide consumers with power pricing stability
by locking in long-term prices for power at a relatively low price
this will benefit all customers by establishing fair prices that won't spike over time
finally
it is critically important to note that the plan is designed to return pg&e to financial viability so that the state of california can get out of the power procurement business
which has been taking funds away from other economic and social programs
the plan also does not require any legislative action or any financial bailout
so the state's attention and funds may once again be focused on their appropriate objectives
the california retailers association is a trade association representing major california department and specialty stores
mass merchandisers
grocery
chain drug and convenience stores
our members have more than 0,0 stores in california and account for more than $0 billion in sales annually
thanks very much
i faxed one the puc filed against the colton contract
pure pg&e
they'll be talking to just about everyone and greasing palms to get more of the same
can't wait to see who else jumps on the wagon
horrible
unfortunately
he was the loudest
most articulate voice appearing before the puc on the 0th
staunchly--and i mean staunchly--opposing da
if i see him
i'm going to get all over him
but me thinks the contracts are in for a wild ride
thanks very much

summary of the draft rate agreement between the puc and dwr the bond structure
keeps the state in the power selling business for 0 years
the life of the bonds
because the bonds are repaid solely from the state's power purchase revenues and no other repayment source
designed as a
net revenue bond
meaning bondholders are paid last and all other dwr costs and expenses are paid first
in order to sell net revenue bonds
dwr must show that it has guaranteed revenues to both
0
carry out its entire operations and
0
generate enough profit to pay off the bonds
as a result
the rating of a net revenue bond depends on the overall financial health of the company
in this case
a guarantee that the overall power purchase program instituted by dwr will be paid for by ratepayers for 0 years
requires that california's current energy policies and programs are set in place and not subject to further political or policy changes for at least the next 0 years and that the continued operation of this program will generate enough income to meet all the program's possible financial needs for the life of the bonds
ratepayers will pay for the state's power purchase program as long as the bonds are outstanding
the rate agreement
requires the commission to adjust rates in 0 to 0 days when dwr sends over a revenue requirement
the commission is limited only to correcting mathematical error or costs outside the agreement's scope
if the commission does not adjust rates according to dwr's estimated revenue calculations
the bond trustee may enforce bondholders
rights to have rates established at a level that satisfies dwr
may require the commission to require all utilities to take dwr's power and deliver it to customers in their service territories before the utilities sell their own
often lower cost power to customers in each service territory
precludes utilities from returning to the business of providing 0% of their customers
electricity needs for the life of the bonds because the state must stay in the business of buying and selling power to meet the requirements of a net revenue bond
guarantees dwr receives whatever revenue it needs for all of its power programs and establishes the state in the power business for at least 0 years
the life of the bonds
because the bonds can be repaid only from dwr sales
suggests the need to change the legislatively imposed mandate that dwr's program
sunset
at the end of 0
already
the financial community has expressed concern about this provision
in response
dwr's comments on the rate agreement suggested that an extension of the sunset by executive order could allow dwr to continue purchasing power in a way that would be funded through commission-approved revenue requirements
provides generators
who negotiated long-term contracts with the state during the very height of the energy crisis when market power was being exercised
irrevocable 0-year assurances that those power purchase deals will be treated as solidly as if they were loans from the generators to the state
interferes with federal or other court efforts to review the long-term contracts entered into by the state
because the existence of those contracts is essential to the continuation of the bond deal
the state would not be able to take advantage of any change in circumstance or law that would reduce dependence on disadvantageous long-term contracts
the commission must also enforce rules so that utilities can bill and collect on dwr's behalf
and customers are subject to disconnection for failure to pay for electricity provided by dwr
constitutes irrevocable financing document
the commission may not alter or modify any of its provisions without dwr's agreement
dwr will likely need to obtain bondholder approval before agreeing to any changes
remains in effect as long as the bonds are outstanding
regardless of how many bonds are issued
the challenges to the rate agreement
eleven parties filed comments opposed to the rate agreement
received comments in support only from dwr
the office of the state treasurer
and the investment bank underwriting the bond transaction
received strong opposition citing numerous flaws with the rate agreement
including
o the commission cannot make the iron-clad guarantee to meet dwr's revenue requirement o unconstitutional
contrary to general principles of utilities law
and outside the scope of ab 0x
the statute that allows dwr to buy power o dwr has acted illegally and the commission's actions are illegal because they rely on allegedly improper conduct on the part of dwr oppose the requirement that the commission must ensure that dwr has the physical ability to stay in business using the utilities distribution networks
consumer groups
calif puc question pwr contract validity los angeles
dow jones
two california consumer groups have asked california attorney general bill lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations
according to a press release monday
the utility reform network and consumers union asked lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant vikram budhraja presented a conflict of interest
because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies we believe there is ample evidence for the attorney general to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of california's conflict of interest laws
said bill ahern
senior policy analyst with consumers union west coast regional office
if the attorney general finds that a contract was made in violation of the law
it must be set aside as void

budhraja was hired by the california department of water resources to negotiate power contracts
but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the williams contract was signed
it is reasonable to assume that budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the williams contract
ahern said
it is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence
which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover
the groups also are concerned that budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $0.0 billion contract with allegheny energy inc

hi barry
congratulations on side-stepping what many
including us
thought would be a summer filled with supply disruptions
we're as glad as anybody that it hasn't happened
i have a quick question
your consultant for gas procurement
a fellow named mark baldwin
until recently did some consulting work for one of our business units
transwestern gas pipeline
mark has informed us that we won't be able to talk to him in his new role due to conflict of interest considerations that arise from our previous relationship with mark
with that in mind
i was wondering if there is someone else working on gas procurement other than mark
who doesn't face the same conflict issues
that we could meet with to discuss providing low-cost gas services to california
we're very cognizant of the importance of maintaining a conflict-free environment
but it would be a shame for the state to forego a good gas deal for the state's consumers
if there's someone we can talk to and avoid
even the appearance of
conflict-of-interest
we'd be very anxious to do so
thanks for your time and hope all is well

incredible
jeez
eldon is on fire
why
not very
in what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event
the california puc today voted down davis
proposed rate agreement between dwr and the cpuc
the vote was 0-0
with the two republicans voting with davis
hand-picked appointees lynch and wood
davis
proposal was introduced at the meeting by another davis appointee--geoff brown--who made a lengthy speech about why california would experience economic and political destruction if the puc did not approve davis
proposed rate agreement
what is davis
proposed rate agreement between dwr and the cpuc
it would remove all puc authority to review any contracts between dwr with suppliers
it would require the puc to pass through to utility rates all dwr power contract costs
no questions asked
what are the implications of the move by the puc to reject davis
proposal
with the vote
it remains unclear how california/dwr will pay for the dwr power contracts
the political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the dwr power contracts is likely to intensify considerably
it remains unclear how california/dwr will pay for the $0.0 b in bonds the treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months
under the structure devised by davis
the revenues flowing from the cpuc/dwr rate agreement would be used to both 0
pay for the dwr power contracts and 0
service the bonds the treasurer is trying to issue to repay california's general fund for spot and other short term power purchased by dwr since january
in short
there is no clear indication of how california will pay for dwr contracts or issue the bonds
safe to say that today's puc vote has seriously embarrassed davis
and left his approach to
solving
california electricity crisis in shambles
what next
a broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill
0xx
that passed the legislature with broad bi-partisan support
the bill would create a
dedicated rate component
on every customers bill to service the $0.0 b in bonds that the treasurer wants to issue
proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the
dedicated rate component
is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt california needs to plug the hole in its budget
the bill is silent
however
on how california would pay for the dwr contracts
and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result
all four puc commissioners who voted against the davis rate agreement today urged davis to sign the bill
the left-right coalition
from nader types to oil companies
is also working hard to get davis to sign it
davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the treasurer and bond counsel
given today's vote
however
davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid
update on edison bailout still appears that chances are very small that edison and davis will succeed in getting the legislature to vote for an edison bailout when it returns for another
special
session next tuesday
if you have any questions
just let us know

we're engaged
if only carl could morph into another loretta
there's a movie that grisman's daughter did about grisman and jerry and bluegrass that opens at the embarcadero on wednesday
might be worth checking out
in another surprise move
the puc approved an edison bailout today on a 0-0 vote
this item was not on the commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding
litigation
we do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to edison's svp of regulatory affairs and here's a summary
the commission will keep current rates in place through 0 any
overcollection
resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $0.0 b in edison's past due accounts
the so-called
undercollection
if edison collects the $0.0b prior to 0
then rates can change if edison has not collected the $0.0 b by the end of 0
the puc will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder
half the remainder will be collected in 0 and the other half in 0
any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $0.0 b undercollection
edison can keep 0% of any refunds received after the $0.0b is paid off
edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $0.0b
edison can apply to the puc for approval to hedge gas price risk
edison will be protected from any increases in dwr contract costs
i.e
if dwr's costs go up
the puc will raise rates rather than take it out of edison's rates
the puc will not fine edison during this period if edison's capital structure varies from the puc-approved capital structure edison must drop its lawsuits against the puc regarding 0
the
filed rate doctrine
and 0
the so-called
turn
accounting method
which effectively kept the rate freeze in place
edison agrees to
cooperate
with the attorney general and the puc in all litigation against suppliers
the puc decision could likely nullify the need for the
special
session that the governor recently announced we will report back with additional details as soon as we get them

puc and edison settle federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising rates the california public utilities commission
puc
and southern california edison
edison
today reached a settlement in the filed rate doctrine lawsuit edison filed in federal court against the puc
the settlement is intended to restore edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers
limit ratepayers
costs of paying off the debt
and maintain the state's role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable
certain period of time
the terms of the settlement agreement include
edison will apply cash on hand
plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs
to paying off its back debt
the puc and edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt edison had at august 0
0
less the cash on hand on that date
less an additional $0 million adjustment
the amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $0 billion as of the end of this month
the parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap
edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 0
or on the full payment of its debt
if sooner
if edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 0
the commission retains the discretion to determine whether edison will pay a dividend in 0
edison is free to resume paying dividends in 0
since edison's annual dividend has typically been about $0 million
edison's shareholders will have forgone at least $0.0 billion in dividends and possibly more
in addition to the $0 million adjustment
edison will apply 0% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the federal energy regulatory commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt
edison commits through court order to work with the puc and the attorney general in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers
the puc can direct edison to use $0 million each year for other utility purposes
including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies
which would otherwise be used to pay down the edison debt
the puc agrees not to lower edison's retail rates below their current level through the end of 0 unless the back debts are recovered
however
rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced dwr revenue needs
the puc agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate
to enable edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 0 and 0 if edison's back debt has not been recovered by the end of 0
there are no concessions of puc or state regulations or regulatory authority over edison
nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities
edison may make up to $0 million in capital expenditures annually
this settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power
while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of california
said loretta lynch
president of the puc
the settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers
this agreement settles a november 0 federal court lawsuit filed by edison against the puc
in which edison claimed that the commission's actions in not providing sufficient retail rates
violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property
under this agreement
edison will release the puc from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the commission's decisions implementing ab 0x
ab 0x
and the turn accounting proposal
assume for now at least that the currently allocation stands pat
pretty crazy
huh
gotta hand it to loretta lynch

puc bailed out edison today
no kidding
jeff
i have a copy of the settlement between the puc and edison if you want me to fax it to you
fyi
are you guys losing it about the edison settlement
seems better than 0kw and above
non
cool
thanks
come on
you're kidding
right
i'll be in the office very shortly
my converstation with fielder
sce svp i've been talking to about the px credit
yesterday afternoon regarding the settlement was not very fulfilling
he said there's still disagreement about what they owe us for the px credit he made a point to include in our conversation the provision in the settlement that requires edison to
cooperate
with the ag and the puc in litigation against generators/marketers i told him that we needed to get the payment issue resolved very quickly
he said that they needed a day or two to regroup and that they intended to call each and every creditor to discuss next steps
michael
i call you soon as i get in--next 0-0 minutes

jeff
thanks very much
agreed
karen
can you and i talk briefly before you call ken
thanks

jeff
got message
call when u can
0.0.0
jeff
would you like me to participate
just give me a call
you want to shoot for 0:0 my time
i'll be here
just give a call
have him call sue mara at 0.0.0
much happened yesterday--wow
and at least for now
it appears that loretta has let the legislature off the hook--appears that the puc is still a fairly potent institution
but it also appears that what had been
a foreseeable and avoidable
energy crisis
is now by and large a pretty messy state fiscal and political crisis for our good friends in sacramento
so i don't think that legislators
irrespective of their wishes
can avoid staying involved
add 0xx to the mix and the signing/veto process generally
and
well
sacramento still seems pretty darned relevant
as such
we will have our regularly scheduled call tomorrow at 0:0
best
jeff
no rush
whenever it's convenient for you
just let me know
and let me when you need the check and for how much
kisses
jeff go giants

thanks
interesting
thanks
i have to clear with calger first
also left a message with kean re
same
may be that we give the idea to the large customers and they run with it so no fingerprints on our part
i'm going to sketch out a proposal and pass it around for people to swipe at
i'm for severing if riordan loses

edison to repay creditors
immediately
but no date yet los angeles
dow jones
embattled utility southern california edison expects to pay all creditors
immediately
but the edison international
eix
unit does not have a specific date of when its debt payments will begin
said john bryson
chairman and chief executive of edison international
we intend to pay all of our creditors
bryson said wednesday in a call with reporters
but we do not have a specific date
southern california edison and the california public utilities commission struck a deal tuesday that will allow the utility to pay off $0.0 billion of its $0.0 billion debt through existing retail electricity rates
both parties settled a year-old lawsuit southern california edison filed against the puc--otherwise known as a filed rate doctrine--that could have ended a retail rate freeze and allowed the utility to recover more than $0 billion in wholesale power costs from ratepayers
the settlement must still be approved by a federal court judge
a ruling is expected by thursday
bryson indicated that the utility may try to negotiate with some large generators
owed nearly $0 billion
to accept less than 0 cents on the dollar for money the companies are owed
there is no deal between us and the generators at this point
bryson said
we will engage promptly
in settlement discussions
we are eager to work it out in a tough minded and fair way
ted craver
edison's chief financial officer
said the utility has between $0.0 and $0.0 billion cash-on-hand and about $0.0 billion in debt
bryson said the utility does not expect its credit ratings to be restored to investment grade
immediately
we've had some discussions with the credit rating agencies
bryson said
but no one expects it to be restored immediately
it's going to take some time
bryson added that the utility will seek new lending opportunites
but he did not elaborate
stephen frank
president of southern california edison
said the utility would sit down with all of its creditors and work out a payment plan
bryson said the utility believes that all of its debt can be paid off by the end of 0
he did not say how much money from retail rates would be carved out for paying off southern california edison's debt
the utility's debt rose to $0.0 billion
according to a recent securities and exchange filing
in the month of october we generated about $0 million
from retail rates
but bryson said he could not estimate how much of that will be set aside to pay creditors
the utility and the puc both said rates will not have to increase beyond the record rate hikes state regulators ordered earlier this year
bryson said the utility has no intention of taking over the state's long-term power supply contracts as a result of the deal with the puc
fearing the state legislature wouldn't support a bill to rescue southern califoria edison after six months of wrangling
advisers to gov
gray davis and edison executives began negotiating with the state's public utilities commission on a settlement of a year-old lawsuit the utility filed to force the commission to raise rates enough to cover its power costs
the negotiations with the puc were kept secret from state lawmakers in case a settlement couldn't be reached
davis aides and edison executives said
the end result
edison and the commission said
is a deal that will allow the utility to work out a plan to pay off its creditors and keep southern california edison from following pg&e corp
pcg
unit pacific gas
electric into bankruptcy
thank you robert for pointing that out
i think there is/will be an opportunity--if we can ever get paid
and if we can ever comfortable from a credit standpoint--and my apologies for not having flagged that sooner
too many balls
in the air

jeff
don't hate me for sending a note
what do you think
california made two big mistakes
first
they never made a market
they didn't deregulate
they just re-regulated the failed monopoly structure they'd been living with for decades
second
when the first mistake led to an energy crisis
california's leaders didn't stop
learn from their mistakes
and get deregulation right
instead
they blamed everyone but themselves
including enron
those mistakes led to the nightmare california's been living for over a year now
and they still california still has woken up
enron's the model of the virtual organization
whether the problem's in california
or india or sweden
enron creates the virtual organization needed to solve the problem
that's what we did in california
houston is definitely the brain
but you need all the other limbs and organs to function well
what makes the
virtual
part of it work is a committed management team
great technology and an incredible team of talented
flexible folks from across the company
that allowed us to coordinate extremely well under challenging conditions
it's been a great experience
attached is a draft agenda for tomorrow's meeting
if there's anything we've missed
we can amend the agenda prior to starting tomorrow
best
jeff
thanks very much for your help on this
thanks a millino for your help
i can make it
sue's will be in houston for this
but will there be a call-in number to tap into for some of the discussion
thanks a lot

listening to the edison call w/investors edison says they will pay everyone at the same time
big bang
approach
sometime in q0'0
my concern is that between now and then dunn
the ag have the time and resources to make a heckuvalot of mischief
which could be detrimental to generators/marketers
claims
investors are asking what edison intends for qfs and generators--asking about haircuts in particular--and edison is side-stepping the questions
great
figured they'd contacted them
but wanted to make sure
you know when the meeting with schedulers will be
i apologize
i'm on the road and haven't heard when that will be
i'm thinking that i may want to attend
thanks
best
jeff
thanks
i guess davis
people think that we'll back off if they put someone from texas in charge
perhaps they're looking for someone who knows pat wood
be useful to find out if she knows him
best
jeff
if you're referring to the tues/thur call
we've talked some and thought we'd go to once per week with sacramento folks having the option of callling in

as california's malaise deepens
gray davis
standing plummets
published oct
0
0
a year ago
gray davis was riding high
because californians were prosperous
confident about their future and thus supportive of the political status quo
davis
high approval ratings had little to do with his actual performance
or any personal affection among californians for their cool and distant governor
he was just the fortunate beneficiary of good times and good feelings
today
a dark cloud has descended on the state
a sharp decline in the economy
particularly high-tech sectors
a stubborn energy crisis and
most recently
the terrorist hijackings and murderous crashes of california-bound airliners have left californians worried about their personal safety and economic security
and they're looking for someone to blame
davis
approval ratings began to decline early this year as the energy crisis hit home and it became apparent that he had failed to take the initiative in heading off the worst aspects of the situation
and they have continued to sag
thus presenting the governor with a series of interlocking tests as he begins his campaign for re-election in 0 months
the seriousness of davis
decline was underscored late last month in a statewide field poll indicating that
at the moment
most california voters would prefer former los angeles mayor richard riordan to davis
history indicates that davis should still be favored to win a second term
but if riordan does become the republican candidate
he would have at least an outside chance of unseating davis
davis
chief problem is that he will be running for re-election in what will almost certainly be sharply declining economic circumstances
the product of a slowdown already under way and the plummeting consumer confidence in the wake of the terrorist hijackings
state tax revenues are in a nosedive
running a billion dollars under projections in the first three months of the fiscal year
and davis will be compelled to make multibillion-dollar slashes in state spending that will irritate important constituent groups
how big the state budget hole will become is anyone's guess
there's a distinct tendency for state revenues to plummet far faster and further in an economic downturn than official forecasts
just as they rise faster and higher in a recovery than the bean counters project
some analysts believe that davis
problem could rival the $0 billion deficit that predecessor pete wilson confronted in 0
wilson swallowed hard and agreed to the largest state tax increase in american history
however large the state's fiscal problem may be
it will be much
much larger if the state money davis spent on power purchases this year cannot be recovered from a proposed bond issue
and the $0.0 billion bond issue is on indefinite hold because the public utilities commission
consumer groups and pacific gas and electric are opposing the administration's demand that past and future power purchases be covered by ratepayers without review
it's apparent now that the long-term contracts the administration signed are much too expensive
which is why davis
own appointees to the puc are balking
davis could try to renegotiate the contracts
but that would be admitting that he and his advisers erred in the first place
or he could accept the legislature's proposal
contained in legislation on his desk
that only past power purchases be guaranteed and that future contracts be subjected to the scrutiny that private utilities
purchases must receive
but davis is insisting that he'll veto the measure
the effect of the current flap over bonds and power contracts
as well as davis
months-long effort to provide a bailout for financially strapped southern california edison
and his lackadaisical performance earlier in the energy game
will undermine the governor's claim for a second term
he comes across as someone who dithered when he should have acted
and signed too-expensive contracts even as the power market was contracting
that
and californians
increasing apprehension about their future
will make his re-election a much dicier prospect than he had envisioned

jeff fallout in california pg&e remains in bankruptcy the company's proposed plan of reorganization places the bulk of its gas and electric assets under ferc jurisdiction
leaving distribution under control of the california puc the california puc and edison reached agreement designed to keep edison out of bankruptcy on the heels of a failed legislative effort to return edison to solvency
the california puc has agreed to a rate plan to permit edison to pay its creditors the davis administration still can't agree on a plan to use utility rates to reimburse the state's general fund and pay for long-term power contracts california used about $0.0 billion of taxpayer dollars to buy power on behalf of the state's cash-strapped utilities and signed more than $0 billion in long-term contracts unless california devises a plan to finance its foray into the energy business
california could turn its energy crisis into a fiscal crisis california suspends the only successful piece of its failed restructuring scheme--customer choice fearful that customers will find better prices for power than it can provide
the state decided to temporarily suspend direct access in california and force customers to remain with the utility the suspension is very controversial
prompting market participants to threaten litigation in the attempt to get direct access reinstated in california

davis vs
lynch
or is the feud a charade to shield the governor
when gov
gray davis named political operative loretta lynch to the state public utilities commission
and insisted that she become the puc's president as well
it was in keeping with davis
long-established mode of personally controlling major political levers
all of that occurred
however
before california was plunged into the
energy crisis
an infuriatingly complex amalgam of politics
economics
power supply and distribution
and such uncontrollable factors as the weather
when the first strains were felt 0 0/0 years ago
davis and lynch reacted
as one might expect
in tandem and
as later experience proved
poorly
they refused
in effect
to intercede with some steps
such as long-term
low-price supply contracts and perhaps small rate increases
that would have prevented the situation from deteriorating into a crisis
last january
when the financial plight of the privately owned utilities brought the threat of major power blackouts
davis and lynch were forced to act
but within a couple of months
the previously inseparable partners began cleaving apart
at least publicly
at lynch's behest
the puc enacted a stiff rate increase while davis claimed that she and the puc had acted on their own
without his knowledge
it was widely seen at the time as a ploy
one that would bring about a rate boost that every authority knew was necessary
without forcing davis to publicly change position
since then
the two have continued to act in seemingly divergent ways
the puc stepped into the political stalemate over southern california edison
for example
working up a secret deal that apparently will protect the utility from bankruptcy without having to win legislative approval
and the puc has opposed the authority sought by the davis administration to finance bonds that would pay for past and future state power purchases
administration officials are publicly critical of lynch and the puc and circulate stories that davis considers her to be an impediment
one version had davis dumping her as president of the puc in favor of a friendlier member
and puc officials insist that lynch is just acting to preserve the historic independence of the agency
first created nearly a century ago as a bulwark against the out-of-control southern pacific railroad
a lengthy article in monday's los angeles times traced the history of the davis-lynch relationship and
in effect
endorsed the conventional wisdom that the two erstwhile political allies had grown apart under the strain of the energy crisis
that may be true
but the intensity with which that interpretation of events is being peddled makes one suspicious that it's just another ploy aimed at protecting the governor's backside from the fallout of his less-than-deft handling of the energy situation
polls indicate that it's the primary reason why his public approval rating has dropped dramatically this year
thus making his re-election next year less than certain
by doing the deal on edison
supposedly without davis
knowledge
lynch saved the governor from a huge embarrassment
he had gone to the mat for the utility but was rebuffed by a legislature dominated by his own party
he had called a special legislative session on edison but had been told that he would lose again
holding up approval of the administration's bond-power contract scheme is often cited as the most powerful evidence of a schism between davis and lynch
but she may be doing the governor a big favor in that arena as well
the contracts signed by the administration are much too expensive and
if implemented
will cost ratepayers billions of extra dollars over the next decade
davis needs to dump them
but if he acts directly
he'll have to admit that he made a mistake
if the puc continues to hold up the necessary authority
he can use that as a lever to force suppliers into whittling down prices
or even abandoning the contracts altogether
without having to take responsibility for reneging
maybe davis and lynch are feuding
but it could all just be a charade to fool the public and protect the governor
power providers cry foul over fees state is accused of improper billing electricity suppliers long accused of manipulating california's energy market are turning the tables on the state
saying its independent grid manager is forcing them to make up the cost of bad energy deals signed by gov
gray davis
administration
the power traders accuse the independent system operator
which is legally required to act as an impartial market manager
of improperly helping state power buyers spread out the cost of high-priced electricity contracts
energy firms as well as municipal utility systems have complained about mysterious charges on their accounts with the grid agency
said jan smutney
jones of the independent energy producers association
which represents such industry giants as enron
dynegy
williams and reliant
the charges showed up around the time the state department of water resources was forced to start selling excess electricity it had purchased at an average of $0 per megawatt hour for as little as $0 per megawatt hour
the iso seems to be following specific instructions the department of water resources is giving them
smutney-jones said
an industry source said nrg energy inc
and other suppliers were preparing a formal complaint to the federal energy regulatory commission
which could order the state to issue refunds to generators if it finds they have been improperly charged
the commission has ordered an unprecedented operational audit of the grid management agency
state officials bought power under long-term contracts when it appeared california could suffer serious power shortages over the summer
instead
the state had more than enough power
and electricity available on the spot market suddenly cost half as much as the energy california had bought
gary ackerman of the western power trading forum
an industry group
said the grid operator was using a combination of power scheduling and billing practices to
bury
some of the cost of power purchased by the state in the accounts of other generators
the state is the biggest buyer and seller of electricity
and they control the governing board of the iso
ackerman said
the governor's spokesman
steve maviglio
called the power firms
accusations
absolutely false
and said the generators were trying to whip up sentiment in washington to interfere with the state's affairs
the generators know they'll get a much better deal at ferc headquarters in washington than they will in sacramento
maviglio said
it shouldn't be a surprise that they make these accusations here to get federal involvement
oscar hidalgo
a spokesman for the department of water resources
said generators could hardly cast themselves as victims in california's energy crisis
i don't feel sorry for them one bit
hidalgo said
they had one heck of a year
gregg fishman
spokesman for the iso said the agency was preparing a response to the accusations
energy trade organizations said they suspected the iso of using several mechanisms to charge suppliers for state contract costs
the extra expense is sometimes tacked on to suppliers
bills for iso operating costs
which all electricity sellers in california share
ackerman said
some firms say they have tried to buy cheap spot market electricity for resale
only to find later that the grid manager has charged them for more expensive state power
others say the grid operator orders them to activate stand-by power units on too-short notice
when they can't comply
they say
the iso brings high-priced state power on line and bills them for the extra cost
the accusations are part of a struggle for control of california's grid
in january
davis disbanded the iso's 0-member governing board
which was chaired by smutney-jones
after some critics said it was too cozy with industry
davis appointed his own five-member board
in february
then-ferc chairman curt hebert said the new board had become
a political arm of the governor
the commission is trying to get california to turn over its grid to a multistate transmission organization
davis has warned washington to
keep its hands off

dear ms dsl
looks like no dwr meeting this week
thanks for the tip

jeff
oh
they're trying alright
but we have conflict with the consultant they've hired
i'll fill you in another time
dwr is radioactive
though
and we shouldn't be doing any deals with them right now
rick
based on your voicemail
here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that i've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in california
e.g
john white
large customers
it could include more bells and whistles
but the intent of this proposal is to get da back as soon as possible
reduce dwr l-t contract volumes by at least 0-0% to
back fill
increase in net-short created by contract reformation
permit noncore customers
0 kw and above
to elect to go da to fill the position da provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than dwr contracts election is first-come
first-serve
capped at the aggregate net short position customers decision to go da will constitute a 0-year commitment to stay da
i.e
can't go back to iou for 0 yrs
must stay in the market
if a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected da
i.e
not enough elect to fill the net short
then the ious will hold an auction to fill the net short the auction would seek a portfolio of 0 month
0 month
0 year and 0 year deals
both peak and off-peak
to fill the net short
noncore customers choosing da would not escape costs of dwr power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service
i.e
prior to electing da
likewise
if the noncore customers choosing da was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its
undercollection
i.e
when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap
the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing da status noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of dwr l-t contracts
potential add-on to deal
core customers
less than 0 kw
could choose
green only
da
but
like
noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible

contract/da fix

mike day and i talked
mike agreed that there's
elbow room
in puc regulations that would allow pg&e to do the financial swap we talked about late yesterday without having to get regulatory approval
however
mike also agreed that there's some risk
moderate to low in our view
that the puc could try to ding the utility--for whatever reason--next time it goes under review as part of its general rate case
in the end
pg&e will have to decide whether doing the financial with us is--in pg&e's view--overly aggressive or not from a regulatory perspective
in short
doesn't seem to be any real downside in raising it and seeing how pg&e responds
if this doesn't answer the question sufficiently
let me know
best
jeff
yes
as things change
so do call schedules
we conferred and have recommend that
there will not be a call this week
beginning next week
the call will take place once per week
on wednesdays
at the same time
0:0 am pdt
same call-in number
we hope
until the next legislative session starts up
the call will be optional for the gang in sacramento
if you have any alternative suggestions
questions
and/or comments
please let me know
and please forward to others who need/would like to know
best
jeff
thanks very much
only if you still agree to be surprised
thanks
one other question
which seems like a legal question
assume that enron openly advocates for the puc to apply the charges to all customers
including ours
understanding that our customers neither benefited from or caused the charges
if the puc does it
and we go back to our customers and claim that an indirect tax has been applied
are we in any kind of bind for having pushed for it
i'm hoping that the answer is no
thanks for the info
best
jeff
got it
i'll check on reviving the unbundling
but i think they've begged off of that for now
in their most recent bcap
they do propose to implement a customer-only open season on their backbone
you have that proposal
and having socal buy for sdg&e seems somewhat likely
i can check on that
best
jeff
knock
em dead

jeff
it seems that since we've already contributed
we're invited
given where davis
numbers have gone recently
riordan's imminent announcement and potential
and the fact that the rs have played it about as well as could be expected under the circumstances
save for morrow
who we may want to bring up with brulte if the lunch is attended
this could be a useful gathering

jeff ferc judge urges dismissal of calif complaint vs el paso washington
dow jones
an administrative law judge has recommended the u.s
federal energy regulatory commission dismiss a complaint alleging el paso corp
epg
manipulated the market for natural gas sales into california
the ruling in the high-profile
politically charged case was a setback for california
which had sought to hold el paso financially accountable not only for higher natural gas prices
but also for the resulting higher electricity prices in a state heavily dependent upon gas-fired power plants
while
el paso pipeline and el paso merchant had the ability to exercise market power
the record in this case isn't at all clear that they in fact exercised market power
curtis wagner
ferc's chief administrative law judge
concluded in an initial decision forwarded to the commission late tuesday
the california public utilities commission
which filed the complaint against el paso
said later tuesday that it would appeal wagner's decision on market manipulation
in a small victory for the state
wagner did find that el paso officials violated ferc's
standards of conduct
rules barring the sharing of market-sensitive information between pipeline companies and their natural-gas marketing affiliates
el paso corp
el paso pipeline
and el paso merchant are guilty of affiliate abuse
wagner concluded
there was a dialogue between the pipeline affiliates and the marketing affiliate that gave an unfair advantage to the bidding
by the marketing unit for el paso pipeline capacity into california
wagner said
ferc had dismissed the issue of affiliate abuse on march 0 without a hearing
at wagner's request
the commission later agreed to reopen the issue during a hearing into the market-manipulation complaint
the proceeding
which began april 0 and concluded august 0
resulted in a hearing record of 0 volumes and totaled 0,0 pages
while 0 exhibits were entered into evidence
wagner reported
the briefs measured approximately one linear foot
he said
contracting with affiliates at issue are contracts worth $0.0 million that el paso's marketing unit entered into with its pipeline affiliate to secure 0.0 billion cubic feet per day of firm transportation capacity into california from march 0 through june 0
california argued el paso had used its control of pipeline space to limit the supply of gas into the state and boost prices
the contract period coincided with an unprecedented period of power-market volatility
in which skyrocketing natural gas costs contributed to extreme spikes in electricity prices that ultimately rendered the state's utilities insolvent
the judge found that the contracts gave el paso merchant more than a 0% market share
the market-power threshold under ferc's merger guidelines
based on his interpretation of the relevant market
el paso had argued for the higher antitrust-law threshold of 0%
but wagner ruled that the lower standard should apply
but while that market share gave el paso the
ability to exercise market power
wagner said
it is not at all clear from the record in the proceeding that el paso merchant and el paso pipeline exercised market power
the record offers only mixed support for allegations by the cpuc and utilities in the state that el paso withheld gas supplies to drive up prices
wagner said
from march through october 0
el paso's capacity utilization rate was about half the rate of other shippers
while for the remainder of the contract
the full capacity was used
wagner concluded that el paso's compliance with ferc rules requiring companies that control pipeline capacity to offer unused capacity to other shippers constituted an effective check against market power
improper communications seen where the state scored a win was in the second phase of the hearing
where wagner heard evidence on allegations of affiliate abuse
wagner cited telephone records and correspondence to conclude that el paso violated ferc rules requiring pipelines and affiliated marketers to operate independently of one another
the rules also restrict communications between pipeline operating personnel and affiliated marketers
transcripts of telephone conversations between pipeline and marketing employees of el paso
demonstrate blatant collusion
to keep secret a discount for service
on el paso's mojave system until the open season was over in which merchant was bidding for the pipeline capacity on the sister pipeline
wagner said
including the transcripts in his opinion
wagner determined that the transcript offered a
prima facie
case of affiliate abuse
and urged el paso to present witnesses to rebut his finding
but el paso declined to present the witnesses
the opinion noted
wagner also cited a confidential memorandum to william wise
el paso's chief executive
from the head of el paso merchant as contributing to his conclusion that el paso and its pipeline and marketing affiliates
were in clear violation
of ferc's affiliate-abuse rules
el paso replied in a statement that the commission had considered the same evidence and found no abuse in its march 0 ruling
the commission would commit a
legal error
if it adopted the judge's views
the company said
the parties have 0 days to file briefs taking exception to the judge's findings
the commission can either accept or reject the judge's findings
however the commission ultimately rules in the case
it is expected to end up appealed before a federal appeals court

california's $0.0 bln bond sale may be salvaged
official says sacramento
california
oct
0
bloomberg
california's $0.0 billion bond sale to cover energy costs may win approval if governor gray davis agrees to seek revisions of existing power contracts
a state regulatory official said
the bond sale stalled last week when the california public utilities commission voted 0-0 against a plan to repay the state's power costs using utility rates
the commissioners favor another approach
opposed by davis
that would give them more authority over the state's $0 billion of power contracts
some commissioners ``would probably be amenable to the rate agreement if there was movement on the governor's part to renegotiate those contracts
said geoffrey brown
who was appointed to the puc by davis
``we're not just sitting around waiting for the sky to fall
there's got to be some give here
moody's investors service on friday said california's $0.0 billion of debt may be downgraded for the second time this year
in part because of the delayed bond sale
california's budget deficit in fiscal 0 may reach $0.0 billion if energy costs aren't repaid
state treasurer philip angelides said
the state has spent $0.0 billion since january buying electricity on behalf of pg&e corp
and edison international utilities
which are insolvent
davis `willing to discuss
``it takes two to tango and we are certainly willing to discuss the contracts
said steve maviglio
the governor's spokesman
davis will consider brown's offer
``especially in context
of any refunds from generators that may be ordered
maviglio said
state officials claim power generators have charged too much
and are asking federal regulators to order refunds
power generators are ``willing to discuss it
but i wouldn't want anybody to have any false promise or hope that any enormous change will come from this
said gary ackerman
executive director of the western power trading forum
a group representing power sellers
any companies willing to talk ``might want something else in return
and who knows what that might be
the planned bond sale
the largest municipal debt sale in u.s
history
would repay the state's general fund for a $0.0 billion power loan and cover other power costs
the sale has been delayed by the disagreements among state leaders
under state law
the puc is required to provide enough revenue from consumer rates to meet the bond payments and cover power contracts
the department of water resources
the state agency buying the power
has sole authority to determine its revenue needs
puc president loretta lynch and others said an irrevocable financing order would make it difficult for the state to renegotiate power contracts
they also said the dwr has been given too much authority
in the past
the puc has set utility rates
``it gives a blank check to the dwr for anything that they want to do going forward
said california senate president pro tempore john burton
the commissioners favor a plan to back the bonds with a surcharge on utility customers
bills
the proposal would let the puc review the water department's revenue requirements and require a public hearing on the allocation of costs among the utilities
davis opposes that plan
``it's dead on arrival
it's still going to be vetoed
said maviglio
the governor has until sunday to sign or veto all the bills sent to him during the last session
the new plan would expose the state to breach-of-contract claims
the governor's office said in a statement last week
the state agreed with power generators to pay energy contracts before repaying the bonds
making a change now ``would eliminate the security on which the power sellers relied
the governor's office said in the statement
critics of the long-term power contracts say the state's economy will be hurt by above-market costs for years to come
no matter which approach the state takes
``the government ought to try to renegotiate the contracts anyway
burton said
``and some of the generators have said they're willing to do it
keep up the good work
sue's got it covered
but i'll be there soon enough
you know
i just received this note
wonder if something's wrong with the network

pg&e utility reorganization draws fire in calif san francisco
oct 0
reuters
pg&e corp.'s plan to reorganize its bankrupt pacific gas
electric unit
california's biggest utility
is coming under fire as a bid to dodge state regulation
critics said that with california beginning to emerge from a two-year energy crisis triggered by a failed deregulation law that drowned the state's utilities in red ink
now is no time to abandon state oversight
loretta lynch
president of the california public utilities commission
cpuc
called the plan
a regulatory jailbreak
and
a corporate shell game to evade proper state regulation
by transferring assets to unregulated pg&e affiliates
the reorganization plan would split the parent company and its utility into stand-alone companies
transferring the hydro network
diablo canyon nuclear power plant and gas and electric transmission systems to unregulated units of parent pg&e
the utility would continue to own and operate local gas and power distribution grids serving about 0 million customers
the plan would allow all valid creditor claims to be paid without the need for a rate increase or state bailout
said bob glynn
chairman
president and chief executive of pg&e
it would provide creditors with about $0.0 billion in cash and $0.0 billion in notes
eye on hydro system one of the concerns arising from the plan is how pacific gas
electric would continue to manage its hydroelectric properties
which make up the world's largest privately held hydropower system
elected officials from 0 counties in pg&e's sprawling hydro watershed in central and northern california will meet friday to weigh actions on the reorganization plan filed at the san francisco federal bankruptcy court sept
0
the regional council of rural counties is worried about who will safeguard the environmental health of the hydro system's rivers and lakes that are the foundation for fishing
boating and tourism in an area that sprawls across about two-thirds of the state
council vice president wes lujan told reuters
pg&e spokesman jon tremayne said the hydro system
nuclear reactors and transmission systems would continue to be regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission or the nuclear regulatory commission
the utility also would continue to get power from plants it now owns under a 0-year deal at 0 cents per kilowatt hour
but state attorney general bill lockyer said he is looking closely at the plan because of
serious concerns the utility is seeking to evade further scrutiny by the cpuc
and avoid state laws on the asset transfers
lockyer said that in the past
pg&e had used cpuc oversight as a shield against federal scrutiny
despite pg&e's claim that the cpuc has no jurisdiction on the transfer of power and transmission assets to the parent
cpuc chief counsel gary cohen said the agency's approval is required under state law
pg&e's goal is clear
they want to transfer most of the utility's valuable assets to an affiliate company
at fire sale prices
so that they will no longer be subject to any state regulation
it is a deregulation plan
not a reorganization plan
cohen said
pg&e's plan conflicts with california's interest to have a more stable and regulated energy system
deregulation has failed the public
and we will look at every opportunity to put down this attempt to solve the failure of deregulation with more deregulation
said doug heller
of consumer advocate the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights
pg&e's tremayne said the plan makes the most sense for california because units of pg&e would continue to own and manage power production and transmission
tremayne said
however
the reorganization plan does not bar a future sale to another company
pg&e's plan would give the utility $0.0 billion from the asset transfers to help pay off about $0 billion in debts
including $0 billion in unrecovered power purchase costs
the cpuc's cohen and consumer groups said pg&e should receive far more than $0.0 billion from the assets
they point to the value of the hydro network
last fall
the utility dropped a plan to sell the hydro system to its parent for $0.0 billion because the system was
undervalued in today's market
and could fetch a much higher price through an auction
the pg&e utility and edison international's southern california edison utility amassed billions of dollars of debt because the deregulation law prevented them from passing steep wholesale power prices to their customers
socal edison and the cpuc reached a deal oct
0 to keep the utility out of the bankruptcy court and pay off its creditors

nevada puc acts to change or void long-term pwr contracts los angeles
dow jones
the nevada public utilities commission wednesday voted to allow its general counsel office to take any action necessary to try to void or renegotiate long-term electricity contracts entered into by the state's two largest utilities
a puc spokeswoman said
the contracts would force sierra pacific resources
srp
utilities sierra pacific power co
and nevada power co
to pay a higher price for power than current market rates
said don soderberg
puc chairman
we paid high prices when the prices were high
but to pay high prices when the prices are low is outrageous
soderberg said
no one at sierra pacific or nevada power was available to comment on which companies have signed contracts with the utilities
or the value of the contracts
the puc action follows a letter sent by gov
kenny guinn to the federal energy regulatory commission in early october asking that the utilities be allowed to renegotiate the contracts
the general counsel's office will now have authority to file with ferc and in court to plead against the current contracts
sierra pacific has said that a june ferc order that capped wholesale power prices has penalized the company
sierra pacific signed its forward contracts to escape high spot market prices
only to have those contracts end up being more expensive than the capped spot market prices
the company has said
as well
if the company wants to sell any surplus power into the spot market
it will now receive less for that power under the cap
it has said
california
s public utilities commission is also pushing for renegotiation of $0 billion in long-term contracts signed by the state
which has been buying power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities since january
davis devises new borrowing plan his executive order could speed up $0.0 billion in bond sales and bypass puc oversight of repayment mechanism
sacramento
gov
gray davis is crafting a new plan to expedite the long-delayed borrowing of $0.0 billion to repay the sagging california state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy crisis
the plan
which could be contained in an executive order as early as next week
would minimize the role of the state's top power regulator
the public utilities commission
which enraged davis last week when it declined to sign off on his original plan
with enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in place for the recovery of the two state's largest utilities
the repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining issues of the energy crisis
that is one scenario
davis spokeswoman hilary mclean said wednesday when asked about the proposal
there are a number of different scenarios being considered
nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be publicly announced
most involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell $0.0 billion in revenue bonds
most of which
about $0.0 billion
would go back into the state treasury
the issue was how to lock in a mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid
a critical step before they could be marketed to investors
davis wanted the puc to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and cover the state's energy costs through the revenues collected from ratepayers
but the puc said the administration's proposal might prove inadequate over time
leading to future rate hikes
the puc also said the administration's plan gave too much authority to the davis-controlled department of water resources
by allowing the department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue
the puc
which is set up to be an independent board with the sole responsibility for setting utility rates
did not want to cede that authority
it rejected the davis plan oct
0 on a 0-0 vote
led by its president
davis appointee loretta lynch
davis earlier said the commission's approval was necessary to reassure investors and get the bonds to market
the plan now under review
however
would bypass that
the dwr would not directly set rates
but under the davis plan it would be charged with identifying how the money coming in from customers
utility bills over the next 0 years would be allocated
in effect
guaranteeing that paying back the bonds would have equal priority with paying back the suppliers of the energy
proponents of the plan believe that would satisfy wall street
the administration believes it would require no additional rate hikes
lynch said wednesday that she had not been involved in the latest negotiations
but questioned whether davis had the authority to issue an executive order allowing the dwr to get involved in setting rates
i've been told for six months that the puc was needed to pass a rate agreement
if the dwr can get the bonds sold by themselves
then great
lynch said
but to dedicate rates
it takes a financing order from the puc or a statutory change in law
a statutory set-aside
it takes one of those two things
the governor is likely to announce the plan sometime following his expected veto of the bill that lays out the legislature's version of the payback plan
by law
the governor has until sunday to act on sb0xx
by senate leader john burton
d-san francisco
davis opposes burton's bill because it gives bond buyers priority in getting paid
followed by the energy suppliers
the power companies
contracts contain provisions giving them payment priority
which davis believes could throw the contracts into legal dispute
if davis signs the order soon
the bonds could go to market early next year
having the proceeds in the state treasury by then is considered by some critical with the state facing a projected $0 billion to $0 billion shortfall in other income

eldon and nancy
here's the wsj editorial by scott simon--long-time npr dude
credentialed lib
and quaker--on
just wars
sort of thought-provoking
best
jeff commentary even pacifists must support this war by scott simon
the host of national public radio's
weekend edition with scott simon
pacifists often commit the same mistake as generals
they prepare for the last war
not the next one
many of the peace activists i have seen trying to rouse opposition to today's war against terrorism remind me of a halloween parade
they put on old
familiar-looking protest masks
against american imperialism
oppression and violence
that bear no resemblance to the real demons haunting us now
pacifism has never been exactly popular
but when i became a quaker as an adolescent in the late 0s
pacifism seemed to offer a compelling alternative to the perpetuity of brute force
mahatma gandhi had overthrown an empire and martin luther king had overturned a racial tyranny with nonviolent marches
fasts
and boycotts that were nervy
ennobling and effective
pacifism seemed to offer a chance for survival to a generation that had been stunted by the fear of nuclear extinction
i worked as a war reporter
but i never saw a conflict between this and being a quaker
if my reporting was sometimes drawn more to human details than to the box-score kind of war coverage
those details struck me as critical to explaining war
i never covered a conflict
whether in central america
the caribbean
africa or the middle east
that seriously shook my religious convictions
in fact
most conflicts seemed to prove how war was rotten
wasteful and useless
el salvador's civil war killed 0,0 people over nine years
it was hard to see how the political compromise that ended the conflict could not have been reached after just six months
but in the 0s
i covered the balkans
in sarajevo
srebrenica
and kosovo
i confronted the logical flaw
or perhaps i should say the fatal flaw
of nonviolent resistance
all the best people can be killed by all the worst ones
i had never believed that pacifism had all the answers
neither does militarism
about half of all draft age quakers enlisted in world war ii
believing that whatever wisdom pacifism had to give the world
it could not defeat the murderous schemes of adolf hitler and his cohorts
it seems to me that in confronting the forces that attacked the world trade center and the pentagon
american pacifists have no sane alternative now but to support war
i don't consider this reprisal or revenge
but self-defense
protecting the world from further attacks by destroying those who would launch them
some peace activists
their judgment still hobbled by shock
seem to believe that the attacks against new york and washington were natural disasters
terrible
unpredictable whirlwinds that struck once and will not reoccur
this is wrong
we know now that there has been an ongoing violent campaign aimed at bringing down diverse nations
with none being more gloriously speckled than the u.s
people who try to hold certain american policies or culture responsible are trying to decorate the crimes of psychotics with synthetic political significance
in 0 the oxford student union conducted a famous debate over whether it was moral for britons to fight for king and country
the exquisite intellects of that leading university reviewed the many ways in which british colonialism exploited and oppressed the world
they cited the ways in which vengeful demands made of germany in the wake of world war i had helped to kindle nationalism and fascism
they saw no moral difference between western colonialism and world fascism
the oxford union ended that debate with this famous proclamation
resolved
that we will in no circumstances fight for king and country
von ribbentrop sent back the good news to germany's new chancellor
hitler
the west will not fight for its own survival
its finest minds will justify a silent surrender
in short
the best-educated young people of their time could not tell the difference between the deficiencies of their own nation
in which liberty and democracy were cornerstones
and a dictatorship founded on racism
tyranny and fear
and what price would those who urge reconciliation today pay for peace
should americans impose a unitary religious state
throw women out of school and work
and rob other religious groups of their rights
so that we have the kind of society the attackers accept
do pacifists really want to live in the kind of world that the terrorists who hit the world trade center and pentagon would make
pacifists do not need any lectures about risking their lives to stop wickedness
quakers resisted slavery by smuggling out slaves when even abraham lincoln tried to appease the confederacy
pacifists sneaked refugee jews out of germany when england and the u.s
were still trying to placate hitler
many conscientious objectors have served bravely in gritty and unglamorous tasks that aided the u.s
in time of war
but those of us who have been pacifists must admit that it has been our blessing to live in a nation in which other citizens have been willing to risk their lives to defend our dissent
the war against terrorism does not shove american power into places where it has no place
it calls on america's military strength in a global crisis in which peaceful solutions are not apparent
only american
and british
power can stop more killing in the world's skyscrapers
pizza parlors
embassies
bus stations
ships
and airplanes
pacifists
like most americans
would like to change their country in a thousand ways
and the blasts of sept
0 should remind american pacifists that they live in that one place on the planet where change
in fact
peaceful change
seems most possible
it is better to sacrifice our ideals than to expect others to die for them

my understanding is that the puc has denied the applications for rehearing
there's a group that is fixing to take it to the court of appeals level--can't see any downside
a
argument is that the puc erred in its decisionmaking--no record
no facts
no evidence
etc
and that it needs to go back to the drawing board and get the process right before it suspends anything--and b
the heavy-lifting was already done getting the app
for rehrng prepared

in response to the commission's suspension of da
numerous market participants--including enron--filed
petitions for rehearing
the california puc has issued a decision denying the petitions
many of those participants are likely to file for appellate court review of the commission's denial
in its decision denying the petitions
the commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects
key among those is a modification regarding facility adds
those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit dasrs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to september 0th that provide for facility adds
the commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept dasrs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 0.0.0
the precise language is cited below
if you would like a copy of the decision
please contact joseph alamo
best
jeff
we reaffirm that for the time being
and unless the commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision
utilities are required to process dasrs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before september 0th
0
including dasrs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those dasrs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service

for example
with respect to the specific esp contract described by uc/csu in their rehearing application
the utilities are required to accept
even after september 0

a little background
recaps briefly what we discussed on the phone on monday
a few weeks ago
we
government affairs
approached john fielder of edison to see if there was any chance that edison might be willing to reach a deal on our negative ctc/px credit claim
after discussions with rac
we offered to take 0 cents on the dollar for amounts owed through march 0
there's general agreement with edison on what the number is up to january 0
which would only leave 0.0--0.0 in dispute
but recall there's still the ferc refund issue which complicates the issue
we asked for 0% down immediately and a binding agreement that edison would pay us by a date certain sometime in the next quarter
in exchange
we said we'd drop our law suits at the puc
in one suit
we're asking the puc to have edison pay us
in the other
we've stopped paying edison for transportation costs until the puc gets edison to pay us
we're depositing what we owe edison in an escrow account pending resolution
we also agreed to work with edison to get the puc to end the whole residual ctc/px credit framework retroactive to march 0
0
that would reduce edison's exposure to negative ctc and our exposure to positive ctc
for his part
fielder was looking
in addition
for 0
an agreement on our part to forebear
and 0
an agreement that everyone
including da customers
should pay what they rightly owe for a
edison's undercollection
b
the bonds
and c
dwr's stranded contract costs
we never resumed the talks in earnest because soon after our talk
edison struck its bailout deal with the puc
with respect to what else we could offer them
from a commercial standpoint
i'm sure you're scouring that front
and i may not have much to add
but given the credit risk associated with the utility and edison's other subs
devising a commercial option to help settle the negative ctc claim seems like a challenge
one possible avenue might be the $0 mm in hedging activity the puc agreed to in its bailout settlement with edison
edison is authorized to hedge its generation and qf fuel costs for up to $0 mm under the settlement
but this would expose us to puc regulatory risk
in addition to edison's credit risk
another commercial angle might be mission energy
but again
not sure how much better mission fares from a credit perspective
one idea that we've bounced around that might appeal to edison--but may or may not be appealing to us--us is to agree to take a note from edison
that is
in return for 0 cents on the dollar
we'd agree to take
for example
a 0-year note at some agreed to coupon
this should appeal to edison since 0
it takes us off the list of folks who might take them in
0
it might provide a useful template that edison could use with other creditors
and 0
it lessens the overall financing edison needs to arrange
bridge loan
etc
in the near-term to pay its creditors
the
note
angle could be packaged up with the other regulatory issues explored in the first call with fielder
hope this helps
best
jeff
cool
if $0 don't cut it on the check

all other ideas

are welcome
we'll set up a recurring call-in number

i.e
same number every week
it will be assumed that everyone will call in
no pre-meeting prep necessary
if someone doesn't call in
it will be assumed that the person has a conflict and can't make it

if so

mike
comments looks good
my only comment is that
in our view
the price cap
which would cover all capacity in the secondary market
is simply bad economic policy and won't address any problems--in fact it will only create problems
from a practical perspective
i'm not even sure that the commission can successfully
regulate
prices in the secondary market
will the commission change the price cap provisions of the decision based comments advising against them
very unlikely
but when the caps create problems
and they will
i want to have been on record advising the commission of why caps are bad economic policy and pointing out the bad outcomes that caps will cause
i think that it's very important to point out the downside of caps and to be on record against them
that said
i don't want the comments to be so negative as to cloud support for the decision
nor do i think the commission will change the cap based on our comments
other than that
ees and ena can sign on
anyone have any objections to pointing out the fact that price caps are ill-advised
best

state lowers estimate of energy costs consumers might see rates decrease lynda gledhill
chronicle sacramento bureau saturday
october 0
0
0 san francisco chronicle url
sacramento
the state lowered its estimate yesterday of how much it will cost to buy power
suggesting that lower rates could eventually be the result
officials of the department of water resources said the state will need $0
0 billion to buy power through the end of 0
about 0 percent less than previously estimated
the agency began buying power on jan
0 when the state's three investor
owned utilities were no longer considered credit-worthy
at the time
prices on the spot market reached upwards of $0 a megawatt hour
now
however
prices average $0 a megawatt hour
circumstances have changed
said ron nichols of navigant consulting
which is a consultant to the department of water resources
conservation has helped
we think the dwr contracts have established reliability in the market
we have broken the back of the spot market
earlier this year
the state signed 0 long-term contracts with various generators to purchase power
those contracts
which were inked when prices were at their peak
have come under increasing fire from lawmakers and the puc
and gov
gray davis
administration acknowledged this week it hopes to renegotiate some of the pacts
but the contracts represent only about a third of the power the state needs every day
the rest comes from the spot market
purchases made just a few minutes or hours ahead of when they are needed
prices on the spot market have dropped
in part because the price of natural gas has taken a nose dive
it is unclear whether consumers will see any benefit from the lower power costs
if the projections hold
the state could either lower rates or scale back plans to issue $0.0 billion in bonds needed to pay for the energy purchases
at the same time state energy buyers trumpeted lower costs
they blasted the state public utilities commission for a decision that they say could cost residential and small business consumers $0 billion
administration officials and state treasurer phil angelides said a puc decision to delay the suspension of direct access
the ability of large businesses to bypass utilities and contract directly with generators for power
will shift higher costs to smaller customers
the puc proposed the ban on direct access in june but didn't adopt the policy until sept
0
during that period
the amount of energy large consumers contracted for through direct access increased from 0 percent to 0 percent
what's happened here is one of the most damaging things that has happened to consumers during the energy crisis
angelides said yesterday
he urged the puc to reverse its decision
setting the date back to july 0
but lorretta lynch
president of the puc
said the delay was at the request of the administration and the legislature
she also objected to angelides
numbers
saying that the puc estimates the direct access load at 0 percent
the commission is awaiting a legal opinion about whether it can make its decision retroactive to july 0
and action will be taken at the next puc meeting
she said
sorry
haven't been around
i definitely want to move forward
i'll respond more fully if more is needed
but the short of it is
i'd like to do the entire job except for the decking
ready to start when you are
can you tell me what you expect the total to be
labor + materials
understanding that it's an estimate and not a firm price
also
i'm assuming that the cost for the materials that you quoted include the
bridge
to the cabin
will
of course
want the bridge to the cabin planked
if you have any questions
let me know
really appreciate your efforts
looking forward to getting started
hope all finds you well

more or less

every wednesday at 0:0 pm

which is a government affairs-only call
those are it
if there's anything else
just let me know
best
jeff
i'm sure that by now everyone's seen the letter that angelides sent to loretta last friday
if you haven't
let me know and i'll have it faxed to you
in short
angelides blames all of the financial woes of the state on loretta and the puc
specifically
he claims that by allowing da sign-ups to extend to september 0th
the puc may have shifted over $0 billion to
homeowners
small businesses
and other enterprises
angelides ends the lettery by urging the commission to immediately roll back the da suspension date to july 0
the concern
of course
is that angelides
assertions are out there and have received alot of press attention
i.e
direct access=$0 billion tax on homeowners
to her credit
loretta refuted angelides in the press accounts and repeated that the best way to get costs down is to renegotiate the dwr contracts
she also said in the press accounts that she intends to deal with the july 0/september 0 suspension issue at the next commission meeting
in light of these events
and the increasing attacks on loretta by angelides and others in the administration
it might be useful to give loretta an assist by drafting a very brief letter to her stating
angelides is all wet--da and
fairness
are not mutually exclusive and the puc has all the regulatory tools necessary to ensure fairness is maintained going forward
thus
the 0 plus billion dollar number is without basis
re-stating that the puc has no legal authority to retroactively suspend da to july 0
etc
etc
folks may have other points to make
seems that we'd want to keep the letter short and to the point
however
a letter might be useful in order to 0
give loretta some support and 0
get some counter-press in response to the angelides tantrum
any thoughts
best
jeff
i'll be on
fyi
sure you've seen it
but just in case
non-energy-related friend of mine emailed it to me

sec looking into possible conflict on interest at enron by stephen taub the securities and exchange commission has requested that enron provide information regarding certain related party transactions
we welcome this request
said kenneth l
lay
enron chairman and ceo in a prepared statement
we will cooperate fully with the sec
enron
north america's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity
noted that its internal and external auditors and attorneys reviewed the related party arrangements
the board was fully informed of and approved these arrangements

we believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done

the big 0 professional services firm will report that revenues rose by 0.0 percent to $0.0 billion for the year
in fiscal 0
revenues climbed by 0.0 percent

the reason for the drop in revenue growth may be that e&y fetches most of its business from the united states

we have been successful this year
despite the economy and during a period of great challenge and change in our profession

another reason for e&y's revenue retrenchment
the strong dollar
the firm is expected to announce that revenues increased 0.0 percent in local currency terms
according to the paper
turley told the ft that his clients are less focused on the longer term and are instead concentrating on watching expenses
cash management
debt covenant issues

we're going to see more covenant violations and that will drive restructuring issues

power authority faces legislative backlash after a three-month honeymoon
the new california power authority is being shredded in the winds of politics this week with the legislature looking into its deals
the california energy commission annoyed with its monopolizing ventures and the department of water resources rebuffing its plan to sell its power through state contracts
other than skepticism from legislative staff about its microturbine bid plan
the power authority escaped major problems in its requests for bids for photovoltaics and fuel cells at
0
0
assembly to investigate power authority
from
0
is the california power authority a dangerously out-of-control state agency
or is it the best hope for get-ting back some state control over electricity supplies
the joint legislative audit committee is looking into the power authority's role thus far in carrying out the letter and spirit of sbx0-0 in a hearing set for november 0
the move is spearheaded by the offices of assem-blymember fred keeley
d-boulder creek
the chair of the joint committee
and assembly speaker bob authors of the power authority's enabling legisla-tion
sbx0-0
legislative staff are questioning the energy foundation's unpaid role in devel-oping the power authority's requests for bids
particularly the rfb for microtur-bines
only one com-pany
capstone
can meet the requirement written into the rbf by the energy foundation
and staff are looking into potential overlaps between capstone and the energy foundation
political maneuvers are swirling around the con-sumer power and conservation financing authority
not only elected officials are concerned
the staff and heads of other agencies the power authority must work with are digging in their collective heels to op-pose power authority overtures
tom hannigan
di-rector of the department of water resources rebuffed power authority board chair david freeman's pro-posal to have it buy peaker output
california energy commission members said they are at policy odds with the power authority's siting plans
in an october 0 letter to freeman
hannigan said that the power authority's power-wind and fossil peakers-is likely too expensive
overblown and not able to respond quickly enough to balancing power needs
the letters of intent already approved by the power authority could far exceed
dwr's
ability to ab-sorb that power given the outlook for net-short need
freeman assumes that the market for power authority power will be via contract
not the spot market
selling on the spot market is difficult to finance and risky
said power authority spokesperson amber pasricha
the power authority is the only agency cur-rently in the position of actually being able to acquire new energy as the state's $0.0 billion bond issue to underwrite continued dwr power purchases is in limbo and the california independent system operator is still not creditworthy
still
the power authority cannot issue bonds until it has its own economic house in order
and an assembly investigation might jeopardize that
j.a
savage
0-ish percent
fyi
note below that even the mighty and powerful power authority's own crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short
despite dwr contracts and da
stampede
which should leave one to believe that
contrary to angelides
letter
the more the da the better
which further supports loretta lynch's response to the angelides
letter that da reduces the amount of spot power dwr has to buy

jeff consumer power and conservation financing authority pace of power authority renewable portfolio agenda is slowed quite possibly the most significant action taken at the october 0 consumer power and conservation financing authority
power authority
was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval
the power authority has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio
with the intent to approve contracts as soon as possible
instead of approving a number of contracts on its october 0 agenda
the power authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until its november 0 meeting
acknowledging that no action can be taken until the department of water resources
dwr
rate agreement stalemate has been resolved
chairman freeman stated that the public utility commission's rejection of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the power authority to exercise renewable contracts
to contract for peaker generation and/or to implement demand side programs
the power authority relies upon dwr's credit to fund these programs
and until a rate agreement is finalized the power authority cannot sign contracts
freeman indicated that the power authority has signed letters of intent to purchase output from 0 biomass facilities in the central valley
as well as 0 mw generated by wind
with the current glut of contracts
why do we need additional reserves
kellan flukinger
senior advisor to chairman freeman and laura doll
provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the power authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation
flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of electricity supplied in long-term contracts
there still appears to be a net short of a few thousand megawatts within the state
flukinger concluded that the state still is at the mercy of electric generators who are not subject to puc regulatory authority and who have no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve customers within the state
he believes that the short-term contracts and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply shortages
he believes that the reserve can be managed through time-of-use and real-time-pricing

contracry to herr angelides

da was about 0.0% of load
on february 0 it was 0.0%
best
jeff
this is true
good point
fyi
here's a note i sent to the large customers
have spoken with them since
they are going to write a nasty letter in response to angelides
also
it does not appear that the puc can act at this meeting on the retroactivity issue--appears that due process/notice requirements prevents it
we're double checking to make sure
best
jeff
congratulations
just more evidence that regulation moves with lightening speed
i'd like to do everything but the decking for the deck
we can hold off on that
in addition
i may have some
salvaged
redwood decking i may want to add to the mix once i get ready to install the decking

jeff
thanks for the cc
nice touch
chalk up another one for the good guys
best
jeff
fyi
please keep confidential and do not circulate
this is just the first draft of a letter we're working with the large customers on in response the angelides tantrum
only the large customers will sign
however
i'll forward the final when they've completed it
sue's working on arm to do something akin from the suppliers side
best
jeff
great question
if you think it would be useful
i can back channel to loretta and find out
i'm of the view that this letter is more to refute angelides
so that his wild assertions don't go unanswered in the court of public opinion
perhaps the letter should be addressed to angelides
instead
on the other hand
i think it is also useful to make it known to the press and the public that the puc has the regulatory tools
processes
etc
necessary to permit customers broad latitude to manage their own energy needs on the one hand
and ensure that there's not the sort of massive cost-shifting to which angelides refers on the other
in the public's view this has been painted as an either/or issue
either we end direct access
or granny faces death and destruction
and that's just not the case
in fact
i think it can be argued that the scenario angelides paints just isn't in the cards
period
but i may be missing the mark with all this and am open to other views
let me know if you'd like me to find out if loretta thinks the letter would help her
could find that out in pretty short order
best
jeff
confidential
please don't distribute
evie's concerned that this letter might not be welcomed by or useful to loretta
i think it would be
but would be useful to have your/loretta's views
let me know
best
jeff
i should be able to find out something by this afternoon
or tomorrow am at the latest
i'll get back to you as soon as i hear something
jeff
thank you
i would have said
governor turkey
give me 0 dates
very soon
and promise that you won't cancel
change
modify
reschedule
delay
postpone
or amend
i'll find out which one works
when you leaving for nyc
the movie sounded very funny
from the riotous laughter i heard
and those menus really do look good--maybe you could get by by giving your mom that piece of things
with your ok
of course
and that would make her feel like she's got a chunk of the event and it could leave you guys with the freedom to do all the other stuff
just a thought
i'm very excited but not altogether hungry

thanks very much for the update
can you email the most recent version of the qf buy-out presentation
i want to forward it to tom beach

nice company
putting you up for 0 days at the waldorf
i love that neighborhood
anywho
i'll check those dates and get back to you
talked to someone at the puc
and i'll be talking to additional folks over there
question
do we know what volumes through blythe have been
one thing that might be happening is that socal's restricting flows at topock in order to ensure minimum volumes through blythe
best
jeff
didn't listen to all of it
but sounds like they ain't making a heckuvalot of progress with edision on getting paid or getting the 0.0 cents put in place
hi brad
i finally got in touch with the people from perfect
they'll be in houston on the 0th and the 0nd of november
either of those days work for you
if so
any time preference
best
jeff
fyi
i ran into bryson last friday
he told me
insisted
in fact
that edison was paying everyone in february
he told me
insisted
again
that they would have all necessary approvals from the puc in the next several weeks
he said that once those approvals are in place
they'll quickly get financing in place to ensure a february payment date--for everyone
i said that was great news but that the market didn't seem quite as certain
he was pretty firm
he also said that it was too late for anyone to take them into bankruptcy involuntarily
that a judge wouldn't go for it
did you know if lay every talk to bryson
best
jeff
quck question
w.r.t
to the stipulation with edison
0
do we care that d
douglas will know what our claim
or proposed settlement amount is
i.e
do we prefer that dan sign a confidentiality agreement
0
when we file the stipulation at the commission
do we care that the universe will see the number
i.e
do we prefer to file any such stipulation under seal at the commission
not sure if this matters whatsoever
but it might
who's the person that needs to answer these questions
best

paul
got your voice mail regarding anthony pescetti running for a ferc seat
here are some quick thoughts
sue likely has some additional experiences and information to share
be happy to discuss further
republican assemblymember from the sacramento area
was a member of the sacramento muni utility district prior to going to the legislature
republican
minority
head of the assembly electricity oversight committee
the one that rod wright chairs
don't recall that he's ever seen a a pro-utility bill that he didn't like
in fact
he sponsored some legislation just this past session that would have locked the utilities in to major parts of the gas industry
and specifically wold have locked out competition
it was strongly opposed by industry and defeated
when push came to shove
i can't think of a time he didn't side with the utilities
even when the assembly republicans were doing of good job of bottling up davis
ridiculous bailout bills in rod wright's committee
pescetti seemed to go along more to tweek the democrats than to foster competition
and even then
he followed
he didn't lead--other
more junior
members on the committee led
can't recall a time that he's been there for us
i'd be happy to talk with him
but if we need someone at the rick level to contact him
that's great
too
just let me know
best
jeff
greetings
hope all's going well in your new venture
or semi-new venture at this point
you finishing this semester

i was reading this press account and was wondering if you new this fellow when you were at lehman
if so
any insights
sort of an interesting career path

jeff california power authority taps sfpuc's berry as new cfo san francisco
bill berry will soon leave his job with san francisco's public utility commission to head up finances for california
s newly formed power authority
which is authorized to issue $0 billion in revenue bonds
the board of the california consumer power and conservation financing authority on friday selected berry as its first chief financial officer
he will start in his new position in early november
the authority was established earlier this year as a result of the state's energy crisis
and is charged with promoting energy conservation efforts and increasing california
s capacity to generate electricity
berry is currently the assistant general manager of finance and administration at the utility commission
which provides water and sewer services to the city and some neighboring counties
as well as hydroelectric power for san francisco government operations
berry has been at the sfpuc since 0
overseeing finance
personnel and training
information technology
and customer service
he also helped develop the commission's long-range strategic plan and 0-year capital improvement program
which may eventually entail requests for voters to approve more than $0 billion in bonds
berry worked for a start-up internet company in palo alto from 0 to 0 before joining the commission
from 0 to 0
berry was an investment banker at lehman brothers in san francisco
specializing in financing municipal and state-owned power

figures that the commissioner's wife is in on it
isn't that always the way it is

not just any jock strap
maybe you could model a few and i can pick one
don't want it to clash with the furniture

me again
you thought about having your guy jack
who's likely got the most juice of anyone in the group
go to the governor and tell him to tell angelides to knock it off and to back off

what do you think about sending the letter directly to angelides--after all
he's the one who's being a chowder head--and cc'ing loretta

i talked to john fielder
svp edison
about setting up a meeting for barry tycholiz with edison's cfo about hedging edison's qf price risk
fielder wanted to talk about the negative ctc issue
here's what he said
they plan to
settle
with the esps and pay them when they pay everyone else
which he re-iterated would be sometime in q0'0
edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative ctc contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the esp's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative ctc and owed the esp
he said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways
0
lump sum netting
i.e
if they owe $0mm and the share of the undercollection is $0 mm
then they pay the esp $0 mm
or 0
future reductions in px credit
i.e
they pay the esp $0 mm
and then reduce the px going forward until the $0 mm is paid down
the numbers are illustrative only
in addition
he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 0
whether da customers pay for stranded costs tied to the dwr l-t contracts
and 0
whether da customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the qf contracts
edison is clearly lobbying the puc to get da customers to pay for these costs
i recommended strongly that he de-link issues 0 and 0 above from the issue of paying us asap what they owe us for negative ctc
he agreed
he said that the puc judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that edison
meet and confer
with esps prior to the nov
0th hearing
and that edison intends to set something up with esps prior to that hearing
fielder is also the point person on
getting esps paid
and intends to initiate settlement discussions with esps week after next
it was very clear from the conversation that edison is going to do everything possible
at the expense of creditors
to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the puc a few weeks ago
edison's stalemate with the qfs is evidence of it
we shouldn't assume anything different with the negative ctc issue
if you have any questions
let us know
best
jeff
apologies
don't know how in the heck i missed you on the list
you know just clawing and backstabbing my way to the top
anywho
here's the note that i just sent
let me know if there's anyone else that i embarassingly missed
best
jeff
dan
is this also information that you'd like to be kept apprised of
just let me know
best
jeff
wanda
i faxed the examples that edison faxed us and that you and michael and i talked about some time back
i'm sure that's how edison would calculate it
does it make sense to run the numbers and see what our
contribution
to edison's undercollection would be under edison's view
if you need another copy
let me know
question
i don't know what our book looks like on this issue
but if we were to take the
netting
through a reduction in the px credit going forward
how much of a hit would that be
particularly if we were to get the $0 mm up front
best
jeff
thank you
please let michael know that we'll be coming in business casual attire
hope that's ok
best
jeff
fyi
talked to edison about getting a meeting with craver
they're going to get back to me
best
jeff
edison did not bring up the refund issue at all
doesn't mean that they won't
though
agree on the ab 0 issue
the clock stops in march of
0
best
jeff
do we run the risk of them saying
enron
on average your customers represented 0% of the load
therefore you owe us 0% of the undercollection
or $0b * 0.0 = $0m
that's my biggest concern
thoughts
need to think about it a bit
here's some of what we know based on the settlement
after they contribute all cash on their books and agree to eat a little
the puc is allowing them to collect somewhere between $0.0-0.0b--depends on who you talk to
the total owed to esps is $0 mm
sorry i missed your call
thanks very much
wanted to make sure that i had the correct copies for release
best
jeff
here's what i'll do
i'll go back and look at the materials they sent us
maybe you could do the same
so at least we have an idea of what they'll claim our
contribution
is
best
jeff
ps ask me how tired of this bleeping issue i am
hang in there
under angelides flawed reasoning
shouldn't energy efficiency be outlawed
since every kilowatt saved means less money to pay dwr for the contracts and the bonds to fill the hole in the state budget
why pick on da
best
jeff
i asked mike day to make sure that we were kept in the distribution loop on this stuff
best
jeff
does martha approve of aloe vera
i'll give you a call and fax you some materials that edison uses to justify their position

it's baldwin
let me know what dates you want to meet and i'll set it up

i'll set it up
this firday is not good
i'll shoot for monday or tuesday

what's your fax number

it's on its way
i'll give you a call
or give me a call when you've had a chance to look at it
i'll include steve swain on the fax
sounds good
greetings
thanks for talking the other day
quick question
are the minimum flows at blythe set in the bcap
presumably
socal's 0% at risk for the flows/dollars once they're set
or is there some proportionate sharing
and what's the sharing
if any on the upside
if i'm missing something
or don't have this right
let me know
best
jeff
talked to pescetti yesterday
prior to returning my call
he had received the information that joe kelliher had already been appointed to the open republican spot
and therefore understands that there's no longer a republican seat to run for
we had a good talk
i told him that reinstating da was the most important energy issue facing california
best
jeff
could you forward the gas daily article
thanks
jeff
u still in dc
jeff
could you make sure that whomever's doing the letter to the california ds gets a copy to me and sue
want to keep the family happy
don't you know
thanks a million
boy do we need the cash from that merger
please hurry
best
jeff
you know what is more recently
reason i ask is that in the past
when volumes have been low
socal's had to
prop up
flows
i.e
keep a minimum at blythe for
operational reasons
to serve san diego
they said
so
just to give them the benefit of the doubt
i was wondering if there might be something to that recently
pure speculation
but wondering if you had any info
because i certainly can't think of any other reason for their behavior
i'm calling another puc staffer today to discuss
in the meantime
are we continuing to make the request to socal for service
might be a good idea to keep doing that
best
jeff
yes
i called him yesterday after the call and filled him in on all the details
so he's up to speed
but feel free to forward
best
jeff also
didn't want to put in the note
but i got the impression from fielder that he's not real keen on extending the stipulation
but i think we should push it
if for no other reason than to keep the puc out of it
u get message from tribolet

px credit call at 0 pm

thanks

i'll assume that we'll meet at 0:0-0:0 at the front desk to coordinate a little bit

calif resells surplus power at a loss in second quarter los angeles
dow jones
the california agency buying power in lieu of the state's ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of $0 a megawatt-hour
the agency said wednesday
the announcement by the california department of water resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as $0 a megawatt-hour because it secured too much electricity under long-term contracts negotiated by the administration of gov
gray davis
the department said
in a press release
the department's california energy resources scheduling division
its power-marketing arm
said it resold 0,0 megawatt-hours
or 0.0% of its total purchases
that power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts
not the long-term contracts
the department said
such sales are typical of any power-buying operation
as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways
the department said
the dwr is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the state's three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own long-term contracts
or about one-third of the total
according to the dwr
power secured under davis
long-term contracts covers one-third to one-half of the electricity it must supply
short-term deals
such as monthly or quarterly contracts
represent one-third of the portfolio
the rest is bought in the spot market
the state has put its average cost of power under the long-term contracts at 0.0 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first five years and 0.0 cents per kilowatt-hour for the next five years
davis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices
similarly
the department of water resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices
the dwr releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position
the department said
the dwr buys power for customers of pg&e corp

jeff
those were rick's and steffe's
i was never sure where they came from and didn't use them
per se
we can talk more about it
sue will take the lead on the arm filing
let's discuss further the idea of a separate enron filing--pros and cons to each
sue and jeanne bennett discussed and thought coalition filings would be preferable
but let's talk about it
best
jeff
fyi
the california ag has announced that he is investigating conflict of interest charges against consultants who were involved with arranging dwr's long term power contracts
may be part of davis
attempt to
re-negotiate
the contracts
there's been some assertions that
under california law
any contracts negotiated by consultants with financial conflict of interests must be nullified
didn't work
was it in yesterday's gas daily
if so
i can access it
thanks very much for your help

sorry about that
i'll get back to you with some other dates
jim
let jeremy know that there will be some big dogs
i.e
large customers
coming out with guns a'blazin
on this and that we're working closely with them
also
sue and i discussed
and we can't see any reason why we wouldn't want very long
very dragged out hearings on this
the longer the issue drags on
the more exposed dwr will be
the greater the likelihood of dwr contract negotiation
and the tougher it will be to drag the suspension date back to july 0
in addition
hearings would
finally
force dwr to answer some questions---this time under oath
and possibly with the press present
which would be very beneficial--i'm talking to other folks to try to get loretta make that happen
either of you see any reason why we wouldn't want to have hearings
best
jeff
thanks very much
i'll try to subscribe again
hey
forgive me for being a snoop

hey
i can't find steve kelly's email
can you forward this to him
i'm not interested
but is it more

which game is it
you're fired
seems like something iep would certaintly be way out in front on

last experience with the puc's planning process
seems like they'd aggressively go after its return in a very big way
trying again
best
jeff
prentice will call you
the generators are going to go nuts over this
they'll do all the pounding needed on their own
calpine will likely lead the charge
which should be interesting
how do the 0th or 0th of november work
baldwin's traveling--meeting with dwr today
but he knows we want to meet and knows the days we're talking about--left a message with his secretary
i suspect that
if dwr is free on either monday or tuesday
we'll be meeting
followed up with fielder this morning
he's at an off-site all day and is supposed to call me back cob today
he knows we want to meet with craver and offered to set it up
if he hasn't got it scheduled when i talk to him
i'll go directly to craver
i'll hopefully have things more set in stone by end of today or tomorrow by noon
that work
best
jeff
i'll contact lydia and you'll have materials well in advance of the meeting
hi lydia
could you let me know what time in the afternoon of november 0th works with brad's schedule
will need 0 minutes
thanks very much for your help
best
jeff
it's going to be sometime in the afternoon on the 0th
nice job
in line with your letter
and in response to wood's questionnaire about rolling the suspension date back to july 0
don't you think it is absolutely necessary to have hearings in order to establish a record prior to any decision
wood throws around the $0 billion number in his questionnaire
ruling
whatever
without any substantiation whatsoever
shouldn't dwr and its rev
req
be thoroughly scrutinized in the hearing room before making a decision
seems logical though 0

with respect to past due px credit amounts
edison has told folks today that
edison will distribute a one-pager by mid-day tomorrow laying out its proposal for how to handle payment of past due px credit amounts
edison is trying to meet individually with all esps prior to the nov
0th prehearing conference at the puc to discuss and hopefully reach agreement with esps on its proposal
edison hopes to make progress with the esps between now and the nov
0th prehearing conference
and if so
intends to tell the judge that the puc should delay action on the complaints pending settlement
we'll distribute edison's proposal as soon as we get it
best
jeff
couple of additional pieces of information
in conjunction with the issue paying esps past due px amounts
edison has affirmed that it will be making a proposal regarding how it wants to calculate the px credit going forward
it remains unclear whether edison will try to fold controversial issues into negotiations on getting paid past due px credit amounts
e.g
px credit contributed to undercollection and therefore da customers should help pay down the undercollection
da customers must pay for stranded dwr contracts
etc
so while edison is making good noises about wanting to settle
which is a certainly a step in the right direction
it's still unclear whether they intend to attach terms to the deal that make the whole thing a nonstarter
got a call into john fielder to try to get answers to some of these questions
will report back when
and if
we get some answers
best
jeff
fielder's traveling today
left him a long message on his voicemail and asked him to get back to me as soon as he gets a chance
best
jeff
steve
been wanting to drop you a line to say
hang in there
you're a remarkable individual
and it's great working with you
as far as i'm concerned--and there are many with a similar view--i'm ready to do whatever it takes to help turn things around
you can count on that
now if we can just find something left to turn around
kidding
if there's anything you need
please don't hesitate to let me know
please give my regards to ken
best
jeff
i'm only coming if molly comes as martha
thank you
the call was pretty tough
quick side bar
edison is very concerned about turn getting a stay from the court on the eix/puc settlement
at the start of the call
fielder said that he'd fax me the judge's ruling in the turn appeal
but based on how the call went
i'm not sure if he'll send it
as we conjectured sometime back
edison is indeed talking about charging us
through a reduced px credit
for our
share
of the undercollection
our
share
would be paid down through a reduction in the px credit over the life of the settlement
presumably about 0-0 years
in short
with one hand edison would pay us what they owe us
with the other hand
edison would take it back
edison intends
as we conjectured
to base the amount of the undercollection owed by da customers on the percentage of load they represent
e.g
if da is
was
0% of the load
they would pay for 0% of the undercollection
we had a very
animated
discussion that went back and forth for some time
i told him that there's been some gross misunderstanding since his proposal simply doesn't track
fielder said that they believe their argument is solid
here's how we left it--he's going to get back to us by cob today or tomorrow and tell us what edison's calculation is of our
share
of the undercollection
we can discuss further on the call that wanda's setting up for tomorrow
if you have any questions between now and then
give a holler
best
jeff
fyi
martin may be interested

well
we had the right person handling the call
that's for sure

i am leaning toward cancelling
i was originally only going to participate on monday anyway

neither rick nor jim can attend
if there's a compelling reason that you think i should attend
let me know
otherwise i'll let bev know that we'll take a rain check on this one

however
my fiancee
prentice sellers
who got her mba from haas last may
is actively looking for work at an interesting place
i wanted to let you know that she has applied for a position at the consulting firm that you're affiliated with
forgive the less-than-objective plug
but she's extremely bright and talented and did very well at haas
prior to attending haas
she worked at lecg
where she was highly praised for her work and consistently got rave reviews
she'd be a valuable asset to the firm and is worth giving a serious look

on another note
i thought the hoover conference was extremely good
you and sweeney did a great job
what was your impression
i've noticed that it got some decent press
best
jeff
it was good to see you
no thanks needed
i'm pretty sure that i can get you the info on the plants--it's in the contracts and i'm fairly certain that we have that analysis
how'd the meeting with pg&e go
you get back to houston ok

got the fax
thank you
i saw the letter from peace to calpers
as far as i know
peace can't force calpers to do anything
including file a shareholder suit
therefore
i'm not sure if we gain anything by responding
or taking other action
thoughts
best
jeff
i'm not positive
the best way to find out is to call the public advisor at the puc directly
he'll be happy to fill you in on how to get on the list of speakers
and i'm sure it's very easy to do
i'll definitely give you a heads up regarding the wednesday calls
though they've really wound down alot since the legislature took off for vacation
hope all is well
best to you and yours
jeff
good plan
thanks
anyone there you would recommend as a point of contact/entry
best
jeff
got your message
as soon as i get a hold of williams--not sure where he is--we'll have the call
hopefully we can do it within the next 0 minutes or so
that work for you
and when it happens
i can conference folks in using my phone
what's your direct dial

jeff p.s
sanity is a good thing
thanks
talk to you soon
thanks very much for helping aida
bob's secretary called to tell me that bob's at a doctor's appt and will be back in the office around noon houston time
we'll shoot for around noon cst to have the call
i'll conference folks in from my phone
best
jeff
we need to start figuring out as soon as possible
what we want to accomplish at the hearing
what our posture/message will be
what to expect from the judge/commissioner and if and how we want to respond
what to expect from others and if and how we want to be prepared to respond
how to coordinate with other parties prior to the prehearing conference
how to ensure we're well coordinated with our other efforts
e.g
pg&e bankruptcy and edison negotiations
sue and i can take the call from this end
and presumably mike and jeanne you can team up in a room on your end
so we can conference everyone in using our phones
please let me know if this works for everyone
thanks a bunch

customer choice can boost
green power
use-study
new york

reuters
giving consumers more energy supply choices could boost use of cleaner electricity sources by 0 percent by the end of the decade
regardless of whether the market is deregulated
a federal study said
but there's a catch
while 0 percent of u.s
electricity already comes from hydro and another 0 percent comes from wind
solar and geothermal sources
stimulating alternative energy demand to meet the 0-percent goal will require more so-called green pricing programs
which are often more expensive to the consumer
according to the study
pushing consumers to adopt electricity alternatives besides coal
oil
gas or nuclear will require utilities to offer green power choices
indeed
the study showed some customers will
go green
even if the price is higher than conventional sources
market research consistently shows that consumers prefer to receive their power from clean energy sources
giving consumers energy supply choices can be a powerful mechanism for moving renewable energy into the marketplace
said blair swezey
co-author of the study
swezey works at national renewable energy laboratory
which conducted the study along with the lawrence berkeley national laboratory
both organizations are u.s
department of energy national laboratories
the study does not advocate competitive markets over regulated markets
but suggests utilities in states without competition should offer their customers green products
if competitive retail markets fail to materialize
utility programs must pick up the slack
said ryan wiser of lawrence berkeley national laboratory
another co-author of the study
california caveat green power marketing had seen success in states with retail market competition
such as in california
but in the wake of california
s heavily publicized deregulation crisis
the state seems to have backed away from deregulation
and green power has been one of the victims
the california experience shows that the transition to competitive retail power markets will not be smooth
wiser added
noting that at least until california makes up its mind regarding the fate of deregulation
green power programs will remain on the back-burner
more than 0 utilities in 0 states out of more than 0 utilities nationwide give consumers the option to choose to buy power from renewable sources
meaning much of the potential growth for green power use has not yet materialized
non-hydro renewables provide about 0 percent
or 0,0 megawatts
mw
of all the electricity used in the united states
hydropower provides about 0 percent
with the expansion of customer choice
the study found the market could support about 0,0 mw of additional non-hydro renewables over the next decade

yesterday
we discussed that edison is likely going to try to jerk around esps
qfs and generators on past due amounts under its settlement with the puc
here's the latest on what they're doing to the qfs
best
jeff
ok
we met with edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative ctc claim
edison continues to take a very hard-line
extreme position
this is it in a nutshell
0
all customers--bundled and da alike
contributed to edison's undercollection
and all customers must pay it down
0
bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and da customers contributed through the negative ctc
0
edison says it will pay esps past due amounts related to the negative ctc
but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--da and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection
0
edison intends to collect it over approximately 0 years
edison estimates that the charge to da customers over this period would be about $0-0/mwh
0
under edison's plan
enron would likely end up paying edison
i.e
the present value of the
undercollection
charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative ctc payment
obviously
with respect to any settlement with edison
we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other options
in the meantime
the california puc is engaged in da and px credit-related activities beginning next week and edison will try to get the commission to adopt their proposal
we are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose edison's proposal at the puc
we will distribute something on monday describing our approach and tactics at the puc for folks to review and comment on
we are scheduled to meet with edison again next thursday to try to knock some sense into them
the probability of which is low
if you have any questions
let us know

could you forward michael's email address to me
0
are you aware of what edison's going to be proposing at the puc on nov
0th w.r.t
how it intends to recoup its
undercollection
under its settlement with the puc
in short
all da customers
irrespective of whether they were taking from edison at the time that edison accrued the
undercollection
would be
responsible
for paying
which means da customers would pay twice for power--once to their esp and now
again
to edison
is this something that your clients care about
we care quite a bit
one of the big issues is whether there ought to be hearings on all of this
or whether karl wood ought to just be able to push rates around based on briefs only
we feel pretty strongly that hearings are required
one of our big concerns is that this will be the tip of the iceberg
i.e
edison will continue on after this in an attempt to force all kinds of costs on customers
you have a view on whether hearings are required
more importantly do your clients have an interest in all of this
and will you be there on the 0th
inquiring minds want to know
hope you're well
please don't travel over any bridges

what's going on at the puc
etc
let me know
today looks pretty good for me to try to do it
best
jeff
talked to craver's office
his office is going to get back to me about meeting at edison early next week
that work for you
best
jeff
we continue to trade voicemails
one of these times
we'll catch each other
i'll report back just as soon as we do
best
jeff
will do
o boy
i feel another planting binge coming on
hey
we're likely going to the dome this weekend
so you're likely going to have put with seeing us
could you believe that game last night--got to be one of the best world series ever
traded calls
i'll get back to you soon as we hook up
can't wait to hear what jerry says
probably something like
talked to tom beach
heard about your plan
we'll call you
or who knows
he could surprise us
i'll let you know either way
best
jeff
we're currently scheduled to follow-up with edison at noon cst
0 am pst
on thursday
nov
0th
we'll set up a number and distribute to folks
best
jeff
thanks for your efforts
thanks for trying
and thanks for your strong sense of decency
if there's anything whatsoever i can do to assist
don't hesitate
best
jeff
ah ha
now i see why you were asking
so sorry that you
have to visit
maui
tough break
thanks a million
thanks
fyi
eeegads
you heard about the story circulating that skilling attended a
high society
pajama party last weekend in houston
eeks
interesting thanks
any word on the transcript
could you forward dan's draft
while aaron's points are good ones
i think may tipping at windmills
you'd think he'd go abroad on vacation or something until things cooled down
non
thanks
jeanne
just to be clear
since we had a bit of a different take last friday in the meeting that jim and sue and i had with mike
mike's take was that we'd be addressing just about everything under the sun
including why we think that hearings are necessary
this takes a much narrower approach
just want to make sure that we're all on the same page
i understand that mike was travelling yesterday and the first part of today
likely makes sense to have a call this pm to make sure out ducks are all in a line
thanks again
best
jeff
greetings
any chance of changing my lesson from tomorrow to this friday
preferably about lunchtime
let me know
if you're all booked for friday
i'm likely going to have to skip this week
let me know
hope all is well
best
jeff
fyi
i've talked to jeanne
and she and mike may have not completely communicated on this
given the uncertainty
i'm having to hold off on sending a note around
i'll do one after the call
best
jeff
thanks for the note
just let me know
we'll do it when you're ready
between now and then
could you send me a summary
understanding that it's an estimate
of time and materials as you see them
thanks again
good luck with the other jobs
talk to you soon
best
jeff
great
can you give me the entire list
indicating who's who
i'm thinking that if i let the big customers know
perhaps that'll give them an incentive to sign on
couple thoughts
understanding that we're really trying to get this thing done and that there's a million different ornaments one could hang on the tree
and bring the thing toppling down
i'll just throw this out for consideration
seems that as a first-order issue
the judge is either going to approve the settlement or cede to arguments the puc could make regarding its exclusive ratemaking authority--that is what it is
assuming that the judge sides in our favor
there remains the chance that the puc could take the edison view and charge da customers for the undercollection
thereby taking back what we achieved in the settlement based on the way our deals are structured with our customers
it would help alot if pg&e took the position at the puc that
for a variety of reasons
the puc should not tack on da customers
bills any charges designed to pay down the utilities
undercollection
in a proceeding where edison and pg&e are on different sides
our chances of prevailing are of course much better
but it likely won't do much good if we have any such deal written explicitly in the settlement document
i.e
pg&e agrees to take our side at the puc
but if there's any way to do some sort of side deal
outside of the settlement agreement
and if pg&e were amenable
there might be some real value
again
i know we want to get this thing wrapped up
but thought i'd toss it out there
we can take it or leave it
best
jeff
in california
all customers can choose--large and small
there are core
small customer
and noncore
industrial customers
consumption volume differentiates the two
noncore customes receive cheaper transporation rates.i'm not sure what sort of limitations you're specifically focused on
there are requirements regarding storage requirements
customers must have some storage
and requirements to pay a share of past
stranded costs
caused by the move to competition
and noncore customers on pg&e have more flexibility to buy in-state transportation than customers on socal have
if there's anything else
let me know
best
jeff
what came of the call
you get in to see whalley
wow
based on the share price
it appears they're having significant difficulty finding additional sources of funds
ain't getting any prettier
you get in to see whalley
you're kidding
right
edison's at about 0.0
great
good luck with others
when do you want to call hedy and bev
$0.0/share
don't make me give suggestions
aye aye
thanks
i think
hump day
is putting it mildly
you see in the press that we approached
are still approaching
kkr
and that buffet ain't interested
what a world
someone in real estate finance i know compared what fastow
co
did to the firstplus fiasco
that hurt
best
jeff
quick adder
it appears that the utilities took a hard line on the amendment issue in their written comments
which is no surprise
utilities position is obviously extreme but it means there's likely to be a signficant fight over the issue
no problem
to be honest
i was concerned--given how wide-ranging it was--that i might step in something unintentionally
please let me know if i do/did
also
keep in touch with how the issues go with them
since they are clearly trying to use the reg
issues as leverage
and in that regard
often offering up worst-case scenarios
best
jeff
i'll get back to you today
houston is dealing with some pretty big issues
but i'm going to push them to meet with you nonetheless
how's the weather in the big apple
you vote for green or bloomberg
ok
today's been nuts
this is likely not complete
but wanted to get something around
please review for 0
anything i've missed and/or 0
anything i've misstated
thanks
best
jeff
plz see email re
talking points
jeff
jesus
0 million enron shares have traded thus far today
insane
brad
lot of water under the bridge since the 0th
but i just got a note from perfect
they're still planning on being in houston to meet on the afternoon of the 0th
let me know if anything's changed and i'll get you the information on perfect asap
thanks
best
jeff
no problem
i'll let them know
best
jeff
hey
just heard back from brad
he's not cancelling
just post-poning
lots--and i mean lots--going on
i think that
realistically
we're talking december
sorry about that
but you know how quickly things can change
you guys hang out with the mccourey's at all
kisses
jeff
please forward along to others i may have missed but need to know
the commission held a hearing this afternoon to discuss the need for hearings on issues surrounding the da suspension
with minor exceptions
the utilities told the commission that the commission didn't need to conduct hearings
and that the commission could just go forward with implementing the suspension and assess exit fees
the utilities said that hearings could be held
sometime later
to determine the exact level of exit fees and how the utilities ought to calcualte the px credit going forward
a large group of business customers and suppliers disagreed strongly and made a very good case for hearings
there were lengthy arguments in front of the judge
at the end of which the judge decided that it would useful to hold another prehearing conference
the next hearing will be on dec
0th
the judge wanted another hearing to permit folks to have the opportunity to respond to the first round of comments on the issues submitted by everyone last friday
in sum
there will be another hearing on dec
0th to further discuss the need for hearings prior to the commission making decisions on these issues
at this point
it appears that the judge is leaning toward having comprehensive hearings
of particular note
at the end of the hearing the judge said that he is not inclinded to recommend a retroactive suspension of direct access to july 0
and that he didnt
think that the puc commissioner assigned to the case was either
worried that he said too much
he then said he couldn't/shouldn't spead for the commissioner
the judge
and the commissioner who was at the hearing
went on at length abouth the fact that no one submitted their da contracts to the puc
as requested in the document the puc issued asking folks to submit comments on the issues
our attorney and the attorneys for suppliers and customers told them that 0
the commission didn't need to see the actual contracts to get the information necessary via hearings to decide the issues and 0
the commission doesn't have the authority to ask to see contracts and they ain't likely going to get them without a fight
though the probability many not be high
there is at least the chance that the commission may try to subpoena folks to get the contracts
seems prudent to at least be prepared for the possiblity
interestingly
edison made a run at getting the commission to implement by january 0 its proposal to charge all customers--da and bundled alike--for edison's undercollection
the judge
literally
laughed off the request
and then said no
as a result
edison didn't get the leverage it was hoping for prior to our follow up meeting with them tomorrow to discuss the negative ctc issue
the judge also gave the dwr representative a pretty good thrashing
e.g
why are you here
you refuse to be a party
you refuse to provide info
etc
from today's hearing it appears that dwr will come under increasing pressure to open the kimono and have its numbers scrutinized
in related news
davis has announced that he's asked sempra to meet to renegotiate their dwr contract and said that he'd thus far met with two other generators in
serious negotitations
interesting to say the least
great case for b-school
you still in texas
no new details to report
same settlement to unbundle socal that's been before the commission for about a year
on the commission's agenda to consider
but as has been the case for over year
they've delayed any movement--at least one commissioner doesn't like competition and has the discretion to continue to ask that it be delayed
some hold the view that there's a push to try to get it moved
but best guess is 0-0 at this point
substantively
though
same thing that's been before them for a very long time
i.e
emulate pg&e's gas accord
more or less
on socal
best
jeff
greetings folks
the folks doing the appeal have asked me to inquire if you folks would be willing to sign on
they understand
as do we
that the likelihood of prevailing is slim
but feel that beating the drum is important in continued effort to maintain current da status and to attempt to preserve it going forward
da seems to need all the help it can muster given that karl wood and bob barnett appear to have control of the issue at the puc
could you let me know either way if you'll sign on
dorothy
talked to keith yesterday
who said you'd be making the call on this one
thanks a bunch
best
jeff
you bet
april
could you please distribute this to the office
thanks a bunch
greetings folks
tired of thinking about related-party transactions
sec probes and re-stated earnings
well
here's a chance to take your mind off of things
i've got a pair of exceptional 0er tickets--lowest section in 0nd tier
right on the 0 yardline
my girlfriend's parents season tickets
i can't use them--in fact
ain't crazy about football
they're playing the saints
which will be a great game
i'm selling them for face value
which is $0 each
like to be able to give them to someone in the office if possible
if you're interested
please let me know asap
best
jeff
yesterday
riordan kicked things off in california
he focused squarely on energy
he made three key
and interesting points
the contracts davis signed are a huge mistake for california that must be fixed
if elected
riordan would immediately eliminate davis
public power authority
if elected
riordan would have california join a west-wide rto
i'll try to rustle-up some press accounts of his remarks
best
jeff
hey
buddie
mike and sue still differ
we're getting the transcript to verify
i told them both that this is not something we should make a big issue out of since what the judge said in a
quip
from the bench will in no way alter our strategy or tactics
they both agreed
soon as we get the transcript
we'll fill you in
let me know if this works for you
please be easy with sue
she's pretty tense
best
jeff
they're yours
just let me know as soon as you can if you'd like them
hope you're doing well
stay buckled up
it's bumpy out there
but at least they're starting to publicly clean house
best
jeff
haven't seen any da statements yet
this sunday
they're yours
and
it comes with a new car
and a case of turtle wax
fyi
oh joy
understanding that many things can change dramatically between now and next thursday
we are nonetheless scheduled to call jim scilacci at 0 pm cst on thursday
november 0th
best
jeff
josh
been in a meeting all morning
think i missed the bidding
if i can't get in
here are my bids
e0--real estate
urban land
0 pts e0--global strategy
0 pts if this won't work
just let me know
sorry for any mixup
best
jeff
fyi
fyi
as we anticipated
today's call did not advance the ball from where we left off last week with edison
edison is sticking to its guns
claiming that all customers
da and bundled alike
should pay for edison's undercollection
i.e
they don't owe us money
we owe them money
the call was short and ended with an agreement that
0
we'll both continue plodding along in the puc process with all the other stakeholders who are arguing over these issues
0
we'll keep lines of communication open--to the extend that anyone has any new ideas they want to share
contacts will be made
and 0
if nothing has happened at the puc by the time edison starts readying itself to pay people in q0'0
then we'll get together to try to get agreement on a number as the puc process continues to work itself out
if anyone has any questions
just let us know
best
jeff
rick
it's hard to articulate
so i'll just say that you're doing a phenomenal job
whatever happens
you have an incredible amount to proud of
not the least of which is how you've handled things during these very tough times
please remember that there's alot of folks out there that appreciate what you're doing and care about you alot
and then there's your family
which is the most important thing
thanks again for your efforts
talk to you soon
keep hanging in there
best
jeff
no
what do they do
great time
so sorry i passed out
man
i just suddently hit the wall
on the jay thing
there's no pressure at all
if you guys are uncertain
that's no problem
just need you to understand that i'm moving ahead
most importantly in the near term
are you guys hip on sharing the cost of getting appraisals
just let me know
and again
let's keep this light
no frictions
everyone needs to feel comfortable with where they are
etc
etc
etc
worse thing in the world is to let biz/finances get in the way of friendships
keep your taht moh rising
fyi
what's pepcid
he has no idea
is he sure it ain't something fatal
poor annie
hi josh
sorry to bother you
but just wanted to be certain
by my tally
i only need to take 0 units next semester
spring
to graduate
i'm taking 0 units this semester
is there anyway to get that
officially
verified through the office
thanks much
best
jeff
hey darlin
you on this list
too
crazy
non
well
what isn't crazy these days
hope you're ok
well
that's not helpful
won't make things any easier
are they an arm member
i'll let the large customer groups know
best
jeff
greetings
i'm assuming that we're still on for the call
let me know
hope things have calmed down somewhat since the deal was announced on friday
best
jeff
rick
with everything else going on
i apologize for raising this issue
but i'm concerned that if i don't
it may fall through the cracks
i just realized over the weekend that within the next few weeks
i will have paid the full balance on tuition for the fall 0 semester in berkeley's mba program that i've been in since 0
by the end of this semester
i will have finished 0 of the 0 units that are required to complete the program
naturally
i'd like to get reimbursed for the fall semester's tuition
but i'm concerned that recent events create uncertainty at just about every level of the company
i know you've got a hell of alot on your plate right now
so there's no need to discuss immediately
i simply wanted to get it on the radar screen
whenever you get a free minute
give me a ring and we can talk about it further
take care
and thanks for listening
best
jeff ps given dyn and ene share prices today
looks like the market loves the combination
that's pretty nice
wouldn't know it by what rebecca smith keeps writing
though
gives the impression that she won't be content until we're reduced to ashes--shame
fyi
edison has been successful at peeling off one of the esps--new west
seems that in exchange for getting paid negative ctcs
new west may have agreed to take the position that all da customers should be charged for edison's undercollection
i'm not aware of any other esps that are willing to take that position
the salient quote in new west's
supplemental
phc statement reads
it is the position of new west energy that all customers
both bundled service customers and direct access customers
are equally responsible for payment of the net undercollections
fairness dictates that bundled customers and direct access customers are both assessed their fair share of the responsibility for repaying the amount of the net undercollections as may be determined by the commission
obviously
not a helpful statement
new west's supplemental phc statement is attached
best
jeff
hi
could you re-email the arm press release re
supreme court
i want to distribute it around a bit
thanks
fyi
i notified the large customers and it appears they've taken it upon themselves to notify some of new west's customers of new west's new
supplemental
position
you think i should submit the reimbursement now
before the semester ends
just to get it in the door
they should reserve a place for fessler at the same place davis deserves to go--history's trash heap
you know that fessler works with klauberg
right
some people you just can't get rid of
best
jeff
i'm assuming that these are the sorts of things we should hold off on
this is very sad
prentice
now one of pwc's finest
and i talked and here's where i come out
i love annie and want to remember her the way she is
and i bet she would feel the same way
all the chemo gets her is a little more time
and who knows how long
and the quality of extended life is likely to be very low
it's really hard
but i think that the best thing for annie
and everyone else
is for annie to go to sleep
peacefully and quietly
i hope you don't mind
but i'd like to pass on the 0 o'clock phone call
i hope you understand
i'll be at your place on thursday to see her
best
jeff
will do
do you have rory's email address
hi avram
meet rory
prentice's brother and computer guru-type
rory and i talked a little bit about what you're looking for
so i thought i'd just go ahead and facilitate a little chat room here
avram
could you explain one more time to rory exactly what it is that you're looking for
just to make sure that i've accurately and adequately described the situation
rory has some ideas
best
jeff
thought i'd add eldon
too
since he likely has some ideas and information
too
hi
sorry to bug you--know things are crazy--but just checking in on the presentations we talked about yesterday
best
jeff
yes
hadn't planned on going
talked to roger again
give me a call when you get a chance
best
jeff
thank you
will there be a call-in number
and who else do we expect on the call
i'm at my desk
jeff
he got me
thanks
where's this leave mcmahon
thanks a million for your help on this
on first glance
these look great
i'll give you a ring tomorrow to discuss further
best
jeff
no problem
man
for someone who doesn't know much
you sure know alot
based on the note you sent
it's your call on today's lesson
if you're feeling under the weather
then we can pass for today
otherwise
i'll show up at 0:0
just let me know
and you can decide anytime between now and 0:0
i don't know how much eldon and rory can help
but they're both real knowledgeable and generally love thinking about this kind of stuff
best
jeff
who loves ya baby
hey
don't say anything to karen
or her parents
but i'd like to get something for her parents as a thank you for gloucester
what sorts of things do they like
you heard that prentice got a job offer from price waterhouse
see you on friday
best
jeff
greetings folks
we will temporarily suspend the wednesday
0:0 am call until things settle down a bit
if something crops up
we can set up a call to discuss
in the meantime
we'll be communicating regularly outside the call
thanks very much
best
jeff
thanks again for the stuff
i can take it from here
two quick questions
0
is there anything that's top secret that i shouldn't be talking about
0
do we have anything for lng activity similar to the slides on incremental interstate pipeline capacity
thanks again
i'll let you know if anything interesting comes up
best
jeff
thanks alot
hi evie
as you know edison is being
well
edison about just about everything at the puc
i think that we actually have some leverage with pg&e
however
i've helped to broker a meeting between large customers and pg&e
tom botorff and dan richard
this friday at 0:0 pm after dj's meeting
dj and delainey are organizing the
basic
idea is to see if there is some way to strike a
reasonable
deal on the da/cost allocation issues with pg&e
which could then be submitted to puc around edison
which seems hell bent on piling as many costs on business customers as possible
at the first meeting
we want to spend a very brief amount of time determining 0
what matters to people 0
where people on the issues and 0
pg&e's willingness to deal
the goal is to find out if there's any room for a deal
should not take a long time
i hope you can attend
since the meeting will be significantly less productive if you're not there
and who knows
it may lead to something that permits us to go around edison
likely attendees are cmta
cleca
the chamber
you
hopefully
pg&e and me
will mike kahl be at dj's meeting
best
jeff
plz call me when you get a minute
thx
jeff
dan
i wanted to follow up on our discussion last week regarding the peaker we're helping lodi to develop
the project is a peaker plant inside lodi's territory
with the power sold to dwr
the deal is both price and time sensitive
no surprise there
needs to be on line q0/q0
0
at a price that's in line with price negotiated with dwr
for the gas interconnect
your folks tell us that the project requires $0-$0 mm in system upgrades that will take 0-0 months to complete
by contrast
the project could connect directly to lodi's gas storage facility for about $0.0 mm and could be completed in about 0-0 months
in short
pg&e's offers blows through both the time and price constraints
the lodi option accommodates both very well
we are very senstive to the tariff revenues you would forgo via a direct connect to lodi and potential concerns regarding precedent over connecting directly to the storage facility
therefore
0
we'd be willing to pay the local distribution tariff price
irrespective of being connected directly to the lodi facility
0
we'd be willing to switch over and connect with pg&e once the upgrades in the lodi/stockton area are done
and 0
we'd agree that the direct connection with lodi should be viewed as a
special case
and not precendent
with the goal of avoiding exacerbating california's problems with supply shortages
thanks for listening
let me know what you think
best
jeff
if we do it sunday morning
i'm game
thanks very much
yeah
i found this out last night as was going to tell you about it
thanks so much
that sounds great
what day of week is the 0th
i recommend that we just stick to one of the three that joseph originally to the time and effort to select
any chance of salvaging any of those
best
jeff
greetings

but got a chance to look at your reorg memo

best
jeff
only one call

best,jeff
this is pretty big stuff and moving pretty quickly
understanding that times are crazy
and that it's a holiday week
if we could nonetheless begin discussing tomorrow
or even late today
that would be very useful
best
jeff
not all
but some
i'll give you a ring to discuss more
wow
there is a god
thanks
have a great weekend
best
jeff
thanks
i thought you folks were involved in this program and supported it
but i may have it all wrong
in any case
please see attached regarding utilities joint proposal on implementing the da suspension
community aggregation would not be allowed after sept 0th

thanks very much
hope you're well
best
jeff

but there's progress
best
jeff
jeanne
do you have a copy of the procurement oir
could you email it to me if you do
thanks very much
best
jeff
it's more complicated still
a crazy commissioner at the cpuc now wants to require everyone to submit their da contracts to commission for review
it's attached
folks are going to oppose it very strongly
i'm available to talk
i'm not sure that the oct
0th date has got legs
best
jeff
my apologies for the delay
about three other bonfires cropped up after i talked to you
in any case
the answer to your question
is yes
we can switch our customers to dual billing if we choose to do so
if you have any other questions
just let me know
best
jeff
you're a helluva guy
i'm damned proud to be associated with you
and hope to continue in the future
if we don't get a chance to talk between now and tomorrow
have a great thanksgiving
and rick
i'm not a very religious guy
but god bless you
best
jeff
thanks
dan
i'm having a very difficult time seeing how enron will have any choice other than to vigorously
and respectfully
0
decline to offer up any contracts and 0
assert our view that karl wood it is unfair to attempt to impose any quid pro quo
i.e
forcing folks to waive their due process rights by declining to hand contracts over to karl
best
jeff

few things
chris warner did an extremely good job of talking about your plan at dj's thing in yountville
thanks a million for helping to identify someone who's a bit more
outside the box
to help on the lodi power plant/gas storage deal
any indication of who that person might be
we're anxious to start meeting with them
any word on getting a conference call together with the large customers
finally
have you told the puc yet that you won't be filing any stinking grc
if so
how have they reacted
have a great holiday weekend
best
jeff

wanted to thank you very much for taking the time on such short notice
and
from what i've heard from others
for having done an outstanding job
thanks again
and yes
we'll take the victories when we can get them
best
jeff
prentice's haas address is no longer valid
you'll need to send to
psellers@pacbell.net
looks like the market ain't crazy about our 0q

jeff
hi
i read karl's ruling on the contracts
just about had it with that bozo
i'm assuming that the customers are going to resist
hey man
you feeling any better
what would you like me to bring and/or do for friday
hello
first
forget it all and have a wonderful holiday
second
given the immense challenges
i've been instructed to get major expenses in and paid
so i sent to rick in a confidential folder my tuition reimbursement form for school
do you know if he got it
best
jeff
thanks very much
if possible
i'd like to listen in
that possible
and have a very nice holiday
best
jeff
test
test
very quick and dirty--not even fully proofed
but wanted to get something out for folks to shoot at
let me know your thoughts
sure i've missed about a million things and mucked up about the same amount
happy thanksgiving
best
jeff
here it is
apologies that it's very sketchy and barely proofed
but wanted to get something out to folks to shoot at
have a great holiday
best
jeff
fyi
pg&e called
they want to set up a conference call to brief us on the gas piece of their por that they'll be filing with ferc around november 0th
they want to try to do it in the next couple of weeks
please let me know if you're interested and please pass this along to anyone else who might be interested
thanks
best
jeff
thanks
lamar
geoff
could you let us know how it goes with the customer and if this a mix-up on the customer's end
thanks very much
best
jeff
thanks very much
thanks so much for the call back
here it is
it's got temperature and %rh from end of may to early november
couple of things
i tried to keep and save heat days
cumulative
on the graph
but for some reason
it won't stick
i'm assuming that you know how to add just about anything you want to the graph
if not
let me know
also
the data should be cut off for about a week at both the front end and the back end
to account for the time that it was in my apartment prior to setting in up on the property
and before i was able to download it in november
once you get a chance to look at
give a call and let me know what you think
if the temperature range looks like it's around the ballpark for vines
i'll want to get terry rosetti up to do some soil testing
but wanted to get your take on the temperature
etc
first
really appreciate all your help
my number is 0.0.0
best
jeff
sue
this woman from newwest is driving me crazy
best
jeff
greetings
i just talked to marcie
she's interested
but wants some more info to examine before setting up a meeting
aren't there some press articles about the sort of muni partnerships you want to pursue with smud and anaheim
do we have anything else that i can email to her to wet her whistle for the meeting
will get back to you very soon about meeting with schori at smud
best
jeff
plan of reorganization
can you forward me both
i'll take a look at them
maybe they'll do the trick
also
do you have that press article where we partnered with a muni
in canada
i think
this time with attachment
thanks
brown going to vote for it
greetings ms denne
hope your holiday was restful and relaxing
a week or so ago
there was an article in the clips about enron partnering with a muni
in canada maybe
to provide retail energy services for the munis retail customers
could someone in your shop try to dig that up
i need to get it to a ceo of a california muni for ees and i'll be darned if i can't locate it
greatly appreciated
best
jeff
janelle
here's an email and slightly modified pp presentation that i'd like to send to marcie
let me know what you think
best
jeff hi marcie
congratulations again on your new role at anaheim
elena tells me that you're having a great time
thanks for taking the time to talk a little bit about the strategic alliances enron is forming with public power
we're excited about our alliance model because it offers a true win-win for municipal power companies and their customers
i've attached a power point presentation that provides an overview of the program
in sum
the initiative offers public power systems leading edge competitive retail energy and risk management products and services for their commercial and industrial electric customers
using their own brand name
since ees retains and manages all price and product related risks
our alliance partners are freed up to offer their customers valuable and sought after products and services with no additional risk
here are some of the program's highlights
enabling our alliance partners to provide their customers with products and services that are superior to what competitive suppliers are offering
reaffirming the value of public power and a strong customer focus
our alliance partners maintain exclusive control over customer relationships and continue to market power under their own name
our market-tested and accepted products and services allow your customers to better manage costs
reduce operational and financial risks and focus on their core business activities our alliance partners do not take on any price risk related to these products
products and services customization further enable our alliance partners to spur economic development and maintain customer retention
innovative financial solutions that allow companies to upgrade industrial facilities and energy infrastructure
including energy consuming equipment and demand-side management programs
without diverting capital from their core businesses
thanks again for taking the time to talk yesterday
if you have any questions
give me a call at 0.0.0
and i'll call you in the next few days about arranging a time that we can meet with you in beautiful southern california
all the best
jeff
and we ate more last night and we're still alive
thanks very much for your hospitality and a really fun time
thanks
if we ever get out of this mess
you can rest assured that i'll help out
can you remind again right after the first of the year
at which time we should have a better idea of where this ship is heading
thanks
best
jeff
please review this one
i just read the contract and there is no end date
it's open-ended and simply says that we can end at our discretion
thanks very much for getting the contracts for me
please address one each to bev and hedy on our letter head so i can sign and send out today
thanks a bunch
the arm group is going back and forth on what they want to say in their filing on the specifics of the da suspension
many parties with many interests
there continues to be debates over the specifics
soon as there is a draft that folks have reasonably agreed to
i'll send it to you
if you have any questions
give a holler
best
jeff
no problem
apologies just got back
can't make the call
but concur that we ought to stay where we were
not that the proposal doesn't merit discussion
but it raises many issues and we're down to the wire
so i concur with bill and aaron
perhaps we should try to regroup first thing in the am
best
jeff
did i ask you to fax copies of the hedy/bev letter to ginger
signed
thanks
geoff
may make sense to loop back with the woman at the puc who contacted jim originally about this account
jim's been in contact with her before about some confusion with a uc account
jim was out yesterday and today
but i think that he'll be in tomorrow
he may want to make the contact
jim
thoughts
best
jeff
will do
thanks again for getting to the bottom of it
got that one covered too while you were out
de nada
sounds like were back at plan b
that's neat
please give them both my best
call me
thanks
jeff 0.0.0
really sorry to bother you with this
but any idea of whether my tuition reimbursement has successfully made it's way through
thanks a million
best
jeff
fyi
looks like many are exploring
probably value in staying coordinate internally
i'll give alan a call
best
jeff
hey
just checking in to see if you're still out there
what a story
hope you weathering things ok
best
jeff
greetings
well
it's about over for the company known as enron
ultimately i
and just about everyone else
am going to need to find a new job
but it should be viewed as an opportunity rather than something less positive
it's a shame that such a fun
interesting and bright group of people that had a very successful core franchise are now in such a messy situation due to a handful of folks who exercised
at a minimum
extremely poor judgment
but it is what it is
as for me
i'm dusting off my resume and getting ready to send it around
i've already had a few calls from
inquiring minds
so we'll we where things end up
thanks so much for the thoughts
definitely crazy times
but i'm not getting to worked up about it
and besides
prentice has accepted pwc's offer
so i'm looking forward to housekeeping
best
jeff
well
i think that enron's fate is going to affect everyone
including me
but no worries
i'll land on my feet
love to have tea
just let me know when
how you doing
you're a good man
thanks
you may regret having offered
though
since there's an extremely good chance that i'm likely to take you up on it
ok
now i'm getting choked up
thanks
man
fyi
thank you both very much for your help on this
best
jeff
call me re
iso
jeff 0.0.0

jeff
you've really been nice about this
thanks very much

i'll give dan a call
have a great weekend

xoxoxox
thanks
and ditto
my friend
you're a rare individual at the company
and it shows
please be sure to spend a little time looking after yourself and your loved ones
since you've been doing a great job spending so much time caring and looking out for the rest of us
best
jeff
should i stop working
no big deal
really
but don't want to continue
if it doesn't make sense
thanks
jeff
thank you so much for all you've done for annie
you know that i've really come to love that crazy dog
and it meant a lot that you and eldon were always so caring
she is truly a lovely dog and i'll miss her immensely
but it helps that everyone was so loving
and i'm really sorry that i couldn't be there for her today
but the enron thing is really a mess and i've got responsibilities on that front that i just can't pass off
thanks again so much for everything
hugs
jeff
all the very best to you and yours
see on 0smith.com
best
jeff
i'm going to work the rest of the day from home--i will be working

greetings all

jeff
hi

es

dude

boots
poles
we'll get a discount
you still plan on getting that
best
jeff
greetings
last night
we were hanging out the the ceo of cameron's company and it turns out that he's a recording freak with unbelievable equipment and he'd likely be willing to record a true blue cd for free
give a call when you get a minute
0.0.0
best
jeff
where have you heard that
and what is it saying
ps i don't think that
to welsh
is a politically correct term
best
jeff
call when u can
ious jointly filed w/puc saying
no assignments
jeff
greetings
please forgive me for not getting back to you more promptly
here's the latest
as you know
i'm finishing up my mba at berkelely
i'll have but one class left to take next semester
finals/projects
etc
are all done/due
etc
next week
so as you can imagine it's very crazy
in addition
i
we
had to put the sweetest dog in the world to sleep this week
and the enron thing's been nothing compared to that
i'd ask
what next
but i'm afraid to ask
however
none of this constitutes an excuse for not getting back to you
so i apologize
ok
back to enron
it's a mess
surprise
i'm still with the company--not sure for how long
however
at least through the end of the year
it appears
sue and joseph have left
if you'd like their contact information
i'd be happy to provide it
we're trying to transfer our da contracts to other esps
but the utilities
carl wood and some others want to make it difficult
if not impossible
though difficult as it may seem to believe
i'm actually doing ok
engaging in lots of zen buddist stuff
and i do promise to give each of you a ring to catch up very soon
this week's a little tough just because with school and
the mess
i'm a tad preoccupied
however
your calls and nice thoughts are extremely welcomed and greatly appreciated
thanks so much
will talk to you soon and hope you're doing well
best
jeff
greetings
first
thanks for the pizza
second
in line with the
role play
that you described in class and in the handout for the project
we took your direction to heart and tried to make our presentation slides very free of jargon
spreadsheets
reams of numbers
etc
given the end-of-semester work load
we
like everyone else
are very appreciative that we will only have to turn in the presentation and the spreadsheet for the project
given the change
if you would like
we would be happy to
beef up
the presentation to include more numbers
jargon and other technical gems
though the spreadsheet lays out most of that information pretty well
whichever way you prefer is fine by us
just let me know
best
jeff
joseph
good news
wallace decided last night that we don't have to do a write-up for project after all
all we have to do is turn in the presentation and the spreadsheet
i've written her an email
telling her that we followed directions closely on the presentation
i.e
very simply
no jargon
spreadsheets
lots of technical crap
etc
and wanted to make sure that that would acceptably when we turn it in
or if she expected some
beefing up
i plant to spend a little time with my slides and the spreadsheet
though not much
just to make a bit better
i'll let you know how she responds
great job by all
best
jeff
hi
hey
i can't open this
hugs
jeff
thanks
very much alan
hedy
bev and scott are still technically on board until the end of the month
but that's fairly
ceremonial
so to speak
let's do this
i'll give hedy a call and see if they'd be willing to attend and report back
in my view
given the circumstances
if they've got conflicts and can't make it
i'm not inclinded to push it
sound reasonable
best
jeff
paul
thanks very much for the note
for the moment
we do still intend to go ahead with the projects and will stay in very close contact with you should the situation change
if you have any questions
please let me know
best
jeff
got your message
likely makes sense to also call evie elsesser and dan carroll
let me know if there's anything else
best
jeff
great
you know this is a pure
lobbyist
meeting
right
you may want to do by phone
if possible
your call
greetings professor
i regret that i was unable to attend class last night
few items
i assume that you returned papers
i will be on campus tomorrow and can pick it up then if you like
or if you'd prefer
you can drop it in my box in the student room at haas
evening mba boxes
or if you'd like to make some other arrangement
just let me know
i assume that our third paper is due by close-of-business on wednesday
december 0
thanks very much
best
jeff
here's my take
alan's got an airplane ticket to go down and attend the lobbyist meeting
from my perspective
there is very little value in that activity
however
if scott wanted to go and report back
then a
he gets information which likely doesn't hurt their business and b
the
estate
doesn't incur the cost of alan traveling to sacramento to a meeting that likely won't have a huge amount of value
but if scott ain't interested
he ain't interested
that's my take
best
jeff
what's up
thanks robert
sounds good
fyi
prentice and i are getting haley the portable cd player
please forgive me for continuing with this
but ena just told me that they talked to jeremy about 0 minutes ago and they had the view that there was still some uncertainty regarding whether hansen had been included in the 0 contracts
i told them that i'd already spoken with you folks and that hansen was on the list
let me know if i'm missing something here
again
apologize for keeping on about it
best
jeff
thanks very much
does that mean that the hansen contract would be sold as a stand-alone asset
thanks for getting in touch
yes
we can schedule
do you know who all would participate
best
jeff
as soon as i get my grades
which i hope will be mid-late december
i'll send them to ginger in the attempt to get tuition reimbursed
but don't worry
i have extremely low expectations about the likelihood of getting reimbursed
this plan make sense
best
jeff
thanks
fyi
thanks
had a long chat with uc that i'd like to pass along
and a couple of additional issues arose in the course of the talk that i'd also like to discuss
is it possible to talk for 0 minutes first thing in the morning
best
jeff
so you guys want to come by p&c's before dinner at la folie
or do just want to meet at the restaurant
be great if you could come by and have a glass of champagne first
best
jeff

you decide to have a call of the walking wounded today

it's going to be a little tough till later on
jeff
thanks

best
jeff
one other thing
i just had coffee with a former business colleague
she is preliminary stages of starting a new
private science and tech high school
in conjunction with cathedral in sf--episcopalian folks
i told her that you would be a good person to talk to w.r.t
setting up board
staff
etc
she's very interested
she is an extremely neat person who i think you would like a lot
are you interested in talking to her
best
jeff
greetings professor

thought-provoking and challenging course

greetings

thanks very much
best
jeff
you have just used your quota of exclamation points for the remainder of this year and for all of 0
it was very fun
may have them sold
$0 apiece
so you're the one who gave me this cold
just wanted to let you know that i've been working on the resume
in between work and finals
and will try to have you a draft by end of this week
or next monday

jeff
hey
i'm still trying to get through school and now i've come down with a cold
so i need to take a pass on tomorrow's lesson
any chance of coming on friday
i don't know what shape i'll be in
but if there's an opening
maybe i can make it
best
jeff
i'd love tickets
but don't kill yourself over
get better--cold's not bad
but it's damned annoying
the trust could not run deeper
just to clarify
we'll want to focus solely and exclusively on the registration
we're not in arrears on the bond
yet
thanks a bunch
best
jeff
sweet
thanks
nancy
here is the final
couple things
the short answers are in the word document
the long answers are in two separate excel files
i used the spreadsheet that you gave us to do the last long answer
the fannie mae question
you can find the answer in a tab titled
long answer--question iib
and it's highlighted by yellow background
the data for the problem is in the
data
tab
thanks again for a fantastic course and hope to run into you in the near future
all the best
jeff
here they are
please let me know that you've received them
joseph
good luck including duration to the correct spreadsheet
and thanks for sending them along to nancy
let's talk and figure out a time to get together
best
jeff
will do
what's your fax number
can you please fax thing we were faxing yesterday to jeremy
i'm much obliged
just talked to the puc
seems that ees is up-to-date on its registration and it's only eemc that's not current
wade will get the 0k to jeanne bennett
who's filled out the requisite one-pager and will send check and paperwork to where it needs to get
however
the puc person notified us that they previously received notice from the issuer of eemc's security bond that eemc's security has been canceled
she said that we have until day-after-xmas to get current on the bond
she could not reveal who the issuer is and i don't have that info
presumably someone in ees received notice that the issuer was canceling eemc's security bond
we need to get info on that
we should therefore also double check that the the issuer of the ees security bond hasn't also canceled
let me know if you have any questions
and let me know what we find out about the bond
or if there's anything i can do to assist
thanks
jeff
thanks
hanging in there about as well as everyone is
no worries on getting back to me
just wanted to keep folks in the loop
been in contact with the desk
best of luck with the transaction
enjoy the time off
talk to you in a couple days
best
jeff
i'm not sure
but i have a sneaking suspicion that all you folks are finished this semester
just wanted to say congratulations
i'm finished with this semester after today
but have one--that's one--class to take next semester to finish
also
though i can't make the ski trip this weekend
i definitely plan on skiing a lot this winter
maybe i'll see you at squaw deepikah
so let's stay in touch on the ski front
happy holidays to all
and if anyone has any questions on creative off-balance sheet financing or or the ins-and-outs of bankruptcy
please feel free to get in touch
best
jeff
greetings

what's up
hope all is ok

that all is well with you and yours

ryan could you make contact with jesus and be his contact for pricing
could you set up a process
maybe the bidfax
where by he can get daily pricing info
thanks
jon
i hope its going well
i just wanted to respond to your request to have the buy's/sell's outline for you in the summery of one month trades
could you please explain why you need this information to complete your pie chart
it would be my preference not to include this information as our trading positions could be piece together prior to us having time to close out of those positions
the risk of outside parties knowing our positions is of grave concern and it would be my preference to avoid this if at all possible
please give me a call to discuss
regards
jon
what time do you need it for
no problem
go ahead
could you please do me a favor
deloitte is auditing our ngx feed process and they need to be able to check the integrity of our data
grahan larson at deloitte wanted us to run the query that is outline in the word doc attached with a few alterations
he was wondering if we could include the counter party id
counterpart flag
and the counterpart name in the query we send to him
could you please coordinate getting him the information he needs
his phone number is 0-0
thanks
jon
did you know before me
you always seem to
i'll let you know when the beers are flowing
see ya then
jon
in
call me on this one
i think aeco would actually be better due to the fact that plant gate gas in saskatchewan trades at aeco
x
therefore an aeco hedge may be more appropriate to match up their risk
hope all is going well
jon
yes
all trades have and associated contract that outlines the
performance obligations
and this is similar to ngx's
still waiting to talk to a lawyer on the other issues
i will get it to you today
jon
please note that because this event of force majeure is at the plant
and not on the pipe
it does not qualify as an event of force majeure under our contract
any deals we have that are not done under a enron contract will probably have force majeure applied to them
please endeavor to find commercially reasonable terms to work around this problem regardless of who's contract the deal was done under
regards
jon
jay
the never ending saga of enrononline vs
ngx continues
under our settle agreement with ngx
we
somehow
agreed to provide ngx with a password and id that would allow them to see the products on enrononline that coincide with the index's that we are providing data to
as a temporary solution i created a filer under my master user id that gives them all physical alberta gas products one month and under
the problem is they can see the rest of month product bid/offer and the product descriptions of other enrononline products
would it be possible to set up a password and user id for enrononline that only shows the products we are contributing to
or at a minimum
have them set up so they have their own limited access that is not associated with my login

i think i told you to pass it along to the new lawyer when he came and i was wondering if this was done
and if i should follow up with him
they certainly are persistent in getting us to sign this
please direct me as to what i should be doing regards
jon ps
when you comin
back
hi rod
i am forwarding this e-mail just to let you know what i am being told as far as selecting a realtor
see below
today i am going to talk to the relocation people and do what i can about keeping things going with you
the relocation people don't sound like they know what is going on
as demonstrated by their reference to
favorable tax treatment
but if they insist on having royal lepage i wanted to see if you could speak to them directly
my preference is to have you represent me
but if they are
paying the bills
i may have little choice
best regards
jon

do they have any right to cut a deal by more than the amount that the pipeline declared as its force majure volume
jon mckay unemployed phone
0-0-0
martin how is it going
i don't want to make this a big deal
quite frankly you and me have better things to spend our time on
and the dollar amount relating to these cuts is trivial
but with respect to cuts in the future i think it is important that we teach the people underneath us the correct way to handle these issues
so that in the future we do not have to be involved
below is a quick dialog that greg johnston and i have had with respect to the cuts and what we can and can not do
this seems to be blown way out of proportion by kevin heal and if there is anything i can do to make this go away please let me know
thanks
jon
hello
your right it has been a long time since we have chatted
things are a change'n with my life
first i just got back from a little
so called
vacation where beth and i drove from west palm beach to houston
we did it over 0 days so it wasn't that bad
day one was a 0 hour hop from west palm to desitn
fl
you would have loved destin
they have the most amazing sand on their beaches
it kind of reminds me of icing sugar
very white and has a very fine texture
and i felt like i was sink right into the sand
www.holidayinndestin.com
next stop was in new orleans
which ended up with lots of drinks and some pretty good cajun food
it took about 0 hrs to get there from destin but the traffic was not that bad
next stop was in houston
about 0.0 hrs
from new orleans
by now i'm sure you have asked yourself
why did they do this drive
and the obvious answer is because beth is moving there
she rented a really nice loft in down town houston not far from enron field she took a job with enron energy service which is our retail company
the bad thing is i'm not sure how i feel about having her work for the same company
the good thing is that she is in a different building than the wholesale group so the chances of having my personal life and business life cross are low
i guess this would kind of be like if we worked for shell and i ran the bulk dealer ship and she was responsible for exploration
not the same business but none-the-less for the same company
second
it look like i am going to sell my house and probably end up moving to houston as well
believe it or not this was not by design
just a mere coincident
however
it has presented some tough questions
do i really want to move again
and do i want to co-habitate
moving is the easy part
i'm starting to become an expert
and i was thinking about selling my house anyway
as for co-habitating
the jury is still out
beth would have no problem with the idea
but
cold feet mckay has mixed feeling
co-habiation is in the lead as it stands
third
what would you prefer i do with some of the goodie's you have let me borrow
ie your beautiful dolls
the cabinets the dolls are in
the tv stand
you mirror
and the other few remaining items
i thought i would store the dolls at carol's
but i was unsure as to what your preference was for the other things
i am going to sell everything i can and start over in houston regardless my living plans
the only thing i'm going to try to take is my car
if you want i can either try to get a fair price for you furniture or stephen might be able to make good use of the tv cabinet and other things
email me your phone number as i do not have it
and we can talk about what is best
anyway
good to hear you are getting some exercise
i am trying to do the same
and stay off the darts if you can
if you cann't
reward yourself for trying
take care and i will talk to you in a couple of weeks
love
jon
please approve thanks
jon
please take care of this
didn't we already send her the data for july
jon
david
thanks for sending this to me
it looks good
does mr
frevert have the other points just in case further explanation is needed
i would not include them in his speaking points what you have is sufficient
but he probably needs the back ground just in case
let me know if i can do anything to help
regards
jon
who is taking care of you
hello favorite aunt
and i do have more than one
how much do you want to try to sell the cabinets
dolls and tv
for
or a least how much did you pay so that we can get a reasonable price
my plan was to sell everything i own before moving
sound familiar
anyway i hope everything is going well and have a good time on your alaskan safari
email me with the info
and i'll give you a call
love jon
the current offer for these volumes 0 year out of oct
would be $0.0
i hope this helps
jon
we would be offered at 0.0 right now
but like all things
what goes up must come down
we moved down
0 in the front part of the curve
but the back has not followed as quickly
i would expect we will have a good hedging opportunity the next couple of days
and then rally after that

the aga number was definitely more bullish than anyone expected and it has caused us to rally to levels that i didn't think we were going to see a long time
but
i do not think that the trend has changed
in my humble opinion
i think that the number was probably an adjustment of over statements of inventory over the past 0 weeks
i do not believe that the number should have any baring on the numbers going forward
i still expect us to trend down
but it will probably take an extra week to recover from this move
regards
jon

that sounds like aol not msn
i tried using that address for msn and it said it was not available at this time
i'll try to add you again later using that address
people down here are shocked
one of the brokers we use was in the second tower when the first plane hit
all he said was that something blew up and he was getting the
*
@##$ out of there
sounds like it was a good decision as he was in the stairwell on the 0th floor when the second plane hit his tower
he got out alright but many of his co-workers are still missing
lots of people have friends and family that worked there so people are keeping pretty much to themselves
as for me
i'm wondering why i moved to this country
things here are ok but i question everyday whether or not i made the right decision
hopefully
some good things start happening to me
so far i have lost money trading
live with two cats i can't stand
don't have a car to drive
or any of my personal belongings
and this country is on the verge of going to war
i figure things can only get better
i'm back in town from the 0th-0rd
assuming i can fly back
and hopefully we can hook-up then
if you need some kitchen-ware
i.e
utensils
let me know and i'm sure we can work out a deal
there is no room for my stuff in this apartment
hope you are doing well and say hi to everyone for me

geof storey's
who trades eastern canada and chicago
father was in the world trade center for a 0 hour meeting on the 0 floor of the first building that was hit
he is missing and presumed dead
a funeral is being held for him this saturday and i think this has caused people around here to take it even more personally
i have to admit
for the first time in years i'm a little nervous about flying back to calgary on wednesday
glad to hear school is going well
i kind of wished i was there with you
best of luck
and i'll email you when i get back from calgary

jon
hey greg
i thought i would drop you a quick note
how are things going
i hope your still getting lots of deals done and knocking them deal at enron direct

it looks like things are getting a little better
other than turnovers
good luck tonight

if you want to go this weekend let me know
how's about today at 0:0
i looked at the map over the weekend and noticed a few areas that will need further work
overall not too bad
jon
how are you feeling today
i'm losing the war and thought i'd send you a note from the front
out look is ambiguous
love jon
or are we running
what time do you want to run
the earlier the better for me
bad day and i can't wait to get out of here
any time after 0:0 is fine with me
regards
jon
you are a better man than me
yes
but i'm not so sure it will be outside
i don't know if you are going to get this in time
but i wanted to try to get some of you input on a deal you price earlier for yankee gas
structuring needs you gas daily daily offer for 0 peak day at tetco m0
you previously indicated us$0.0 for 0,0 a day and it looks like they are going to do the whole volume
they will notify you by 0:0 am the day before delivery
i don't know what the right price is but it would seem that we could anticipate their need to call and get in front of the market moves
i am going to stick with the 0.0/mmbtu unless i hear from you
i hope the vacation is going well
sorry to disturb you
regards
jon
right back at you and i would be even more takin by you if you would pick up my race for the cure package

happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear beth happy birthday to you
happy 0rd birthday
long time no e-mail
things here are starting to settle down a little
i still have not quite cleaned up my affairs in calgary and probably need to do a weekend trip back up there
but i'll be sure to give you more notice than last time
as it will probably be less work and more play
i have yet to do anything too spectacular down here
last week end i went to the houston grand prix
paul tracey and the other canadian
name fails me
you know the french guy patrick
didn't do to well
although
enron had sponsored a car for that race and it was in 0rd most of the way until it crashed on the 0nd from last lap
it was kind of fun to have someone to cheer for in the race that was in the
thick
of things
the day was nice and it beat being inside all day
a couple of week before that i watched notre dame get slaughtered by texas a&m
it was a really hot day and kyle field
where a&m plays
is the loudest outdoor stadium i have ever been in
there was 0,0 people there and 0,0 were die hard texas a&m fans
i kept pretty quite though
the only thing i had to cheer about as far as the irish was concerned was that they won the coin toss
everything else was down hill from there
it was a complete domination by a&m
the apartment is starting to get organized
it is hard to take two 0,0 square foot homes and move them into one 0 square foot apartment
i've thrown a lot of stuff out i hope i wont need again or i hope i can replace easily if i need it
how are things with you
are you guys getting out much these days
anything new and exciting going on in your life
i hope all is well and i find myself missing you guys a lot
have one for me
jon
i would love to be included
thank you
thank you very much for looking into this for me
i look forward to hearing from you regards
jon
this should supply you with hours of endless entertainment
it is fun to use as a tool to mock you associates
love jon
how are you doing
i know i have been delinquent in sending you a note but there has been a lot going on these days
the move still is not quit complete
i still have things i need to do up there and i probably need to do a weekend trip to get everything cleaned up
i ended up selling you curio
sp
cabinets and keeping you tv
cabinet
hence i have a cheque for you that needs to be sent
or picked up if you like
the move has gone pretty well all things considered
we managed to fit two 0 square foot homes into one 0 square foot apartment
it kind of has the cluttered eclectic new york apparent look to it
you know the same as your basement in summerland
nothing major got damaged
in the move so that helps
i still have to switch over my car registration and insurance
and we all know how much fun that is so i've been procrastinating
i've done a couple of fun things since being down here
i've gone to two college football games
one at college station to watch texas a&m beat notre dame
and one in austin to watch the university of texas beat colorado
they were both day trips about two and a half hours from houston
so the drives were not that bad
its just kind of neat to be in a stadium with 0,0 other fans
it is truly amazing to hear the noise that can be made by that many people
two weekends ago i watched the texaco grand prix of houston
this is a car race similar to the ones they have in vancouver and toronto each year
there are two canadian drivers in this racing series but both of them had a bad day
one of them crashed and the other finished way back
the highlight was that enron had sponsored a car just for that race that was doing very well up until the second from last lap when it crashed
oh well
at least it was fun to have some one to cheer for
and it was a pretty nice day to sit out side and drink a beer
work is hard and not going as well as i hoped
but i think i just need to give it some time
enron also has been in the news a lot these days for all the wrong reasons
it sounds like one of the
way high-ups
had a questionable kick back deal with enron that has come under attack
the board of directors has been sued by shareholders and all the regulatory people are starting to ask questions now
it looks like my plan for early retirement is out the window as our stock price this year has fallen from a high of $0 to $0
so much for getting stock options as your bonus
anyway
the world trade attacks have not really changed much down here
there seems to be more hype than anything else
you know anything the media can latch its teeth into rip apart
i'm actually getting tired of all the rumors and fear mongering that is going on
i figure if my time is up
than so be it
but i'm not going to spend all day worrying about it
its a waste of energy
i hope the new job goes well
i'm glad to hear that your back working
i was starting to worry about you a little
you know what can happen when people lock themselves in their house and don't get out enough they tend to stop going out all together
anyway
its time for me to start working so i have to go now
take care and have fun at your new job
love jon ps
i lost your address in my move
could you please email me your physical address so i can mail you the money i owe you
thanks
are you going to the hospital today or would you like to run
scott
here is the unwind structure for 0/mmbtu of the boston gas deal
could you please set aside some time tomorrow to discuss the costs and residual risks that would be left after unwinding this deal
i would like to include gerry and howard from our calgary office in this discussion so they can brief you on the current status of cal pine
below is a couple of slides that show the unwind
regards
jon
if so
what time
dale
thank you very much for hooking me up with stephen
it seems that he will probably be able to help me move some of my stuff directly to the us
could you please see that the address on my current accounts with rbc gets changed to my houston location so i can receive statements going forward
the correct address is
jonathan mckay 0 texas avenue
#0 houston
texas
0 thank you very much
regards
jon
i'll be there
fred
i just wanted to say thank you for the golf on saturday
i had a really good time and enjoyed playing your course very much
you should be very proud of it as i think it one of the best laid out courses i've played
thank you
jon ps
hopefully we get to play together next time
jeff
good to hear from you
things down south seem to have taken a turn for the worse
enron keeps making headlines
and not in a good way
it looks like the market is going to test the big e and make sure that we can handle a little adversity
life down here is ok
i am still trying to get settled
living with the girlfriend is going pretty well except for the two cats she has
i can not stand them
and if i could find a way to make them disappear i would
cats are the most useless
dirty animals in the world and her cats prove it everyday
anyways
i've been doing some fun things down here
i have gone to a couple of college football games
i saw texas am crush notre dame
and the university of texas kill colorado
both
games were fun to go to and the weather was nice for both of them so i can't complain
i also went to the grand prix of houston
that day was also nice and it was fun to watch
but as far as car races go it was not that exciting
the winner lead start to finish and no one was close all day
the two canadian drivers both crashed relatively early so even trying to cheer for people from the homeland didn't go that well
other than those few days the weather has been pretty uncomfortable
hot and sticky
its like sitting outside and watching the rodeo
you just don't feel clean when you get back inside
trading has been hard
i've been on a long cold spell and i need to turn it around soon
but
it always looks its darkest before dawn
bring on the light
i hope everything is going well for you
sorry to hear the ladies are not plentiful
usually that is one of the big upsides to going back to school
good luck on you exams
i'm sure you'll do fine
regards
jon
how is everyone
mother
child
father
i hope everything went smooth
are you taking this one to hockey practice or dance class
include me in the mass e-mail when you get a chance
jon
i am still sick as hell
but i thought i would try running today any interest
i'm in
i can't refuse a free needle
are you a father yet
if not do you want to run on the treadmills or play squash tonight

hello
i was just dropping this note to see if anyone was interested in getting together for the rice owls homecoming game against tulsa this weekend
game time is 0 pm and i thought we would get walk-up tickets
eveyman for himself
if people are interested we would have a little tailgate party prior to kick-off and watch the 0-0 owls
undefeated at home
kill the tulsa hurricanes
drop me a line if you have interest as i am trying to get critical mass
jon ps
please invite anyone that has interest in coming along and bring your kids if you have them
glen
so its time for monday night football and i was thinking about how you'd hitting on some waitress at hooters
ahhhhh those were the days
how are things going
what's new in the world
things here seem to be running there course
remember the movie wall street where they arrest
bud fox
for insider trading and it is the beginning of the end
well i think bud might have worked here
and the whole company seems to be coming down with him
i don't know if it is getting much press in canada but the mighty enron has fallen on hard times and we are in the process of merging with another company down here as a way of staying afloat
we seem to have run out of cash and can't pay the bills
visa and mastercard are maxed out
its kind of got me soul searching and i'm trying to decided what to do next
i can stay where i am and wait and see what comes of the merger
but its kind of like sticking with the expo's
no one is certain what the future is
or
i can try and jump ship
catch on with another gas trading company
but the problem is the grass is never as green on the other side of the fence
hence the soul searching and dilemma
anyway
i just thought i'd drop you a note
see how things are going
dolphins seem to be doing ok
0-0
life could be worse
i'm going to tampa bay for american thanksgiving and kind of looking forward to the couple of days off
and i'm coming to calgary for christmas
i get in late friday the 0st and head back to houston sunday the 0th
maybe we could get everyone together and go skiing one day
drinks at minimum
anyway i have to get back to work
i hope all is well in cow town and say hi to one of the waitress for me tonight jon
sorry i missed your call last night
i had to pick-up my car
any interest in exercise
give me a call if you can make time
jon ps
nice articles in the wall street journal and ny times
you can't send this to my work
send it to bjenkins0@houston.rr.com
thanks
jon very funny though
had to send you that email
company policy

i thought the stamps were out of it
just want to make sure we are meeting at 0:0 am to run tomorrow
regards
jon
dale
thanks for the email
i would be happy to pay the 0.0 fee one last time
however
given that this account will not be touched and no changes in the accounts holdings are allowed under canadian tax law given my status
we need to find a way to either avoid this fee in the future or transfer the holdings to somewhere else
i would much appreciate your recommendation on how to proceed as well as an address as to where i should send the money for the outstanding balance
regards
jon
hey jean

thanks jon
hey jeff
how's it going
things down here are actually very slow
they
upper management
are still trying to figure out what to do
in the mean time no one is trading
i sit around most of the day and play games
i keep waiting for some instruction about what to do next and nothing is being said
the old hurry up and wait
beth's
my girlfriend
whole department got let go the other day
she is still there until christmas doing the clean-up but
come the new year she is going to have to try to find a new job
things down here could not have gone worse for her
i feel real bad
because in a way i had a part in her moving
but there is nothing i can do about it now
are you an unsecured enron creditor

jon
hey

i'm pretty sure a couple of guys could sneak away
is there any chance you could make it
jon ps
sorry about the conversation during the run yesterday
i was just trying to let you know what was being tossed around on the floor so did get blind sided by it
hello

jon
dear mrs
kemp
my name is jonathan mckay and the reason i am contacting you is with respect to obtaining sponsorship to become member of the local cfa society
i moved from calgary
canada in september and i am not familiar with anyone that belongs to the houston chapter
i obtained your name from the aimr website and would appreciate any help you could offer me as far as sponsorship or putting me in contact with some of the local members
i have completed the third level exam and need this sponsorship in order to obtain my designation
i can be contacted at

or via email at jonathan.mckay@enron.com
thank you
jon mckay
this is why we have to run
frank
by not being able to trade c$ denominated products we would not be able to trade most of the physical products including cash
one month
index gas
or be able facilitate long term structures
having said that
if the time period for not trading these products was only 0 days
they could get past that without any major damage being done
it will take longer to get physical contracts in place in canada than it will financial
the extra time the canadian office would have before it traded physical c$ products would allow them to obtain a critical mass of trading counter parties
if it was going to be 0 or 0 days
then there would be problems
i hope this helps
let me know if you need any else
regards
jon
i thought since you wanted to talk
we would skip going to dinner to night
we'll go tomorrow with tom and miranda
and the real reason for canceling is
i'm going to play golf
i have my cell phone if you need me
jon
i am interested in moving to the enron center or if nothing is available to allen center
i work in enron center south and my company number is 0 and my cost center is rc 0
regards
jonathan mckay
john disturnal
why
glen
your alive
glad to see you are still around
what's with the new job
for me the new job is obvious
we started playing a drinking game where every time the name enron was mentioned you had to do a shot
minutes later i was fired for drunken insubordination
sometime in the next 0-0 weeks i'll start working for ubs warburg
union bank of switzerland
i'm hoping working for a swiss company may finally get me out of the middle of all the conflicts
terrorism
enron
anthrax
no one should want to harm the canadian working for the swiss company
actually
my division was sold to ubs so the transition should not be that hard
mostly the same people
but on a much smaller scale
if i could make the same amount of money for ubs i did for enron last year
i'd finally get the bonus i've always been looking for
anyways
i'll keep you posted
my email hasn't changed yet
but i'm sure it will
if you need to get in contact with me try
bjenkins0@houston.rr.com how's the personal life going
i hope all is well
jon
ginger
jeanie slone informed me that you would be able to help get my last two pay stubs
i am in need of these in order to get a new work visa and any help you could offer would be greatly appreciated
thank you
jon
thank you very much for all your help
jon
i hope this works
i guess i'm not sure what you are after
do you have an example of another one that i could work off of
if i had a better idea of what kind of thing were suppose to be included i could probably get you something else
are we after more words or more duties
jon
through terminal server
hey stephen
glad to hear the funds finally showed up
it would be helpful to me if we could hook back up together in the next little while
i'd like to get your opinion on a few different thoughts that i've had
i need to do some
financial planning
so to speak
let me know how your schedule is looking thanks
jon
sorry the system would only allow me to send them two at a time
could you please save them where brad can access them
thanks
jon
hey
this worked
have a good day
we are on
thank you very much
and please thank mr.fox for me
i really appreciate your help with this
best regards
jon ps
thanks for the tickets
it looks like it should be fun
just a quick reminder
we have a meeting scheduled for 0:0 pm today to discuss how tco works
it will take place in room 0 and come ready to talk about your area of expertise
regards
jon
due to the popularity of this meeting we will have to move it to 0
sorry for the inconvenience
jon
it was good
i went down around noon and hung out for a couple of hours
it is amazing how excited everyone is for the texan's to start up
thank you very much for the tickets it was a lot of fun
it seemed like everyone but me knew who they were going to take in the draft
look for a check the next couple of days i plan on sending you $0,0 that i would like you to put with the rest of my cash for now
thanks again
jon
hunter
after talking with my father regarding new members for our weather team he sent me the email below
sorry there isn't a better lead
however
i did notice that each of these websites have a place to post job opportunities
should we be posting something
just a thought
regards
jon
scott
do you know who i need to contact to get the odbc driver installed on my computer
i think you were right in pointing out that it is not on brad's old box
thanks
jon
see below
so do you think things are proceeding well
my guys tell me we are just about finished on our end and will be getting ready to beta test
how are your folks doing
i think the note i sent to steve plus the fact that he came to see me and i told him he was out of line are enough
we will not support the app
it seems kind of draconian to shut off the flow of information
as far as wireless in general it has never been a high priority for me because we never had a commercial basis for proceeding other than
gee
wouldn't this be cool
i think it is time to reassess the wireless angle
in terms of what it would cost to build
who would build it for us
and what we would get from the project
i'm going to ask dave forster to do that
comments
let's let govt
affairs get some more info before doing anything
stranger than fiction
let's discuss
talk to matt motsinger for that information
he is in charge of the reporting for that
if we accept
then yes our ipe shares get converted to ice shares
yadda yadda yadda
the c0 guy's note is just more e-commerce blather
i don't know whether he would add any value or not
but would definitely add buzzwords
thank you for the note
we are evaluating the potential value that techspan could bring to enron
we will contact you when are ready to enter into a dialogue
once again thank you for your interest in enron
andy zipper vice president
okay
but you're still sleeping on the couch tonight
please see revised market assignments
addititions are highlighted in blue
no interest
thanks
i don't know
i need to meet with gm from 0:0 to 0:0
so the early offsite slot works for me
thanks
can you schedule and send out the following note to the enrononline origination group
please attend an origination meeting on tuesday
may 0 from 0:0 to 0:0
the focus of this meeting will doing a walkthrough of an enrononline demo for both enrononline hosted products and x-online hosted environments
this demo will cover all relevant functionality of the system
similar to what we have been presenting to gm et al
send to
dave forster michael bridges bob shults dan diamond jake staffel john allario john pavetto mike haney leonardo pacheco carl carter cc:greg piper
mark palmer
okay
it wil be bob shults
i will put him in contact with joe
please call joe robertson of enron metals in ny to discuss market-making deal with the comex
this is the underlying deal
it needs work and i am not sure we would do it
also
no straight through processing would be allowed for our deals
i agree with kal
i believe the attached note accurately summarizes our position
we do not see anything changing
the deal remains terminated for the reasons below
i declined to review drew because i feel i haven't really spent a lot of time with him
the times i have worked with him
he has done a great job and been easy to work with
let me make this clear
accenture is not to speak to anyone other than ourselves regarding what they are doing with enrononline
we ahve too much at stake right now
thanks
yes
and i would you and i to chime in as well
vin
glad we could hook up yesterday
the gist of what we are interested in is providing enrononline's liquidity to local nymex traders
i would like to explore the concept of nymex's clearing corp or another clearer standing in the middle between enron and these locals
enrononline's architecture provides for a master user
such as a clearing corp
to set up as many sub-users
local traders
as it wants
each sub-user has trading rights as designated and controlled by the master
we would envision the clearing corp
handling it credit arrangements with the locals
and negotiating its relationship with enron
i know this is pretty simple stuff
but every long journey starts with a small step
please let me your interest in pursuing this sort of arrangement or a variant thereof
thanks
andy zipper vice president enron corp
please review the spreadsheet
and look at daily deals graph
justin
the traders are free to use any platform they like
i do not approve or disapprove
they are in the best position to make that decision
it is ews policy however that someone from amita/lara's group be the master user to montor activity and control what access agreements we accept
thanks
andy
lara
you need to be the master user for the platform
it is ews policy
go ahead and get set up and coordinate document acceptance with justin
guys
let's get together today to dicuss demo
i would like to demo full capability
including option manager
i think it is very important to also set up an interest rate product
perhaps a swap that is quoted in rate only
no need to convert to dollar ox just yet
given that the guy who is building their commercial paper platform will be there and seems to be one of the main judges of the merit of eol i think it behooves us to slant presentation that way
i'm good from 0:0 to 0:0 andy
thanks
damned things never work
millionth trade
eric graff @ coral
tco pool day gas
someone on scott neal's desk
openlink is one of the leaders in risk management systems
we used at coral
and it was then called abacus
it is strongest in front office risk management
i would view their competition as kiodex
the deal with duke has been around for awhile
frank
thank you for bringing your team down to houston to demonstrate the new version of the system
we appreciate the effort that houstonstreet has made to upgrade its system
however in our view insufficient progress has been made to change our decision to terminate the posting agreement
once again
thank you the effort your team put in and let's stay touch
andy zipper
mike
that's fine
but no loi is to be agreed without enrononline's concurrence
if you want to do something without us
go right ahead but if we are to be involved then we need to approve and be involved in the deal from the get go
bob shults is contacting joe in ny as we speak
thanks
andy zipper
we will do on monday morning
but i don't think we need jay involved
kal will be finishing mine shortly
please be prepared to do the 0 hole punch thing 0 times
thanks
okay
fair enough
he would be perfect for the role
but i understand what you are trying to accomplish
what about london
it's fine with me
can you send david lebow in ir a copy of the above report on electronic commmodity trading
thanks
let me if you receive this email
good
i'll attend briefly
but you can run it
we will only be able to get kiodex the customers eol trades as per the agreement
if the customer so desire they can ask us to send their non-eol trades to kiodex for processing
but that is outside the kiodex/enw agreement
same plan
cool go for it
close enough for 0 0's
no
no interest
i know steve murray quite well
add barrick gold to your list
they like enron
and bruce garner has had extensive discussions with them
what would be the product the sabre would list
i like the name but can't see the business idea
help me out
where are we at with them
please work with the group so that i am no longer inundated with erequests for additional mailbox space
how does this relate to what we are working on with them
when will we have a draft available fo distribution to accenture
unfortunately i will not be attending
but i would like to participate via videocon
this is my simplistic first take
bloomberg has come back to the table with us and are being good boys so far
so i don't have a problem issuing them a enrononline journalist id to view your prices
thanks for the cooperation

hickerson does not have any products up yet
i need to find out from bridges where we are with cargill
he has been in meetings all morning
i will revert when i know
0
to be honest i think we are nowhere with dow
but i have left that to berberian
i haven't heard a peep from anyone on this
i will find out
0
i think it is 0/0 on gm
they clearly are interested
but are not very clear on what they are trying to accomplish
they do want to make markets
i think our best bet is an eol product hosting deal
but their internal process will be excruciating
next step is they will meet with alan engberg to discuss listing 0 to 0 petchems on eol
0
i have not been moving forward on service level contract because i do not think it really adds any value at the present time
0
i do think we should seriously consider the case for charging an access fee to eol
this should not be viewed as a commission
0
i spoke with vin viola of nymex and he is interested in pursuing this idea of clearer as credit sleeve for locals
he is tough to pin down and negotiate with but we will run this down by end of next week

re:kiodex
it is coming slowly as we have a lot of things on the development/testing schedule right now
0
as you know we are in receipt of the ice api
we have not been able to do much work on it given 0
i did confirm that dow is now an asset deal with no interest by dow in enw products
i think we should look at what everyone else charges per commodity
i.e
ice
and think about tsomething that is at least 0% of that
and it shuold be labelled an access or system maintenance fee
a bit of good news
ngpl has confirmed that they would like to do a 0yr product hosting deal on enrononline
$0k initial startup plus $0k per year and $0 per transaction
so total value not including per transaction is $0k
i think they get 0 products
but forster knows the details
it's a start and the crew here is pretty pumped
i'm trying to get a lieutenant of viol'a to work with but it is hard
patience
let's meet on monday to talk about what we were going to do on friday
i am in the office picking up some stro's tix
it sure is quiet for a saturday
creepy
congratulations
now let's focus on closing the deal and getting someone else signed up
well done all

reuters will give us 0% of all subscription revenue
which is how the product is sold
this is on a monthly or yearly basis
phone
0-0-0 pager
0-0-0 good luck
let's you and i get together for lunch today
and do the same with brad tomorrow
i will be participating by videocon
this is where we are with banks for fx product hosting on eol
please put greg piper
phillipe bibi
and greg whalley on distribtuion list
thanks
i have had you added to distribution list
sounds kind of vague to me
i think we should stick to known publications who we think add value
in case you guys didn't have a copy
done
have we heard back
sorry for the delay in getting back to you
but you know how things are
i have tried to get someone in the npc to talk to me but to no avail
i will keep trying but don't hold out much chance
a big mazel tov on the engagement
married life is the way to go
i heard about sonny
oh well
i didn't really know him that well so i can't say if that was a loss or not
i heard alex is now with allegheny power
although i assume that is in nyc not hagerstown
md
take care and give me a call

this looks fine
please distribute to accenture

would you like me to fill it out and return it to you
sorry for the delay i will have my check tomorrow

we are sending our bid and offer prices to reuters for most us gas
power products
as well as european gas and power
crude and refined products
bandwidth
coal
emissions
weather and sea freight
we will receive 0% of all revenue reuters collects from subscriptions to enrononline quotes
it is an evergreen 0 yr contract with mutual termination rights upon 0 days prior notice
we are under no obligations to provide levels of service
revenue expectations
reuters will charge
initially
$0/month/desktop
they have 0,0 energy desktops worldwide
with a more realistic assumption of 0% penetration the yield to enron would be $0,0,0 p.a
this revenue does not include the incremental benefits
in our view
of branding and standardization of our product and liquidity in the marketplace
in the future i could see us adding a transactable api to the product through reuters
which would enhance the ease of transaction by reuters users
if you have any more questions give me a call or drop me a line
can i get a reuters screen as well
i met with jeff sprecher of the intercontinental exchange for almost an hour and a half and thought it would be a good idea to bring you up to speed on where they are heading
0
we now have the complete api to them
but it is hooked up to their test environment
they will be sending us a contract to sign before they connect it to their production site
he assured me it will be the same contract that all the founders have to sign to get access to it
esentially
if we trade or provide prices the api will be free
if we are voyeurs then we will have to pay for it
0
he stated that charging commssion is not a denfensible business model
they will try to make their money through mid and back office services
0
their purchase of the ipe is directly related to implementing 0
his vision is to use the ipe infrastrucutre to make all derivative trades cleared and then use the fcm's to fulfill the back office movemment of funds tasks
in a nutshell he beleives the fcm's are all interconnected and used to moving money around for settlements and margins through the clearinghouse
so why not expand their role
0
when i expressed some skepticism about 0
he asked if we would like to participate in a forum with other ice members to discuss shared mid and back ofice services
i told him we would
if anyone has any questions about this let me know
please
next steps are he gets me a contract for the api
and lets me know when they are meeting on mid and back
let's table this for now
too much going on
on another note
where do we stand with tfs
heard you had ended up at allegheny
in nyc or hagerstown md
drop me a line
i want to discuss something with you
hope all is well
andy
the propoer contact at enron for you is jay webb
he can be reached at jay.webb@enron.com
i will foward this to him
good luck

over to you
i need this deal closed by month end
why are we bothering with loc
i thought we had moved past that
why wouldn't we use the deal bench auction platform
this provides for open auctions with participants changing their bids in real time
no
not enough of a background in finance
thanks and keep trying
stewart
it is my strong belief that kiodex will be most successful in marketing to fortune 0 corporations
these companies have extremely large portfolios of derivative products to hedge various financial risks but do not view running a risk management system internally as core
i am interested in your thoughts
and how
if you agree
we can influence the company in this direction

on another note we went live with tq yesterday
unbelievable huh
we did one trade with tuscon elec
the first day and today we did three
all with pg&e
who happen to own 0% of tq
pretty lame
on a good note
we hit a record today with brokerclient
0 trades

other interesting note
we launched reuters on monday and the nymex wants to put it up on one of their huge wallboards
they would buy a block of desktops to cover it
bad news is that
john arnold
my new boss in approx 0 days
with some justification thinks this is a bad idea
he will lose the ability to arb the floor against the otc
my view is that this will go away anyway as enymex and icex do the same thing
what are your thoughts
hope all is well andy
please check with me prior to traveling to conferences
thanks

send the resume to them

i've asked bob to be the business side representative to work with operations and it in getting the kiodex project off the ground
in addition he will be pursuing the channel partner opportunities with them regarding product and environment hosting services
on the sales channnel effort he will work closely with dave forster
looks good
what are vector's major receipt and delivery points
claudio
i am still in the process of setting up what we are going to look at and how
but it will very definitely be options focused
i think the three major drivers we will care about will be gas
power
and weather
i am particularly interested in the relationship of how gas and power prices react with weather
one trade i am interested in is gas daily options that knock-in based on an observed temperature for the particular delivery point
what are your views and what would you focus on if you were me
thanks andy
jeff said he does not have access to trade emissions allowances
if he indeed does not
please turn him on for those
if he does
let me know

i understand
however my request stands
i would like a heads up whenever you are planning a trip like this
it is the same i ask of all my direct reports
thanks
john
on the first note
ok
thanks
on the second
i would like the senior person on each team
and they know who they are
to figure how to divvy up the tasks based upon their teams relative skills
you guys need to figure it out
with my help
right now we are a little heavily staffed for what we are doing and i am trying to find ways to cope with that
this is one
your cooperation is appreciated
thanks
i realize that traveling to see a client is part of our job
i would just ask that we try to spend those expense dollars as efficiently and conscientiously as possible
thanks
mike's thoughts on subject
what is
exactly
the state of play here
i nothing else happens
on monday does the product go up on the wallboard
has eddie quoted on px to the merc
i need to have my facts straight when this becomes a pissing match between whalley
arnold and lavorato
thanks
are we talking to greatlakes pipepline as well
do we have a contract in front of them yet
harry's comments
he has a valid point on the volumetric suspension issue
i think he will launch the product but ask us to put this in the development queue
greg and philippe having listened to the dealbench presentation at our offsite and after discussing with jay
i would like to propose the following with respect to dealbench and enrononline
0
the most valuable pieces of business functionality dealbench has are the data rooms and auctions
the first might have some going concern value
but probably not much
as intralinks
the king
only generates $0mm in revs per year
the second
auctions
while of value will probably be given away by competitors to get other business
0
the technology as a whole is not severable right now
and probably not ready for prime time
thus the chances of getting a bid for it as ipr that is above the costs of doing a deal is minimal
we have some knowledge of this from our offline experiences
recommendation
enrononline's auction functionality is very thin
dealbench's has a lot of good business logic built into it
while the code might not be up to our standards
it would be of value to integrate it into the enrononline platform
this way we take advantage of the superior enrononline brand and not reinvent the wheel as far as business logic is concerned
there will be some development needed to integrate and rewrite the dealbench auctions piece to accommodate the single enrononline login
as well as change the look and feel to an enrononline one
but this should be well worth it
it is my strong belief that there is an untapped market for energy and commodity based auctions that enrononline should own
as a part of this move we should re-deploy dealbench's auction marketing force to attack this space
which furthers the general commercial goals of ene
as opposed to something that now is fringe at best
thanks
yes
but the other shoe is that we should shut down the rest of dealbench
if not
we will need to make large costly changes to the infrastructure to keep it going
i talked with greg and he and bibi are for it
start the process with guadaramma but keep it close to the vest as it is not official with the dealbench folks
thanks
wasn't me
do we want to make this official
give raj a call
i do not want my name in the article
please use greg piper's or phillipe bibi's
thanks
thanks for the note
awaiting your review and response

we would definitely like to get this finished by end of june
we can move as fast as you need us to
ideally i would like both sides to get together early next to hash out any differences
how does this work for you guys
thanks
my pleasure
claudio
i agree with you
the first bullet point will be easier to implement
generally i have found that there is sufficient divergence of opinions amongst wholesale players that you can get positions on that you want
my goal would be to fulfill the function of both bullet points
i think there are pockets of risk management of complex relationships around the firm
but no group dedicated to it
clearly we will need quantitative rigor to serve those functions
questions
i am familiar with quantos from my banking days
where a usd interest rate option pays off in a non usd currency at a fixed exchange rate
what is the specific structure of the options you are looking at
regards
andy
you're right he does look good
i am very interested
can you set up a phone interview
and if that goes well bring him down for rounds
when you get a chance can you gice me a call re
the above and natsource
i'm around most of tomrrow so any old time is fine with me
thanks andy
thanks
i agree
the whole thing is a sham
fyi
any help you can give us would be appreciated
thanks
thank you
stewart
i base my opinion on 0 years trading and marketing risk management products to corporations
when i was at bankers trust
every corporation we dealt with would ask after completing a deal
can you tell us where we can get a cheap off-the-shelf system that we can use to manage these things
the problem kiodex has is exactly what you describe
with companies that where trading of derivative products is core to their mission
the third party asp model is an extremely difficult one to sell
there are all the obvious reasons
security
reliability
continuity etc
what kiodex needs to focus on
in my opinion
is the intersection of customers who need the product but don't view the function as critical to their operation
for what it is worth
andy
i agree completely
we are the delivery vehicle for kiodex

there is no other way to get out of the window though

0
i don't know what you folks have in mind but i could see leaving ene's market making and trading structure intact and having dyn's asset-based trading be just another business unit like ees was
but the key is the tremendous cost savings of the common support platform
i don't mean to be presumptuous but i hadn't talked to you in a while and wanted to get it off my chest
good luck

there is a lot of confused bullshit floating around
mooney's are great planes and are very fast
i almost bought an mse a few years ago
which subsequently was called the allegro
then the eagle
they are really well built with no incidents of inflight airframe failure ever
drawbacks are they are quite small and there is a cloud over he comapny as it is in bankruptcy
the bankruptcy isue is around whether the supply of parts will be available going foward
they are probably being discounted which makes it a good buy
idon't think the parts issue is a real one as someone will step in to take over the manufacturing

our treasury guys are either not available now or are not working anymore
so for getting the term structure of enron's funding costs for 0/0/0 i probably can't deliver that today
i still think your money desks and corporate traders could give you a pretty realistic picture of that
i will keep trying though
andy zipper
dave
i am being told that the books and records of enron's trading units are on aggregate marked off of a cost of funds curve
i should have that curve to you first thing monday morning
sorry about the delay but it is hard to get certain things done in a timely fashion around here right now
andy
i'm considering this terminated
i would be happy to
and yes you may use my name
rick
i've been thinking about this
i think 0 mos
for the average tenor of a trade is way too high
for john arnold's book it would on a prospective basis be more in line with 0 months
we would probably not make markets online on anything past 0 months for nymex gas and the vast majority of our trades are in the first three months
i think the same would probably be true for power
but i haven't spoken to those guys about it
for the nymex book gas i made the following assumptions
average tenor
0 months average trades per day
0 average volume per trade
0,0 mmbtu with 0 trading days you and up with a gross unadjusted notional of $0bn
this is simply 0*0*0,0*$0.0 you then have to adjust down for the expiration of trades during the year
if the average life was 0 months you could halve the number above
which would be conservative given our 0 month assumption
that takes you down to $0.0bn
$0bn/0
the next adjustment would be to factor in netting for counterparties
you are trying to estimate the net open interest per countperparty
i am working on those numbers as i write this
it stands to reason that the net number for nymex gas deals would be less than $0bn
when you factor in other gas trades and power the number would rise and i will look at that
as a basic method
does this start to get you to where you need to be

i don't know if bob hillier talked to you yet
but i need stack and option manager set up on a stand alone machine
i am moving to the power options group as of tomorrow
my cell is 0 0 0
call with questions
jay that makes sense and is the right solution
however i floated it by rob benson and dana davis and they felt that having to have another product up on the ir screen would but just too much
go figure
so they agreed to let me auto hedge to the base product and 0 min qty 0 increment works for me so we will run with that for the meantime
the non web visible route is my back up
i'll let you know how it goes
thanks andy
i will be running the power options desk with ubs

about that
theresa
what's your idea
let me consult my partner and get back with you in the morning
okay mister
team chick hasn't been in the superbowl every year for no reason

thanks
theresa
genaro
we have fixed the pricing in our system
please re-draft and let me know if there are further discrepancies
thanks
theresa
megan
i'm not sure why this is showing up
i think it must have something to do with the name change from enron midstream to crestone
let me pull out my oct 0 file and see what invoice # we finalized then because i'm pretty sure they paid us
i'll try and get to this later today
thanks
theresa

i would assume this week sometime
thanks
theresa
gloria and megan
here is the crestone gathering service and fuel sale for september 0
megan
do you finalize the fuel sale to crestone
i'm having a brain freeze today and i can't remember
call me if you have any questions
theresa
crestone should not be charging us for ua/0
unaccounted for
our it-0 contract is
all inclusive
which means no fuel or ua/0
walt and scott will be fixing our statement and our # in the system is correct
we will forward it to you as soon as we get it
theresa
please call me if you have any questions
thanks
theresa
valerie
the prices look fine in sitara
i cannot figure out where these prices are coming from
do you know who we could contact regarding the input of these prices into sitara
if cig and cig gd
theresa
i'm glad
i'm very sorry about that mix up
thank goodness we only have one more month of this deal and it expires
we did not re-new it
talk to you later
theresa
gloria
amy felling here is working on current month and i'll continue on prior month variances

mom
that's sounds fine to me
would they go horse back riding that day or a different day
where they live will there be things for the kids to do
it sounds like they have a lot of kids around so there should be things for them to do
i talked to jan this morning about a bigger cabin and the 0 person one is the biggest one
she called and reserved another 0 person one for $0
i'm gonna call tim and let him know that he and dawn can have that one
i'll call you at work too because i'm never sure if you get these e-mails from me
theresa
ladies
here's the revised september purchase
thank you cheryl for bringing this to my attention
sorry about the mix-up
thanks
theresa
alan
i'm not sure that our purchase is equivalent to the $0.0 purchase but i assumed you received an e-mail from amy felling in our office
here's the september purchase for september
let me know if you have further questions
thanks
theresa
real funny
was our purchase tied to this wire your accounting group received
this new counterparty is the old
kn gas services
counterparty
they just changed their name a contact would be lori leyda at
0
0-0 thanks
theresa
the only thing i'd like to add is the quantum purchase for november is 0,0 mcf not mmbtu
we are showing a 0 btu factor so it would be 0 mmbtu at the wellhead less fuel
any additional gas would be under imbalance between crestone and quantum
thanks
theresa
my husband jeff and i are planning on attending
do you know if we are getting any special rates at any hotels downtown for that night
let me know
thanks
theresa staab

count me out for this round
theresa
gloria
thanks for the heads up on 0/0
i'm printing the report right now and i'll get with amy tomorrow
she's out today
if you would like to look at august that would be fine
i would just like to stress that changing any receipts will affect our purchases and likewise with our deliveries
if you could define the differences first then maybe i can lead you to where the issues are
how does that sound
i also think by doing this it will get you familiar with this pipeline and maybe in the future you could take this part over
it's just very confusing at first
let me know
theresa
i'm sending the invoice/statement via e-mail
let me know if you can't open it
the crestone oba imbalance is the summary we started on showing the discrepancies on the receipt side
a lot of it is rounding from the crestone spreadsheets to our
whole
numbers we put into the unify system
the other imbalance report is on the 0rd tab of the enron statement report
let me know if you have any questions
and how might you want to be involved
what did you need to do to finish 0/0
we have about cleared the interconnect issue for 0/0
theresa
gee thanks barry
you know i must say it's been a while since the packers have had to worry about beating the bears
it's kind of fun to see an old rivalry back again
the bears are pretty good this year and if the game was in green bay i would really bet on the packers but i'm just gonna hope they can beat them in chicago
i hope we'll get the game here in denver
go pack go
do you care to wager anything
the deal was nominated and cut to zero
amy
i just now opened my e-mail
0:0
i've been trying to figure out where you were because i saw the capacity reports and the gas daily
i thought you left to go get breakfast
darn
i hope you feel better
i wouldn't worry about coming in today
ty needs to work on our model before we could start anything anyway
see you tomorrow
theresa
fyi
medicine bow incremental firm capacity effective 0/0/0 is up to 0 from 0
as far as the maintenance tomorrow
adele said they won't decide on cuts until after 0st cycle and then the cuts will be based on nominations
i'll let you know after lunch
theresa
rita
scott sitter
crestone
and i have been working on this
scott has been trying to reconcile with fugg on the 0/0
0/0 imbalances
then we can take it from there
i forwarded this e-mail to scott to see when we can get together to finalize this
i will get you a complete summary with all the backup as soon as i can
my guess is the last week of november
0st week of december
scott is out most of this week on vacation and i'm out next week
i'll talk to you soon
please let me know if you have any questions
theresa
gloria
i was looking at path manager and it doesn't look to me like they even pathed this can point
let me know what you find out
mark bergeron at woodward is expecting a call back from us
paul lucci
today
thanks
theresa
the invoice they received must be based on nominations
right
i think we could probably do +.0
we bid +.0 last month and i think he said
0 won
what do you think
ena will bid cig gas daily +.0 for the lost creek fuel volume
0
0
thanks
theresa staab
gloria

0 through january

we got sierra an outfit from old navy
and i think she'll like it
talk to you soon
i didn't see the attachment
that's still not that great is it
it probably won't be available until after the holiday
the reason i say that is because we haven't received the bill from public service yet
are you out any time from now until the end of the month
i'll have amy watch for it for me and get it over to craig lipke if it comes in while i'm gone
i will be out starting tomorrow until wed

she said she isn't seeing it on a
paid invoices
list so she's still trying to get it resolved
she said it would probably be after jan
0nd since so many people are out of the office until then
i haven't seen todd or wayne and i didn't see an invoice on my desk from them

0-0
thanks again for thinking of me
theresa
mark
i'm sure you've already noticed this
but our cell phones have been disconnected
i thought maybe we could pay for the bill on a credit card and turn it in on an expense report
susan helton is trying to find someone to get guidance from as far as getting this bill paid
she said in houston they are no longer paying for parking or cell phones but she wasn't sure about satellite offices
she would hate to see us not get our expense reports paid
i'll keep you posted
mark
susan said to go ahead and expense the cell phones
i called at&t and it was 0.0 so i put it on my credit card and i'll turn it in
the phones should be on now
