biggest gamble to date has been the $0 million it pumped into cynet
the software outfit relies on a wireless modem that plugs in to a laptop or pc and lets you e-mail
fax
and use voice-and data-messaging
that may not sound like much
but imagine e-mailing thousands of people at once--or sending a document and following with a prerecorded message to tell folks to check their fax machines
cynet is also developing the ability to retrieve e-mail messages as voice mail on a laptop and to translate voice mail into e-mail
the investment helped launch cynet as the first african-american company to go public out of houston
how's it doing
not so hot
after the initial offering in january the stock jumped to $0
but it got pummeled in april and now hovers around $0
it has yet to recover
still
enron is holding on to its investment
now worth only $0.0 million
cynet holds the exclusive north american marketing license for teleran electronic's wireless modems
that's got to be worth something
compaq computer is using the technology to add high-speed wireless internet connections to its ipaq pocket
azurix water
unocal will announce higher that anticipated 0rd quarter earnings on 0/0
they also did not hedge their production
so are able to capture the higher energy prices

friday enron online basis numbers
our commercial group has definitely used the deal analysis system
the reports have been very beneficial in quantifying some of our recent transporting deals on transwestern
for example
we executed a one year deal for 0/day at our maximum tariff rate
which will generate $0 million gross margin
another one year deal for 0/day
also to the california border
will give us over $0 million gross margin
two other examples for 0 months each will generate an additional combined $0.0 million
hopefully this will justify our need for this system
let me know if you need anything else

happy holidays
dear tech support
last year i upgraded from boyfriend 0.0 to husband 0.0 and noticed a slowdown in the performance of flower and jewelry applications that had operated flawlessly under boyfriend 0.0
in addition
husband 0.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs
such as romance 0.0,and installed undesirable programs such as nfl 0.0 and nba 0.0
conversation 0.0 no longer runs and housecleaning 0.0 simply crashes the system
i've tried running nagging 0.0 to fix these problems
but to no avail
what can i do
desperate dear desperate
first
keep in mind that boyfriend 0.0 is an entertainment package
while husband 0.0 is an operating system
install tears 0.0 and enter the command <c i thought you loved me>
husband 0.0 should then automatically run the applications guilty 0.0 and flowers 0.0
but remember
overuse can cause husband 0.0 to default to grumpy silence 0.0
happy hour 0.0
or beer 0.0
beer 0.0 is a very bad program that will create snoring loudly.wav files
do not install mother-in law 0.0 or reinstall another boyfriend program
these are not supported applications and will crash husband 0.0
in summary
husband 0.0 is a great program
but it does have a limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly
you might consider buying additional software to improve performance
i personally recommend hot food 0.0 and lingerie 0.0
good luck

feudalism you have two cows
your lord takes some of the milk
fascism you have two cows
the government takes both
hires you to take care of them and sells you the milk
communism you have two cows
you must take care of them
but the government takes all the milk
capitalism you have two cows
you sell one and buy a bull
your herd multiplies
and the economy grows
you sell them and retire on the income
enron you have two cows
you borrow 0% of the forward value of the two cows from your bank
then buy another cow with 0% down and the rest financed by the seller on a note callable if your market cap goes below $0b at a rate 0 times prime
you now sell three cows to your publicly listed company
using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at a 0nd bank
then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get four cows back
with a tax exemption for five cows
the milk rights of six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a cayman island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to seven cows back to your listed company
the annual report says the company owns eight cows
with an option on one more and this transaction process is upheld by your independent auditor and no balance sheet provided with the press release that announces that enron as a major owner of cows will begin trading cows via the internet site cow
cows on web

weather trading energy and weather are so inextricably tied to one another that it is sometimes hard to separate the two
the demand for power is directly related to temperature going up in summer and going down in winter
if
therefore
you have an unusually cool summer
the demand for power will be much lesser than anticipated
and the same in case of an unusually warm winter
several electricity utilities enter into power purchase agreements based on anticipated demand
and would face serious financial losses in such cases
weather derivatives provide such companies an option to hedge against risk of weather fluctuations
it is no surprise
then
that one of the conferences more lively discussions centered on the presentation by tom fletcher
head of weather trading for mirant
in describing weather trading
fletcher reported the market has grown exponentially since it was first formed in 0
fletcher highlighted how successful trading requires purchasing the right product
he went on to describe some of the sophisticated products being launched and how mirant is integrating weather risk into their overall profile and what that means for the traders on the floor
with presentations from other market leaders such as centrica
i-wex
spectron
aquila
liffe
mirant
bewag
aon and entergy-koch
weather trading europe provided three days of the latest developments in european trading
the conference touched on key issues surrounding the sector including liquidity in the weather market-where is it and how to access it
data issues-the state of play in european weather data and how you can best utilize the information you've got and a host of other topics designed to help attendees leverage their skills
as weather trading takes its place in the online world
there is a pressing need to develop greater use of weather derivatives from corporations to avoid the market becoming a predominantly speculative industry

system operations notice text
all shippers letter #0-0 date
0/0/0 time
0:0 a.m
mst subject
system operations the purpose of this letter is to inform northwest's shippers of how it intends to deal with the upcoming maintenance announced by questar pipeline at clay basin and by transwestern pipeline at its la plata facilities
questar pipeline has announced it will shut in its clay basin facility from april 0
0 through april 0
0 and will then perform withdrawal tests on april 0 and 0
0
during this time northwest will have no access to clay basin
additionally
transwestern pipeline has announced that its la plata compressor facilities will be shut in from april 0 through april 0
0
and will accept no deliveries from northwest pipeline
during the month of march north flow volumes through the kemmerer compressor have exceeded capacity on a regular basis
with clay basin shut in
northwest's balancing flexibility will be significantly impaired
northwest will have no place to inject excess gas south of kemmerer and as a result cannot physically accommodate overscheduled volumes
if north flow volumes continue to exceed kemmerer capacity during the questar and transwestern maintenance
northwest will take the following steps to maintain the reliability and integrity of its system
reduce line pack on the south end of its system prior to the maintenance
cut north-flowing alternate gas at compressor station cut points from la plata to meacham as necessary to mitigate high line pressures or overscheduling through kemmerer
take all necessary steps to ensure that gas deliveries from receipt points south of the meacham compressor closely approximate confirmed nominations
entitle for undertakes or overtakes
as appropriate
and finally
if required
northwest will issue operational flow orders
if net scheduled volumes north through northwest's kemmerer compressor do not exceed physical capacity
northwest will have much greater flexibility during the clay basin and transwestern shut-ins
northwest's customers can help themselves and reduce the likelihood that kemmerer will overschedule by securing adequate gas from canadian suppliers or by using their jackson prairie storage during this work
northwest will make every effort to reduce the impact on its customers of the clay basin and transwestern shut-ins and will be monitoring the situation closely
northwest will take every opportunity to relax system restrictions in later cycles if north flow volumes moderate
northwest is confident that if its customers respond prudently
the impact of the transwestern and questar maintenance will be greatly reduced
if you have any questions
please contact your marketing services representative

dad
shelley
we need to make sure mike knows of all the ramifications of this entire deal

both babies were real fussy and we had to work hard to get them down
i did a pretty good job with jason
i look forward to you getting home for turkey day
dad
i recieved the same document
if you would distribute it to the committee that would be appreciated
i would think we might want to discuss it at the board meeting prior to setting up another meeting with eei
what do you think
i can see pros and cons of meeting with eei prior to the next board meeting
depending on the strawman i feel we are beginning to lose key support from the board to work this matter
bill we need to get the board to continue to follow him if we are to make progress
good morning
thanks for the yahoo greeting
it made my day
have a great day
remember that cathy and carol's birthday is nov
0th
i sent them a card and a $0 check to go out to dinner on us
i signed it from all of us
hope you don't mind
they would enjoy an email from you
love
dad
thanks for the strawman
i would like to discuss it at our gisb board meeting on december 0th
any problems with doing that
we have distributed to the board committee only
my initial reaction is there is alot we agree on but there is much we do not agree on
let me know about the board meeting
also
this board meeting will be my last as chairman
i do not know what role
if any
bill boswell
the incoming chairman
would like me to play in the future in this effort
stan
it should be the chairman's choice but i would favor a houston location
also
please strongly consider having the board meeting on tuesday afternoon in lieu of the golf outing
you might just get some board members to attend at least one day of the annual meeting
stan
i am aiming for next wekend
i need one more weekend to get the soreness out of my knee which i messed up by playing too soon two weeks ago
thanks for asking
thanks for remembering their birthdays
drive carefully
see you sometime this weekend
i think we should try to keep alot of this out of oour emailfiles
based upon your representations i see no conflict and wish you well in your new job
ditto
busy morning
my condolences on the loss of your grandfather
please let us know if there is anything we can do
stan
you are beginning to realize that time goes by awfully fast and we had better enjoy what we are doing while we are doing it
you never get another chance at today
end of my phiposophical analysis of life for tday
you are welcome to the car
i will try to bring it tonight or better still can your mom bring you over to get it tomorrow
either way is ok
daddy
steve indicated to me that koch has a 0% interest in the company
thanks
seems like everyone had a good time
happy holidays
a's always please me
you seem to have applied yourself this semester and i am pleased
congratulations
thanks for the note
my policy is that i do not interfere in the hiring practices of my direct reports other to ensure that ets is complying with all enron policies and procedures
i suggest that you contact jerry martin
phil lowry and gary smith
good luck on your search
stan
will do
thanks
i have asked wilson barbee t0o see if he can provide any assistance to you
i do hope you find something that meets your qualifications
thanks for keeping me updated
stan
i can play on sunday morning this week
my eldest daughter has a horse show that i need to be at on saturday
next week i could play either saturday or sunday
please let me know
looks ok
looks good
this looks ok to me
i agree with jim
it doesn't cost anything to listen
i agree with most of this but have found from experience that if you give originators the freedom to pursue deals with little restrictions the deal flow improves dramatically
for eott
we want to pursue acquisitions of energy assets period
we do not need to limit ourselves to the crude oil business
in fact a portfolio of assets would likely reduce the companies overall risk to crude prices
second
we want to avoid any additional exposure to commodity prices
therefore
fee based business structures are the best fit
that would include pipeline acquisitions
crude
liquid
natural gas
co0
etc
as well as fee based processing
non-qualified income based aquisitions are also ok as long as they are fee based-type deals 0ie
electric generation
terminals are also an excellent acquistion for mlp,s
does this get to your issues
thanks
who is playing on sunday besides me
a report would be fine
you two are the experts
i will see you at 0 am on sunday
i am looking forward to playing again and to seeing you after almost a month
thank you for sending these reports to me
they are informative and timely
by the way
did you get randy horton's power of attorney form
she has asked me to invest some of her excess cash and i executed the form and thought she had mailed it in
please let me know
thanks to you and david for the outstanding service
stan
good luck to you
hopefully i can get out there this afternnon and see you ride
i love you
daddy
this looks good
thank you
i heard you are scheduled for another interview
good luck
just a note to say good morning
see you this afternoon at eott
stan
the board of directors of gisb decided yesterday at their quarterly board of directors meeting to continue discussions with eei and other interested groups regarding the formation of an energy standards board
stan horton
gisb's chairman
stated
while there are many differences between the approaches advanced by gisb and eei
there are also alot of similarities
gisb is hoping to respond to the stawman advanced by eei by the end of january
gisb is also seeking input from other interested industry segments on the two proposals which have been advanced thus far
thanks
please just call cindy stark to get on my calendar
i would warn you that i cannot see expending money for such a book since i do not see any value that would be added
it would be nice to have but i was turning down painting projects on our pipeline that were in the $0k range during oour budget cycle
stan
glad you finally made it
good luck on your legal exam today
get some rest and start studying for wednesday and thursday exams
the finish is close at hand
enjoyed taking you last night
i like the time alone with you
saturday
i have a haircut at 0:0 so we can start shopping at 0 or go early and be done by noon
let me know and send me your mother's list
dad
there is sure alot of scheduled activity where there is no revised completion date or a note that it is completed
can we get an update
i am very pleased and wish you all the best in your new job
please keep me updated on how you are doing
i guess this will make your holidays a little better
stan
caron mentioned it to me but we did not have time to talk about it
i will talk with her this weekend and see what she has to say.hope everything is going well

the press release looks fine
great
just what we needed
i am glad that everything worked out
good luck in your new job
thanks
glad you had a good time
john and i agreed that we would not send the letter at this time
in reviewing the key items of your business review with jeff skilling
he had some issues with your new broadband business
please provide me with some more detail as follows
it was mentioned that we had spent around $0 million thus far on dark fiber
how much of the resultant capacity has been sold
are we laying the dark fiber at risk
in other words are we taking a long position in dark fiber
what is our capacity situation today
do you have a business plan for this new venture
ie what is the anticipated capital expenditures annually for this venture
who are the customers
what is the expected return
what is the payback on our investment
etc
who approved the formation of this new venture and the capital commitment
anything else that will help me get a clear understanding of what we have and where we are going with it
love you too
i wrapped mom's present
it is ready for you ton pick up
gave mom your allowance this morning

daddy
yes
i will do whatever you would like to do
saturday is fine
let me what time and i will be there
i have no specific plans
dad
thank you
sorry about the admin gaffe
i think the best way to handle this is for you to get with mary joyce and her team and work out the details
i think the last item may be of some concern
if there are issues that can't be resolved between mary and you i will gladly get involved
does this sound like a good plan
tuesday works for me
this should be the first major step to getting this done
let me know if i can be of help
i am glad that your mom is happy
it means alot to me
sorry you are not feeling well
i'm not either
i have not felt well since i gave blood on friday

dad
unfortunately
work totalled interfered with my plans to go to the masters last weekend
i was so mad i didn't even want to play golf
i am over that now and would like to play this coming weekend
i can play saturday morning
need to finish by 0pm
or sunday morning
i will be out of town wednesday thru friday so just let cindy know if anyone can play
have a good week

if the sales representative from the jaguar dealership calls please get in touch with me
have a good morning
the boss
good morning
i'm at eott
talk with you later
stan
i would love to come and participate
i think the best i can do is come in the night before and perhaps
attend the night game and then do the golf tournament the next day and leave after the dinner
talk with dave about who i should be paired up with
i would like to play with either him or mike mcgowan also
tell dave he stood me up last year but it was worth it
probably replacing ken harrison with myself is the right movr
please go ahead and handle making the necessary changes
thanks
i checked with rick buy's group on where they were on the raroc analysis of your proposed broadband project
they aren't doing anything according to rod who checked for me
it seems to me that we need to do several things to either kick this into gear or to put it on hold pending completion of a sale
0
we need to find out from mark metts if this deal adds any value to the transactions being proposed
i will talk with mitch and mark about this issue
0
we need to determine ebs interest in this business
ie are they a buyer or seller of portland metro dark fiber
if they want to be in this business wouldn't it make to develop this project as ebs and not to include it in a sale
0
a project of this size will take jeff's approval
the projected phase i capital is above my threshold
i will talk with kevin hannon and mitch and then get back with you
sound like a plan
i am here
i will leave the office about 0pm
i'll see you this weekend
good luck on your test on thursday
dad
would you please look into this and advise me as to whether we can do this
also
rod hayslett is checking with michael anderson on whether wessex would like to perform certain billing and payable functions for enron europe
who is going to put our presentation together
i will give it if you and bob feel that is the right thing to do but i just do not have time to put the presentation together
stan
please advise
fyi> responce requested
thanks
i go to washington dc tomorrow morning returning on wednesday evening
i will not be in the office either day
do you want tickets to astros game on friday night

louis with mark mcguire

you are always prepared
good luck
daddy
good luck and thank you for a job well done
if you need my signature you should get it by noon on monday or it will have to wait until thursday
the red rock expansion needs to get approval at the may 0st board meeting
the procedure is to submit it to the finance committee of the board for approval
assuming the finance committee approves the project they would recommend it to the board for approval
by this memo
i am requesting that rod coordinate with rick buy to get it on the finance committee agenda
i will be in town for both the board meeting and the finance committee meetings
if formal presentations are required at the finance committee we can decide who should do them
it is my understanding that no presentation needs to be done at the board meeting
i will check with jeff to see if he wants a formal presentation to the finance committee or if he will do it himself
the engagement letter was mailed last week
if you do not get it by tomorrow please let me know
thank you
thanks for the update
i agree that getting the past amount will take some time
thanks for the update
going to one of the power desks was a good move
experience on the desk will prove very valuable in the years ahead
i hope you made your dad pay a premium for those peakers
stay in touch
since we are in the process of trying to exit this business the answer from enron wind would be no
you might want to contact condy plson to see if the idea has any value to enron
i agree
there have been way too many surprises from this group lately
i will do whatever i can
joe is a real good person
besides i think you could become a very good regulatory analyst for us and joe would be a wonderful teacher
i hope everything works out for you personally and professionally
i have the tickets
invite some friends if you want because i have four tickets and no babysitter
perhaps your mother would like to go
have a good day
sorry i have been so busy this week
daddy
congratulations
it totally made may day also
i was coming back downtown from eott and went down westheimer
when i passed the old apartments i lived in for awhile all the bad days came thundering back and i just about lost it
so you made my day
thank you

daddy
the letter looks good
it is factual and correct
contact joe and suggest that he meet with you while you are there or i could do it for you
let me know
i w0ill take them over to your mom's or leave them with debbie
if they are not at your mom's
they are at my house
ok
are you sure lohitt is the right person to do this job
what about eott
no one at eott even knew that steve was leaving before i told them last week
communication skills are crucial in this job and i never thought that was one of lohitt's strong skills
that is not the issue
by putting us in the middle between gtb and solar we would be the ones that would have to resolve any differances between the wo if the unit does not function properly
the whole deal gets complicated since there is a design engineer
oerator and equipment manufacturer and we get in the middle between the equipment manufacturer and owner
if the unit does operate properly
everyone will point fingers at everyone else
i have seen this happen coutless times on ee&cc projects
why do i want to take this risk on an international project that according to jerry's own numbers gets me about $0,ooo in current perios earnings and another $0'ooo deferred over many years
it just is not worth the time and risk for that kind of money
i think phil lowry agrees with this assessment also
i waited to get you one until they worked out all the kinks
see how thoughtful i am
i assume you have taken care of this and jim is available immediately
looks good to me
the information should have been sent to you by now
i was out of town last week
sory about the delay
email is a great way to comminicate on this
thank you
i will call you tonight to catch up on the prom etc
orlando was ok
nothing great
by the way
dk
the twins and i will be in florida june 0
july 0
when are you coming
we will need to get plane reservations asap
this is the entire conversation that i did not send previously
glad you could join us
great idea
if you are bored go work out
that is time consuming and good for you
that is fine with the credit card
if you work out it is ok to go shop and put it on the credit card
just not too much
by the way dk's birthday is april 0 and the jj's are may 0
no one expects presents but it would be nice if you got dk a card
she is taking your car in today to be fixed
daddy
friday is fine with me
i am not aware of any other conflict with schedules
i suggest we go ahead with the meeting
glad you could make the trip
the game was awesome
our tickets were directly behind homeplate
debbie said she could see me on every pitch and knew that i left the bootom half of the 0th inning
she said i never picked my nose once on camera
pretty good
huh
have a good day
talk with you later
by the way
your car is done
they had no problem removing the oil filter at all
they only had to wriggle it a little bit
love
daddy
short and to the point
no changes
sounds good about the car and the horse show
where is david staying this weekend when he comews up
i am not sure i approve of this

right now
we are concentrating on disposing of all azuriz assets other than wessex and buenos aires
john garrison and michael anderson are handling getting ca's executed and books out to the respective parties
just contact michael directly about getting this kicked-off
thanks
i agree
i suggest the following
joe
we need you to go give a pitch to massey's assistats about what is going on
next jerry halvorsen has scheduled a lunch with massey in two weeks
he has invited me to attend
what do you think
no
the gp contribution is enough
i don't want to go to jeff for another $0 million
after giving it some thought i think just naming debbie as executor and agent is the best course of action
debbie is fine with this approach
thank you
i will be in attendance
i will discuss your recommendation to seperate pge from enron's health and welfare benefits with cynthia barrow and mark metts in the near future and will get back to you once that meeting is over
i can play
that actually works well for me
contact lou pai
he is heading up our new xelerator program that is looking at new business opportunities that are outside of our mainstram businesses
the list looks complete
0 days is acceptable
this is extremely important to us
we cannot afford a communications or performance breakdown
i am looking to you to insure that one does not happen
thanks for the report
just what i needed
thanks for the report
just what i need
the normal process is to have him interviewed by three members of the executive committee who then confirm that he meets our requirements for being an enron vp
i assume you are asking us to agree to deviate from this process
i am uncomfortable with that due to the fact that if the process is not going to be adhered to anyone can nominate a person for vp based on the strength of an individuals resume
if everyone else agrees to the exception i won't be the one to hold this up but i don't necessarily agree with the exception being granted
what is the subject matter you wish to visit about
i'm glad you had a good weekend
i am taking dk out to dinner tonght so i won't be home
dad
the list looks complete
0 days is acceptable
this is extremely important to us

i am concerned about long-term yields increasing which would mean bond prices decreasing
doesn't it make since to go with shorter maturity dates ri0ght now
go ahead and post the response to gas control issue

my daughter has a horse show
we own three arabian horses that she shows
in fort worth in mid june and i will try to get up there for at least some of it
unfortunately i am not going to be able to accept your generous offer to attend the indy 0
my wife and i have 0 year-old twins and i was hoping to get our nanny to pull some week-end duty to help my wife with them as i went to the races
unfortunately i was not successful in doing that
leaving her to look after two infants while i attend the races didn't seem right
thanks for the invitation
i am on for golf on saturday if anyone is interested
tom
can you make the t time
saturday morning early is better for me
0 to 0.:0 am start
q0 earnings report looks very good
congratulations
i will keep it quiet until you are sure of the numbers
we should let causey and hayslett know for planning purposes asap
given the recent events related to the proposed sale do you think it is even worth discussing the benefits issue with corporate
also
have we finalized all of the divestiture/retention deals
have a good week
thanks
thanks for the report
anything you need help with
did all the compensation issues get resolved with gary and you
for your information
i still think we can do better than this
after returning home and reviewing the material handed out at the pge business review
there are two areas that i think i need to understand better
the first is pge's energy positions going forward and the financial exposures to changing prices
the second is the rate case
i would be happy to return to portland to get a more in depth review with a much smaller cast of players
i am open to suggestions from you
given the status of the divestiture process
jeff wants to make sure he
and subsequently i
have a good handle on these two important issues
thanks
you and i need to sit down and discuss in some detail john ale's contract and yours
let me know when a good time would be
thanks
peggy
that all sounds very goo
i will attempt to get educated first and then we will set up a meeting

thanks for the note
o agree these items colin and you are looking could be good for both entities
it was so nice to hear from you
i am glad all is well

please let us know as soon as possible after the geraldine delivers

my best to you and your family
anything i can do to help
rick causey came to see me asking us to firm up our q0 numbers

if so by how much
debbie has to be downtown for other reason on may 0th
could you meet with her about 0:0pm at my office
i will schedule a conference room for your meeting with debbie
perhaps yopu could come around 0:0pm and i could go over any and all changes that i have on tem prior to your meeting with debbie
looks ok to me
the madera project in california should not be going forward

thank you
approve
please handle
corporate comp is relooking at your contract based on our converstion
ieyou would be entitled to severance payment eqyual to 0 year salary and bonus should you decide to leave the company provided that all or substantially all of the azurix assts other than
wessex and azurix bu0enos aires are sold
i will meet with jim derrick today to discuss john ale
with regard to beckett and glasford
their agreements provide for retention bonuses provided they stay until september 0th
if they voluntarily leave before that they get nothing
there is no employment agreements in place that link anything to comparable positions titles or anything else
should we move them over to enron in director positions and they are subsequently offerred positions elsewhere in enron
once we dispose of non-wessex and aba assets
at director positions
then they have a choice of accepting those positions or voluntarily terminating
since there is no contractual agreements with these two i do not want to offer any kind of enhanced severance payments to them
i have contacted ben glisan regarding glasford and he is polling his people about their view on an appropiate placement for him
i will talk with you when you return
thanks
peggy fowler should have someone from pge calling you
if they don't please let me know
i will be there
thanks
i bought 0,0 units of northern border partners at $0.0 with part of the proceeds
the roughly $0k is correct
thanks
any ideas on the cash
i was thinking about $0k in munis and $0k in s&p 0 index fund
your thoughts
please follow-up with jeff as soon as possible
let me know when someone has contacted jeff
thanks
thanks

group have seen the financials before releasing to ubs

i will make the tee times and let you know
steve

i cannot play on thursday but thanks for letting me know

i am usingdfswtl@swbell.net
could you double check this with steve for me
thanks
i have no such studies
i will look into this myself
i just wanted to make sure you guys know everything i do
actually this is somewhat bullish considering past legislative attempts
cindy double checked
we are ok for 0:0 on sunday
i would appriciate if you would send to me each week the pge position report
also
at your convenience i would like to spend some time via telephone to run through the report to make sure i understand just what is being reported
i'll have my assistant call to set-up the phone call early next week
also

i can make a t-time but i am not sure what we will get at this late date
i have secured a tee time for saturday at 0:0 am for the new course
if i hear from steve or tom that they have a tee time already i will email you

daddy
it sounds like the due diligence with ubs is going fairly well with no real surprise
the news is good on indian mesa i and ii both on the deal with aep and the financing
the real target is completion of the project on time
i am concerned about slippage again on q0 due to the greek project slippage and german installations being behind schedule
i am looking forward to seeing the q0 numbers very soon
what is the issue on the l&s gearbox and what is the potential impact on 0 earnings given your statement that if we do not pass the test
it will present significant problems for 0 us sales
let's talk by phone this week if possible
i will know our schedule better next week
i would hope we could execute before the end of june at the latest
i will email you again on monday
thanks
it is a bad day getting worse
any more questions about how i am doing
if it rains i am going out and standing in it because it will mean my day is actually improving
talk with you later
daddy
yes
please go ahead and send the documents to david
the name sounds ok to me
better than eottmtbe<lp et al
first of all congratulations on completing your degree
having completed my masters degree by going to school at nights and saturdays while working full time i know first hand the commitment that takes
i suggest that you work through mary ellen in trying to find the right position
she knows gary smith
vp of hr for ets
between the two of them they should be able to offer you the right advise
keep me informed
dana wins
q0 needs to be on plan
work hard
count me in
see you tomorrow
i don't like the answer tho the last question
can we add that under the agreements we could cancel as early as
date
but no decision has been made with regards when actual termination would occur
how much does putting out the newsletter cost
how often are you proposing to put it out
does it replace any other newsletters
is there any new information in the newsletter or just restatements of what ken
mark and greg have already said
need to make sure we have included brian stanley's group in what constitutes egs
especially nepco
lets try it and then try to gauge whether it is accomplishing anything
i believe our employees are on information overload and putting out another newsletter adds to the overload
i have always believed that if we have an effective corporate newsletter we don't need these subsidiary newsletters
meaningful information can be included in the corporate newsletter
at ets we used to have periodic fyi newsletters that were directed at key topics we needed to cover
you and i also need to do a budget review
the cost i am hearing from your group are to big for egs to support
i had truly hoped that gina's group combined with you and perhaps one other person could cover egs
gina's group was covering ets and eott
i think adam has a pr person so we need to find out what pr costs are in the wind company
also nbp's has there own pr person
please set up a meeting with cindy and tracy
thanks
i have it on my calendar and debbie would like to come also
the plane can only fit so many so be careful you don't over invite if they are counting on the plane for transportation
thanks
i hope you are exercising reguarly given your chips
salsa
dip and beans
i am having lunch today with el paso's ceo for their international group
byron kelley
the meeting was set up to discuss el paso's public positions in brazil and the problems orlando was having with them
i will add your concerns to the list of items to discuss and get back with you
stan
do yyou mind ig i give the attachment to byron kelley
i met with byron kelley who runs el paso's international business
he is an old business aquaintance that i had not visited with in several years
byron assured me that he would stop the type of press like the article you sent
he reiterated although that el paso has had good success in dealing with the government in a very private way and did not want to publicise any differences that they may have with the government from time to time
he was willing to stop the press articles that defined differences between el paso and enron in their approach to brazil but had no desire to join enron in publically trying to effectuate change in brazil
the meeting was very friendly
let me know if i can be of further help
hope all is well with you and you and your family
yes
with everything that is going on it would be prudent to hold off pursing any acquisitions at this time
thanks
congratulations> job well done
congratulations
i hope somebody else draws my name then
please call me tonight and five me an update
good luck on the mythology test
ask julie to play with us
i could play sunday if that would be better
the wall street has some good articles
read it every day this week
glad rose and you are doing good
busy day for me
lots to do
call tonight
love
dad
we definately need to talk asap
please call cindy or call me at home 0.0.0
with regard to 0
and 0
the answer for now is no for now
between rod and tod we will keep you covered
you will have to work double load for a while longer with regard to americas-gm
the o&m makes sence
go ahead
i will explain all this when i talk with you
it looks good to me
jack urquhart has inquired as to his continuing role for providing oversight of the trojan decommissioning
i think he sits on the review committee
please give your thoughts on this
i think we need someone from enron on the committee but given jack's changing role he may or may not be the right person
please acknowledge receipt of this given our email difficulties
thanks stan
looks good
i think we should add to the letter
each year the chairman of the natural gas council has to privilege to name two individuals to the council
the experience you have gained as both a state and federal regulator coupled with experience working in the private sector makes you an excellent addition to this years council
a similarly worded phrase could be added to rick's.thanks
calm down
the operative word is it has been put on hold
these are not normal times
no one saw this coming or we could have planned better
give us a few days to figure everything out
we just made the decision today to preserve cash while we were waiting to see what was going to happen
thanks for your cooperation which i desperately need right now
too bad about the saporito's
it's tough to see a family break apart
it was nice that ours could stay together even if it is non-traditional
you know how much i care about your mom's happiness and welfare
too bad about your week coming up but considering the two weeks i have had you get no sympathy
i will be here late tonight
love dad
get the wsj early tomorrow
i agree with your last sentence
thanks for helping us through this crunch time
watch the news tomorrow
big day
call me
long term investors get rewarded
hang in there
you haven't lost until you have sold
be careful not to let your losses turn into long-term losses
short-term losses are treated as ordinary income for tax purposes meaning uncle sam absorbs 0% of your losses
then buyback and hold for a few years
hopefully you know what this is about
done
great
your thoughts
i think this is a good summary of where we are
0
qf status
mirant is willing to provide a legal opinion that it meets the qf status under the ppa if it is required to close
0
a market report should be issued by mirant today as to the reasons they have only been able to secure $0 million instead of $0 million in insurance
hopefully this will satisfy the lenders
0
mirant's proposal went out today on how to protect the lenders if the sho is extinguished
0
mirant and ge have agreed to a closing checklist and fee coverage
things left to do
0finalize all documents 0
receive underwriter approval on the resolution of all insurance claims
0.agree upon mirror guarantees with enron and mission relating to the union carbide guarantees
jeff donahue informs me that cfsb feels secure that this deal will close on december 0 but not before
the reason is that there are ppa bids that need to go out by that date
let's keep daily status reports coming
if i have misrepresented anything in the summary
please let me know
i'll be fine
thanks for thinking of me
i am more worried about the 0,0 people that work for me
tough time bro
i noticed yesterday that my hands were staring to tremble a bit
i think i need some time off when this is over
not too much time though
how much did i give dennis last year
thanks
steve has been a valuable asset for enron and ets which is exactly why other enron business units are so interested in his services
i made sure that steve knew that he could stay with ets
the decision was his
however
we must always remember that sometimes we need do what is in the best interest of enron and not just ourselves
thank you for letting me know your feelings
we will miss you also
glad we had you for the time we did
see you at the board meeting
stan
i will be there unless i have to work
for now i am ok
thanks
i made it clear to steve that he could have stayed
steve made the decision that was in his and the company's best interest
he has not contacted me about staying
thanks mike
that means alot
thanks
i have heard from just about all of steve's reports about retaining him
steve was given the choice to stay at ets
he made the choice that was in his and enron's best interest
steve is a quality individual and an exceptional leader
his talents need to be showcased and i think he understood that
i appreciate your comments on steve's replacement
we have finished the interviewing process and will make a choice in the next couple of weeks or sooner
your recommendation is appreciated
thanks again for the kind words
stan
looks like i need to cancel
my wife reminded me that i promised to take my daughter to lunch on saturday
she hasn't been home in a month and i would like to see her
can you play on sunday morning
if so i will try and get a t time
let me know
thanks
we are on for lumch
the guys wanted to play golf saturday at 0:0 but i told them i had lunch with you and couldn't make it
ok but you need to fill out the form and get it to cindy
if you need help call cindy
she can schedule the plane for you and probabley take care of the paper work
i would like you to get directly involved in selling the assets we have targeted for next year while overseeing the operations of mariella
pete and orlando
that is alot of stuff
however i will keep you in mind as we figure out who is going to be on the transition team
i will call him again on monday
do i get a commission
just kidding
i would like to discuss
please call tomorrow if possible
i think we should put a number on the table
supposedly but i am trying to get out of it
i will let you know
thanks eric
nice job handling all of this
we will discuss at the next staff meeting
thanks for bringing it up
any feedback from the floor meeting yesterday would be appreciated
as i said yesterday it is my understanding that we need dynegy's permission in order to engage in such discussions
i however have not seen the final merger documents so i may be mistaken
given dynegy's presentation to the analysts on monday it doesn't look like the want to divest of the pipes
this is greg's call
i agree the timing is awful
by this memo i am asking gary smith to see if this can be expedited in any way
please call cindy and set up a time for us to chat
if it would be helpful i would gladly to a phone meeting with your direct reports
are we sure we want to do a board presentation on my group
everyone is so busy doing a presentation is not on anyone's priority list
if so do we want to just do the pipes or all of global services
good job
thanks ken
the dynegy folks took me to new york for the analyst prsentations and made a big deal about enron's pipelines and about me coming over
the only problem is they never asked me if i was planning on going over
i know their ceo and coo very well so i will probably have a choice
i would like to see this thing through
i committed in my current contract to stay until 0/0/0 so i would like to keep my commitment even though the options they gave me sign the contract are worthless
i do feel an obligation to help right the ship
my businesses keep performing well and are anchoring the ship right now
employees are pretty scared so having some key executives stand up and commit to stay is pretty critical
either way i will be fine
thanks for your concern
it means alot
stan
i trust everything is going well
please let me know if there is anything i can do
at the next board meeting i am sheduled to provide the board with an update of enron global services
could you have someone prepare a couple of slides on portland
one should deal with the major accomplishements of your group in 0
ie rate case etc
in bullet form
the second should be an update of the deal with nng
perhaps a summary of the deal and then where we are in the timeline of key events
call if you have questions
thanks
the board meeting is scheduled for december 0th
thanks mike
much appreciated
i am ok with the release and the mou
thank you rick
those were very kind words
everything will turn out ok
i believe that
thank you for your kind words
we will get through this and we all will be better for it
lessons are sometimes learned the hard way
i can't begin to tell you what my days are like now
unbelievable is the only way i can describe it
not much time to do anything
stress is at a record high
we will get through this though
dk and i will be going to the game tonight to see the lakers
talk to you tomorrow
love
daddy
thanks
you got the message correct
we will not accept a firesale price but if the price is fair we are sellers
it is a tough message to deliver but people need to hear the truth
i appreciate your efforts in arranging the floor meeting
any news on eco
i am sorry i did not get to you first and let you know
my apologies
i really appreciated your interest in the position and your commitment to ets
you are a quality individual and i respect you for that
thanks
my apology for missing the dynegy board meeting that ken told me today at
0pm that you wanted me to attend
i had my international team in for business and budget reviews and to discuss what
non-core
means since both dynegy and enron have labeled them as such
we need to keep these folks motivated to get us through the sale process
i couldn't reschedule them since they were heading home tonight
they are fine and willing to see this through
please let chuck know that i just had a conflict
congratulations on a very successful rollout with the analysts on monday
sorry i couldn't go to chicago with chuck but it appeared i would have been a detraction
i would like to sit down over luch with you when you have the time to see what your plans are
in the meantime call if i can be of any help
stan
the total bonus pool needed for egs is $0,0,0
the amount charged and paid by joint ventures is $0,0
the enron portion would thus be $0,0,0
this is a reduction of $0,0,0 for 0 bonuses charged to enron
i know it must be frustrating being a ocean away and not really knowing what is going on
i can assure you that at times i too feel that i do not know everything that is going and that is probably correct
i can tell you that jeff mcmahon did receive the offer from the royal bank of scotland at or around rab
i have supplied him the potential financial impact of enron accepting that offer
as of yesterday no decision had been made about responding to their offer
i suspect that a decision should be made early next week
i would appreciate your thoughts as soon as you can supply them to me
ken lay and dynegy have both characterised enron's investments in water assets as non-core which means of cource that they will be divested in due time
i would think that that would be the final straw that triggers the goodwill impairment
we all recommended that if enron could not support the goodwill remaining on the books then we should proceed with trying to sell wessex at or around rab
that is where we are right now
again
please send me your comments
i would try to keep this confidential since we have not yet made a descision
i am sorry if i have not done a good job of communicating with you the past few weeks
things are quite hectic as you can imagine
thanks for the update
do we have to pay them
thanks
i am not surprised that we asked to meet with them but i am surpeised that jeff did not mention it to me
communication here is not great
stan
no problem
prudent actions given the circumstances
i will await jeff's call
can you fill me in on what is happening with wessex
colin skellet has been notified that the potential buyer is coming here to have discussions with mcmahon
i need to get in the information loop if at all possible
thanks
quite frankly i am getting tired of memos like this
there has not been a decision not to provide short-term liquidity for enron wind
if there was i would have called
enron is in the midst of a liquidity crisis
i need the support of the entire team as does enron to help us get through this
i need you to see the bigger picture and to think of ways that wind can help
i need cost reductions
improved cash flow and support
thank you
what meeting on tuesday
no one has informed me of a tuesday meeting
i like it
thanks
from a valuation standpoint i assume case 0 would give us the highest multiple
the issue is is it doable
we have achieved $0 million last year
also
before we go further with project armstrong i would like to get whalley and dynegy to agree that if the discussions are successful we would do the deal
let's suspend these discussions for the time being
stan
we need to get this done
what other resources do you need to get this deal done
i know the value phil has brought to this effort
i also know his plate is full and i am glad you will assisting him on getting the eott problem under control
please keep me updated
yes the weather has turned somewhat colder
busy day
call tonight
love you
dad
given our limited corporate resources
can we cut the it newsletter
ken has forwarded to me your letter of october 0 wherein you asked how enron wanted to handle several activities which you are now engaged
trojan nuclear plant decommissioning
contract review for offshore sales and rep agreements and involvement in transparency international
ken has asked me to work with you on this
please let me know a good time to discuss
thank you
stan horton
thanks
to date i haven't heard anything from gisb
that is your call
i am trying to make sure everyone is looking at their group and properly assessing where we can become more efficient
you have to way the benefits vs
cost
i thought we should review the process with mark and jeff first
i will go ahead and invite either jeff or ray
thanks
that means alot
agree
we could waste alot of time with candover and not get anywhere
thanks mitch
i have 0 month old twins who could care less about my distractions
they are my stress outlet now
happy thanksgiving
this does conflict with a meeting i have in washington d>c> with nortwest natural that dick asked for
your call on rescheduling the meeting with candover
bummer on the test
let it go an do well on the next and it won't make a difference
you are welcome anytime on thanksgiving
i have some papers that you have to get notarized on friday
i have also scheduled to have you explorer for an oil change and lube job
i assume you have not done this yet
write back
thanks frank
i will look over the resumes but given enron's current condition we are not doing any new development projects outside of the pipelines and are relying on corporate development to assist with asset sales
given all that i don't believe i have a spot for anyone
quite frankly
i am concerned about keeping all that i have
given where we are i tend to agree with theswe statements
no problem at all
please set this up for monday
sorry but it is enron's policy not to comment on these types of things
rest assured that we have very experienced people who are evaluating offers we receive for any asset
thank you
ok
but please expedite
also
you should be aware that todd has informed me of his need to pursue going on short-term disability
we are looking at internal candidates to serve as the cfo for the interim period as we seek to seel enron wind
you will of cource have input into the decision
my first interview is monday with a mike miller who is in corporate development
i will keep you informed
i am glad it worked out for you
it will be interesting to see how things unfold in the days ahead
thank you frank
that means alot
good days are now impossible
congratulations on your test
proud of you
everyday is tough
i can't tell you what its like other than tough
love
dad
thanks
right now i know of no available opportunities but will keep you in mind
i think we should talk with them if the have the cash
however
i get very nervous when anyone would commit $0 to $0 million with limited due diligence
also
i would not want to announce anything until the deal closes
preannouncing a deal of this size isn't goi0ng to stabilize anything
$0 to $0 billion might get a different answer
as to your involvement
you made the right call
you have my permission to just refer them to jeff donahue
jeff is in the process of naming individuals to assist in the disposition of our international assets
corporate development
egas and investment bankers will collectively pursue the disposition
i woould think dr
boyce should be so advised of the process we are going to use
jeff or his designee can deliver this message if you would like
jeff
i assume this is the right approach given our converstion
i am ok with this
bill has done a good job
thank you
i feel i have neglected wessex and you with all that is going on
the truth is that john
michael and you are very capable of proceeding with little input from me
i did make sure with corporate development that michael had to be involved along with you and your team
communication here is not the greatest so please keep me updated
thanks
it seems we could be more responsive than this
gary
can you help
thanks mike
should have known you were in control of the situation
by the way
how are you doing with all of this
i am doing ok
needless to say i am disappointed but i am trying to provide some leadership
thanks for asking
please call to set up a meeting
we should include michael anerson in the call
there are updates that i need to provide you with
debbie
let me know if you get this
cindy
what is wrong
my blackberry did not pick up the email you were responding to
thanks
please make sure bob kelley is on the list
happy holidays to you and your staff
selling wessex is the rifht move for everyone
i am glad that things arew going well
@et me know if i can be of help
thanks mike
we all will need to do our best to get this turned around in 0
set up a meeting with cindy
can you get a card to send to morris
i doubt anybody wants that to happen
this issue is are we now at the point that enron wind cannot generate enough cash to meet its own requirements
please send pam benson the information for joe on where to send the check
who to make it out to
etc
another bit of background re frankfurt
see below
i would be a little bimore insistent on german consulate support than herr sturm suggests
otherwise this could become a black hole for your time
per my voicemail
i have also received regrets from horton
but confirmation from metts
anybody at the cftc or on the hill we want to send brochures to
i will attend
i wuold like to attend if my calendar is open
any problem
please advise don
i agree with mark's points
while we have advocated our merger with pge
which did not concentrate market power
we have intervened in opposition to most others
moreover
there is some hope that the german government will take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open access
we will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger otherwise
most mergers in this industry are defensive
not procompetitive
and
in my view
deserve no credit for convergence
innovation
or
we can create significant mutual benefit by partnering with a firm which is focussed on developing it systems for bulk power systems
we need to take our deregulation model to the next level of detail by having it solutions which will support our view of how the market ought to work
the it firm would benefit from our access to the policy makers
domestic and international
whose decisions will make the it firm's systems either successful or obsolete
call me if you would like to discuss
mary
see attached
there may be some press today about enron's involvement in the nepal hydro project
the government of nepal is hopeful that we will pursue it
but we are not going to
kelly's response on press inquiries will be that we are not pursuing the project
kelly will also be getting in touch with david howe
i just wanted to keep you guys posted in case you are getting questions
i appreciate you pressing this issue
you should both be aware that unocal
has been sued by the families of four employees who were shot in pakistan a couple of years ago
their claim is that the company did not provide adequate security and ignored official warnings of trouble in the region
please respond and copy me
a typical utility luncheon
i don't really have a problem with this
but i thought that all vp promotions were supposed to go through our year end process
that's what i have been saying in response to the inquiries i am getting
ken
being newly back in the fold
likely didn't know about the process
fyi
these are the items i left ken a voicemail about
i will be out of town that day
a meeting i can't move
please continue to let me know about future meetings
lora sullivan@enron
a
dedicated room
isn't as bad as it sounds
it would not be in use full time and the only equipment requirements are 0 screens
which one of the team rooms can accomodate
and a network connection
which the team rooms already have
let me know what you think
also
i talked to salisha about lara's move and it's ok with me
i think we were originally concerned that she wanted space we were setting aside for graphics
but she is actually moving deeper into her group
and next to her files
looks good
some of his questions suggest he's going to include a fair amount of industry reaction
which could be a mixed bag
some are clearly threatened by efficiencies in bw markets
looks like it will be a really good story
he definitely appears to be excited by it
yes
just make sure the working group leaders know
i won't be able to attend
let me know if i need to be hooked up by phone or if you will just brief me afterward
looks like a full slate
you're off to a great start
maureen
please put times and locations on my calendar as an fyi
typo in second paragraph
should be companies not company
is catherine working on environmental policy related to sustainability or is she working on greenhouse gas transactions
or both
i'll send it back on tuesday
it looks like enron japan was kept in the loop
let's keep it up
good luck
on the advice of my much esteemed spouse
i would like to express great interest in this group
thanks
please put on my calendar and call to confirm my attendance
thanks
am i taking care of you or what
terry was acting with full coordination from jose
the problem was this
daly insisted someone speak on behalf of the group to the press
and designated terry to be the one
terry did not have the updated information that we were about to meet with the government officials and deliver a slightly different message
i.e
that we needed to know if the government planned to really open petrobras or not
the implication being that we would work within either decision but we needed to know one way or the other
terry was simply not in possession of this information and no one had given it to him
probably because they had no reason to assume that terry would be thrust in front of the press
moreover
it's hard to see how terry could have taken such a position publicly anyway
by my eyes terry did the best he could and we had an unavoidable communications bust
i know the southern cone team is moving to make it right
but i see absolutely no reason to come don on anyone about this
please add terrie to the meeting with beth
bill
palmer
et al
fyi
okay
so i didn't know what a
drip
is
but now that i do
i'm sending this to you
fyi
any of the following would be great
prop ref no
tus-0-0
the last one on your list
i would prefer one with a tennis court in the complex
go ahead and book
thanks
rosie and sherrie
jeff ken and joe wanted to discuss the attached
joe
this is the same document i forwarded to you earlier
i'm normally not a big fan of conferences
but this one may be of interest
i think it may be of even more interest if we don't speak
it's possible some utilities may say some of the same things we would say
but they may be less likely to do so if we speak and they feel they have to respond
let me know what you think
what are our chances of final approval at ferc at the july meeting
jeff still thinks this is a third quarter close
do we have any chance of making that happen
my copy shows long term comp on the exhibit under
grant award
and yes
the date will be revised
forgive me if i have forgotten
but had you suggested a topic for our next advisory council meeting
i understood the
validation
process to be a fairly flexible name applied to a wide variety of approaches
what we specifically discussed
and what scott s
left prepared and committed to do
involved looking at individual curves
the assumptions underlying them and some process
yet to be specifically determined
for addressing updates
we agreed to start with the top 0 curves and especially those which are involved in the upcoming deals
i think the confusion is in what the term validation means
in the ena context it means one thing
in this context it means what we discussed
which was in jim's memo and
as you'll recall
we went through point-by-point
let's just get this done
let's process this request
i think it's justified
i need you to run these items by rick
i take full responsibility for approving the hiring of the hills firm
and i look forward to meeting with you and carla as we discussed
but remain hopeful we can use their services for something other than wto
in the wake of seattle
and as i have come to understand better what the wto can and cannot do for us on the energy services front
i have come to the view that our talent and money would be better spent on other activities
my inclination is to do the bare minimum necessary to keep the machine going
if we have specifically committed to certain things
then let's follow through
if there are things we can avoid
let's avoid them
specifically with respect to fischer going to geneva
why not have him available by phone at all hours to provide assistance and mage that known to usg instead of underwriting additional travel
with respect to the hills firm
can we use the retained time to help with the specific strategies we are now working out for the regions
these are the kinds of things we need to consider
i agree with rick
i know jose is tied up on current business
but his input will be important
to date we have been relying on legal analysis of required approvals etc
that information is essential but it is
as you know
about 0% of the issue
the far more critical considerations are how is the government likely to react on a political level and what can we do about it
i think our government affairs people are in the best position to make these assessments
do i need to do anything
i believe the only transaction i had was related to a set of shares which were released to me earlier in the year
some of the shares were sold at that time to pay the income tax on the distribution
we discussed this before and my recollection is i did not have to make a filing
could you confirm by e-mail
do you have an
alumni
list of analysts/associates in key positions at enron
i think the message christi prepared is great
check with her one last time and then let it go
congratulations
yes
you are
thanks for the message
that's ok
i was going to use it in the presentation
but it wasn't essential
was my talk what you were looking for
i believe it is timely to discuss this again and i agree with cynthia that stand alone legislation does nothing to address the essential transmission structural issues
i am open minded on the issue if someone can make a compelling case to support stand alone legislation
but my gut reaction is that it would be a serious mistake
congress would happily put off dealing with this issue for years if it passes reliability only legislation
i think the legislation itself makes little or no progress on our issues and may even set us back on making progress at ferc and in other fora
i realize that if this gets going it may be hard to stop
but it would be such a cynically ineffective approach to the real reliability problems that we should help whomever we can to put a stop to it
if it gets through committee
i have no confidence in this congress to actually amend it into something better and broader
so
again
i have difficulty seeing why we should go that route
i look forward to the discussion
cynthia sandherr@enron
any follow up questions or india press about the bloomeberg story i sent you yesterday
joe asked me to get in touch with you regarding indian media reports/inquiries on possible sale or sell down of dabhol and to discuss a possible statement in the event we get additional inquiries
give me a call
i agree that we need to add our customer contacts to the list
this gives them a great opportunity to look smart
we went to the market and got price protection
on the messages we need to include mark's top three
0
price caps cause shortages
rob bradley
let's put some historical examples together
i agree with mona
we need to include some customer contacts
it gives them an opportunity to look smart about going to the marketplace and getting price protection
the messages need to include palmer's top three
0
price caps cause shortages
rob
can you put together soe historical examples
0
better solutions are already available
and 0
short term politics makes for long term problems
on item 0
we need to talk about the competitive offerings to san diego
the fixed price offerings available at retail
and the availability of conservation and demand side management technology today
including its availability to the consuming public from existing suppliers
ie you don't need to wait for enron to make a consumer offering
i do not
enron energy services
preliminary congratulations
looks like a good plan
keep me posted
i think this is a great initiative
but it is critically important that any announcement of the panel makes it crystal clear that the objective of the group is to come up with standards to facilitiate competition
we will do nothing but waste time if it becomes a negotiation over competition
the best and politically easiest time to make that objective clear is in the original announcement
not after the group gets underway
can we get in touch with doe to make sure they pick this up
cynthia sandherr@enron
wow
was this expected
do we have someone who works for us now who was at transredes when the government owned it and could help us do a comparison between our respective environmental records
it seems to me that even though we are having our share of problems
we have probably had fewer problems than the government did and have probably been more responsive and thorough in our clean up efforts
obviously
we would need to be judicious about how we used such information
we don't want to aggravate the government
but having such an analysis may be helpful in showing the progress made and in discouraging overly punitive action by the government
what do you think
i still need to talk to you about our public message in india
i am on my way to calgary tonight
my hotel number is 0-0-0
thanks
thanks for the referral
we definitely want to get our story out to these guys
just for future reference
meredith phillipp is handling

let's add this to our daily distribution
we don't know yet
he has been invited and we expect most will show up
but we won't know until they do
enron energy services
in the underscored language added to the rto section i would insert
access to
between the words
planning
and
maintenance
cynthia sandherr@enron
let's take the opportunity
cynthia sandherr@enron
i do too
but i think you should send it with the appropriate caveats
which i communicated verbally to her
fine
looks good
looks good
i think you have picked the two most interesting industries
because energy and telecom both have natural monopoly characteristics
the government gets involved in economic regulation
not just the usual environment
safety
labor and other types of regulation which all businesses are subject to
that means that there is constant interplay between policy makers and the business community and that policy makers have alot to say about which business strategies will be successful
rob wilson@enron
my message was sent before i finished it
i think it would be interesting to focus your attention on this interplay
what policy changes have meant to companies
ie the winners and losers
and how explicit companies are about how government policy drives their business strategy in these industries
i also think it would be fascinating to compare regulators
visions for the industry they are restructuring with the reality after the fact
i believe you would find some similarities but also some substantial and interesting differences
good luck with your studies
my best regards to mike
i learned a great deal working for him
rob wilson@enron
thanks for the update
congratulations on your progress
please do send it out
thanks for the kind words
i know you know how i feel about your work and i have shared that view widely
i have enjoyed working with you
i always valued your insights
your responsiveness
and your work ehtic
i wish you all the best in your new role
these are good fixes
i still think it's important for our security people to be able to recognize all of our senior executives and make sure their guests get where they are going quickly
sherrie and rosie
jeff and ken both received notes from tom delay about designating portions of their contributions for use in texas
mr
delay would like them to make that designation using the letter below
note that it will need to be modified to be from each individually rather than a joint letter
it is
of course
up to ken and jeff whether to make the designation
lou
you may be maxed out on franks now
don't write a check for the august fundraiser until you have talked to eliz labanowski
if you think this is worth pursuing
get in touch with christie
offer him the job
rob bradley@enron
what do you think
i think you
or someone in your group
should cover this
the attendees are operations focussed and may be interested in issues such as siting
interconnection and environmental issues
also
from a more macro perspective
what kinds of demands the new industry structure may place on operators
the importance of flexibility in asset operations
ie the premium the market will place on quick response
or the challenges of different scheduling regimes between the gas and power markets
maybe we should knock down the walls of those cavernous offices on the topfloor
i think it would be useful to verify their view that they are really only 0-0 years from commercial production
ideally
we could get that confirmation from someone familiar with the technology but without any financial interest in its success
their technology pitch sounded good
but i don't know enough to recognize the potential shortcomings
i want to feel comfortable that you all feel this is real
then i would be happy to have me and my team spend some time with them
i'd like to get about 0 minutes with mark
just to catch up
ditto
nice work rob
your insights on project stanley are also much appreciated
please revise the document as aleck's changes indicate
with respect to the alternative responses shown near the end of the document
leave both alternatives in
see below
this is one of the issues that concerned us more than price caps
because it could limit our ability to move power to other markets in the west
in addition
if you get questions from the analysts on
reregulation
or price caps it is worth pointing out that the high prices prevailing in many markets help our retail sales pitch to end use customers and create opportunities for our wholesale price risk management services
even a $0 price cap is 0-0 times what large customers are accustomed to paying
see below
this would have presented a bigger problem than price caps
tim
cindy manages this program
mary
please give some thought to how we might solicit employee views on this
cindy
i believe we already allow matching of donations to quasi-religious organizations
religious schools
for example
and perhaps relief organizations like catholic relief services
i think that if we want to consider extending it we should probably discuss it in a smaller group than the e-speak forum
the enron foundation board perhaps
this could become controversial
though
recall the planned parenthood debate and the periodic attempts of shareholders to add restrictions through the proxy mechanism
i think this is a good idea
we may want to think about cnbc as well
brandon
any technical obstacles
margaret/cindy
how does the link work
does it go straight to the clip or do users have to navigate within cnn's site
are you aware of this

congratulations
i won't be going
let's look for an alternate
i'd be happy to come to dc
jon
ricardo charvel is pulling together the briefing for ken
so please share the ebs activities
agenda with him
thanks
do we have a mechanism to survey employees
can we do a
scientific
poll
as discussed
more detailed information
additional information on the regulatory context
opic information
opic information
let's ask jeff hines
our opinion research guy
to put a few short questions together and send it out

also
i was talking with beth tilney today about our website
and the fact that every business unit now feels free to go do their own thing
we thought it would be a good idea to add this topic to the brand conference
perhaps as part of an existing segment
interesting idea
but hard to see any near term benefit
i would decline
please forward to sue walden and get her ideas
calendar
calendar
also
i would like you to set up a meeting with me
cindy olson
beth tilney
kelly kimberly
mark koenig
rick causey
and rick buy
i was thinking the easiest way to get us all together would be to get a room at a restaurant for 0 or 0:0 some evening
i have contacted beth and cindy already
so they know what it is about
and i will leave messages for the others
i just need to check schedules for now
also
i think it would be a good idea to have a get together after work once a month or so for the public affairs organization
nothing fancy
cadillac bar or something similar
spouses and significant others invited
talk it over with a couple of people in the group and let me know what you come up with
i'm afraide this leaves too much room to manuever
having duties related to setting legislative affairs strategy and developing a plan for contacts on the hill
will give cynthia the idea that she can run all aspects of those duties
not just those related specifically to her substantive area
i think it is also worth covering the heavy emphasis on teamwork and supporting
rather than directing
others in the organization
calendar
hey
you're talking about our future president
i am soooo looking forward to my next biennial resource planning proceeding
tim i enjoyed meeting with you too
as i mentioned
i thought your answers were thoughtful
well stated
and accurate
in our line of work it helps to triangulate using others
insights and i found yours particularly useful
i would like your insights
meredith
i'd like yours as well
particularly in light of the messageyou received from lawson and jefferson
laura schwartz@enron
calendar
fyi
start with joe hillings in dc
fyi
no
contact rosalee fleming
ken's assistant
i let her know that you would be preparing the briefing
i am interested
but it's probably more important that jeff dasovich and sandi mccubbin
in our sf office
know
so that they can keep the politicos informed
and keep them from doing something stupid
thanks enron energy services
tony pryor
gpg legal
asked if we have any credentials/tickets left for die hard democrats in the company
i know tony will understand if they are already spoken for
but if we have some left that would go unused
we have a volunteer
how's it going
are you partied out yet
jeff shankman
coo of enron global markets
is interested in going and would like to see the schedule
i told him you would send it to him
jeff can also help us get our message across on the problems in california's power markets
dasovich can fill you in
also john
woody
wodraska
managing director of azurix is interested in attending
please get in touch with him
i haven't heard from stan yet
what about the
show cause
order route
palmisano left a couple of months ago to start his own business
jeff keeler
in our dc office
is covering john's issues
also
you should contact ken's assistant
rosalee fleming
to see when would be a good time to give ken a briefing and see what else he needs
i have told rosalee that you are preparing the materials for ken
i can hardly believe peggy noonan wrote this
i'm a sucker for blatant heart string pulling
i love it
i'm misty
did you see peggy noonan's article
shapiro and i are getting misty eyed
fyi
as we discussed
please detach the attachment
combine it with the articles gavin dillingham sent me and attach to an e-mail to robert zoellick and irwin stelzer with this message from me
attached is some background information on the
reregulation
crisis in california
i'm afraid we have our work cut out for us
we have been working the proces at the state and federal level in the past couple of weeks
i continue to believe
hope
oops
my computer sent the message before i was finished
i continue to hope that there is more opportunity than risk in this for us
price volatility is in the news like never before and our main product is price risk management
i know that the inquiries are up
i hope ees and ena can get some sales out of it
more utilities have been approaching tnpc
ees and ena about taking over their merchant functions
on the policy side
we are working the issue on both a state and federal level
whether this country does anything meaningful to deal with the current crisis comes donw to one person
linda breathitt
ken lay spoke with secy richardson and sen schumer about proposing rulemaking initiatives to ferc
we are working the rto process hard elsewhere in the country and coming up with messages to arm our remaining allies around the country
this is the biggest time for us on this issue since the very beginnings in california and new hampshire
in the current panic
however
we will be decimated if we are associated only with a move to keep price caps from going into effect
i saw your message to mona
i am going to read the comments next
but i start off thinking we need to avoid running headlong into the price cap movement
we may be better off trying to co-opt the movement to get broader reform
hang in there
the plan was to hit the issue twice
once in the short format of ebiz and at greater length in the longer format of the october issue of enron business
please let paul know
please go ahead with preparation of the talking points
i'll give ken a heads up
background information
i'd like to talk to ken about making the call
i'll see him at exec comm today
we'll have the usual macroeconomic update from larry lindsay and gavyn davies
the domestic political update from bill kristol and some presentations from gary hamel and others focussing on enron networks
for meeting file
see attached wsj article
particularly the last paragraph
the message is
there has not been enough deregulation
the government is still very much in the way
california is a perfect example
the market has responded to demand increases with thousands of megawatts of new generation
but state and local officials have not sited them
and companies like enron are offering price protection
but utilities are not allowed to take advantage
have you solicited comments fromo ees
i believe we should back massey as well
who do we weigh in with now
probably not
let's communicate breathitt's interest to bone and stay out of it for now
thanks for the note and congratulations
sorry we didn't get a chance to talk before you left
but
i'm still here
give me a call when you get a
i've made some changes
shown in bold
bracketed text indicates a deletion
in my interview i stressed that a big part of the communication problem is the narrow and impermanent nature of the information about what's going on at enron
narrow because for every significant activity there are only a few who are in the loop and
impermanent
because very little information is committed to writing
most of it is exchanged in person or over the phone
this is
i believe
what lies at the heart of complaints about cross-department communication
we now have some solutions emerging
software that enables more people to record and post information in html format on company intranet sites
i suspect that using such tools will face two obstacles
learning how to use them
ie there's a huge need for training
and making it part of our culture as a knowledge/learning organization
my message cut off
the conclusion is that while we continue to need to address the kinds of issues laid out in your recommnedations
we need to look at solutions which may go deeper to adress our communications problems
solutions which have become available only recently
why not have these guys focus on an online training program to both teach people how to make information available and accessible
eg by recording information and updating on the intranet
and demonstrating the importance of this activity to the success of the organization
i think you and your team have done a fine job dealing with the traditional
and perhaps largely insoluble problems
that this group wants to take on
i am pessimistic that the program outlined below will provide anything other than marginal improvements
i am somewhat optimistic
though
that we may be able to bypass many of these problems
and get to the heart of what people are really complaining about in the survey
by instituting real knowledge management at enron
yes
contact either gia or john and get the ball rolling
thanks
should we
or esca
start looking for opportunities like this now to get the word out
please forward to public affairs group
we handed the oped to delay's staff at lunch
i think we're finished for now
any interest
not yet
may not be until sept 0 as ken is on vacation
but there is a chance that ken will try to reach him in the meantime
i'll let you know when i hear
thanks for your help in preparing for the texas hearing
i think texas legislators are viewing the california experience in the proper context and i think i was at least marginally articulate on the emissions issues as well
thanks again
the price might be a bit stiff
particularly in light of the following
i don't think we need the dc grass tops component
we have an effective set of messages
contacts
consultants and lawyers
perhaps we could use charlie as a fresh set of eyes on that stuff
but i think that asking him to develop such an effort would be duplicative of what we have done with aae
paxson
i do think the other aspects of what he proposes would be useful
however
and should be less resource intensive and at least a little less costly
eric
i think the release looks fine
shelley
i take it there are no affiliate issues here
or they have been fully vetted
this is fantastic
is this someone in the analyst/associate program
you probably saw the announcement that mike mcconnell is now ceo of enron global markets
egm will be focussing on a number of new and existing markets
including coal
lng
crude and products
interest rates
agricultural commodities
equities
weather
etc
one of the markets mike's group is actively considering is transport capacity
i mentioned your work in the area
he is anxious to see it and meet with you after he has had a chance to review it
in case you had not heard
lou pai has done some fundraising for franks and both he and his
lou's
sister know him fairly well
keep it in mind if at some point we need to get in to see him
i think the qs and as look good
i wouldn't bring up the california situation
eliminate the second half of a0
i realize you have pushed these guys already
but the attached letter would be better if not sent at all
it doesn't address the real underlying problem
that a
reliability bill
on a stand alone basis doesn't fix the problem
instead
the letter implies that the reason for opposition is merely a political consideration
ie that it may reduce congress
appetite for action next year
if possible
it would be better not to have the letter go out at all
have we suggested to ferc staff that they force the iso and px to open the
blackbox
to show how they determine dispatch
in addtion
if you are not on the distribution list for belden's memo on utility behavior in california this summer
i will forward it to you
it suggests some other areas ferc ought to be looking into
looks like you got this earlier
i think it has new relevance in light of ferc's announced investigation
it's hard to formulate a position without more of the specifics
but i think our message should generally be
we support providing immediate rate relief to small residential customers
we believe that relief is best provided by giving san diego the ability to procure power on a fixed price basis from the market
san diego has offers in front of it now
those should be evaluated and the legislature and the commission should give san diego the flexibility to accept one or more of them
this is sounder than running huge deferrals
deficits
to be later recovered from consumers
rate relief should be accompanied by real reform
rate caps have bad long term consequences
they cause shortages
combining short-medium term rate relief with expedited siting of new facilities will address the near term problem while laying the proper groundwork for a long term solution
in the second paragraph we should delete the
partnership
statement
i think it's more effective to refer to the new power company's risk management capabilities
as provided by enron
if necessary
that's the basis for the ability to guarantee savings
not economies of scale
i am also concerned that the current statement implies that enron is taking the risk on the commodity price guarantees
we don't have revised versions yet
when we do
we will probably only want to put some
not all
of the documents on the intranet
i agree that we should not be opposing rate caps for small customers and schools
but i think we should be pounding on the fact that market participants have been putting offers in front of sdge and that allowing the market to provide this solution is superior to legislated caps that require the creation of huge deferrals
and more problems in the future
can we make that argument work
calendar
rosie
please check ken's calendar
this would be a great one to do if we can squeeze it in
nick
congrats on what looks like a great new opportunity to make progress
i am in all week and would love to talk to you and joe
if we can't otherwise make schedules work
call me at home after hours houston time
add mona petrochko
peggy mahoney and rob bradley
please send to the distribution list
while the more-open gas market may have more tools available than in electric markets
market solutions have been proposed as an alternative to legislated rate caps in the hard hit san diego market
gavin
please send irwin copies of the articles on the offers made in san diego
looks ok
one more
nick o'day in tokyo
congratulations
i'm putting in for chairman and ceo of rationalizations and euphemisms
neither ken nor jeff are available
it would probably be better for one of you to speak anyway
any interest
i spoke with jeff and he is not going to be available for the speech on the 0th
do we pass or is there an alternative
can we get done what we need to get done with ken's visit the following week
i may be adding someone to the agenda
vikram pandit
recommended by ken lay and pug winokar
how are we handling these now
last time i talked to jeff
we weren't going to lift the restrictions until next week
assuming we do lift the restrictions
any word
more info
i enjoyed talking with you the other day and am happy to answer your questions
both the texas position and the washington dc position report to rick shapiro
from a government affairs standpoint
i've divided the world between rick's group
the americas
and mark schroeder's group
europe and asia
both rick and mark report to me
joe allen continues as part of the texas legislative team
working for the head of that group
formerly kathleen magruder
terry thorn has taken a commercial position in enron and no longer works on government affairs issues for the company
except to the extent we call on various executives to help from time-to-time
could you work with allison to get the needed information to cathy
a bit lengthy
but i think it looks fine
this is the e-mail i was talking about
i do support the change
let me know what i can do to help
you are correct
this is the way we handle regulatory counsel in other regions
particularly the us
what derrick and i have agreed with regard to counsel selection is
gov't/reg affairs picks the counsel we want to use and he retains a veto
which has rarely if ever been exercised
once we have retained counsel we will use that counsel on other regulatory projects unless the legal department starts to have a problem with the firm
eg because they represent someone against us in litigation
again
i don't recall this ever being an issue
it seems to work
outside counsel gets the message that we will look dimly on any firm that squares off against us and we select the most qualified counsel on our issues
please send the economist piece around
no
i had the right date from our previous communications
when we have described the problems and solutions for california we have focussed on generation siting and flexibility to hedge
we have stayed away from transmission issues on the assumption that california
with its iso and px
does not suffer from the same discrimination issues as other parts of the country
is this true
does california's system layer in priorities for utility use of the system
eg doesn't pg&e control
path 0
does that control provide advantageous access to pg&e
are there other examples and are there links between these
preferences
and the current problems in california
as we are trying to convert reliability and pricing concerns into ferc action these would be helpful arguments to have available to us
calendar
what does the siting bill provide for
skilling will be speaking at the national press club next week
he'll give an overview of enron's business
talk about what's going on in power markets
and what should be done to fix the current problems
california will get covered as well
other than what we have already discussed
is there anything jeff should know or address in his remarks
look at this
baum finally speaks up
way too late
can somebody tell me what sdg&e's energy rate was pre-dereg
they refer to expedited siting
what are the provisions
yes
thanks
lay is going to be giving the keynote
it may be a hard story to assemble
the gas market is deregulated and structured pretty much the way we would like to see it done in both gas and power markets
yet we still have high prices
it's a bit of a stretch to blame it all on opec
i'm interested in any views you may have
got your message
i'm testifying at the congressional hearing and dasovich is covering ferc
i think jeff's comments were taken out of context
he said policymakers do need to take care of small customers whose bills are tripling
frankly
we'd get slaughtered if we said anything else
but he also said there is a right way and a wrong way to do it
enron and others had provided a market based answer by offering a fixed price deal to sdg&e
which would have enabled them to cap rates to those who had not switched
california elected instead to cap rates and deficit spend
ie create a deferral account
i don't think we can stand for anything that doesn't protect the small customers
but we can continue to emphasize the market based solutions
one of the messages in my testimony will be
customers should be encouraged to choose
those who did are doing fine
thaniks for the note
christie is now organizing our university relationships
so direct the communication to her
thanks again
contact dave parquet and jeff dasovich in our san fran
office
dave has worked on enron's proposals to san diego and jeff has been supporting him from a gov't/reg affairs standpoint
let me know when and where
i am going to copy phillippe bibi
chief technology officer
and cindy olson
evp-hr
please put someone in touch with chris
thanks
here it is
calendar
the pac did not give the money
pac contributions to federal candidates are limited
the money was a combination of individual contributions ken solicited and soft money donations to the republican party
erin rice
attached is a copy of my california testimony
the proceeding was somewhat productive
but turned into a witch hunt at a couple of points
our view on this is
the problem is fairly straightforward
demand increases and new supplies are inhibited so prices go up and shortages ensue
sound familiar
and the solutions are straightforward
site the power plants suppliers are begging to build
let the utilities hedge outside the exchange
and finish the job of opening the interstate grid so power can get from where it is to where it is needed
what it comes down to at this point is ferc is the only entity with the authority to start fixing this problem now
congress isn't going to get anything done this year and the california legislature is
thankfully
out of session now
our political leaders need to give ferc the room they need to act
good luck on your speech and give me a call sometime
attached is my testimony
cynthia
get back to jeff on this
it doesn't look like a high priority to me
but i will absolutely defer to your judgment
jeff
chris is on point on this issue
he and dan reck have already spoken
i think this is a fine attempt
but i continue to believe that a pure relative ranking offers the most flexibility and is more like the way the process works in practice
a separate list of desired behaviors
criteria etc can be used to guide discussion but i believe the ranking itself should remain purely relative
i talked with scott tholan and he immediately understood your concerns
i don't think there is anything else you need to do right now
let me know
though
if there are requests for information you consider inappropriate
i'm still waiting for davis
office to call
the plan currently is for me to talk to him when and if he calls
sandi has been in touch with the governor's office
by the way
thanks for the summary of the california proceedings
i talked to hebert yesterday and he was duly impressed with your remarks
i had to remind him that you worked on the right answers for california
not the abomination that's in place today
preempt me
please
test
maureen
please send vince my california testimony and the talking point presentation for jeff skilling at the national press club
eliz
keep vince on the distribution list for the documents we are generating now to repond to the california situation
fyi
i am sending vince some materials we have used
please forward to advisory committee
i approve
the letter looks fine
set it up as
your letter to ken lay was forwarded to me for response
and have jeff b sign
thanks
i talked to hettie today
it's unlikely that we are going to find time for jeff and the governor to talk
because of the governor's schedule
we'll try to set something up later
in the meantime
the governor should just sign the bill
of course
hettie had already communicated this
the gov's office acknowledged that the message was recieved but did not make a specific commitment
any interest
decline
i think it looks fine
will defer to jeff's edits
thanks
please keep me on the list for the more detailed management report as well
attached is sen
hagel's energy speech
he focusses on oil primarily but also does a nice job of framing the importance of sound energy policy to our continued economic growth
at the end of the article there is a presidential straw poll
it shows bush with only a 0 point lead among oil and gas industry executives and analysts
joe
could you or someone in the office get in touch with michelle
thanks
i understand from shelley that you are going to be seeing commissioner breathitt on monday
we have been working to persuade her to vote for forceful ferc action on electricity issues
she is widely viewed as the swing vote
with massey and hoecker being the other two votes
needed for the commission to take action
attached are two documents
one is a set of talking points for you and the second is a ferc action plan that we are floating with several of the commissioners
fyi
there has been some concern that this deal was being put together without connecticut authorities knowing the full extent of our interest in
no special requirements
but it's good to keep track of in case we want a point of contact
thanks
you should plan to be there
i think he was looking to make a sector-wide point
for example
how much of the total market moved to wholesale traded volumes
he wants to make the point that even a nontraded commodity
ie electricity in 0
can rapidly progress to a traded market
as electricity did between 0 and 0
great news
keep up the good work
stephen d burns
any interest
joe
there is no announcement today
i tried to leave you a voicemail but apparently the system is down there
before we can offer an outside person a vp position
the executive committee must sign off
we are going to be going through that process in a few minutes
then we begin the offer extension and negotiations
the person we are recommending is linda robertson
one of the two people i mentioned to you before
please guard the information carefully
last time we talked
when the list had been narrowed to two
delay's office called with the exact two names and started pushing us to hire a republican
as you know we interviewed candidates of both political affiliations and just settled on the best person
ken told delay's office that's how we do things and ken is comfortable
actually enthused
about the choice
when some external announcement is done
you will be involved and your considerable contributions will be prominently mentioned
looks good
i think you implicitly say this
but i think you should make it more explicit
the continued growth of the new economy is threatened by our electricity infrastructure more than anything else
the high tech industry requires market driven solutions to reliability and pricing not the old style command and control regulated monopoly approach
let's start getting the word out
thanks
i hope we get there soon
yes
yes
rosie
please print and have signed
note there is a typo in the second line of the last paragraph
does should be
do
thanks
thanks
chris
rick
see the witness list below
in case you want to try to get some points through to these witnesses
zausner is kind of a mixed bag
i think he's strong intellectually and has some influence
but i don't trust him to keep our strategy and contacts confidential
isn't our primary problem with aep's internal merchant function rather than with the marketing affiliate
i realize we have problems with the affiliate too
can we protest continued market based rate authority for aep until they have surrendered native load priority
more indications that the power angle may be fruitful
the senator's speech is focused on the oil sector almost exclusively
but it does an exceptional job of framing the importance of the issue
eliz
i need your group to put together a search which captures the comments of pg&e and edison officials in trade press
anlyst reports
and speeches which would be inconsistent with the idea that they can now recover their shortfall
in other words
when they were trying to get ab 0 passed
when they were fighting proposition 0
when they floated their
rate reduction bonds
and when they talked to analysts and rating agencies i'm sure they assumed that they would live under the rate freeze and take the risk of stranded cost recovery whithin the statutory deadline
looks good
how about a point about the need to connect new generation quickly

draft letter to ferc by consumer groups below is my first rough draft of a letter that could be sent from consumersto ferc chairman hoecker
due to technical difficulties
i could not attacthe letter in a separate document
so i copied the letter and have reprinteit below
having never been involved in this type of letter writing campaign
this waa bit of a stab in the dark for me
so i welcome everyone's comments
i amalso working on a letter that could be sent by senior management or ceos ofhigh tech firms

let me know if you have any questions or comments
sarah the honorable james hoecker federal energy regulatory commission 0 first street
n.e
washington
d.c
re
electric power industry reform dear chairman hoecker
we are consumers or represent consumers of electric power
we write to urgyou and your colleagues to take the initiative to address the intolerableshortages and extreme price volatility that have become all too common in the electric power industry
it is imperative that the federal energy regulatory commission proceed expeditiously with the reforms needed to support a competitive and efficient power supply industry to ensure a reliable supplyof power at the lowest possible cost to consumers
there are many actions you and your colleagues should take to ensure that the power supply in the u.s
remains sufficient and is available at reasonableprices
for example
you and your colleagues should remove roadblocks in the nation,s electricity gird
under the current system
ferc regulations amany companies that own transmission systems to restrict access to their transmission lines by competing electricity suppliers
the result of thispolicy is shortages
blackouts and skyrocketing prices
like the interstathighway system
ferc should allow electricity to move from one state to another just as freely as motorists do
all electricity suppliers shouldhave the same access to the transmission lines in order to transport power to where it is most needed
ferc should also discourage electricity suppliers
reliance on spot andshort-term electricity markets for power supply
instead
ferc should urgesuppliers to purchase a portion of their power needs under long-term contracts
locking in electricity costs at fixed prices protects consumersfrom unexpected price swings that can be financially devastating
we strongly urge you and your colleagues to seize the initiative on thesereforms
consumers deserve a power supply industry that is both more reliable and economical
very truly yours
i don't know
can we get someone in it to respond
fyi
it's fine with me
please send regrets
see if there is anythiing of use in here for your high tech group messages
please post the jp morgan doc
on our site
see if she wants to meet with me when i get back
please post and circulate to the team
please pst and circulate to the team
we probably need to open a new section on the site to adress gas prices
submit a pac request and keep tom posted on when and where
i think i confirmed for this already
but could you check and put on my calendar and put this in the meeting file
i think it's a good document and carves out some solid policy ground for bush
i think the electricity section needs some additions though
there is not a lot that the current administration can do about siting new plants and power lines
its largely a state and local decision
further
the problem has been less about government failing to provide adequate incentives to utilities than it has been about a failure of the current commission to opening the grid on a nondiscriminatory basis
once utilities are in the open access transmission business they will look for ways to invest in the grid and stop getting in the way of independent power producers who want to connect to the grid
the answer is open access
so power can get from where it is to where it is needed
this has been clear for a long time
yet the current administration
and its appointees on ferc
have yet to use their authority to make this happen
the result
spiking prices and reliability problems
calendar and meeting file
looks good
calendar
i would like to do this
but i have a speaking engagement the next day
do the time zones work out so that i can do both or do i need to find a sub for the nov 0 speech
jeff skilling proposed a solution to gov davis to solve the supply and pricing problems in the california market
in summary
the proposal would have a neutral party conduct an auction wherein the utilities would seek bids for 0-0 year packages of power from suppliers
the gov asked if anyone had successfully conducted such an auction in the industry already
i need your help to identify and describe any such examples
european or north american
by mid day monday
jeff and i will have a follow up call with the governor on monday
thanks
for the call with davis this am
let's bring him in
per our discussion
see first item below
just a
heads up
ken may get a call from gov gilmore regarding the republican governors
association
below are sue landwehr's recommendations
with which i concur
let me know if he calls and let us know if you need any additional information
i share your perceptions of jose
though i don't have as much contact as you do
i know also from some recent discussions with rick
who has also had a fair amount of contact with jose
that he has very positive views on jose's work
i think we should make a concerted effort to get the feedback and have a good discussion about jose at year end to ensure that he is properly ranked
fyi
mark has some editorial changes to the letter if there is still time
what do you think
if you think this would be useful
go ahead and order it
what have they done for us
i won't be on the call
but will fax my comments to you this am
i've got a few too many speeches coming up
you are probably in the best position to address this crowd
time for the student to teach the teacher
but i'd understand if you think it would be awkward
the we should just decline
do you guys follow these reports
do we need to correct them
when we talked about me speaking at the conference in nov
enron's management conference had not yet been scheduled
now it has and
of course
it conflicts
it also conflicts out just about every other senior person at enron
i will take care of finding a substitute
but wanted your thoughts on a couple of candidates
how about seabron adamson
richard tabors or scott magrane
sp
the latter is at goldman sachs and
last time i talked to him
was working on transcos
let me know what you think and let me know who you were working with at feba so i can take care of the problem
thanks
i mentioned the need to call gramm in the exec committee meeting today and ken is willing to do it
the talking points isda sent looked fairly generic
given ken's relationship
and the fact that he has talked to gramm previously on the subject
what should we ask ken to cover
i'd like to give him a background document and talking points like we did last time
i will send it by fax to you chris and would appreciate it if you could update it as appropriate
do you still expect guinn to call ken
if so
do we have updated talking points
and background
for ken
i want to keep my subscription current
calendar
contact mike terraso
who heads the environmental function
and mike hicks
who oversees corporate security
sounds good
but i couldn't open the file
could you send hard copy
i'd love to but i'll be in london
sounds good
i think we should not talk about the conversations with the governor
i'd rather not prompt them to go to the gov
presumably to object to the gov talking to us without talking to them at the same time
i will be out of the country on wednesday
nick lampson called and asked for a contribution
i committed to one without knowing about his vote on pntr
i will keep my word by making an individual contribution but will also communicate to him that in my capacity as enron pac chair i cannot authorize the pac to make a contribution as a result of that vote
sorry i jumped the gun
what do you think he'll add
looks good
i assume we avoid libya completely
the question
though
may be how we proceed if we are doing business with someone who has activities in libya
your views please
i may need to spend some time with you in advance
but you don't have to plan on coming here
i think the presentation looks good
in the meeting itself i think you should go heavy on the argument that it makes no sense for sempra shareholders to be in a commodity market as a regulated entity
the
heads they win tails you lose
argument

i don't know how far it is prudent to take a position on this as a co
it has already become a key battleground
garnering some discussion in the gore-lieberman debate
i think we stay away from it as a co

pete van de gohm suggested we might want to get something out on the mideast situation as well
a sort of travel advisory
please follow up with him

see if there is anything else we need to be doing
dennis vegas may be able to provide you with a way to get the info you need

this could become a very deep pit
i don't want to distract you from theprimary mission

you could
deputize
jane wilson to help out on this
jane
as usual
has embeddedherself deeply in the enron india organization as vp of gov't affairs and can be a sound source of information for you as well as an agent for you in india
think about contacting her and getting her help
also
we have never explicitly talked about whether your focus is north american or world wide
my view is that it is worldwide
but that has to bheavily modified by the fact that most enron employees
current and probablfuture
are here
while the us has many deficiencies in its education systegraduate education here is the best in the world
and we need to show rapidearly success
and that's best accomplished by sticking close to home at least initially

re
enron university affairs mark
steve
i'd be happy to get us involved with this
but i'm not sure how we're handling non-north american university affairs
please let me know and i'll follow up with rajesh
thanks
christie
if you can cover it i would say yes
it's a key race and we have been close to ashcroft for years
let's make sure he knows we gave it
we need to follow up with him
last time i talked to him he basically recited the utilities
position on electric restructuring
let's make it clear that we want to talk right after the election
how did this happen
i realize the group may go a different way with this
but i remain convinced that we should go to a pure number system
ie a pure relative ranking
and use the behaviors and skills descriptions as a way of discussing the differences between people
just adding the qualifier
relative to peers
glosses over what's really going on
the behavior and skill descriptors tell everyone what is valued here and guide the discussion
the relative ranking lets us have the flexibility to meet business needs by getting tighter or
looser
on performance rankings
terminations
and comp
one of the things you should include in your report to koenig and frevert is our preliminary views on the rto filings
perhaps it's simply that we are not going to be satisfied until ferc forces nondiscriminatory access and we will object to every filing and fight every shortcoming
calendar and meeting file
please check schedule and get back to irwin's office
washington would be fine
there's always plenty to do there
i got a note from ken asking that you and i have the first meeting and come back to him withrecommendations
i agree with the agenda you have set out
it may also be worth discussing how we can use the individual members of this group outside of the meetings with the enron exec committee
there may be efforts elsewhere in the company which would benefit from the advice and input of members of the group
thanks for the resume
i don't see a fit in government affairs
but i am forwarding to community relations to see if there is any interest there
thanks for the update
i want to make sure we present the numbers in a morcoherent fashion than just laying out the individual rcs
you and i havediscussed this before
my recollection is that we were going to break out afollows
administrative services aviation building services new building ongoing government affairs americas other budgets retained at business unit level
explanation of shift in expenses from advocacy to transaction support/riskmanagement brand advertising internal comm other pr i may be forgetting some of the subgroups we talked about

meeting with mark lindsay i wanted to update you on my conversation this morning with mark lindsay regarding next week,s budget meeting
the format will be similar to last year,s
we,ll be receiving from mgroup a consolidated spreadsheet of all of our budgets
grouping them by functionality and illustrating 0 plan
0 estimate
and 0 plan
andthe variances between
we will be covering the epsc and aviation budgetsduring the same meeting
billie and i will get together on friday to compare what the two of us have so far
and then we have a meeting set up for mondamorning with you
bill
billie and me to go over everything in advance oftuesday,s meeting
points that mark made
no surprises here
jeff has mentioned that he wants to see reductions in all corporate costcenters since our international activities look like they,re going away
we have made significant reductions year to year on our international gov,taffairs and pr budgets
and i think we can justify that the other cost centers are primarily focused on domestic activities while the individualbusiness units budget much of those activities themselves
even though we,re allocating more overall to the business units this year
jeff will be interested in the gross budget numbers
before any allocations
we need to be able to explain any significant budget changes year to yea
mark particularly emphasized the increase in the pr budget
most of whiis retained at corp anyway
we need to be able to explain anything that we,ve inherited from thebusiness units that is now staying at corp
this applies to the headcountthat we,ve picked up from ena and from int,l
dennis
group
lindsay mentioned that there,s a possibility that causey may
in advance of our tuesday meeting
meet by himself with skilling to get a general idea ofwhere jeff stands on the corporate budgets as they,ve been submitted so far
and then come back to us with instructions on any changes that need to bemade
if this is the case
we may have to make cuts before we get to preseour case
i'm working on our presentation based on that conversation and will forwardit to you as it progresses
please schedule for monday
calendar
i talked to ken lay and he will support carol as vp
i have talked to carol and she knows the process
we are going to take her up at the next excom meeting
i don't think there is anything you need to do right now
look at the last article
any idea what the
rude awakening
might be
see dow jones newswire story at the end
please see attached
can we be even stronger on this
the short answer is that joe's resignatiohas no impact on our view toward india
the evaluation of our asset holdinand new business opportunities is the same the day after joe's resignation as it was the day before
if need be
we can reiterate previous statements about our ongoing review of asset positions
what do you think

sutton india statement we expect considerable indian media interest and attempts to interpret theimplications of joe sutton's resignation
in consultation with mark palmerand others
we have developed the following statement
which we intend to uonly in response to media inquiries
please let me know if you have any comments
john for enron use
only if asked statement on impact of sutton resignation on enron in india joe sutton,s departure should not significantly affect enron,s commitment to the indian market
in fact
consistent with enron,s new business lines
we are in the process of developing data centers and a fiber optic network inindia
of course
we continuously look to optimize the value of our busineinterests and there may be some related adjustments in our holdings
but weexpect to continue as a significant participant in the indian market
if pressed
we are not able to comment on specific plans or operations
as it is our policy not to comment on the details of potential divestitures or acquisitions
thanks

i am anxious to get out there soon
in the meantime i'll send a tape of my singing voice
i would drop the second sentence
it's a bit convoluted
i would also like to look at what else the ad says

what other quotes will be used
etc
please get the list of people i interviewed

the attached letter is being delivered this morning to the ferc commissioners
since the letter concerns a matter currently pending before the commission it will also be served on the parties
we plan to talk to the press about it as well
a number of other companies and organizations are also submitting letters and we have helped prepare an epsa filing which focusses specifically on california
our best information at this point is that the ferc staff report regarding california is generally accurate
and therefore
favorable
while it will mention periodic exercises of market power
it is expected to lay blame for california's woes at the feet of california's own decisions about market structure
it is further expected that the report will not provide a basis for ordering refunds
on the other hand
the commission's order
to be considered tomorrow along with the staff's report
is expected to at least put refunds on the table for comment and to discuss
and perhaps implement
further price caps
this is just our best guess at this point
the commission has put special emphasis on putting the report and order under wraps until wednesday
my mistake
but no reason to stop the presses
thanks
the letter is already out
but we will be accurate in follow up calls and in press interviews
any interest
joe hartsoe
rick shapiro
or jim steffes can fill you in on the details of what ferc did today
one question you need to think about is how their decision on price caps affects any contracts which we may have indexed to california's spot market
the way it reports the market clearing price will change fundamentally if prices over 0 will be accepted but not used to clear the market for all bids
so
if we are using this as a reference price in our contracts it may trigger the need to look for alternatives
i think paul has a number of good suggestions here
i think that tying rankings to clear objectives does not reflect the fluidity of our charge
though
and will lead to expectations which may not be met
i also feel strongly that the ranking needs to be a relative one
i would go to a pure number system
we are going to need to assess at each prc whether the organization is strong
in which case i think it's ok to have a disproportionate number of high ratings
or whether the organization has weaknesses that force us to grade tougher
you don't get that in an absolute system with preset expectations
i think your group in particular has done a good job of emphasizing team work
and punishing those who don't play well
so we need not create a competitive or jockeying environment so long as that emphasis is communicated explicitly
i agree with paul's points about giving clear
specific feed back
though i don't think we can give a clear target for what one must accomplish to be superior
i also like the idea of the abbreviated mid year prc to deal with those we need to counsel more vigorously
i'm not sure we can get away with it but i am willing to give it a shot
i think paul is to be complimented for taking time to focus on the larger organizational issues
very vice presidential of him
no overstepping of bounds
quite the contrary
i am out of town
joe
can you attend
please ask ken to sign the following
but
in the advisory council letter delete the reference to the december board meeting and check with ken on whether he still plans to brief the enron board at the december meeting
i believe he talked to kelly kimberly about this
i think it looks good
a few suggestions though
i haven't read the whole reprt so i can't say for sure that it alleges no price gouging
make sure to forward this to jeff
my e-mail is slow on the road
we can say though
that instead of blaming generators and marketers the report blames the structure of the market for california's woes
i think we should shorten the quote to something like
the reprt is consistent with what we have said all along
we should say that the scheduling penalties part of the order will
penalize utilities for underscheduling
not predicting
hedging is not about holding pirces down so much as it is about protecting people from wild price swings
that's what allowing utilities to buy outside the spot should help do
also
my title is just evp and chief of staff
did ken ask us to sponsor it or just consider it
i'm wondering what if anything we gain from such an investment
but i have an open mind on it
my only comment relates to the azurix reference
it's not a significant part of the biz and things have changed recently
i don't think it merits reference
john
i'm copying janine and barb on this message as they are most likely to be able to identify someone
janine and barb
could one of you get in touch with john
congratulations on a great launch
the us press on the office opening has been great
if you haven't seen it
get in touch with ann schmidt
i believe the registration deadline for the nov 0 election has passed
i'll ask eliz to forward the registration materials to you so you can be ready for the next election
also
if you were registered in harris county before you may still be on the rolls at your old precinct
you should ask
i don't want to disrupt building a more collegial relationship here
but i have some concerns about their reticence to sound more positive about reaching agreement on our two key issues
can we put the question differently
what are the barriers to their concurrence and what can we do together to address those barriers
if the barriers for eei are insurmountable because of the recalcitrance of a few members
can they facilitate a dialogue between us and a more progressive group
i am very interested in pursuing this and i believe enron presents an ideal case study for the purposes you outlined
i am copying christie patrick on this message and asking her to coordinate this for us
christie has worked on other case studies and will be very helpful in navigating enron for you
let's add rick
jim and me
thanks

see resume attached
attached are a revised org chart and a revised org memo
work form these drafts to incororate the handwritten changes i have given you
i will be on the first panel of the ferc california conference on thursday
the format allows a 0 min presentation and then 0 min of q&a
i need your help to make sure i have
gore-like
command of the details
please help with the following information
enron project information
parquet/mccubbin
please give me any presentations or summaries you have on the generation
or firm purchases
we have under way
or planned
i'll talk with you to find out what we are comfortable disclosing but please err on the side of giving whatever information you have
updated belden presentation
hain/belden
i believe the latest information was as of august
i think some of the information on the cost of peaking facilities is particularly eye-opening on the price cap issue
comparison to pjm
hartsoe/novosel
is the information we are seeking from the iso and px similar to information pjm already provides
if so
it would be nice to tie our requests back to something the commission has already approved
cancelled dsm projects
mahoney
again
i'll only use what we feel comfortable with
but it would help make our point if we can give examples of how price caps backfire when it comes to encouraging conservation
iso/px reports
dasovich
i have the iso market surveillance report
is there another iso report
if so
please get me a copy and provide a copy of the px report too
cec/proposed generation update
mara/parquet
need the basic information
proposed
waiting for permitting
how much/little the legislation did to expedite siting
ie are we still comfortable saying that it applies to less than 0%
soft cap
belden/hain
need a crisp explanation of why the
soft
nature of the cap is not sufficient
also
would we be ok if the commission revised it to say that bids can be taken above 0 without special filing or reporting requirements
but those bids will be accepted at the price bid rather than applying to all lower bids as well
ie the highest bid at or below 0 clears the market
bids above 0 accepted at price bid as needed
offers we have made/deals done
parquet/dasovich
mccubbin
roseville plus any others
offer made to sdg&e
i want to make the point that the market will provide solutions
below the retail price cap
if we get the utility
and the regulators
out of the merchant function
herding the cats
hartsoe/mccubbin/mara/dasovich
we are asking ferc to be courageous
do the right thing and ignore the politics
to be even halfway credible
we can't have iep
epsa
dynegy or anyone else
squishing
on the price cap issue
we have never been closer to reform in california
we need these guys on board
thanks
attached is the presentation i used for a very general update on deregulation
it includes some california material
looks good
ricardo
mark's organization is on point on this one
dave delaney has asked that we accelerate our look at space alternatives in mexico city
if you assume that you and jaime and
perhaps
one person from ebs remain there
what do you think the cost is
or when can you let me know
fyi
we had a bomb threat this am
it's a hoax
this e-mail made it into a reporter's hands and the reporter asked about this in the clinton-lazio debates in ny
cnn covered the hoax the next day
the us postal service denied it
of course
by the way
i have never seen a letter

these guys did a great job on the polling here
but i can't speak to their other qualifications or their california ties

jay's number is 0-0-0
sandi deserves time off and she shouldn't have an obligation to do e-mail while she is out
further
i was only copying her on messages that many others received
so i don't need to hear back from her
but
if this is a standard message going out to everyone while the fires continue to rage in california
i think it leaves a bad impression
can we find a way to direct urgent requests to someone else in the office or to someone on our external lobby team
per my voicemail
attached is a proposed
statement
to open the executive committee meeting on monday
eliz
does this allocation reflect the cuts we have already made
don't worry about it
sorry for putting you back on speaker
i just wanted sue to hear
she enjoys utility bashing so much
thanks for the comment on the hearing
in some respects i don't think the first panel could have gone much better
everyone thanked ferc for intervening
though for different reasons
the other staff reports are also looking good
scott miller has been a godsend
somebody not afraid to tell it like it is
does she have any interest in meeting one-on-one or is she just looking for a public hanging
i remain convinced that if we can just get the facts in front of people they will modulate their approach
see below
can we get some help on the ibm issues
calendar
there are a few other issues we need to look into
larcamp told hartsoe and i after the meeting that ferc may clarify that the price caps and reporting obligations apply only to bids into the px and iso
ie no bilateral transaction will be subject to the requirements
he asked if knowing this would change any of our views
esp peaking plants
though i suspect it's already too late for that
my gut reaction is that so long as the market continues to clear through the centralized exchanges this
exemption
for bilateral transactions won't matter much
but let's think it through
is eol or apx an alternative
massey specifically asked us to address forward markets in our comments
specifically
has ferc done everything it can to encourage forward market development
in addition to any other points we might make
i think we should argue that
pjming
the market won't facilitate and may even hinder forward market development
also
we should advocate actions by ferc that take away second-guessing by the cpuc in order to reduce utility fears about contracting forward
we have to give the commission a way out on price caps
we need to think through whether there is something we can live with here
or we should take the approach i took in my testimony
ferc should encourage the state to provide rate protection for selected customer classes by putting those requirements up for bid
ie get the utility out of the commodity business as much as possible
finally
on governence issues we should argue for a narrowe role for the iso as a way of diffusing the emotional governence debate
analogy
if the iso is simply the air traffic controller all parties will simply be interested in retaining the most technically competent people
not hiring or appointing their lackies or friends
so long as the iso has a role in setting prices
acquiring supplies or running the market
it is destined to be controversial and highly politicized
those functions should be left to the market
per voicemail
per our discussion
want to schedule a tour and want to make sure that marchris is avail
let rick and montovano know
what does this proposal imply about transmission pricing
we have debated from time-to-time whether we would be better off with a pure
loads pay
transmission pricing scheme because it would leave fewer places for utilities to hide the ball
when they pay for transmission they are just transferring money from one pocket to the other
and it would allow us to reach the maximum number of counterparties for each mw
thereby increasing liquidity
where do we stand
congratulations
one thing to add to the arguments
we have to make the adverse effect on consumers the centerpiece of our arguments
we need the legal arguments too
but this is fundamentally a political and consumer protection driven discussion
we have to be prepared to demonstrate that the key to alberta reducing prices is allowing new generation to enter and to do that you have to allow a true market price to be posted
california has seen the cancellation of numerous projects while they remain desparate for new supply because they have tried to artificially constrain prices
that's not good for consumers
if they need a lower cost solution for consumers
or protection from price volatility in the meantime
they need to
outsource
the residential supply business in blocks for fixed price bids
regardless of how we frame the arguments
or the solutions
however
we have to make the public policy
consumer protection arguments the center of our written and oral presentations
do you agree
thanks for the message
i agree that once we have a good outline of what we are going to do we are going to need someone who can get it done
i think you would be an outstanding candidate for that role
seems to me we went after you once before
is your inquiry confidential or can i discuss it with others
thanks
i enjoyed it too and would be happy to do it again
if we are interested in doing this
the interviewee should probably be from eel
has anyone talked with tim b about what larcamp said
ie the soft cap only applies to px and iso bids and not to any bilateral contracts including bilateral fwd contracts
you might try scott tholan
mike hicks
or rick buy
as i mentioned at the executive committee meeting
we have a number of people who either have expressed interest in serving on the transition team or who i would like to approach to serve on the transition team for bush
we believe that a call from you to cheney may be required
david haug
david will be returning from his honeymoon on dec 0 and has expressed a strong interest in serving on the bush team
woody wodraska
woody would like to work on environmental and water issues and has been in touch with bush campaign folks in both california and florida
he would appreciate a call on his behalf to cheney
amanda is aware of his interest and is amenable to his service
james steffes
you know jim
he is one of the most creative and talented people in my organization
he is familiar with state and federal energy regulation as well as the state and federal policy makers who have played an active role in deregulation efforts
he would be great to have on a vetting team for commission nominees
i have talked to jim and he is interested
others
we can make another 0 people available from the government affairs organization with qualifications in energy
communications and market regulation
the question is more a matter of how many enron people they would like to have
among them
dan allegretti
who will be chair of nepool next year
who campaigned for bush in new hampshire
and sue landwehr
a republican who works for us in the upper midwest
linda robertson has suggested that we try to put as many people on the
vetting
team as possible
let me know how i need to proceed
can you find the contact and see if they are still interested in the money
that flight time is fine
a couple of other things
i need to meet with mckinsey while i'm in town on monday
please set up with suzanne nimocks
office
also
my return should be first thing tuesday morning
i think we had discussed monday night originally
just get me on the first available flight to roswell
also
i didn't mean to put you in a difficult spot with melissa
i had tried getting hold of her last night but only got the answering machine
don't worry about tellling her my travel schedule
if i haven't told her first
i'll deal with the consequences
i've logged
couch time
before plus i'm usually pretty good about keeping her up to date
thanks
i think this is something we should consider
i'm asking rob to look into it

another key point
to avoid the mistakes of california
policy makers must make it easy to site and interconnect new generation
in california peak demand rose by about 0 mw from 0
0
the market responded with porposed capacity additions of about 0 mw
most of these facilities are working thier way through the tangle of state and local approvals
the problems we saw in california did not need to occur if policy makers simply enabled the market to work
also
it's worth noting that the deregulated market did work
customers who signed with enron saw a lower bill than prederegulation
enron hedged its commitments and so our customers
and enron
did just fine during the summer
deregulation worked
the problems in california can be directly traced to continued regulatory interference in the market
it looks like a good letter
heavy on explanation of our position
at some point i'd like to hear more of the background that's leading us to this position
you had asked for my input on a response to a letter you received from tom donahue regarding increasing enron's contribution to the us chamber to $0,0
i have been giving the chamber a bit of a hard time lately and wanted you to know why
i have been in touch with both tom and his staff over the last year
donahue has done a very good job raising money and getting his membership rolls up
both in terms of membership and dollar contribution per member
my reservation about the chamber is that they won't take a stand on something which is in the best interests of the vast majority of their membership if it will alienate a vocal few
electric restructuring was a key example of this
there was no doubt where they should have been on the issue
but instead of embracing retail open access legislation at the federal level they decided to have a
process
naturally
all the utilities volunteered to participate in the process and outnumbered the nonutility members when it came time to vote
the vote supported wholesale
but not retail
reform
with heavy emphasis on ensuring stranded cost recovery
afterwards
the federal debate shifted solely to wholesale legislation
though this is not exclusively the chamber's fault
unfortunately
tom's forceful and competitive approach when it comes to raising his membership rolls leaves him unwilling to do the right thing if a few members will be upset
for enron it's a bit like paying $0,0 for a veto right
the only things the organization pushes for are the things everyone agrees on in the business community
eg china pntr and lower corporate taxes
things they will push for whether we pay dues or not
and things we will add our separate voice to in any event
as i have explained to the chamber
enron makes its money challenging conventional wisdom
changing the way markets work
and dislocating incumbents
anything important that we stand for is likely to alienate some members of the business community and the chamber is unlikely to stand with us
they represent the status quo in the business community
tom is an extremely promising leader
he needs to create a new kind of voice for the business community
a voice which stands for moving business to the next level
not just protecting its current position
having said all that
the chamber
particularly its international chapters
has been useful to us in the past
in previous years
donahue himself has intervened on our behalf with latin american leaders
as a consequence
i have asked them for a proposal which would allow us to remain chamber members at a lower dues
and policy participation
level
but with continuing access to their international activities
i suggested something in the $0,0 range
that's why they are approaching you
they want us to double our current dues to $0,0
currently
i am inclined to just withdraw from chamber membership
but i plan to defer to linda robertson
i am interested in your insights
or
if you prefer
you can simply refer them to linda or me

i have what i need

i also need to get some time with shawn cumberland
please schedule that too
great work
any indication that the publication of the stanley investigation is having any adverse effect
meeting file
i had a hard time logging on remotely
so i just got this now
as you can see
it's a relatively brief
overview
presentation for jeff
not going into much of the detail surrounding
for example
performance criteria and evaluation or job classification
where much of the real work remains
the main purpose of this presentation is to give jeff something for the december board meeting
i need your thoughts on something
one of the rationales i had discussed with mckinsey for this new organizational approach was the need to win the war for talent
a partnership at least theoretically creates unlimited opportunity and reduced hierarchy in an organization
it also creates substantial upside opportunity and continued motivation for the business leadership
my question for you and your team is where are we at risk in fact when it comes to attracting and retaining talent
my suspicion is that our turnover is farily low
and that it is especially low in the top tiers of the organization
where we run into problems
my gut tells me
is that we have some difficulty getting the very best from the very best schools
ie we often lose out to the i-banks and
perhaps mckinsey-level consulting firms
and that we have a tough time holding the most talented managers and directors
ie we're ok at the top livels already
could you have someone do an analysis of the turnover rates at different levels
we may need to weed out the performance related departures
including those who left after getting a low performance ranking even if they were not officially terminated for performance reasons
if possible
i have attached some suggestions in the comment section on the presentation
i think we also need to have a set of slides or some talking points for jeff that make a compelling case for these changes
some of the points are touched on but i think we have to make a better case for change in addition to outlining the changes
some of the themes which we should develop further might focus on the challenges we face in sustaining our growth
this was a major theme at this year's management conference
terrie
please forrward a copy of gary hamel's presentation to the addressees on this e-mail
these challenges imply the solutions we are proposing
a professional partnership model which provides opportunity and compensation incentives to attract and retain top talent and encourage cooperation across the company
capturing and exploiting knowledge within the organization
and a more formalized approach to business building through an accelerator
i will be in california on monday
but let's try to set up one more meeting before we get together with jeff
i can make time on tuesday or wednesday
attached are my suggestions
proposed edits attached
looks good
i like the references to the energy savings
i think we should try to get this story some play in california
not necessarily in the media but perhaps with some of the folks we are working with in the gov's office
please copy dasovich and mccubbin on the final
extra congratulations on the usa today story
i have a reception that evening
coincidentally with another rice group
from the engineering school
so i will not be able to attend
i got the package on the 0 pbs special
we are already doing a significant pbs sponsorship in connection with a series based on dan yergin's
author of the prize
new book
the commanding heights
we have looked at numerous public broadcasting sponsorships in the past
but the ratings are so low they tend to be a very inefficient means of reaching our target audience
we made an exception for yergin's series because it focusses on the role of free markets and their relationship with governments over time
i'll ask margaret allen to handle the decline
calendar and meeting file
anything you want me to do
huh
i don't see anything technically wrong with the document
but i struggle to see the point of it
most people are not going to care about our industry's problem
they are going to be interested in solutions
we should be telling them what the answer is
eg forward prices are lower
there is an opportunity to buy forward now and protect yourself from volatility
etc
what do you think
what do you think
looks good
is the co0 reduction only 0.0 tons or is it some multiple
like 0.0 thousand tons
schedule
please send an estimate of time and description of the topic to rebecca
thanks
look at the attached
it may be too late for this afternoon
but i took a shot at a revised way of presenting the investment fund and the associated issues
substitute for slides 0-0
please block off on my calendar
key members i recall are
andy fastow
gene humphrey,cliff baxter
ken rice
rick causey
lou pai
kevin hannon
it's easier for me to remember those who are still around and in leadership positions as these folks are
it's also interesting to note that with the exception of rick
gene and andy
all of these guys were in other parts of enron but were attracted to jeff's team by his vision for a new approach to the energy business
please get a copy and forward to paul kaufman's team
see below
i'm sure your guys are considering all of the applications in dcourse and those who are waiting are naturally going to be anxious to hear.not asking for any special treatment for this individual
but
as we discussed in your office the other day
there are some continuing core skills in the ee&cc group that we need to hold onto
at first glance
this guy seems to have those skills
calendar
shapiro is just unwilling to accept the fact that his guy is a very scary guy
enough to scare away lifelong democrats
i got your voicemail
thanks for following up
we would be looking for a contract relationship only
not full time
can we get gary's comments
we'll try to get a copy of gary's comments
can we get a copy of gary's comments from cnbc
i have been trying to hook up with kevin and will see him tomorrow
i still prefer to use the
old exec committee plus
for this prc with a reformed md prc starting at mid year
we have too many people in transition to just switch over to the policy committee at this stage
attached are several documents which capture our positions in reaction to power and gas pricing
particularly in california
included are a detailed set of solutions to california's power market woes
which we have provided in california and at ferc
a representative speech
and a talking point summary designed for more general audiences and the media
the gas paper was prepared in september and needs updating
but i have included it as well
i will get a more integrated message put together and circulated
i agree that we need to rework the copy
especially since the gas market is blowing up
how are the appointments turning out from your perspective
attached is the accomplishment discussion to go with the public affairs goals
let me know if this is sufficient and consistent with what you want to present
i can provide more detail if needed
in the first sentence could we say
transmission owning market participant
here is the attachment
i'm ok from a pr and govt affairs standpoint
but we can't move forward until we have legal
including fcpa
approval
i have exchanged voicemails with elizabeth labonowski on this and she is on it
if you have consulted local counsel on the issue you should put that person in touch with elizabeth
once we have the approvals we can proceed on verbal oks and document later
as we have in other cases
this issue has come up before in europe
the first time through is the hardest and slowest
after we have run all the traps once
the subsequent requests move faster
but we have to get it right
even in europe
where our contributions were small and routine
we attracted a bunch of attention just because of who we are
as in japan enron attracts alot of attention in europe
even where other american companies don't
just got word from the lawyers
it's a go
i need to talk to you about wasaff's project when you get a chance
tomorrow
if possible,b ut not absolutely necessary
hope all is well
looks fine to me
dan
i assume you are comfortable with it
larence is running up against the deadline for associates to be promoted or move out
here is my concern
larence has been worked for a number of people who ended up leaving the company
he worked for dave ramm at enron wind
dave left
he also worked for john palmisano who also has left the company
he ended up in a structuring group working for brad richter
it's hard to sort out what happened there but perhaps because of larence's lack of interest in the area
which he apparently expressed to brad
he has not done much structuring work and brad is not inclined to promote him or keep him in the organization
he has been told that he needs to find something now
could you guys look into this
perhaps we could either extend his deadline
or find him something through the redeployment process
calendar
no problem
i made a couple of suggestions on slide 0
a wording change in the first bullet and i dropped ect from the example list
i think the ees and ebs examples are more alike and make the point more cleanly
i think showing the ranges for mds on slides 0 and 0 is fine
i didn't see a reference to the possibility of an emd level
i think that's probably ok
jeff can still speak to it if he wants to when he discusses the ranges in the md level
thanks
i'm not on the vp prc
but i will be in the group that reviews the results and does the md ranking
hannon chairs the vp prc so you should make sure he has these too
also
rick shapiro is on the vp prc as are scott yeager
steve elliot and ric dimichele
also
i know you weren't thrilled with at least one outcome from saturday's prc
if you want to talk about it or the process
give me a call
can rick attend
need one other person too
i agree
it doesn't appear that we have the need for his skills that we had even a few months ago
i see that you are in contact with michelle hargrave about next steps
anything you want me to do at this point
attached is a brief overview of the egm business
i realize you probably already have this
lisa
this organization represents perhaps the biggest near term earnings growth opportunity we have as a company and one that will require our organization to develop expertise in new markets
new regualtory fora
and perhaps new countries
from time to time
i'm sure we will all be called on to help out
so i'll endeavor to pass on any info i receive
it's a little hard to tell precise numbers from the charts so i need a
call out
number from the charts
specifically,what happened to microsoft's turnover rate for how much stock decline
eg did it go up 0%
from 0% to 0%
for
x
decline in the stock price
it is tenure at the level
eg vp or md
not with organization
the color scheme looks good
mo
please set up a call
cindy
it seems to me we should use an hr distribution to get this out
let mike and i know what you think
given the way the numbers came out
i guess we don't need the talking points
but we should still try to get to the bottom of this because we will be called on to comment to regulators and media
unless we have strong evidence to the contrary
it seems to me that wholesale markets are working
they are open and they are competitive
on the other hand
retail gas markets suffer from the same problems as electric markets
they are not open
customers don't have effective choices and price signals don't get through
so there is no demand response when prices rise
on the points raised in the attachment
i'm still not sure i follow point 0
also what does
electric disconnect
mean
calendar and respond
fyi
jane wilson is our government affairs person in mumbai
calendar
also please rsvp for melissa and i to the lay's party
fine with me
i would very much like your help on this
i agree that we should follow up on the others and if it doesn't work
then pursue some bush people
the evening before for pres
elect bush is a good idea too
can yu follow up
our recommendations on possible ferc commissioners for ken's next discussion with cheney
question
why do we need from jan 0 to jan 0 to respond to staff comments
i think we should squeeze that time dramatically to take a shot at jan or early feb resolution
if there is slippage
i don't want our earliest target date to be the end of feb
calendar as fyi
thanks for the idea
i'll pass it on to mark metts
have we reponded
i talked to peggy and her messages seem to be the same as ours
call if you want to discuss
let me know what you think of the attached version
see revised version attached and let me know what you think
i like it
do you think we could aggregate information regarding ees
demand side management opportunities and prepare a release announcing the results of those efforts
normally
we wouldn't do such an announcement without a specific deal to report
but in light of the special circumstances in california perhaps we should consider it
as we discussed
the governor cancelled the meeting at the last minute
apparently
he was trying to schedule a meeting with clinton and our meeting conflicted
so we were bumped
we are trying to set a new time
i will share with the governor's energy advisor the information and recommendations all of you helped put together
thanks
this is very good work
you make all the points we need to make without spraining anything in the process
you have been doing a superb job under very difficult circumstances
on another note
i don't know if you received my page
but the meeting with davis was cancelled so i flew back to houston
we are trying to get another time
perhaps as early as this week
davis did meet with greenspan and summers
both of whom we had briefed extensively
rosie
i'm not sure if this went through
i couldn't find it in my
sent file
karen
attached are the documents i mentioned to you a minute ago
we met with gov davis on thursday evening in la
in attendance were ken lay
the governor
the governor's staff director
kari dohn
and myself
the gov
spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas
he would like some additional thoughts from us by tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following monday
attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed
based on my discussions with several of you
as well as some background materials jeff dasovich and i prepared
below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals
the governor's ideas
as well as my overview of the situation based on the governor's comments
overview
we made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration
the gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief
more modest than what the utilities are looking for
and credit guarantees
his staff has more work to do on the latter
but he was clearly intrigued with the idea
he talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level
he also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of california consumers
including utility-owned generation
which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis
and excess muni power
which he estimates at 0mw
he foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by
0 and provide some political cover
our proposals
i have attached the outline we put in front of him
it also included the forward price information several of you provided
he seemed interested in 0
the buy down of significant demand
0
the state setting a goal of x0 mw of new generation by a date certain
0
getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 0
setting up a group of rate analysts and other
nonadvocates
to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities
he was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding ldc gas purchases
as already mentioned
he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities
his ideas
the gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere
brainstorming
some of these ideas would require legislative action
state may build
or make build/transfer arrangements
a
couple
of generation plants
the gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases
this was a frequently recurring theme
utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus basis to consumers
municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in california
state universities
including uc/csu and the community colleges
would more widely deploy distributed generation
expand in-state gas production
take state lands gas royalties in kind
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies
empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time
condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state
either eliminate the iso or sharply curtail its function
he wants to hear more about how nordpool works
jeff
someone in schroeder's group should be able to help out here
wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state
we made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators
securitize uncollected power purchase costs
to dos
jeff
again i'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's thoughts and get them to kari
he wants to see 0 year fixed power prices for peak
off-peak and baseload
not just the 0 one year strips
he wants comments on his proposals by tuesday
he would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal
he wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues
thanks to everyone for their help
we made some progress today
forgot to include you on this
michelle
i think linda would fill the spot you and i talked about very well
linda is the new head of our dc office
she was asst secy of treasury under bentsen
rubin and summers
she is very well respected in washington
she received the alexander hamilton award fro secy summers
the highest award presented by the us treas dept
she has gotten up to speed very quickly on our issues and i think would serve the progam well
and she's already paid for
scott sent this to marty
but i assume you already have had communications with him about this
ok to update
this guy has it right
so is it bigger than his tax cut on an annual average basis
let's make sure that he gets our list of ferc commissioner candidates
with special emphasis on wood and brownell
minor edits as shown
otherwise
looks good
see revisions
am also attaching the
solutions document
we left with the governor
i think we should follow that basic format and include the solutions set out there
see suggestions
i don't know if i have sent one of these to you before
this is an e-mail update service that we may want to consider as a distribution vehicle
either because they pick up the content or because we procure their distribution list
dan
could you have someone check these guys out
my comments
these were the next to last drafts
before correcting any typos
i spent a little over 0 minutes with robert
he is a very sharp guy and has a great deal of relevant government experience
while i don't have a position that would be suitable for his experience level
all of my senior positions are filled
he is definitely someone i would consider if i had an open position
my impression from robert is that
while he has some interest in public affairs
his main interest is in a commercial position
i stressed to him that it would be difficult to come into enron to run a business
but he could build to it over time
his main concern was that he not get
lost in the system
if he came in at a level below business unit head
i think robert would be a good addition to enron if 0
he is willing to come in to a commercial role at a more junior level to learn the system and 0
we can make sure that he gets the opportunity to have contact with senior levels of the organization from time to time
call me about this

i don't think this will work

schedule and file
i will be presenting at this meeting
please send comments to elizabeth asap
schedule and meeting file
i think there is merit in pursuing this
a couple of comments
it may be unduly complicated to get customers to provide the funding
perhaps we should focus on the banks instead
the deal might be further funding in exchange for legislative and regulatory concessions on rates
transmission and generation siting and the rest of the items you outline
rubin would be great to have
but having watched summers in action i'm notsure we need another ex-treas
summers is superb
up-to-speed
and apparently willing to work on this
linda
how would larry feel if we brought in his ex-boss
i know they're buddies but does summers really needthe help
need to keep an eye on the ball for large customers
many of whom are oursthey will continue to need some access to better rates
perhaps the proposcould be converted to cash in exchange for demand reductions

i'd suggest that you prepare the talking points for jeff and schedule some time to brief him in advance

it sounded like he fully understood your role and would take the appropriate steps with respect to the recruiters
is it straightened out now
please see the attached documents

have you handled already
any interest
revised version
i spoke with ken about the business council
he agreed
errors of commission are much better than errors of omission
h e does want to be personally involved in the invitations from here on and he is very willing to make calls next week to help get some confirmations
deal directly with him
there's no need for me to be in the middle
also
a bit of background
greenspan is always invited to the reception the night before
but they don't want to offer him a speaking spot because he won't speak without the press present
thanks again for all your work on the senate hearing
i felt overprepared
which is just how i want to feel
and every bit of information i needed was at my fingertips
thanks to everyone for their work on the senate hearing
there are a couple of follow-up items
thanks to the portland and washington teams
sen wyden is very interested in identifying the kind of information we need from the iso
and px to the extent it's still relevant
to make the market work better
we have written this up before
i think we just need to put it in letter form
alan
please take the lead on this and get a draft to linda
i think we should identify the information and also prepare a letter for the chairman
that could be sent to the ferc
murkowski
the committee chairman
asked for an itemized list of things the fed should do to expedite siting as well as anything else we feel is necessary to address the california crisis
we have identified the need for open access across the nation
but he is looking for what can be done in the 0-0 month time frame
dave
i think your memo to me is a good start
sue
could you please put those and any other suggestions in letter form and get them to linda
finally
sen feinstein asked all of the witnesses to ask their ceos not to
price gouge
yes
that's what she said
she appealed to everyone's community spirit and asked suppliers to forbear charging high prices while california struggles to fix its problems
i think we should send a response from ken
jeff
please take a cut and get to linda
i think the basic messages should be
we are actively working on solutions with california policymakers
forward contracting was our idea after all
we are actively pursuing demand reduction in the state
etc
we should also explain the nature of our business and pick up on some of the other solutions we identified in the written testimony
offer to meet to discuss further
etc
we need to put a briefing book together for ken asap for his california trip

i know you guys have been working around the clock
i just wanted to make sure you hadn't forgotten about mike dahlke
whose resume i sent on to you dan
when you catch a breath please take some time to consider mike for
i have sent a reminder
the ees team has been working around the clock on california matters
so i'm not surprised that they haven't focusses o this yet
nice work
mike
ken did speak with ulf

i have not heard about further contacts as yet

it amazes me how many people saw c-span
i thought it was just for junkies like us
i would like to get together in dc
i don't have a date scheduled yet
but i seem to get there every other week or so
corporate policy
i just read the e-speak transcript
i think you did a great job
i look forward to sitting down with you after we have gathered all the feedback from the website and other sources
great presentation
as always
i think you should add a brief set of talking points
what are the key messages we want to convey
what
if anything
can we ask martens to do that would allow some progress in the short run
maureen
please get this to ricardo
he's at the ebs offsite this am
looks fine as far as it goes
but don't we want to explain how this fits in to our strategy
is it just another platform for us to bring our products and prices to the market
we have said with respect to eol that the transaction is the goal not the platform
do we want to position this the same way
examples of other press releases include our extension of pricing on eol to the two other platforms
including houston street
which we did a couple of months ago
calendar and meeting file
i am attaching several items that i hope you will find useful when you brief chambers
a background document
which is a bit dated
but still useful
this is an internal document
so i would appreciate it if you would keep it confidential
though you are free to use the content in your own messages or documents
a basic outline of solutions
a summary of the governor's recent executive orders
it's another internal analysis
i think these orders show a better understanding of the problems and solutions than we have seen before
as we discussed on the phone
our biggest problem is inertia
we don't have much time
many solutions have long lead times
and the political wheels grind slowly
jeff dasovich
please forward any specifics on the demand buy down proposal and anything else that you think might be helpful background for laura
we move alot of people around enron
in fact
on an annual basis
we make about 0 moves
out of a houston employee base of 0
we have found at enron that putting people next to eachother makes things happen
increased productivity and communication
given our tight office situation in houston
moving people around to make room for new and expanding businesses has caused some disruption
we try to keep it to a minimum and expect it to improve later this year when we begin occupying the new building
meeitng file
i am sooooooooooooo proud of you
more importantly
you should be proud of you
i concur
what do you think
ken has talked about ees willingness to invest this money in demand side management
if the right program were set up
eg a demand buydown program
do not circulate
fyi
jean has responded to rick and i
she doesn't feel that she has room in her budget to pick up a partial headcount
absolutely
feel free to use the content
i forgot to give you mike day's number
it is
0.0.0
as you'll recall
you asked for a california energy expert
mike certainly qualifies
sen wyden called jeff skilling and i subsequently spoke to his staffer
joshua sheinkman
as you know
wyden wants to introduce legislation to facilitate disclosure of operating information about the electric grid and is now looking for more details
wyden is not interested in pressing for additional disclosure of financial information
the additional details they are looking for include
what information should be made available
when should it be made available
how should it be made available and who should make it available
on this last point
i suggested that the legislation should apply to the transmission system operator
whoever that is
i.e
it could be an investor owned utility
a publicly-owned utility
an iso or an rto
i also pointed out that ferc could make this happen by itself
except in the case of public utilities like bpa
extending ferc jurisdiction to these entities could be among the main benefits of the legislation
alan
please pull together the recommendations on each of these issues and forward to linda
linda
after we have the information
and perhaps some legislative language to go with it
please forward to joshua at wyden would like our help in getting sen nickles to cosponsor the legislation
linda
it may also be useful to suggest a letter from wyden to ferc asking them to use their existing authority to start these disclosures as soon as possible for those entities wver which they have jurisdiction
linda and joe
i agree with john's recommendations
we have been doing surprisingly well in the press
and
for the most part
those who write bad stuff are doing so based on ideology
we are not going to convert them
shelley and jim
who should follow up
this is an interesting idea
thanks
forward on if you find it helpful
thank you very much for the note
sorry i am so late replying
i am on my way to another round
house hearings this time
and was recalling your note
it is amazing to me how many people saw the hearing on c-span
nothing worthwhile on the weather channel
i guess
thanks again
and welcome aboard
take a look at the attached and let's discuss
maureen is in vince kaminski's group and wants to leave
how about reg risk

can give you the call in information and add you to the distribution list
sean
is this anything we need to follow up on
firsst article attached refers to the 0 nebraska case i mentioned to youin dc
test
can you fill this out for me
thanks for the analysis
we understand that mckinsey may be helping the governor develop a demand buy down program
is this true
ken will be making a call to bob glynn at pg&e
please give the attached to ken before the call
can you help me wiht this
any interest
having worked on the enron advisory council process
i have one observation
consider having some or all of these individuals as
guest speakers
rather than formal memebers
you can still have them review information
do their homework
and tailor their remarks to enron specifics
also
you should definitely include paul portney at resources for the future
he sits on the enron advisory council and knows the company well
yes
fyi
jade eaton is one of lara's contacts at doj
i think i can recommend that the time be set aside
but it would be helpful if we pointed out to emerson that it must be clear that there is a clear opportunity for enron before we schedule the meeting
maybe you could use this to get some progress on a bundled outsource deal
i don't see a fit
i'm suggesting that we make progress on it before we agree to a ceo summit
ask karen for the distribution list she would like to send these to for today's 0:0 meeting
also please reserve 0c0 for the meeting so i can use the computer screen
i'm not saying we should buy this service
but i do think we need some way of staying on top of tv spots mentioning enron
thanks for the update
the western governors remain the best avenue we have for preventing price caps and california's attempts to secede from the grid
we need to keep pushing information to them regarding these issues
attached is some text i have been using for correspondence with policy makers regarding california issues
feel free to use it
just received a voicemail from stan
he knows mike
he does not have any spots for him right now
my suspicion is that the ees discussions are not ultimately going to yield fruit
we are probably going to have to discuss what's next
i think this is a very interesting idea
please get with bill d
and make sure he gets a description of what we would need to do to physically accomodate the station and make sure he's comfortable with it before we go ahead
how important is this fight to us now
see attached article on exim
please see attached
rob
perhaps while in london you could stop by mark's desk to discuss
it looks like we are playing a smaller role than the wsj article indicates
i.e
a role commensurate with our level of interest
i have talked with john several times about the relative importance of opic
exim and other funding organizations in light of the change in emphasis in our business
as a result of those discussions we cut headcount and expenditures from the proposed budget for
0 and john has joined linda robertson's organization in the dc office
instead of being a stand alone effort
having said that
my view
based on the work john has been doing
is that we continue to have a considerable amount of work for him to do on the project finance front as a result of existing projects
projects we continue to pursue
and transfer issues associated with the asset sales
do you agree
i just checked with jeff and ken
they are both out of the office that day
sorry it didn't work out
got a voicemail from rob walls
they are
have been
looking into it
excerpts by email are fine
also
as i mentioned
i am very impressed with your background and accomplishments
but i would like to have you meet a couple of other people in my group before making a final offer
thanks and stay warm
make sure this is consistent with the lists we put in the memo
thanks
this is an issue we need to stay on top of
felicia
could you please putsome background together for everyone on the list
here are the message points
thanks for the note
jim hughes asked the same question you did
here is my
and john's
response
sorry
i had saved your list for the europe aa prc and didn't include them in my draft of the memo
i am sending another version shortly that has that information included
i don't think i need anything more from you
unless you have other comments on the memo
thanks
thanks for the message
it's good to hear from you again
we have already hired racicot
who now works for bracewell and patterson
but i'm not sure that our arrangement would include what you may need
so i'm copying linda robertson in our dc office
also
i'll copy jim derrick so he knows we might expand our relationship there
linda and joe
thoughts on bpa and eol
i am attaching the ferc order and staff recommendations
the order provides for $0 million in
potential
refunds
either pay up or provide cost justification
enron was not named as one of the 0 overcharging parties
but pge was
$0.0 million
it's not over yet
though
the order deals only with jan 0 and promises further orders regarding dec 0 and benchmark prices through april 0
the prices used to determine refunds were fairly high
$0/mwh based on gas prices
emissions costs and an assumed heat rate of over 0
with respect to sales to california
we have concluded at least one short term sale and have talked with cal dept of water resources about longer term deals
but we were still struggling with credit issues
last i heard
i'm copying jeff dasovich because i'm sure he has more up to date information
as to whether long term contracting by cal
is a good idea
the answer is somewhat mixed
we were one of the early parties pointing out the problems with total reliance on the spot market and encouraging more forward contracting
given the utilities
precarious financial position there were two options
0
outsource the default provider obligation to the market
this is what we prefer but there was no political support for it
or 0
have the state put its credit behind the purchases
california is pursuing the latter
with cdwr prucahsing the utilities
requirements
in the short term
we have criticized the state's plan because it contemplates state takeover of the grid
state participation in power plant financing
construction
and ownership
and they have not made it clear that cdwr really has the money to pay for all the purchases
i am attaching text i have used as the base for a number of communications with policymakers
it was not mentioned to me
i'm copying rosie and vanessa to find out if this was a simple referral
in which case you should keep the work to a minimum
return the call
but don't get distracted from your other efforts
or whether ken is especially interested in this and wants us to follow through
i'm checking
melissa loves talking about houston real estate
one of the many quirks i love her for
i'll find out when she can do it
please post on internal site
looks ok to me
yes
i would just say jeff is pres and ceo
not refer to him as ken's replacement
ken was meeting with him the day before yesterday
i'm just waiting to hear back
your assessment makes perfect sense to me
what do you think about having nels make the call to lundquist just to find out what his status is
what he might look for when his current assignment is over
etc
obviously without identifying us
presumably nels would have reason to talk to him anyway in the normal course of business
i am not wedded to the idea but am inclined toward at least getting the information
unless you see a problem
i can do it
but have to be at the airport before 0:0 for a flight to ny
perhaps we should consider putting something together on india
the amendment was defeated
joe
could you see if someone at ferc
hebert or madden
might be available
or suggest a suitable alternative
we have got to do better at this
ir did a webcast of the annual meeting that from all reports had a minimum of glitches
can we use the same technology
at the bottom of the string is stacy's phone number
this is a very good try
i think it comes off too defensive and too genera
i just don't think the topic lends itself to the format
here's what ithink we should do
jeff is filming a piece for etv about the stock price
we should perhaps use
and expand upon
those messages
this approach ismore directed at the bottom line
why our stock price should go up
cc
mary clark/corp/enron@enron subject
re
per your request thanks steve
here's an initial draft
i've taken a very light
ebizy
approach to delivering the message
perhaps by having some fun with it wecan look a little less defensive
let me know if we're on track or pitifulway off
thanks
comparing enron to apples you may have noticed
or you may be asking why
industry analysts ocompare enron to wall street firms like goldman sachs or investment bankslike chase manhattan
we thought it was time to sort out any confusion between our businesses
just in case someone asks you to explain
here's how we're different from those guys
w enron provides physical delivery of energy products to customers
we are not just traders
those guys mainly act as brokers and do not participatephysically
w enron proactively seeks to reform and create markets
those guys simplyparticipate and compete
w enron extends its business model into new and deregulating markets
enabling high growth rates
those guys are in markets that generate lessaggressive growth rates
w enron owns physical assets that provide consistent cash flow
such as ourpipelines
those guys do not have them
and if that's not enough
we think our employees are so much cooler than theirs
to
mary clark/corp/enron@enron
sarah palmer/hou/ect@ect cc
subject
per your request here are the message points
can we also get something in the stip that limits the market making activity or at least promises a reexamination of the scope of the market making activity after some period of time
also
can we strengthen the language to give us something beyond simply a right to file
which is a right we have anyway
hap
could you provide a response and get it to meredith
i'd like to correct this
looks good
rosie
you may want to include this in ken's file for the toronto trip
drop the first comma in the first sentence of the third paragraph
otherwise good to go
the memo going out on monday discusses the corporate policy committee briefat the end
the corporate policy committee does the md prc
evaluation ofmds and promotions to md
reviews the recommendations of the other committees
which we are just now forming
additionally
the corporate policy committee met to determine the membership and charters of the othercommittees
including the prc committees
the corporate policy committee is comprised of the most senior executives
including the office of the chairman
the leaders of the four business units and the heads of the corporate functions
in addition to the specific items mentioned above
thcorporate policy committee was intended to discuss and resolve the major issues facing the company
including issues of strategy
personnel and challenges facing the company
the corporate policy committee has met three times so far
so not much history yet
perhaps as further pronouncements issue from this august bodywe will make more of a point about where they came from
mary clark cc
subject
re
corporate policy committee steve
please briefly describe what the policy committee does so we can respond to this employee question
thanks
mary
how about inserting the attached
after the explanation about the relationship between new power and enron
keep sending the message board quotes
sometimes when i open them i have trouble locating the specific quote
other times i'm taken right to it
do you imbed the urls differently
the quotes are accurate
but i did not say california does not have a supply problem
the conversation was very positive
glynn did not know anything about it at first
but
looked into it and called ken back friday evening
glynn said they were including the amount owed in their negotiations over the price for the transmission assets and said they intended to pay all of their debts
including this one
as soon as they get paid
he said that this weekk would be focussed on finalizing a deal for sce given the threat of bankruptcy
the discussions would then turn to pg&e
i heard you were a big hit
i just saw the nyt article
nice job
it's nicely positioned as an issue about india's resolve to encourage foreign investment and live up to contracts
he could have solved this problem in 0 minutes
right
the revised statement looks good to me
congratulations on your new position
this all came up rather suddenly
at least as far as i can tell
if you have any interest
i would like to talk to you sometime
thanks
look forward to seeing you
sorry i left jimmy off the note
i know he must be doing a good job
thanks
i was glad to do it and would do it again
next time my computer will work
i benefitted a great deal from what i heard from the group
especially regarding the prc
what's this about
could you e-mail dave and i with the background
any effect on us
etc
why was dave on this distribution
thanks for the offer
i may take you up on it
i would hold off for now
i think
based on our discussion
that ira might be a fit for my organization or ees
unfortunately
i am heading out of town with my family on the 0th
unfortunate for meeting with ira
not unfortunate for me
and ees has new leadership who is trying to assess the state of things before making new senior level hires
so
let's wait a bit
thanks
your understanding was correct
in light of recent changes in the california regulatory environment
eg the recent rate order
i don't think it makes sense for us to distribute the document at this time
so you can ignore the request
thanks
linda
as we discussed
adding a sentence on open access is key
also
i would delete the sentence about the transmission system not being designed for the way it's being used today
maureen
please schedule some time on my calendar for littlechild
thanks for the note
i am forwarding it on to our analyst and associate recruiting program leaders
we may have already filled the summer spots
we also cut down the number a bit this year to ensure a higher quality experience
but we will be out looking for a large number of permanent hires in the fall
see last question
mark also forwarded a voicemail from doty
doty goes into great length about his discussions with gramm
both of them
and professes to have not only a good relationship but also the support of the senator
at this point
any reason not to get the letter prepared for ken's signature
i am calling rob walls to see if he can attend
no
any idea how these guys are finding out where jeff is going
enron capital
trade resources corp
tell him we are sending his note on to the appropriate person
per our discussion this morning
below is a summary of items to discuss with glynn
adding enron's
negative ctc claim
to the list of claims
pge's filing included a list of top twenty creditors
our negative ctc claim was apparently not taken into account in compiling that list
the list is nonbinding
however
pg&e will be required to file schedules of creditors on april 0
our negative ctc claim should be on schedule f
for unsecured claims
you may want to remind glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectation that the negative ctc claim will appear
preferably as uncontested
in the april 0 filing
note
if pg&e does not include the claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the validity of the claim
including enron on the creditors
committee
pg&e may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors
committees
there are several reasons to suggest to glynn that we be included
0
we are a big creditor
0
we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution
and 0
we are one of the real parties in interest behind the px and iso
who were listed as significant creditors but are really just
passthroughs
for the suppliers
and pg&e likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway
i agree with mark's changes and i think the memo is good to go
i talked with ken yesterday
he would like to keep david on until may 0 to finish up some things he is working on for ken
enron capital
trade resources corp
i would decline enron capital
trade resources corp
eliz
can you handle
never mind
i found
em
could you look into this for me
yes
send to dennis stacy walker@enron communications
attached is the information on talent moves within enron
the numbers are for enron's domestic workforce only
the bottom line is that the ebs and ees redeployment figures are not unusual for enron
we moved over 0 employees last year
about 0% of our domestic workforce
most of these moves are attributable new business startups
eg egm
enw and eim
and normal course of business transfers within the company
the formal redeployment process makes up only a small fraction of the total moves in the company
i didn't sell any
right
good brief
i have noted a few comments and questions throughout the text
ignore my universal change to the word
transmissions
thanks so much for your message
your communications are always complete
firm
clear and polite
i am sorry that perhaps the most critical aspect of your efforts
security
has been so confused by our end
i understand from john brindle that the confusion generated by our end has not kept you from accomplishing a great deal of the work anyway
i have asked john to lead the effort
to the extent you need him
john and his team are very experienced and have been in contact with and coordination with the london office
mike hicks is a good hand
but for the most part
all i have asked him to do is be in a position to identify outside resources skilled in the area in question
it is a bit too much to ask mike to be hands on for all of enron's corporate security needs
a little background i'll bore you with
after andre legallo
formerly vp of security for enron
left
we did not replace his function
most of the operating companies had their own security and business controls groups
when andre left
we reduced the corporate function to a
default provider
role
if a business unit had a need it was not otherwise meeting
mike hicks
as well as an outside consulting firm
would help identify competent resources in the area
with the reorganization of ebs
i have inherited the very competent and experienced team they had assembled
led by john brindle
john identified some concerns regarding india mid last week
i urged him to get in touch with rebecca
he did
it was clear after further inquiries by john that the india team had already addressed many if not all of the concerns and much of the remaining work involved implementation
john volunteered to send some people over to help and i said ok
he had already been in touch with the london team and mike hicks
who i have asked to return to houston
the last thing you need right now is confusion caused by a group saying
we're from corporate and we're here to help
if you don't need any
help
or if the situation gets anything other than significantly better
let me know
you are awesome
thanks for taking the lead on this
note tim's question about handicapping the liklihood of approval
prices will move in the west based on these odds
we need to have a better view than anyone else
thanks for handling
let me know if it begins to interfere unduly with your new responsibilities
thanks for the updated presentation
it helps me a great deal to keep up with you guys
send more as you do them
do what you need to do
the system has to work
the only question i have is
why doesn't it just take care of this without a charge
this is not an extraordinary item or special request
this ought to be something it simply takes care of without us having to get involved or pay extra
am i missing something
no charges
i think we should refer these to carrie robert and ask her to run down the people in the organization most likely to have an interest
in this case
i would get in touch with andy fastow
ben glissan or someone in the finance group in london
that way
we can make a better determination about the value of the relationship
make sure those who are interested in pitching them on doing bus
with enron can be involved
or
we can make a determination to decline
i think we decide who we want to let in then do it for free
rather than charging
i would'nt have it introduced by the
corporate policy committee
i would say enron is introducing or
there is a new tool available to you
i am anxious to see how this goes over
it's a great tool
please get me pat wood's phone number and post a reminder on my calendar to call him asap
calendar
i think jeff should be the point person on putting the response together on this
and future air and climate change position inquiries
jeff
please make sure you get the comments of all involved
i got a voicemail response from jeff
he is fine with me substituting for him on the japan trip
i got a voicemail fro ken
he would be happy to meet with freeman
he is willing to work on other times
but suggested the following after 0:0 on may 0nd
right after ken's speech to the rga
or late the day before or in the morning of the second
to do this though he would have to cancel his speech to the texas governor's business council but he is willing to do this if necessary
his least preferred alternative in this general time frame would be early morning on the third
jeff
could you coordinate with rosie to get the time and place nailed down

we need to communicate with massey before he gets completely carried away blaming the interstate pipeline business for gas price spikes
we need to get him the information regarding cal ldcs failure to fill storage and their opposition to additional pipeline construction in the state
shelley
could you forward copies of the ldc filings to the group
should joe or i
or both
try to see massey when i am in town next week
ken talked to sen kinder
he made the points you had prepared
kinder agreed to shelve the legislation for this session
he said he had been hearing from several others
including proctor and gamble
which has a big facility in his district
that the legislation was not going to help competition develop in the state
he expressed willingness to work with us on a better package and also expressed interest in coming to enron's offices
he is going to be in san antonio in august and would like to come to houston around that time
i think wholesale will be well covered
enron capital
trade resources corp
i think it's a good idea
but we will need a different summary
either limit the summary to a couple of key points or provide an explanation
in layman's terms
of the practical effect of each of the changes
go ahead
have we made this available to the cheney team
congratulations on your appointment by fox
that's great news
i continue to be impressed by the way fox is handling things
let me know what i can do to help
as you know we are looking for a replacement for the unreplaceable ricardo charvel
i know you and he have discussed some possibilities
rick shapiro has met several candidates and will be bringing two to houston in the next week or so

so if you have a chance
check it to make sure we did everything we agreed to
i am going to try to come into the office very early tomorrow and will check email again
but my son has an appointment with the neurologist here in houston at 0:0 am tomorrow
and that is where i will be when you have the 0:0 call
we made this appointment months ago
but i will communicate with harry and everyone else before then
thanks
fyi
i think they should try to get in to see lundquist
but i don't think we need to participate in this
we have been focussed on nation-wide issues when we have had the opportunity to meet with lundquist and i don't think we should use our limited shots here
nice work kerry and barb
i think we should do the follow up work on setting a follow up meeting with the senator
ken left it open whether he would be available when the sen is in houston
so we have made no commitment in that regard
could you coordinate with cindy stark on the meeting with massey in a couple of weeks
stan has asked me if i would like to attend
i would
but don't know when exactly it is scheduled for
i have advised against ken or jeff attending the generators meeting
ken is still willing to make time avail on the 0d to meet with the gov
one minor edit
looks good
looks good
this is an issue we have long struggled with
we have conducted several comprehensive reviews in the past and on an ongoing basis we go through a resource allocation process which enables subjective criteria to be considered in the prioritization and resource allocation process

upcoming speech
we are concerned about leaks to the press which may have ocurred from our washington office over the last few months
including leaks from a former employee
could you put someone in touch with rick and linda robertson
head of our dc office
looks fine to me
i have not cross checked the lists
but i assume you have included everyone who was designated to serve on the prcs per the original memo
in addition to the new bus unit additions
no objection
a memo is coming out shortly
i think the memo needs some additional work
i have made a number of suggestion
highlighted on the attached
meeting file
thanks for the invite
and the follow up voicemail
i'd love to see the general
and you of course
but i'm going to have to pass
thanks anyway
ok by me
ok by me
i think we should let people in the legislature know about this and see if one or more of them can get their hands on it
i think the meeting is on wednesday
but if you can be there
sacremento
i expect
you should
as i mentioned in my voicemail
i think the meeting will not be particularly substantive
more likely it is a photo op for the governor to show how tough he is on the pirate generators
based on your message below
should we still plan to send somebody
i still think we should if we can manage the legal risk
mike
would you be able to attend as well
minor changes shown on the attached
gotta get the big guy's title right
please add linda robertson
head of our dc office
to this list if that's ok
i love you
baby
study hard
thanks for the invite
i would suggest jean ryall
who heads our texas government/regulatory affairs team
she is certainly more familiar with the details
of which there will be many more after this legislative session and the conclusion of the pilot program
she is also a very good speaker
and can probably relate a few war stories to spice things up
please get available dates
i need to be there for this
i left hartsoe a voicemail on this issue too
i'm not sure we can convince massey and others not to cap the secondary market for example
but they need to understand the facts before they run off attacking the pipelines
gas utilities in california opposed interstate capacity expansions into the state
gas utilities had just as much opportunity as anyone else to participate in open seasons for capacity
gas utilities fialed to fill storage
gas utilites have failed to build adequate take away capacity at the cal border i suspect socal gas is using its interstate capacity and its in state storage to line its own pockets
in short
if ferc wants to get to the bottom of the problem they need to look in california
not outside
please forward to vicky sharp
forward to whomever you see fit
it looks like an opportunity to explain price risk management to large customers
steve
take a look at this and contact the sponsor with a yes or no
thanks
decline is ok
enron capital
trade resources corp
i think the presentation looks fine
but consider adding this
there is real risk to utilities
as well as customers
in continuing a regulated regime
the california utilities have been pushed into or to the brink of bankruptcy
the presentation looks fine but consider adding this idea in a few slides
the continuation of a regulated structure poses considerable risk for utilities
california's utilities were pushed to the brink of
or into
bankruptcy because of a regualtory regime which allocated price risk to them
all parties are better off in a system where the regulated enterprise is limited to natural monopoly functions and all other acitivities are conducted in a marketplace

did we cover the shortcomings of the japanese market sufficiently

include on the distribution list and send out note about the monday meeting
thanks for the explanation
i agree
though i may not have explained the context adequately to ken
sorry
i got overwhelmed by california
i have not talked to ken yet and will be in japan until friday
perhaps we can hook up then
i have opened a new lotus file

working group
where i am keeping the contact information
but i am assuming you have picked everybody up already
if in doubt
check out the file
thanks
stay in touch with linda ro the recommendation
thanks for the update
several employees have asked about the exercise policy on stock options
specifically
they want to know what the exercise policy is on i
termination eg as a result of the prc process
ii
voluntary departure
iii
retirement
or iv
resignation
and to what extent do the rules vary across plans
i
aesop
ltip
deferred bonus etc
the main focus is on the length of time to exercise
i am concerned that there may be some odd incentives in the structure
eg are severed employees allowed more time to exercise than employees who just leave voluntarily
ie if you want to have a full three years to exercise options are you better off becoming a performance issue and getting severed than you would be if you simply left the company
sorry for the delay
i have asked the question and should have an answer in a day or two
don't do anything rash in the meantime
linda
i haven't heard of these guys
do you know them
one minor point
the response to the first data request implies that all employees went through the prc process in 0
i am not sure this is accurate
it's fair to say that most did
but i believe that the field employees who are organized into self-directed work teams do not go through the prc process
joe is working with the governor's office and so should go on that list
not the sellers list
you should also check my folder

i'm envious
see you when you get back
congrats ray
now
get ferc to do something amazing
fyi
further distribute this message as you see fit
thank you for the information
unfortunately
we are not interested at this time
is this a 0 question
if so it seems to me we shouldn't bother with it
if this is a 0 question
then let
s discuss
feel free to call me at 0.0.0
please set up some time with linda
yes
please
thanks
yes
i did know about the conference
ken has a copy of the study and made reference to it several times during our visits to sac
a couple of weeks ago
it's nice to occasionally see some rational thinking in california
i look forward to catching up with you when i get back to town
i'd prefer to skip
how big of a problem would that be
i'll do it
i saw steve reynolds
the govs assistant
today
and told him i would do it
i have a lot of respect for geringer
i may try to persuade them that they should reach out to ferc and congress as a state that sees the need for a federal role in transmiission and encourages ferc to act
any background you have would be most appreciated
what do you make of this
this is a thorough and helpful analysis
but
have we considered the broader emergency powers the president might have
i.e
beyond the clean air act waivers requested by a governor
it would seem that the importance of the defense business in california
the large number of military facilities
the public safety hazards of widespread blackouts
etc
ought to trigger some broader authority
i think we need to keep the pressure on
i liked the way our basic messagewas evolving over the course of last week
as you pointed out
the japanesutilities view us as just another annoying us company who is going to comein
bang its head against the wall for a few months and then leave
we neeto continue to reinforce the message that not only are we not going away
ware starting other businesses here to keep us going while we continue to agitate for reform in the electricity sector
is there anything we can tell them about the rates they should expect from the utility
i think that will be the biggest concern and we can reduce backlash if we can provide them some information
i just spoke with clark smith
head of elpaso's merchant arm
i told him that we had been hearing that el paso was blaming enrononline for problems in western gas markets
he asked for some more specifics about who exactly was spreading the rumor
i told him we had heard it from 0-0 sources
he acknowledged that eol was not the problem
said he couldn't believe that it had been identified as such
and said he would bring it up on his call with his washington team this afternoon
i think he will put it to rest
except for whatever damage has already been done
i did promise to get some more specifics on who has told us that el paso pointed to us
can anybody give some info on that
please send any comments directly to peggy
this looks like a run-of-the-mill conference except that the guest list is fairly senior
any interest
if not
let amy know
looks good to me
i'm glad you had the chance to work with linda
is jeff available
thanks
thanks
we are preparing a memo
john has seen it
to go out to each of our offices telling them about this incident
and the related ones that occurred the same day
and including some tips on how to handle such confrontations in the future
could you please put together a combined presentation
enron's strategy and the need for open access on the transmission system
i'll be happy to accomodate
i can take you through enron's view of how markets overall are evolving and how we approach those markets
i'd also like to spend some time reviewing interstate transmission policy and how it affects western energy markets
fax the attached word document to jeff asap
thanks
we are discontinuing the executive car wash
you
steve and i should talk
i saw your e-mail response
did it go to oxley too
is this it
i thought we had heard it from
0 or 0
sources
enron capital
trade resources corp
i think it starts off a bit too hot
i would pull up some of the arguments you make about the need for additional supply and the importance of electricity to our way of life
i'd then go into a discussion of the debacle in the west
and how they are now playing catchup
with loud
polluting diesel generators
as was reported today
then i'd go into how our plants in florida represent a very reasonable
inobtrusive solution for florida
maureen
please forward on to barry when you get his e-mail address
barry
i don't know humberto personally
but looking over his resume
i thought he might be a fit in your organization
humberto
i forwarded your resume to barry hunsaker who is general counsel at eog resources
as you may know
eog used to be enron oil and gas
a majority-owned enron subsidiary
a couple of years ago
enron sold its interest in eog and it became a stand alone company
eog resources has been doing very well
i don't know if they are looking for lawyers now
but i think i sent your resume to the right place
enjoy
yes
mary will discuss with you
attached are my edits
per my voicemail
see my revisions
and one question
let's revise and circulate

i think it would be a good idea to get together
i would include eric thode as he has been living through the pr battles on a daily basis
please call before you leave and please send me your contact information when you have it for your new job
thanks
houston has experienced catastrophic flooding
my flight has been cancelled
it is conceivable that i could get out tomorrow
but i am wondering if i should try
i could still make the speech if we don't get more rain
but given the lack of other reasons for me to go
i am considering cancelling
i don't think it makes much sense for me to go for a 0 minute speech
what do you think
phone 0.0.0
i'm not sure yet
i think we are going to be sending two memos
one that i am working on and on that andy is working on
it looks to me like the message below fits better into andy's memo
i don't think they will be combined into one
but i'll know more tomorrow
the other memo will follow shortly from maureen
as we discussed
the other memo will follow shortly from maureen mcvicker
my assistant
attached is the draft
it combines all three announcements into one
with a common format
it reflects a
just the facts
approach
let me know if you have changes
or answers to the questions in the text
looks fine to me
maureen
please keep on file
will you be filling out mine
we may be able to handle this specific issue outside the policy committee
but i think it would be a good idea to set the next one anyway
i'm sure we'll have something we'll need to talk about
john brindle
david cromley and others in the corporate business controls group
formerly part of ebs
have been working over the last several weeks to make sure that we can get our people out of dabhol if there are threats to their safety
while no plan is perfectly reliable
particularly during monsoon season
we believe that we are as ready as we can be
looks good
nice work
let's get it out
can one of you forward to ed
or whoever you feel appropriate
please update my bio to include human resources and add some boilerplate on enron
you may have seen this when it first came out a while back
but it's worth a rerun
please call me
would it be possible to use livelink to capture the information we gathered for the organization/budget review
such as functions of the different groups and the roles and responsibilities of the different individuals
budgets etc
i hate to see all that ggod information sit idle
i think you are right
i thought we were going to do both
i set up a meeting for next friday in washington with ed g
and ralph reed
starting at 0:0 am
here it is
thank you
i think
attached is jeff's backgrounder in the event you call hertzberg
no need to review with policy committee
i am having lunch on monday with michael isikoff
a newsweek investigative reporter
he is doing yet another ken lay/enron political influence story
one of the things he wants to talk about though
and i think this is a good sign
is enron's climate change policy and how it compares to the administration's
what i need from you
as soon as possible
is a timeline
what the administration said when
doesn't have to be down to the day
the administrations position
and our position
and how they differ
borrow heavily from existing materials
ken left a msg for me on sunday
he was able to return bryson's call
not much new
ken got jeff's paper will try to reach hertzberg on monday
bryson gave an update
very consistent with yours on fri
wants us to think creatively about
how to keep dwr contracts from preventing the comprehensive solution
and how to address the concerns of the state treasurer
ken tried to reach pete peterson
blackstone
but did not make contact
fyi
price cap events of the week
thanks anyway
no need to do anything right now

told ken that he would like to be briefed on the california and broader energy situation so that he can speak out on the issue
also
don't forget that we need to go see your buddy newt
you may want to forward this to your customers
yes
phillippe left to join a firm in new york
i don't know who
you may want to forward this to your customers
sorry for the delay
i had major e-mail problems
the memo looks good
let's get it out
has this gone to ken yet
if not please send
has this gone to ken yet
if not please send
ken hasn't mentioned it
i'll ask next time i talk to him
please add dave delainey
john lavorato and louise kitchens to updates with significant news like this one
they may already get them
i didn't read through all the names
thank you
i enjoyed the discussion very much
the dod has significant challenges
but if the group participating in the meeting was any indication
they have some first rate people working on those challenges
if i can be of further assistance
do not hesitate to call
you have probably heard this already
but on july0
the cpuc postponed their direct access decision until mid-august
fyi
itinerary
i have looked it over
i think they would do a good job
another idea
dick foster
advisor to enron's board and senior director at mckinsey
has a great book out
creative destruction
i was on a panel with him recently where he shared some of his research
he is a very good presenter
he knows enron well
and his work is first rate
he might be a good addition
i have an idea on the breakout sessions
it needs some work but i'd like to talk it through with you
follow up to previous message
i would not have
managing for the slow down
on the agenda
i don't think it is as relevant to our business as it is to many others
i think this letter looks fine
for the hororarium
i suggest we use whatever we paid kudlow for his participation
i believe ken also entered into a consulting contract with kudlow
but i'm referring only to the one-time payment for the advisory council meeting he attended
looks good to me
is there an alternative quote we could use instead of the reference to
stabilizing
in the california market
i think i know what we mean but most outside readers would see the situation as unstable
perhaps we could reference the continued availability of direct access or renewed interest in enron's offerings
i doubt that this is worth the trouble
i.e
running it through a conflict of interest check
ensuring no liability for actions taken on the advice
etc
yes
maureen
please schedule

i know we got a lot of grief on the hill when we had our fight with uc/csu

i love you
call me
i know we are holding for a later filing
but i have attached further comments anyway
the document is still too rough to send out
we need to take the opportunity
as soon as possible
to get a hard hitting
thoroughly researched and carefully written document in front of the commissioners
california's reaction to the judge's recommendation is likely to give ferc
especially the new commissioners
a feel for how irrational the california politicians can be
we will have a limited opportunity to take advantage of that realization
we need to hit it hard in the pleading
our conversations at the commission
the hill and the media
as discussed
has this previously been covered by the office of the chairman budget
if so
please handle
otherwise let me know
the letter looks good
a couple of comments for your consideration
on page three we describe the change to the definition of public utility and then argue that we don't fit into it
would it be worth explaining why that makes sense
specifically
the new jersey restructuring law
like most efforts of its kind in other markets
is designed to separate the competitive from monopoly elements of the power
and gas
businesses
economic regulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the business
eg distribution
the competitive market can not be solely relied upon to
regulate
the behavior of monopoly asset owners
such as distribution utilities
therefore
regulators continue to be called upon to set pricing and other terms of service
what those regulators decide matters a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign contributions to tacitly influence decision makers
the same public policies simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive
the generation and sales business has a competitive structure
i.e
relatively low barriers to entry
multiple competitors etc
these components of the power and gas business can be
regulated
by the market with respect to rates and terms of service
they do not require economic regulation any more than grocery stores
department stores
appliance sellers or other
retailers
who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions
competition and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of service
because regulators don't set the prices and terms of service for such sellers
there is no reason to be concerned about campaign contribuitions from such organizations
indeed
the legislation
and the legislative history
clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale
as a former practicing lawyer
i certainly understand the value of pleading in the alternative
but
i question how certain of our arguments woud be perceived by the public if they ever came to light
which these documents have a habit of doing
i can just see the press seizing on enron's claim of
ignorance or mistake
or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise of
prosecutorial discretion
i suggest that we add whatever we feel is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument
not make specific reference to
ignorance or mistake
and not plead for the favorable esxercise of pd
if we feel we need to write about this last item
perhaps we could suggest that it would be a waste of the public's resources to pursue a claim under such circumstances
i love you
call me
as discussed
my comments are attached
i think the pleading is well written
but
as you'll see from my comments
i believe we should be incorporating more of the arguments from the previous pleading
i couldn't open link
i s this something new for me to sign or have i already complied
attached is the final letter
please note
there was a small change at the top of page 0
see attached
great summary
i think the two main issues you raise are the right ones
but i have one other thought we should discuss internally
do we want to create a set of incentives for the management of pjm that would entitle management to incentive compensation to the extent they meet certain goals
eg relieving congestion on the grid
increasing throughput across the transmission system
expediting interconnection
measured in terms of actual interconnections not just applications approved
etc
this way we could create an organization that would have the incentive to make a workable and open transmission system
see attached
i'm still a junkie
please email copies of the orders
i'm glad things are moving forward
i've talked with dave briefly and willfollow up with him again
kevin scott on 0/0/0 0:0:0 am please respond to kevinscott@onlinemailbox.net
i think it would be a good idea for them to talk
but i wouldn't want jeff to go to california right now
maybe they could meet outside the state
if
for example
brown is going to be in dc or new york
or by phone
see last story attached
congratulations
it looks like you are shaking things up in typical enron fashion
see last point
mit would like to talk to us about energy procurement and management
could you put someone in touch with them
i'm still a junkie
please email copies of the orders
thanks for getting on top of this
please get the word out to the hr team leaders as soon as you know more
i'm glad things are moving forward
i've talked with dave briefly and will follow up with him again
kevin scott on 0/0/0 0:0:0 am please respond to kevinscott@onlinemailbox.net
let's talk
while there is always some value in these things it is ususally quite small and consumes more valuable resources in trying to capture the benefit than the benefit itself
attached are some late night thoughts on the portal
most of this is focussed on the portal for opinion leaders
but some of it could be applicable to the comemrcial portal as well
could you forward this to palmer
for some reason my address book doesn't pull him up when i'm off the system
bonnie
please forward to michael kirby
i think the draft looks good
could you also prepare a draft of the letter we discussed yesterday to convey the proposal to the committee
great news
with respect to the commissoners
i think it makes sense to go back through ellen and ask if she could set up meetings with a few commissioners ater the staff briefing
please respond to
i kept your contact list
but now i can't find the cv you sent
would you mind resending
kevin scott on 0/0/0 0:0:0 pm please respond to kevinscott@onlinemailbox.net
rick
i'm so sorry to hear about this
but i'm glad the outlook is good
let me know if there is anything i can do to help
calendar and meeting file
can you circulate the link to cal tv again
please respond to
calendar and meeting file
can you circulate the link to cal tv again
please respond to
ok with you
congrats
ok
we should include david oxley
vp of human resources
looks fine
attached is a draft of the agenda we discussed
irwin
i show joskow on here but he has already declined
his wife is having surgery right before our meeting date
we may want to consider someone like seabron adamson
frontier economics
or perhaps someone else
congrats
i would like to see research from all of these sources on areas of interest to enron
energy and broadband
north america and europe
thanks
ok
we should include david oxley
vp of human resources
looks fine
no
we have reallocated some of the responsibilities
but cindy has a significant part of the hr organization and continues to manage community relations
so her title is accurate
thanks
this is steve kean's pab
no change
the plan is to make the changes effective 0.0.0
we need to discuss the communication of the changes
my recollection from one of our earlier conversations is that this is considered a benefit change and therefore must be communicated
is that right
is it all employees or only us based
i have a question related to your former responsibilities
as you know terry thorn had significant involvement in the igu
i believe he is still chairman
with his retirement
eff aug 0
he is asking ken lay about the possibility of continuing on behalf of enron
my inclination is to simply resign the chairmanship
but there are other options
let terry continue
i think i know your view on that
or replace terry with another enron person
what do you think
call at 0:0 today
0:0 your time
if you can
the attachment was scrambled
can you send in word format
further to our conversation of the other day
we have compiled some information on political contributions by other corporations
please see attached spreadsheet
as you will note
energy companies are already heavily slanted to the republican party
as are pharmaceuticals for the most part
the interesting one is the financial sector
where contributions are more evenly split with one
bank of america
heavily slanted to the democrats
have a look and let's talk
i take your point
but to clarify my intent in gathering this information
i'm not making the case for a different
tilt
to our giving
i was looking for information about the total giving
including individuals
by companies which share a common viewpoint and may face some of the same risks that we face if the democrats continue their runaway campaign of corporation bashing
pharmaceuticals were included because ken sits on lilly's board and wanted a closer look at that sector
ken asked for the information because he is at least thinking about making an appeal to the business community to send some of the same strong messages we are beginning to send
looks fine to me
but i would change the second sentence to refer to the
council
meeting twice per year
as opposed to
committee
looks good to me
i would not invite glynn to dinner the night before
though
please forward to ralph reed
jerry was one of the people from mercatus conducting a seminar on financial and physical markets for ferc staff
i don't have a role for tom at this time
but i appreciate the interest
looks fine to me
ken had suggested that we try to get schmalensee
sp
for the october meeting as a substitute for joskow
what do you think
my god
this will be a lot of work
how much of this can be pushed to the supervisors
i'll do lunch with sue
letter looks good to me
i've been thinking about this
due to limited battery life
calling areas etc
i'm not sure that a combination cell/pager is the way to go
i'm thinking that blackberries may be worth looking into
per my voicemail
please send me the latest version of our multi-pollutant and cap and trade proposals
ok
i need the following changes to outlook
i need my file folders to be
active
so that i can get stuff out of them and put stuff into them when i am working offline
i need my
inbox
to show all my messages
including the large messages
i don't want to have to check in two places
or more
to review all my new messages
i also need to be able to access those large messages when i am working offline
let's discuss
i think we should emphasize
at the outset
our proposed solution
amy kim is still an open question
i think it's fine to put all charitable contribuitions in one place
are they transferring $ or just responsibilitiy
i want to show jeff the year-to-year differences 0-0-0 and show transfers into the organization
eg from ebs
transfers out of the organization and other reductions in headcount
i'm not sure that we need to include alot of other metrics
they haven't worked in the past
i've been thinking about the need to recast the
e-commerce
position as well
i'm asking maureen to get some time for us to meet
at rice
in the next few weeks
what do we think it means for the pace of reform
is it a mandate
this is still confusing to me
i have made a couple of suggestions
but i still have some questions
see attached
i made some modifications
but we may want to make more
i think we need to emphasoze the reasonableness of our offer
the audience should be redefined as the senators
not just the members of the committee
let's discuss
joann hill is on vacation
i'll look into it
ken
the process description
i.e
where brown could play a key role
is discussed in the middle of the update document
ken is talking to willie brown today
he will encourage him to get involved as a facilitator for a comprehensive solution to the california problem
ken would like to have the following information to provide brown perhaps next week
listing of who is owed how much in california listing of the forward contract holders and the relative size of their positions
any insights about the correlation
or lack of correlation
between the names on those lists listing of the defendants in the class action suits
the objective is to identify for brown what his leverage would be
and what benefits could be offered
if he were to convene the parties to work for a comprehensive solution
please let me know who will take the lead on this
see attached
attached are the drafts as of sunday
let maggie know
i love you
i think you do need to be there
revised documents
reflecting less definitive statements on earnings
revised with kll comments
still need to include all employee memo
i'd like a copy of this
i wrote some comments last night
maureen will fax this am
as you will see
i have some deep concerns about the story
content and the prudence of doing such a story
including all employee memo
attached is an organizational statistics summary for the first half of 0
the hr organization has been working to develop meaningful reporting of trends in our employee population
a few highlights from this report
the employee base continues to grow
though on a significantly slower pace than 0
terminations
voluntary and involuntary
are up dramatically this year
our
contribution loss
a statistic which uses terminations weighted by the performance ratings of those leaving
has gone up
indicating that we are losing more high performers than in previous periods
however
those departures of high performers are concentrated in areas of substantial reorganizations
ebs
the former ee&cc and hpl
let us know if you would like to see additional items on the report or if you have questions about the data
draft of ken's remarks
test
let's send it out
see below
these numbers were gathered in the first week of august
during the time that the hypocrisy of davis
power company bashing was revealed in the conflict of interest scandal
the reality of his failed approach may finally be catching up with him
i left a message
ken has stated publicly that succession will be internal
so we won't be needing these guys
paul krugman has made frequent negative references to enron and its management in his new york times column over the last twelve months
i have refrained from responding until now
below
and in the attached in word format
is a letter i hope you will print
if you wish to contact me
you can call my office

or page me
0.0.0
thank you for your consideration
steven j
kean executive vice president and chief of staff enron corp
it's hard to tell what motivates paul krugman's frequent attacks on enron
enron goes overboard
august 0
his latest attack is no more than a string of misstatements and non-sequitors reminiscent of a schoolyard taunt
he reveals
in depth
his ignorance of enron
the people who work here
and the tragically botched california regulatory regime
perhaps he seeks merely to entertain
the broader goal of his personal attack appears to be to discredit the free market system
a system that entrusts people to make choices and enjoy the fruits of their labor
skill
intellect
and heart
he would apparently rely on a system of government controlled or sponsored monopolies to make choices for people
we disagree
finding ourselves less trusting of the integrity and good faith of such institutions and their leaders
ironically
the example krugman cites of
financialization
run amok
the electricity market in california
is the product of exactly his kind of system
with active government intervention at every step
indeed
the only winners in the entire california fiasco were the government owned utilities of los angeles
the pacific northwest
and british columbia
the disaster that squandered the wealth of california was born of regulation by the few
not by markets of the many
so long as krugman's elitist reasoning prevails
we are doomed to repeat such mistakes
steven j
kean executive vice president and chief of staff enron corp
i got fed up with krugman
sent this out this am
ok if i forward this to billy lemmons
or does he already have it
i think #0 might be at the heart of the matter
if we kept the class size smaller
we could be more selective
pay more for the higher quality talent
make more meaningful assignments
and provide for a more active mentoring and development program
we recommended this to ken and i believe he is very willing
should be coordinated with greg whalley and john lavorato
i received an auto-reply email from terry tang indicating that she is on vacation and that i should forward this to you
in the meantime
i have spoken to ken lay
our chairman
president and ceo
he said that he would be happy to put his name to the letter if that would improve its chances for publication
let me know
this is great
rick
jim and elizabeth
we should look at something like this for the rest of the organization
david
please forward to the appropriate person
starting july 0 we implemented cost savings initiatives designed to reduce enron's cost structure by over $0 million on an annual basis
additionally there has been a substantial amount of restructuring in both ebs and in ees to reduce costs and refocus our business on high value opportunities
as ken has said
though
the basic business model and strategy of enron is sound and promises continued growth
no changes there
for example
in the enron industrial markets and enron global markets groups
efforts begun just over a year ago
we have already experienced enormous volume and revenue growth and we are making money already in these
first mover
businesses
successes like these prove the advantages of our overall strategy and business model
combined with some long overdue focus on costs
we should be well on our way to even greater gains in recurring earnings
thanks so much
it was a tough week
but i am very proud of how the whole team handled it
mark
jeff and i worked on the attached and i agree with your assessment
but ir was not pleased
hopefully
we can all move on now and get back to the work at hand
as much as i enjoyed working with jeff and looked up to him for his intellectual leadership
i feel like the whole place is energized by ken's obvious competence
calm
and heart
i have never felt better about working here
see attached
christie
please check for accuracy on some of the career milestones
maureen
please put on my letterhead
i haven't forgotten
i have one last trap to run
which i will be able to finish in the next few days
i see my numbers are going up but still not high enough
alot of my people are outside of houston
are they solicited anyway
when we are finished i would like to see a breakdown between my houston-based and outside houston numbers
thanks
rob
i was
writing angry
so i wasn't sure how it would come off
i did have my wife take a look and she assures me i didn't go
overboard
at the end of this string is a letter reply to mr
krugman's most recent column
as indicated below
ken lay
our chairman
president and ceo
would be happy to put his name to the letter
that would be our preference
let me know if you need anything more
now what
i think you are the right person to get this
if not
please let me know as soon as possible
see reply to krugman's august 0 column at the end of this email string
ken lay
enron's chairman and ceo is putting his name to the letter and we would prefer that you publish it as such
thanks for the list
one clarification
what do you mean by the sentence starting
how challenged are we really
well
i guess when you lose 0% of your ad revenue you get a little sensitive
i wouldn't say i berated him
it was more like merciless hassling
no message was attached
many quotes from kp
the eastern power markets oracle
on balance a good article
thanks for helping out
i believe we have this already
john b could you send a copy to john s
i think we should find a spot on enron.com to describe management changes
look at the topic below
should we send somebody
we are responding
i'm tempted to compare their decrease in ad revenue with our increase in revenue and eps
who's burning out
privileged and confidential
request for legal advice
some further questions
are we required to have a formal severance plan
can we opt not to have a severance plan and simply handle matters on a case-by-case basis
perhaps with
rule of thumb
guidelines
if we are required to have such a plan
should we centrally administer the plan to avoid inconsistencies
my original message regarding the employee involved was raising a somewhat broader concern
perhaps because our plans are complicated
we have had occasions where an employee was told something
what he/she was told was incorrect
he/she changed position based on what he/she was told
and then we made the employee bear the risk of the mistake
obviously
the right answer is to get it right the first time
but on those occasions where we made the mistake
do we have the flexibility to fix it
i talked to skilling yesterday and asked him if he would be interested in teaching at the jones school
i was very clear that i had not talked to you or anyone else about it yet
he said he would be interested
if you would like to talk to him
i'll give you his number
do we have a time for me to meet with gil yet
i know bob from when he worked for commissioner jesse knight at the california puc
it's worth noting that knight was the lone dissenting voice on the california restructuring fiasco
i told bob that we probably didn't have anything for him in government affairs at this time
but that we could possibly help out by circulating his resume on the hill
ferc and perhaps in the western states legislative and executive branches
if we hear of anyone looking for his expertise on electric issues
i am not asking anyone to make extra efforts
but if you hear of someone looking
please pass bob's resume along
please put a confidential backgrounder re rod wright for lay and i
i'll be joining he and ken for at least part of the discussion
don't know
havent heard anything re long beach
meeting not unitl 0/0
please discuss with vince
i don't know how to engage relative importance
jeff's number is 0.0.0
he has left for a whitewater rafting trip and won't be back for a couple of weeks i think
ask ir
i think we are out of the stock price prediction business for now
but
as ken made clear we are performing better than ever in our core businesses
our growth prospects are superb
and the issues we face are well managed
we should be positioned for a great period of growth
honey
would you post this in the chatrooms
i hope you are enjoying your time in barcelona
a couple of requests
could you give the name of your colleague at hbs who's research you presented at the last enron advisory council meeting
we are organizing our annual management conference and i would like to bounce some ideas off of you and ask for some recommendations for speakers
call when you get a chance
0.0.0
thanks
recurring item for calendar
hold on
dan and i discussed it
but it is not my call whether anyone other than ees bears those costs
for what it's worth
i agreed with dan that to the extent tom and ken had reached agreement regarding
among other things
tom's use of the corporate aircraft for non-ees purposes
that it may not make sense to have ees bear those costs
but it was clear in my conversation with dan that it was not my call to make
i think we should have a version which says that
ken lay named
i don't know that the board actually does the electing
i think ken may just be making sure that they are ok with his decision
i will confirm
we still do and you should go if you can
the next one is in london in october
joannie will be handling the logistics
i am asking maureen to send you the dates
do we have an agenda and/or presentation for the meeting with gov
geringer
also
i would like to see his speeches/presentations and an overview of the business we have pending in wyoming
bill
fyi
i don't want you to take any action on this until we have talked
i.e
please don't forward this or talk to the people involved yet
let's talk when you have a minute
please process the following effective july 0
david oxley and mary joyce base pay increase to 0,0
note
i spoke with our outside comp consultant and reviewed oxley's situation with the ews o of c
mark palmer
pr
to 0,0
note
i previously asked mary joyce to review mark's position and this is the amount we agreed on
i would also like to review shapiro's base pay in light of his now expanded responsibilities
see attached
mike
how about lisa jacobson
fine
kean
steven j
paul kaufman and i met earlier this week with gov geringer of wyoming
he is supportive of a single rto though it is not clear that he favors a ferc mandate
he will wlso be pulling together a small group of western govs to meet with pat wood to discuss the negative impacts of fercs refund and rate cap proceedings on western power markets outside of california
he has asked us for two things
which i believe paul
sue l and janel are working on
agenda and briefing paper we would propose for the govs meeting with wood a
white paper
describing the burdens placed on western markets as a result of the price cap and refund processes
like most western govs
geringer has little tolerance for federal mandates but he is very well informed on energy issues
favors open markets and is very interested particularly in seeing the western power grid opened
geringer will also be participating in bingamin's
panel
on or about oct 0
i couldn't find what i was being asked to approve
welcome and thanks for contacting me
let me know if there is anything i can do to help
i'll ask my assistant to get in touch in the next couple of weeks
maybe we could have lunch
also
my wife is working with the dean of the rice engineering school on a history of engineering at rice
if your wife would like to get to know the engineering community in houston
we may be able to help out
decline
per my voicemail
here is the slide presentation we were talking about this morning
thanks for your interest
we have asked cindy olson to take the lead on forming this group
so i am forwarding your message
just fyi
amabile did not present to enron management as she was unavialable on the day of the meeting
some of her work was presented by her colleague and enron advisory council member
pankaj ghemewat
thanks
please coordinate with linda robertson
i'd like her to be at meeting
this is what i was talking about this morning
this is to confirm my earlier phone conversation with the security desk
effective immediately
terminate access to the enron building for asem atta
if mr
atta attempts to enter the facility please call any one of the following individuals
steve kean executive vice president and chief of staff
0-0
home
0.0.0
john brindle senior director
business controls
0-0
john presley business controls please deal with mr
atta firmly but with courtesy and respect
let's just circulate the presentation and ask people if they have any comments
thanks
as we discussed
i have forwarded this to fitch
you should compare with your list and consolidate
or have gary consolidate
onto one
i talked to ken yesterday and he is fine with this
what does
held
mean
do they start over or do they pick up where they left off
thanks
thanks for all you are doing
this is fully consistent with what we are communicating throughout the organization
we are looking for more motivational speakers and working around a less grandiose theme
restoring confidence
overcoming adversity etc
terrie james is working with ken on speakers
it may be worth discussing at the management committee today
thanks for the inquiry
we do not have an interest in sponsorship
please print attachements also
please find bob lane's phone number for rick
thank you and good luck
stay in touch
i talked to ken yesterday
i had also talked to linda robertson
linda was a little concerned about taking on an incumbent
now majority
senator
i told ken we should wait a bit and he agreed
who else is going to run from the republican side
i think that we ultimately ought to support a republican in this race
incumbency or no
but i want to make sure we back the right one
one more to print
what do you think
thank you
i look forward to seeing you again in the interview process
i'm not sure i would give a list of topics
i'd hate to see what would come of the prc video
perhaps we should just suggest a general theme which would be consistent with the forward-looking thrust of the conference
e.g
a challenge we currently face or will have to overcome to get where we want to go
fyi and please handle
please schedule
calendar
i think you are right
most people will elect to travel by car
alone or in groups
i doubt that a bus will make sense
i don't want this going out unless it has been thoroughly vetted with the o of c
i think we will get alot of
don't knows
when we ask the questions about what the respondent's companies are doing
we can probably find a better tool than a survey to get at that infromation
i'm not opposed to including those questions if you think we will get useful data
but i raise the issue in case there are other questions you mihgt want to ask but didn't have time for
i don't think we will be able to categorize customers in terms of whether they are lapsed
current or prospective
that information is kept on an inconsistent and decentralized basis in the company
finally
given enron's focus on the day-to-day
i wouldn't count to heavily on getting alot of help putting together the stakeholder sample
you should have a back-up plan
thanks for the opportunity to comment
i am very much looking forward to reviewing the results
i think it would be useful to get in touch with the hr leadership and review what is being done and get their ideas on what they think should be done
more than anything i want the organization to know who to go to with their ideas and cut down on the noise level and the perception that we aren't doing anything
this relates to the epa region 0 issue we discussed last week
has koenig seen the ir section
i don't agree with the statement that they have not done a good job communicating with analysts and investors
i can't believe he would think that's accurate
rick
per my voicemail
i don't think we should require employees to walk around with their badges displayed
i don't think they will and i think it will undermine the other measures we are trying to take
also
i want us to have sufficient additional security to do the badge checks to ensure we don't slow down the
badge in
process
the other recommendations look fine to me
i have left a voicemail for greg for his approval
thanks for the update
your approach makes sense to me
fyi
as we discussed
please see attached revised travel advisory
i think it does a better job of balancing the competing interests
no word yet
i will also be seeing barton tomorrow
fyi
i am speaking at his texas conservative forum in austin
per my voicemail
i'll be seeing barton today in austin and will make these points as well
yes and yes
i spoke with jimmy glotfelty on friday
the message they are stressing is that ferc is injecting much needed certainty
i think we should add that to our message as well
i would like to see him if it works on my schedule
per my voicemail
calendar
i think this is fine
it lends itself to an outline format
so i suggest converting to word and make it a one-two page
leave behind
thank you
i enjoyed our discussion very much
thank you
i enjoyed our discussion very much and was very impressed with your accomplishments and experience
and yes i am learning how to use the blackberry reasonably well
i think that since we are targeting some commercial support groups
legal and accounting
we should broaden the term
business unit
to include business unit or functional group
i'm ok with sending this out
but understand that people are up to their necks right now
we may not get much response now
we might get more if we waited beyond the management conference
yes
irwin knows enron and is very amusing
thanks
i think the communication is extremely well put together and informative
the phone option
with the keying in of each letter
looks very complicated but i'm not sure that there is a better way to do it
it will probably just encourage more people to make their elections online
the message from ken about increasing costs should be modified
i think
first
i think we may be overstating it to say that the cost increases for future periods threaten the health of the company
i know it's a play on the
health
theme
but i think it comes off as unnecessarily alarmist
second
and on a related point
i think we should be a bit clearer that we can't keep this up and absent some major change in the underlying cost of health care we are likely to increase the employee contribution in
0 and beyond
finally
i think greg whalley and mark frevert should see this part of the message at least
after we make changes
again
i think this is a very good communications piece
nice work
please print
thank you
i also enjoyed our discussion very much
your accomplishments and experience are extremely impressive
you will be getting a call shortly
if you haven't already
inviting you to our weekend event later this month
please come
i believe i sent this to you earlier
pankaj is a harvard bus school professor who sits on our advisory council
he is putting together a program
in barcelona
i believe
and would like an enron executive to present
i said i would try to find someone from enron europe and gave him your name
would you mind getting in touch with pankaj
i have received my worldcom card
we have already submitted our budget for pr
govt
affairs
facilities
corp hr etc
does the process below affect my numbers
please say no
i will bring john brindle
yes
thinking of you
karen
please send a copy
a penetrating exposition of french culture
useful prep for the girls
next french test
i'm meeting with jerry patterson today
he is running for texas land commissioner
jean said yesterday that we have given him a significant amount of money and that ken has made a personal contribution
eliz
please tell me what we have given
pac and corporate
if any
sally
could you tell me of ken's personal contribution
good update
please put me on the distribution list for future installments
what about the net benefits test
will the rate agreement suffice
call to discuss
i've talked to mcconnell
shankman and reck and gave them my ok
i think this would be awkward given the large number of business units
why not point out that we are always adjusting employment levels across our businesses
we have people leaving as we reorganize or reduce activities in certain areas and we have people moving to other areas or being hired into areas where we are starting new businesses or growing
we simply have not had the mass layoffs that other companies have announced
i'm not sure
a couple of theories
refining capacity is limited because of environmental barriers to new refinery construction
second
in the absence of government subsidies i think ethanol is uneconomic
and with continued low crude prices and an antisubsidy mentality in washington
it's unlikely to get better soon
in other news
melissa's mom called last night
francis is dying
he was slowly going with congestive heart failure and now has renal cancer which has spread to his liver
he has had a great life and is well into his nineties
he is mostly sleeping now and norma will be getting a hospice nurse today
norma seems fine
this has been coming for a while
but of course no one is ever ready
he has stayed himself to the end
when norma was helping him get back in bed after he had fallen
he told her
i don't think we
ll be having sex today
packet is on it's way by fed ex
maureen will call the organizers
approved
i sent the approval to joann
wanted to make sure you saw this
i'm sure you are aware of this
but i am passing along just in case
please reply to lucy
thanks
we are setting up a process to respond directly to these and other comments
questions and concerns
our success depends in part on our responsiveness to these observations
we should get the focus off of
micromanaging ferc
this isn't about a federal agency
this is about which approach will produce the best outcome for consumers and our message needs to be couched in those terms
obviously
our view is that ferc's approach
at least so far
appears most likely to produce the kind of market which will ensure reliable
secure and affordable power
i like the
gerrymandering
message
a process dependent on compromise
eg a legislative body like congress
is going to produce a
camel
and that won't work for customers
truth be told it was this same kind of compromised
political
consensus-building exercise which produced ab 0 and the resulting debacle in california's energy market
here it is
what do you know about this guy
i like your revised version
i have placed a call to barton
in case i don't reach him
i put the attached letter together
what do you think
i like the first opening paragraph better
also
please don't use the term
corporate relations
i think
community relations
works fine and won't create as much confusion with public relations
corporate communications or other functions
thanks
congratulations
sorry to see you go
i like jim to make these calls because he is up to date on the legal community and our interests there
put in the request and send to eliz
then we'll put it in front of derrick
she might
might
be a fit in billy lemmons group
thanks for your message
we met about the fire drill process yesterday and will have something shortly
one of the issues we are facing is the absence of
floor wardens
people who know the procedure and can help it move smoothly if there is a problem
if you are willing to volunteer
contact mike terraso
thanks
third quarter qs and as
stan horton called about the production tax credit for enron wind
enron wind is one of the many companies he's responsible for and he is going to be getting more deeply involved
at least on this issue
i will forward your latest update
originally to mark metts
but i think you should provide a new update for stan as well as a discussion of what we are doing
or should be doing
to get the extension
here is the most recent update i have
i have asked our dc office to give you a further updat and to look into what else we should be doing
the summary below is a bit dated
as is everything done before sept 0
congress is now expected to adjourn this month not next
otherwise
the report on the prognosis for ultimate passage remains accurate i believe
absolutely
im sorry i saw this so late
we could have talked today
let's talk mon
i assume you get these
if not
you should make sure you are on the list
see changes proposed to q&a
still working
as discussed
see attached
revisions
we will need to get new business cards
see attahced
thanks
final
looks good
a very preliminary draft
a very rough
off the top of my head
draft
attached are some messages to consider using for the upcoming internal discussions
the document is not intended as a script but as a starting point for your remarks
see revised version
thanx 0 being so patient
here
my story
nora
see attached with my comments
i didnt select them
thanks anthony
it's difficult to see so many smart
hard working people in the kinds of circumstances you describe
unfortunately
i'm going through some of the same things
on a smaller scale
we are having to let people go in my organization
i simply don't have room
even for a qualified person like maurice
does global markets still have a presence in singapore
if so
perhaps there is an opportunity there
voicemail from ken
attached is a set of message points we developed with the finance group for use with our external audiences
kean
steven j
i'm copying karen
thanks for the heads up
my view is we probably won't want to expend resources or ken's time on this right now
it looks like a story that can wait a bit
kean
steven j
i concur
please look into this
here it is
please look into this and give shelley a call back
we can always reconsider in the sense of providing support to someone else
but the money to brown is out the door
i would still like to see the data
bob eury is asking ken to lend his name and encourage employee support for light rail
rosie please confirm with ken
but i think he should allow bob eury to use his name in support of the mainstreet light rail project campaign
yes on prop 0 and no on prop 0
but i would say no on employee support
attending rallies etc
right now
we have too much to do right now
assuming he agrees
let misha know
got your msg
call me at 0.0.0
nice work
thanks
no
but thanks
some additional background on the california refund issue
consistent with what we discussed
just some additional detail
looks good
tracey prepared the attached to make sure we had the facts surrounding another related party
the travel agency in the park
as you'll see from the attached use of the agency is encouraged
for sound business reasons
but is not mandatory
i know this is not technically an employee relations issue
but it looks like the kind of thing you have dealt with before
i agree with john
there is little point showing this to ken
but you personally know him better
so i leave it to you
thanks so much for the message
i am hanging in and hanging on
as is everyone else
i have never seen such courage and strength in an uncertain environment
thanks for your offer
you hang in there too
please make sure these individuals know that they have been designated
see below and look at attachment
in a subsequent message the comment was made that the drop off today is typical for post bid week activity
here is a suggested lay quote for the special committee release
with the formation of this special committee and the attraction of additional capital
which we are also announcing today
we are taking care of the past and securing the future
thanks
jeff
we have already retained a crisis pr firm
kekst and co
they have been working with us for the past few weeks
feel free to mention them to chase
nice
fine as written
shankman told me tonight that the additional piece that makes up the difference between the 0.0 and the 0.0 has not been irreversibly committed to
so we don't have to pay
thursday is fine
please schedule
thursday is fine
let's talk about the proposed expenditures
we will need to prioritize
thanks so much
as the week wears on we may need to contact our distinguished friends in the academic community and ask them to comment on some of the actions we are taking
i will be in touch when the time comes
it's going to be postponed til feb
i think you should attend when we have it
thanks
please see revisions
jordan mintz told me that the release needs to be reviewed one more time by securities lawyers
he will take care of it
here it is
david would you please forward to the right person
looks good
in the memo i wouldn't have ken refer to dean powers as
bill
sounds too chummy in light of what he is doing
this is the final version agreed to by citi and chase
i think we should shoot for tuesday
after the written info is released mon
i will work on a release today that announces the tues call and the mon written disclosure
here's what i think we should say in the release 0
explain the silence
complex transactions
we wanted to provide clear and full explanations
new cfo getting up to speed
and we've been busy getting liquidity and meeting with rating agencies etc
0
promise the additional disclosure
monday's written info and tues call
and 0
list the topics
i also think it needs to be a call not a webcast
what do you think
would be happy to
just let me know where
the board has asked for a draft communications plan
attached is an outline
obviously
it is a bit premature to finalize the plan
so this presentation just reviews different scenarios
i don't think so
meredith please give cheryl a copy of our external q&a draft
cheryl
it's a draft and the sec lawyers have not fully vetted it
some good news
your call to gov rowland was helpful
we are not finished yet
but we are on our way
thanks for thinking of us
we have retained a crisis communications firm
kekst
co
to assist us
they have extensive experience with the various challenges we are facing now and have been most helpful advising us and ken
in case you need to reach someone in ir or pr
here are 0-hour numbers
board meeting running long
nice work
john
please copy me and ken on any recap you put together
the deal is final
attached are some communication materials for you to use
please provide your thouhgts to peggy
if you'd like
i can set up a tour of the enron center for you and anyone else you'd like to include
i agree with beth
we had some other options to pursue before we got to that stage
but the dynegy option was the best
it's overstating it a bit to say it was the only way to keep the ship from going down
this msg is about new bldg tour
anything further yet
irwin is on enron's advisory council
could one of you send him a reply
linda was assistant secy of us treasury while this legislation was being negotiated
let us know if we can help
some background information for the meeting with mayor brown
brown won 0% of the vote
to sanchez
0%
and is now in a run off with sanchez
sue walden's perspective
not surprisingly
is that brown will win and that campaign polls show him ahead among likely voters
african american turnout in the election was lower than expected
but an active get-out-the-vote campaign could turn that around
enron has supported the mayor with a $0,0 contribution
i would not recommend a further commitment under the current circumstances
if you want to discuss some of the positive accomplishments of his administration
you could
congratulate him on passage of his version of the light rail proposition
compliment him on how he has responded to security issues since sept 0 and his handling of flood relief
you should know that the houston police were extremely helpful and responsive when we asked for assistance in connection with the october 0 threat to the enron building
we have responded to the city's rfp for energy service
ees made a presentation last week proposing a 0-0 year transaction the city is opting for a 0-0 year transaction that would require very detailed load data which is in reliant's possession
we have expressed concern that we are merely a stalking horse in the city's effort to do a deal with reliant
we have said that we won't play on those terms
separately
we are working with the city on a demand side deal
ken talked with barton
barton will not be signing the letter the leadership met and decided
since they are going to be in session anyway
they would try to pass an electricity bill
barton is now targeting a mid dec markup there is a meeting tomorrow at 0:0 between wood and tauzin
barton was supposed to be in dallas
ken urged him to stay for the meeting
not clear if he will
i got the impression from ken that part of the reason barton is not sending the letter is that he thinks he will be passing a bill anyway
not necessarily that he disagrees with the substance of the letter
thanks for the message
i don't know of anything moving forward as yet
i think the answer is this
fully consistent with the successful completion of the transaction with dynegy we are taking the actions we need to take to stabilize enron's situation
these actions are important to preserving the value of what dynegy is buying
the merger agreement
of course
has a
no shop
provision
and it has provisions
as i understand it
to make sure enron continues to run the business prudently
that's what we are doing
could you take a look at this
thanks for the invite
we will probably still be on our way back from new mexico
we're driving
so we won't be able to come
have a good time
i know you will
i hope your blackberry is working better than mine has been over the last few days
i understand that ken and chuck have spoken and that greg
stan
and dave will be coming over at 0:0 and no one is expected to be there at 0:0
correct
thanks for the inquiry
i appreciate the interest very much
but i am not interested in participating
please review and comment on the attached
please review for send out monday
please call me re the attached
see revised version attached
melissa's mom will be coming
so we will be sticking around hous
absolutely
send electronically
if possible
thanks
it asked me for login info
see minor comment and then circulate to the larger group
ask everyone to send you the info to fill in the blanks
and to copy the others on the list
perhaps you could join in on oxley's 0:0 call
i'll ask by copy of this message
i'm sorry
i told mom
phil and karen
but not you
francis died two weeks ago
norma is fine
she is taking care of things and when she gets done will be coming to see us
around christmas
thanks for the information
it looks like i have a sizable additional tax bill
am i missing something
do i have enron stock i can sell to offset these gains
e.g
in my savings plan matching
other ideas
michelle
can you respond
i haven't seen anything
also
after our meeting we had talked about making a proposal to them
specifically
we were at least going to describe the actions we took so they might have the opportunity to acknowledge that we had done enough
i know everyone is busy
but i would like us to get ahead of this while we have a good environment for resolution
attached are two versions of a press release
we plan to issue one of these before market open tomorrow
the second version assumes financial close on the remainder of the secured credit facility
i need someone to confirm or deny
the first version speaks only to the merger and our debt restructuring efforts
please review and provide comments as soon as possible to me and karen denne
karen.denne@enron.com
i understand that jeff mcmahon and jimmy lee will discuss the attached at 0:0 cst tomorrow
as discussed
please prepare the letter to mclarty for my signature

houston contact list
i've sent some releases and other info to mike b
let me know if i need to resend
here is the draft forwarded to dynegy
any reason we couldn't do this
my comments
i don't have any comments to add
attached is the draft release
i didn't mean to come across too pessimistic on the way in this am
the release does contain good news and we need toget it out as soon as we can
this is an article that irwin stelzer wrote abut enron
he is willing to talk further
his number is 0.0.0
he said he would like to have me on the phone when you call
you should read this
you won't like some of the comparisons
but it is a nice statement about what our team has accomplished
thanks
approved
fyi
anybody we can recommend
see me about this
thank you so much for your message
and thanks for sharing that particular memory
it means alot to me
i have always enjoyed working with you
you have always been so quietly competent and thorough
it made me smile just to see you
you are an important part of
my enron
i take away from this place a great deal of learning and experience
but most importantly i take with me the memories of the wonderful people like you
all the best
here is the electronic copy
i wrote a letter of recommendation for you
you're getting it whether you want it or not
thanks so much for the note
i remember our trip to dubuque very well
my father asked about you many times after that visit we had the evening before our meeting
i am glad you are well and wish you the very best for the holidays and the new year
i'll be glad when this one is over
attached is my resignation from the pac
in my email inbox i have a few expense reports for me and john brindle
please review and approve john's
please check on mine
they show that they are paid but on one it looks like they paid double
it may be that the first one didn't go so they reissued it
but i just want to make sure that it was paid and only paid once
thanks for the link
sounds like they are doing well
i'm sure that it is due to our analysis and advice
i assume mary has had her baby
how is everything
as for deer hunting
it's been really exciting as we've been seeing lots of young and middle aged bucks and a bumper crop of fawns for the first time in my memory of over 0 years of hunting there
i have not taken anythin but our hunters have gotten a 0
0 and 0 point
the 0 point grossed 0 b&c swhich is not giant but a darn respectable deer anywhere in the us and outr third largest ever
for calibration
mine grossed 0
i have one good 0 point that's about 0
wide and 0.0 yeears old but i may let weldon shoot him as he has not gotten a deer there in 0 years of hunting
i'm still open to you going there to take pictures
it may be hard to schedule but i really would not mind if you wanted to go down there and tkae some pics on your own
i've got one blind at which the feeders are close and the deer move nearly all day
you could drive down for the day and easily snap some good photos from sunup to sundown or from noon to sundown
whatever
call me at 0-0-0 if you are interested and we can work it out
melissa and hunter are doing well
he's 0 now and will start pre-school next year
we may have another one on the way but we're not sure yet
enron is great and everything i hoped for really
i will be rotating as scheduled to a new role in feb/mar
how are things at dell
later
charlie
congratualtions
will
may god bless you and your family
she's a beautiful baby
how is recruiting going
any idea where you think you will end up
i'm sorry it did not work out at enron
i know that you will do well wherever you go
charlie
i want the same as i currently have
all i need is a page refill for 0

hope you had a good thanksgiving weekend
i'd like to catch up with you today if possible regarding recruiting etc
can i reach you by phone
if so
where
you can call me toll free at 0-0-0-enron and follow the menu
my extension is x0 or you can use the voice activated system
thanks
charlie
had a great time this weekend
i'm sure glad that travis got another good buck under his belt
i think he is now ready to move it up a notch on the next deer and if everything stays good at the ranch then it should be pretty possible next year
i was also wondering if you and mama talked about paying melissa for her painting
mama mentioned to melissa that she
owed
her but nothing more than that
she worked for no less than 0 hours and was disappointed that she would not be able to do the rest of the house as we really need the money
our negative checking balance needs some injection of cash and melissa had hoped to use the money to buy a few things for christmas this week as well
if you haven't already
i'm sure that you can broach the subject with mama without letting her know that i asked
anyway
melissa really wanted to be able to paint more and is upset that she wasn't able to
prove
to mama that she is willing and able to work hard
she still gets those not so subtle jabs all the time from mama about not working outside the home
for the record
she busts her ass keeping our house clean
clothes washed and ironed
meals cooked
and doing lots of things to make sure we have a happy
healthy
and well adjusted son
if there is a way
later
that you can subtly encourage mama to hold back on these jabs when we next visit
it will go a long way toward ensuring a good christmas for everyone
anyway
definitely keep all of this confidential between me and you
there is no major problem here but i wanted to check off with you on this so we can help keep everything going smooth and folks getting along
i'm sure you see my point of view here
thanks
charlie
thank you very much for your obvious interest and commitment to doing a high quality job in your prc representative role
per your request
i am attaching my resume and a brief outline of my contributions during the last few months
i am currently in my first rotation as an associate which i began this past summer following graduation from ut with an mba in energy finance
i am assigned to vince kaminski's research group on the market fundamentals team
this team is commonly referred to as the
weather group
and is headed by my supervisor
mike roberts
we are located on the gas trading floor
0nd
and provide direct support to all the gas desks as well as weather derivatives trading
thanks again for your interest and i am looking forward to meeting you
please let me know if you need any additional information
sincerely
charlie weldon
i will be unable to attend
thank you
charlie weldon
thanks
here's the file
if you break the date column up into three separate columns for month
day
and year then you can use subtotals and/or pivot tables to analyze the data a little more quickly and dynamically
for example
you might want to look at the extremes or averages for any particular month or year or whatever
i c an help you do this if you want
remember that this is a very limited data set statistically speaking
especially considering that the last 0 winters were far above normal
if you want to investigate what the possible extreme scenarios are based on past history then i can get you the data for many decades further back if wish
just let mw know
thanks
charlie
can there not be an argument made to dive into txn
it's trading at 0 forward p/e
0
with a 0-year consensus growth rate of 0.0
a peg of ~0 on a high quality stock with superior technology
good management
great market position and tremendous long-term growth has got to be an opportunity
right
what's your view
the technicals
macd
are not great right now but i think fundamentally this is a tremendous value long-term
it looks like the economy has really got the brakes on now
too much
but wouldn't you expect the market to begin pricing in rate cuts in 0 pretty soon and an eventual return to high growth in technology
i wouldn't touch any peripheral players but some of the megacap stocks with great market positions
like txn
are sure tempting
nasdaq down 0% from its march high and not looking good at the open
this could be a
buy while there is blood in the streets
opportunity
thanks for the info
the $0 is definitely far more than we expected or think she deserves so we appreciate it
no need to send any more
really
if you want to give her more
then you can put it toward a christmas present or something
are you going hunting this weekend
it's going to be cold and probably wet so it should be perfect
charlie
kristin
attached is a file with the data and graphs of some of the bc rivers you requested
i only got an exact match on station in a couple cases and in many of the cases the dataset is limited
additionally
i added some other stations that had what might be some useful data even though they were not the exact station requested
to firm up whether or not these surrogate stations are valid
i need a very detailed map of the region
i assume whoever needs this info has one
anyway
take a look and let me know what you think
this file is a good representation of the type of data available on the cd
it may not be perfect but i'm afraid that we will have a pretty tough time getting better data from any other source
not that i will give up though
thanks
charlie
i guess i would have shot him
look out for very cold temps by this weekend and next week
coldest in 0 years
i think the ranch was owned by jimmy powell
it was 0 miles west of menard on hwy 0
a great area that's for sure
three deer have been killed on the ranch thati know of so far
0
0
0 point by wayne scroggins that grossed ~0 and is third largest ever on ranch
didn't weigh it but they estimate it was 0-0 lbs
0
mike lehnert
mickey's son
killed an 0
0 point with a double main beam
four brow tines
and a drop tine
0
travis shot a 0
0 point that was pretty nice but had two broken points
we've seen more bucks than we have since
0
more fawns than i ever remember
maybe things have turned around for awhile
i've got some good videos i'll show sometime
when are ya'll coming
i'll let you know where you can go
probably pretty much anywhere in buddy's or i might can arrange for you to sit in another area
it won't be a problem but we will need to communicate
right now my friend weldon is hunting in my blinds as he has not gotten a deer in 0 years and has paid my dad ~$0 over the period
paul is still hunting in there too and that's where travis killed his deer
check out the following link on the weather
take the last three days with a grain of salt because those forecasts are automated and tend to spit out some garbage
however
a true blue norther should be coming and don't be surprised if dallas sees the teens next week with highs below freezing
we'll probably come down on the 0st
if you are still there then maybe we can hook up and go out there together and laugh away the deer
how does a january/february trip up to grapevine sound
oh yeah
melissa's pregnant
due first week in august
it's early so we are being cautious but i figured you would want to know
up 0.0%
for now
vince
mr
horn's request has been taken care of
he has the data he wanted and knows how to call it up on his bloomberg terminal in the future
charlie
indeed
if the weather models that run tonight confirm still are as intensely cold as today's and the present hint at another arctic blast to directly at the east coast next weekend continues then we could approach $0
pretty risky business here being short or long
eh
a frozen precip event in the deep south and houston is not unlikely next week
i saw it
after our conversation
i did add some citi and wachovia and have since lost but i still think it's a good move
hopefully there will not be any more financial pre-announcements so the focus will quickly shift towards the future lower interest rate environment instead of the mediocre past
i am now completely out intel and did trim some other
i'm pretty balanced now between financials
tech
drugs
energy
and consumer
wmt
ene closing at $0+
you are a professional
any day next week except monday or thursday is good for me
not sure how i got your e-mail at v.charlie.weldon@enron.com but my username is v.charles.weldon@enron.com
i would recommend selling intel today
it is up with the market this morning even after a bad announcement
the fundamentals for anything pc related going forward are the worse they have been in 0 years or more
the best summary of what is going on here that i have read recently
jim
are you going to invite the others
charlie
i saw that too
i agree on ferguson but i think toombs will have to show that he can play with all his heart
and ass
every week
he could be a bettis type back if he stays committed
in case you haev not heard
we are likely to have an ice storm here tomorow
i would call this the arctic express
i think fergie will stay unless his grades knock him out
in that case
i would say he is a third rounder or so
which ain't bad for 0 games in div
i agree
even the best of accounting maneuvers will not be able to hide the fact that
if
ebs is not fundamentally successful
so the question is
is there a way to go long ene and short ebs
probably not
but if there were a surrogate for ebs
the trade might work in most scenarios
how about shorting a long-term broadband contract
that's the irony
not sure
i am writing to inform you that the deadline for your offer of employment from enron has been extended until january 0

ouch
thank you
tomorrow's another day
looks like i bought arba at the top
todd
thanks for the info
i may need some help decoding the info so we can get exact durations for warnings
however
i think we should wait until we get a genuine expression of interest from a counterparty before we spend any more time on this
it's definitely good that we have this data though should we need it
pre-0 is probably not necessary at this time
thanks

try this link for the
official
view on the economy and future fed actions from enron's chief economist
it's a bit different than most
most useful buttons for you will be
executive summary
and
cold air alert
i watched the whole game and was extremely impressed with benson
he definitely got good blocking but he showed power
speed
balance
vision
i believe only an injury will prevent him from having massive success
his interview after the game showed me that he's pretty mature also
i'll take over 0 yds next year if you take under
he sounded reasonably intelligent but nothing to get too excited about
i'll be shocked if he gets redshirted regardless of how good hayter is
benson is the 0th all-time rusher in texas history having just passed the great robert strait from cuero
0-0
and almost passing rodney thomas
those guys don't get redshirted
i'm befuddled about the o-line numbers
ya'll got this kid winston this weekend over us even though we have only one ol commit and need 0 or so
slocum has got to close the deal on a few more of these top recruits or we are doomed
0 of the top 0 linemen are still available and we've got a reasonable shot at them but hightower
#0
still says he's going to visit and consider texas
amazing
any comments
i've got slr and flex in this group and maybe that's a good thing
we'll see

just a reminder concerning follow-up with the weather channel and energizer holdings regarding potential hurricane derivatives
additionally
i found the following link which describes ray-o-vac's recent earnings warning
among other things
they mention that they had tough comparisons due to an active storm season the year before
i believe they are referencing hurricanes and represent another potential opportunity in my opinion
one more thing
as i mentioned in our conversation
i believe that the weather channel is an ideal candidate for approaching concerning hedging against a lack of extreme weather of all kinds
i know that they are financially
not doing so well
at present due in some part to a lack of hurricane activity and are now enjoying great ratings due to the extreme cold
they may be a hard sell but they are as purely exposed as anyone and should be worth the effort
especially after the recent story they did on us
please let me know how i may be of assistance
thanks
charlie
this is an excerpt from an internal weather channel
landmark communications
newsletter
blizzards produce high ratings for weather channel
record page views more people turned to the weather channel instead of their local tv affiliates to get news about this week's blizzards in chicago and detroit
and nearly 0 million viewers
a record
went to weather.com to follow the storms
in a survey by survey usa
0 percent of tv viewers said they found out about the blizzard from the weather channel
compared with 0 percent who watched their local nbc affiliate station
and 0 percent who tuned into a local radio station for news
twc also was the winner
at 0 percent
with those who said the weather network did the best job of covering the storm
another 0 percent said their nbc affiliate did the best job
and 0 percent said chicago and detroit cbs affiliates were tops
a record number of pageviews
0.0 million
were recorded at weather.com
twc produced a 0 a.m
to 0 p.m
rating of 0.0 on monday
delivering an average of 0,0 households
this performance is well over twice the average december monthly rating to date
kansas city and st
louis recorded the highest metered market ratings during the blizzard
followed by detroit
the chicago rating also was within the top 0
keep trying
we are definitely interested
how much does a pair of tickets to an inaugural ball run
in the case of the texas society ball
it would be cheaper to join for $0 and buy the tickets for $0
this does sound like a good one to go to based on the website but sounds like we are out of luck there
i imagine
hope
that the other balls are comparable
i found several airline quotes for ~$0 as you indicated
if we can't get wilkerson
hightower
both top 0 nationally
and a decommit or two from texas or somebody based on this news then our coaches are indeed pathetic salesmen
these guys can come in and start as redshirt frosh if not play as true freshmen
even though rc likes to redshirt all ol'men
we've got a 0-deep ol lineup for next year but i question the quality as only a few were legit blue-chips and i like the odds of getting bluechips versus sleepers
i think we'll get one of the 0 studs and maybe both
the main concern is that our primary weakness in the past few years has been a lack of dominate line play
we've got the skill guys

charlie
december's winter weather events
coupled with early wintry weather in october and november
boosted the network to an all-time high 0th quarter rating
despite comparatively lower averages early in the quarter due to quieter than usual hurricane activity
did you do it
i will be there
thanks

why don't you buy deep in the money put options
they will have a high delta and hence move almost dollar for dollar with the stock
check out nok feb 0 puts
nzymk.x they are up 0-0/0 while nok is down 0-0/0
0 contracts out wth 0 traded today so liquidity shouild be ok
buy 0 ericy for ~$0 and one nok put contract of nzymk.x
that should give you a delta on nok equiv to shorting $0 of the stock
did i figure this right
sounds somewhat believable
i can imagine the frenzy on the discussion boards if that got out
i won't be the one to put it out there
i think one more year and then its done
would the motivation for the aggie ad to work really be only money
yep
we won't miss him as much as we will fergie if he goes though
i think if he's fully committed to being as good a pro as possible he could be really good
we'll see
we'll likely move joe weber to fb
he's ~0 lbs and pretty fast for a fb so he'll do
whitaker will still be tb but we've got a redshirt frosh named keith joseph who has the dimensions of eddie george and played really well on the scout team
i'll bet he sees a lot of pt at tb if he's really that good
he was one of the very few guys that rc got over maciii in the last few years of recruiting
ene up 0-0/0
option bid only up 0 teenies from where i bought it though
the spread on options is about a 0/0 which makes it tough
rebecca
i was looking in ehronline at my available vacation to verify that it all got accounted for correctly in 0
it appears that it did except for the fact that when i attempted to view my available vacation for 0
it only indicates that i have 0 hours available
i should have an additional 0 hours left due to the 0 hours that accrued on 0/0/0 and the 0 i had left over
can you please let me know how to reconcile this in the system

shares of enron corp

ene
quotes
news
boards
were smacked around again yesterday
following close on the heels of seven-session decline that sent the stock down more than 0 points
or 0%
from its recent high of $0.0
december 0
all amid uncertainty and considerable volatility
the pullback doesn't appear to be company-specific exactly
although the rumblings in a certain geographic region
namely california
are triggering aftershocks throughout the u.s
energy community
as we outlined in a report on january 0
the energy situation in california has rapidly reached crisis proportions
strict environmental legislation and the uncertain profit potential post-deregulation has kept utilities from installing sufficient generating capacity in the state over the last 0 years
the state's two major utilities
pg&e corp
nyse
pcg
quotes
news
boards
and edison international
nyse
eix
quotes
news
boards
are facing the prospect of eventual insolvency due to the spiraling costs of electricity purchased on the open market
however
the rates the utilities can charge their customers for power represent a fraction of the costs that prevailed during the gradual rollout of full-scale deregulation
the risks to enron are two-fold
for one
the crisis in california may result in a default of payments to the state's major wholesale energy providers
including enron
although the company does operate in california
the bottom-line impact would likely be shielded to a considerable degree because of enron's size
strength
and diversified global revenue streams
in addition
enron would likely be high on the list of default payees given its importance to future wholesale energy supplies in the region
more significantly
investors are concerned that california legislators may pull the plug on deregulation entirely
or at least until the current crisis abates
some also fear this mess might derail utility deregulation in other states as regulators and politicians alike become fearful of adverse and unintended economic consequences
neither scenario is probable
for one thing
the airline industry was deregulated in fits and starts
with plenty of mistakes and recrimination along the way
and a strong argument can be made that the shortage of electric power would have pressured rates sharply higher even in a fully regulated environment
the california public utility commission will attempt to decide the best course of action this week
it appears inevitable that
regardless of pg&e and edison's ultimate fate
the state's energy consumers will likely absorb much of the burden through an increase in the prevailing rate cap
enron has also fallen victim to the rotation out of strong defensive stocks on the heels of the federal reserve's unexpected interest-rate cuts last week
the initial euphoria has waned
however
upon the realization that the sharp rate cuts will serve to offset what appears to be a rapid rate of erosion in domestic economic growth
rather than generating a rebound in economic activity
as a result
we expect investors once again to seek the shelter of well-capitalized defensive plays like enron
we would emphasize that several factors that weigh in enron's favor have been overlooked amid the california crisis
the november-december period was 0% colder than normal and the second-coldest start to the winter months in the past 0 years
coupled with an uncertain supply situation
particularly in natural gas
enron stands to profit handsomely from energy volatility and pricing
an environment that is likely to exist for at least the next 0 months
in addition
enron's diversification into still more new avenues of growth help to insulate the company from additional challenges of this sort in the future
the markets for enrononline
a real-time commodities exchange vehicle
and enron's broadband services unit are expected to at least triple over the next year
an eventual inflection point in the groups
profitability would serve to send profits measurably higher in the long term
despite the recent turmoil
enron's consensus earnings estimate for 0
according to first call
has come down a mere penny
to $0.0 a share
although the stock's rich price/earnings multiple of 0 times may aggravate its near-term volatility
the absence of a complete collapse of the stock indicates the market approves of enron's maneuvers so far and is confident in its prospects going forward
i don't disagree with your view
but i wouldn't count broadband out yet
it may be going slower than we like but it might come around eventually
if it doesn't then there certainly will be hell to pay in the stock rice

fund companies have either launched or filed paperwork with regulators for the first four mutual funds focusing on the new-power/alternative energy industries
unlike broader energy funds
this pack will focus to varying degrees on a thinner band of the energy/utilities sector
namely companies that either sell power at steep prices to utilities unable to keep up with their customer's demand and those developing new ways to keep the lights on or maybe even run your car

the taxes that you owe will be based on any gain on whatever we sell

if we bought $0 of enron stock that is noe worth $0 then you will only pay tax on the $0 gain

just tell them to send you $0
you should have at least that in cash
if there is any extra leftover and you need the cash
you might as well take it too but that's up to you
enron is up a bunch again today so you should do well selling today

$0 from you and $0 from vikas on my march nymex trade i closed today

here is an excerpt from my write-up on my projects

agricultural modeling in an effort to help the financial trading group begin effectively trading commodities
we have attempted to locate a commercially available crop modeto predict macro-crop effects based on real-time weather data and forwardweather scenarios
we have purchased a model known as dssat
which is highregarded in the agricultural modeling community
one of the primary authorof this software
joe ritchie
has recently retired from michigan state university and is moving to texas
dr
ritchie ahs expressed interest inproviding assistance to us in setting up this software
his new address is0 camino principal
belton
texas 0 and telephone is 0-0-0
his colleague
dr
gerritt hoogenboom
at the university of georgia has confirmed that this is the best software for our needs and that dr
ritchiewould be ideal for providing us the help that we need
a second software product known as
pcyield0 has been suggested
pcyield is based on the dssat model but is supposed to be more user friendly
howeverdr
hoogenboom has suggested that the dssat model that we purchased is probably the better fit for our needs
the salesman for pcyield is namedbill bodine and he works for a company called mpower 0
he has indicatedthat he wants to visit us in houston on february 0nd

of the deal currently is
thanks
charlie
i'm staying away from small caps
note their performance yesterday in light of apparently good news
this guy has amazingly good 0/0 hindsight
he's painting the fed as behind the times and inept at managing monetary policy in this new economy
in fact
it was greenspan's willingness to embrace the new economy's higher gdp
speed limit
and unemployment
floor
that enabled this unprecedented economic expansion
while it is true that the fed's tightening is largely responsible for this downturn
it is not solely responsible
and it is the fed's nimbleness over the last month in reversing monetary policy that will prevent this downturn from being a mere bump in the road
i got my w-0 but i haven't looked into the impact of moving on income
i think it is sad that he died but i
m certainly fine
he was pretty old and i really was not really close to him though
but he was a very nice and intelligent man
about 0 years ago
i went to utah on business with dupont and i stayed over the weekend with him
he took me all around salt lake city and showed me a bunch of neat stuff
that's what i will remember about him most
i'm in on calpine
just bought
per andrew
let's plan on meeting
or at least touching base
on thursday at 0:0
i'm attaching a revised summary and a spreadsheet derived from the one maria sent me on monday
please take time to review both documents to see if we're still heading down the right path
just fill out form and send $0 in
contribution is for year 0
i've been real busy
it's saturday
will that work
lunch is likely
call me then
andrew
can we move tomorrow's meeting to 0:0 instead of 0:0
i have a structuring class all day
mark will need to leave at ~0:0 so i'll try to be up here a little early if possible
i'll send a nother note with a conference room if i can get one

you may consider linking to this regular column from your gopusa site
i'm always ready to crap but if you want assistance pre-crap
then let me know
one less competitor
my cousin told me about chewing your ass out
he was pretty embarassed as he is really a nice guy
here's the link to the gas fundamentals site
john
attached is the estimated notional bid for the 0-year term gas
0/0-0/0
delivered per your proposed project with national fuel
the bid as of tuesday's closing prices comes to $0.0/mmbtu with the following assumptions
0
per goeff storey
the basis spread is zero from the mid using the cgpr-niagara curve
0
national fuel will deliver the gas on the nfg system at niagara
the desired point per storey would be on tcpl/niagara system on the canadian side of the border and hence a 0 cent discount has been applied for transport
it is possible that it could be negotiated with nfg to deliver the gas on the tcpl/niagara system
0
nymex bid is six cents off the mid for a ten year quote of this
small
size
let me know if you have any further questions
thanks
charlie
here are the updated curves as of last nights close
let me know if you need anything else
charlie
the curves in this file were off by a month since april is no longer valid
see the attached file for the correct prices and months
charlie
eric and i will come by ~0:0
thanks
charlie
my supervisor is ed mc michael

yeah
i'm not sure i'm going to fork out the $0 to take my family now
versus $0 and being less crowded
suzette
monday morning should work
just give me a call
i'm tied up in the p.m
but a.m
should work
charlie
i'm not sure
we're going to the astros tonight and are working on the nursery i think
other than that
not much
same as before except changed cob date to 0/0 instead of 0/0 on quote sheet
attached is the latest pricing as of friday's close for the stagecoach deal
load factors have been adjusted per your request to give a 0% minimum
the new indicative price
applying spreads from previous quotes
is now $0.0
note that the market is off significantly today so this quote will likely be a few pennies higher than one you would get in the live market right now
thanks

the following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the fort pierce project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by dave fairley
ed mcmichael
ruth concannon
mark breese
eric boyt
and charlie weldon
note
the heat rates and mw are subject to change pending final engineering evaluation
the intent of this note is to document the overall runtime assumptions
0
during the summertime months of may through september
the plant is expected to run 0 hours per day in a mode where enron's 0 mw are dispatched as are ft
pierce's 0mw
0
enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 0 mw for 0 hours per day at our
bought-down
heat rate of 0
this equals 0,0 mmbtu/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in only a 0 hour period
0% per hour
the table below summarizes the monthly capacity requirements
month total capacity needed by enron ft
pierce capacity
from fgu
phase vi capacity capacity from east desk ntoe
prior to phase vi completion
the project will purchase capacity from the east desk
0
ft
pierce will use its existing ft via fgu to secure its gas requirements at the 0 contractual heat rate for the 0 hours it is dispatched in the summer
0
for the winter months of october through april
the plant is expected to run 0 hours per day in a mode where ft
pierce is not dispatched
thus leaving enron with 0mw at the overall plant heat rate of 0
this equates to 0,0 mmbtu/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 0 hours
0% per hour
0
because ft
pierce will not be dispatched during the winter
their unused capacity via fgu will be available for enron
these amounts differ by month as summarized in the table below
0
enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 0 mw for 0 hours per day at a 0 heat rate
less the monthly capacities available from ft
pierce via fgu
these non-fgu purchased quantities will come from the phase vi capacity and the east desk as shown below
month total capacity needed by enron ft
pierce capacity
from fgu
phase vi capacity
nov-mar = 0% of summer
capacity from east desk note
prior to phase vi completion
the project will purchase capacity from the east desk
0
backup documentation supporting the hourly gas requirement in each dispatch mode is attached to this memo
we'll be there friday night and plan to spend the night
if elizabeth would rather spend the night with her friend
that's fine
hunter can play with travis that night and be plenty happy

i just deleted a bunch
let me know if i need to do anymore
enron avg = 0 injected industry avg = 0 injected i-bank avg = ~0 injected
they should stick to banking
my number is 0
i think the market has already built in a 0 or less number
we should make it by 0:0 plus or minus 0 minutes
we are planning on bringing flossie if that's ok
why are energy stocks down so much today
my only guess is because outlook for ng prices is lower
follows your theory of our price being proportional to ng price
great
flossie is a maxine
not a max
suzette
i was able to fill out an evaluation form on tuesday and submit it by e-mail
hopefully they will accept it ok

doug
attached is the
long-awaited
spec for the 0k gallons of low-sulphur #0 fuel oil to partially refill the tank at the ft
pierce facility in florida
as the attached note describes
the final spec is a result of the combined spec requirements by the environmental permit
mhi
mitsubishi
and engineering
we currently believe that some of these specs may be more stringent than what is commercially available
in the event that some of these specs are too stringent
we would like you to
0
identify which specs are not reasonably attainable
and 0
suggest what value of these specs are attainable
your feedback will be shared with the appropriate parties and
assuming there are spec change recommendations
these parties will determine how best to proceed
please note that the first attached note requests than any bids we get contain info on density
heating value
and trace contaminants
additionally
the second attached note references getting multiple bids for different specs
i suggest that
for now
we resolve the spec issue internally as described above and then we obtain quotes
if you have any other suggestions on how best to proceed
your input is welcome
your assistance in this matter is
and has been
greatly appreciated
thanks
charlie weldon
matt
thank you very much for the info
i have forwarded the specs on to doug leach who will be responsible for ordering the fuel oil
i asked him to identify any spec parameters that are not readily attainable with commercially available #0 fuel oil
for example
i'm fairly certain that 0.0% ash is not normally available
i have also asked him to provide information on what grades of fuel oil are available that we should consider
i will forward any feedback that i receive from doug to you so we can then have the team determine how best to proceed from that point
thanks again for all your help
charlie
mike
i noticed that your name was not on the distribution list for these exchanges so i am forwarding them to you to catch you up
i have faxed the #0 diesel fuel specs along with those for jet fuel to matt tezyk who has been coordinating the effort to consolidate the spec
he said he would share these with all the riight parties so the decision can be made as to whether we decide to take regular low-sulphur #0
jet fuel
or pursue some other path
please let me know if you have any questions
thanks
charlie weldon
doug
thanks for the info
i have passed it along
i have one more question regarding heating values
do you know what the lhv and hhv values are for #0 and jet fuel
i figure those are parameters that are measured and known but they weren't on the spec sheet
thanks
charlie
here's another good article
john
based on yesterday's

this note is just to confirm my voicemail message this morning indicating that the charges for the fuel oil sample check for vanadium should be charged to co# 0
rc # 0
according to the spec sheet i have
the astm method for vanadium is d0 and the units of measurement are ppm
wt
again
i appreciate your patience in this frustrating issue
charlie
bill
i understand that you are the contact person for mhi concerning the ash spec for the 0f turbine being used on the ft
pierce project
i have been working with matt tezyk to finalize all issues concerning this fuel oil spec
please let me know as soon as possible what the mhi response is regarding the inability to get 0% ash fuel oil
we are trying to get closure on this issue so we can order the fuel oil to replace that which we caused fpua to burn to begin construction on the site
thanks
charlie weldon
i'll sell you up to 0 jun nat gas at 0.0 right now
same as johnny
doug
fax is 0-0
a couple folks wanted to know where this sample was taken from
i told them that i was not exactly sure but was confident that the sample would be representative of the fuel oil that would be delivered in florida
per our conversation
thanks again
charlie
our
spec
is <.0 ppm
i talked to doug about whether or not the measurement can be made to a greater degree of accuracy
we believe it is not but doug said he would provide us with a contact to call concerning the vanadium measurement accuracy
i'm still waiting on that contact name and number
the thought here was to have this contact discuss the iissue first-hand with the engineering team so a judgement can be made
thanks
charlie
the following response from doug is intended to address the issue of whether or not the sample taken was representative of what we would expect to recieve in florida
per the discussion of such matter in our meeting
charlie
per our conversation
i recommend using tetco m0 plus the avg seasonal basis to alg cg
summer =~0
winter =~.0
note the volatility in these that i graphed
this volatility willl likely need to be taken into account in your model if/when you get to that level of detail
charlie

the ngi daily prices got messed up somehow when i ran the data fetch program
i updated them in this file now but i figured you would use gdd prices anyway
i have also attached the ngi monthly index which is usually the way we use ngi prices
as you indicated
i just thought you wanted daily prices originally and wanted to show them from the 0 different sources for comparison
sorry for the confusion
let me know if you need any more assistance
thanks
charlie
thanks doug
can you confirm
or tell me how i can
that these sample charge are being routed to co#0

glad to hear buddy is getting better
i assume we still need rain but are doing ok given the good rain 0 weeks ago
we may come this weekend or next
will know tonight
as i previously shared
the result for vandium in the low-sulfer diesel
#0 fuel oil
came back at <0.0 ppm versus the
spec
of <0.0 ppm
i just talked to the lab supervisor at saybolt whom performed the analysis
and according to him there is no practical way of measuring the vanadium content more precisely than within one-tenth of a ppm
the only way he knows of is to use a nmr
nuclear magnetic resonance
machine that nasa uses to analyze rocket fuel
he is not sure whether or not the government would allow use of such a machine but estimates that
if they did allow
it could cost upwards of $0,0
please let me know if we should pursue this matter any further
thanks
charlie
mike
the maximum ash content is 0.0 wt% on the official spec for low-sulfur #0 fuel oil that we would be ordering
we should plan on receiving fuel oil with up to this amount as you mention
thanks
charlie
matt
doug leach will be calling me in the morning to set up a brief meeting to discuss all the final details regarding purchase of the fuel oil for ft
pierce
i believe that we have all the logistical matters addressed and all that is left to discuss is where and how exactly the charges for this purchase will flow
in order to maximize communication and be sure that this issue is finally resolved
i am asking that you attend this meeting with us tomorrow morning
please let me know what your availability is
thanks
charlie
got it
go it
matt
two quick questions that doug leach needs answered asap to get the oil ordered

would you mind providing the mw and heat rate assumptions that correspond to these flows just for information purposes
thanks
charlie
doug
the contact at the hd king plant is ed leongomez
his phone number is 0-0-0
ed is the plant superintendent and can coordinate all issues regarding the fuel oil either directly or indirectly
he happened to call today so he should be glad to hear from us

we now have the capability of importing live eol quotes into our models if so desired
colin tonks
who supports it development efforts for the trading floor
has made this capability available to us via a file that i have now saved in the models directory under the name
eol_product_listen
in order to run the file
you will first need to run a program called
tibco rendezvous client
you can run this program by going to the start menu/system utility applications/installation and disk creation
install tibco rendezvous client
you will have to reboot after installation is complete
after rebooting you can then open the program
eol program listen
the program has 0 sheets
0
eol
and 0
eol_search sheet 0
eol
is the sheet that pulls in the live quotes based on an eol id number that you enter in column c
in order to determine the correct eol id number
you need to use sheet 0
eol_search
on this sheet
you can enter a search string in cell b0 and then hit the search macro
efficient use of this search macro requires some trial and error since the search is limited to a max number
once you find your product id #
you can enter it into sheet 0
eol
and then hit the
start
button
you will then be pulling in live quotes which can be linked to any model which you wish
a word of caution
we will likely all find limitations into how this tool can be effectively used
for instance
it has been brought to my attention that the product id #'s change each month as new prompt months roll on
thus
the tool should be used with discretion and verification that the right id # is linking up should always be verified
especially on older files
nonetheless
as we get comfortable with the tool
i believe that it will provide some value on deals that require real-time pricing inputs
please let me know if you have any questions/comments
i can provide a quick demo at my desk if anyone wishes
thanks

i need you to do the research on this meter
you will need to review the various scheduling systems to see how this was handled prior to 0/0
you can also check with volume management to see if they have any info regarding the allocation of the point
let me know what you find out and i will work on getting a deal in place
daren
kim
i will be out of the office next week

thanks
vintage should be 0
aimee
pg&e's numbers are correct
what occurred at this point in prior months
who was allocated the volume
carlos
please look into your black marlin info and see if you can find anything on this
thanks
charlotte
this is a desk-to-desk deal
you need to get with the scheduler on the east desk who handles transco
both desks will need to tie in mops
in this case
pops most likely tried to update the hpl side
but the east desk has not adjusted their side in mops
imelda
the following people

enron north america corp
ami chokshi will be sending this to you once it is finalized
pat
you should have been included on this
i probably won't go to these meetings since i won't be dealing with unify much in the future
i don't mind going with you for the first couple of times if you need me to
though
fyi
heather
please include pat clynes on all logistics information
he now manages the hpl group
thanks
daren
stella
the deal is in sitara
#0
however
that point has been inactivated
in oss
you can manually enter the contract you need to allocate the volumes
richard
please add pat clynes to your distribution list
he now manages hpl logistics
robert
please look into this
i have asked robert lloyd to look into this
he handles our industrial noms now
i added 0/0-0 to deal 0

why do you keep changing your e-mail address
how were your first few days back at school
you haven't burned down your home making class
have you
anyway
hope you have fun this weekend
adios
kim
deal 0 has meter 0 attached to it
you can apply the flow to this deal
you may need to renom from mops to pops to get it through the systems
imelda
steve weller's access should be removed
he is no longer involved with the texas desk
the rest need to retain their access
at sweeney
mtr 0
for december
0,0/day was confirmed to the phillips sale
acutally
we should have nominated a purchase of 0,0 and a sale of 0,0
the original purchase deal had the incorrect year on the deal date
so
i have created deal 0
please reallocate mtr 0 with these changes
sale of 0,0 on deal 0
purchase of 0,0 on 0
if you have any questions
let me know
the cox contract expired effective 0/0
so we should not have any gas coming to us from them
the confirmation with pg&e should be adjusted
the tribo deal is good
if pg&e allocates gas to them
we are ok
i don't think they have been allocated gas in the last 0 months
carlos probably has a contat with cox
either you or he can call them to see if they have sold any of their interests
someone in producers services
you can call vance taylor and he can probably tell you
aimee
if you review that deal in cpr
you can see that this is a desk to desk deal on ect
this is actually our transport of waha gas on pge
delivered into hpl
so
the volume should be scheduled/allocated to the ect intrastate contract 0-0-0
should the entire volume be moved over to icc now
currently on deal 0
icc
0,0 is being sold at 0.0
the sale on the txu ticket has been zeroed out on the deal line
but needs to be reallocated in vol mgmt
if i need to move the additional 0,0 to icc
i will
but
i want to make sure that is what we need to do
ken
thanks for your input
i will definitely take this into consideration
also
i want you to know that i really do appreciate all that you've done for me
i have greatly benefited from your knowledge of the market and industry
and also from your experience of just dealing with people and issues
it has been very nice having someone to discuss ideas with and to learn from
and argue with
thanks
also
for your honesty and openness
i really appreciate you telling me when you disagree
it helps me see things from a different view
i just want to do the best thing for our business
and you help me to do that
you don't try to slip anything by
and you take responsibility for your work/actions
that's hard to find these days
i just wanted to let you know that
thanks
but
i will still continue to think of you as in that dilbert cartoon
whenever we disagree
i always end up yelling
that's an indication that you have poor interpersonal skills
the base purchase should be brokered with the base sale
deal 0 does not replace the basse purchase ticket
it is in addition to that one
on the days where deal 0 is applicable
the purchases and sale should balance out
no flow
so
is this ok now
hey
i think that we are coming in this weekend
we are only going to be there through sat nite though
see you then
then 0,0 is already moved
it just needs to be reallocated by vol mgmt
sounds fine to me
0,0 is being sold to icc @ 0.0 on deal 0
aimee
i assume that you are looking into this
see comments below
cr
this is one of the meters that you should broker for entex
fyi
again
tom does not have this info yet
so
please allow gary and/or james to talk with him first
new deals
nov #0 dec #0
see notes in red below
in each case where the contract has been terminated
tom and/or carlos will need to get with producer services to determine what we need to do
set up a gtc
renegotiate the term deal
etc
this relates to the message on missing deals
dave
please add pat clynes to your distribution list

how gas is moved through the system
where our main supply and market areas are
locations of specific points
etc
we will be using a map of the pipeline as the basis for the discussion
so
come to the meeting with any questions you have on hpl
anything is fair game
yvette is currently working on securing a room
i will let you know when that is finalized
let me know if you have any questions
we have no way to input a storage deal for cilco
the way that the contract is set up
does not fit into the systems as they are
tom
i changed the meter on deal 0 from0 to 0
you will need to repath and renom this in mops
also
you will need to make sure that the welhead meteres are linked to 0 in pops

what time do you think you can make it down here on friday
we will probably be leaving farily early to go to the rodeo
about 0:0
we can have the girl across thestreet take care of cole until you get there
daren
stella and charlotte
i looked into this deal
we sold this gas for one day only
in mops
the path was nominated for 0/0 only
however
in pops the path was nominated and confirmed for 0/0-0/0
this should have been showing up as a bridgeback error during the month
also
someone should have identified that the path/nom in mops wasn't the same as the nom in pops
this discrepancy should have been found before we closed out january
i researched this problem by reviewing both systems
looking at the path id in pops
finding it in mops
and checking the audit on the path in mops
this type of issue should be researched and solved by the logistics group
who has all the necessary tools to find the problem
the resolution
not the problem
should have been presented to myself or the marketer
with an explanation of what happened
some one still needs to find out how the gas was confirmed for the 0th-0st
since the gas apparently flowed
we will have to apply the overflow to the oba
unless you can find a missing transport contract
i would like to talk about what we can do to make sure that effective training occurs in the future for new hires/transfers
for example
we are giving an hpl training session today
we should not have to give another full blown session in the future
the group should be able to take this knowledge
add to it
and pass it on to others entering the group
with the rate of turnover we have experienced in the past
it seems like some knowledge has been lost
yvette
where is this offsite taking place
i know you told in the meeting the other day
but i didn't write it down
heather
i will be at an offsite meeting today
stacey neuweiller will attend in my place
leave me a voicemail if you need me to do anything
thanks
look at the cc
i'm an idiot
i extended deal 0 for another year
where are these meters
what is happening
what have we done in the past
heidi
i expect the wellhead volumes to be around 0,0 to 0,0 per day
enron north america corp
you need to talk to the east desk to see if they were allocated this extra gas on the 0th and 0th
if they were
we can change the deal
if not
the pipes will need to balance out during the next flow day
i extended 0
tom
go ahead and increase the nom
thu
you need to get with aimee and george on this
as discussed in our 0-rivers/king ranch meeting
i have set up purchases from the liquids group and the other 0rd parties at hgpl mtr 0
due to bridgebacks
i had to create new deal numbers for the days prior to 0/0/0
i went back to dec 0
in case it is needed
please see the deal #s below
hplr liquids 0
0
existing deal to cover excess residue
mandy
i understand that you will be setting up the buy and sale with hplr liquids to cover the transport on hgpl
let me know if you have any questions
rita and lisa
why don't ya'll get together and determine a range of days/times that would work for your groups to have a training session
over lunch or early afternoon
if you are interested
i would like to discuss how we operate the hpl system and the processes we go through during the trading day
to help with the discussion
i have maps which highlight the main points and areas where we transact
there will be a few for you to keep at the desks
i did this with the logistics group
i think it went pretty well
if you want to do this
we need to allow 0.0 to 0 hours to talk about everything
let me know
fyi
gas fair is 0/0-0
fyi
due to this shut-in
i have taken deal 0 to zero for the 0th-0th
if you hear of this point coming back into service
please notify me
we bought the gas from koch energy trading
deal 0
done
got your message
jo won't have your tax figured out until we get the langston #
but
she will be able to give you an idea soon
the curtains do look good
we are going to have to get a shade to use also
though
the sun and lights come through pretty bright
gotta go
bruce
i need to hold the deliveries to 0,0 for 0/0
i'm somewhat limited on my transport right now
i will look into the possibility of increasing the volume
though
if you can increase the deliveries at fuels cotton valley
that will work
daren
i know we transported on midcon due to problems with the plant at the point
i am not sure about the rate
the purchase from swift was shown at mtr 0 during dec and jan
i have created a new deal
#0
to add mtr 0 to the deal
deal 0 is the purchase from hplr liquids
this purchase is on 0 for jan 0 forward
brenda
i may be involved in an options training class 0/0-0/0 from 0:0-0:0 each evening
this is mandatory for the commercial guys
and tom is trying to get me in also
robert
ken developed an industrial report before he left
it can be found at o/logistics/kenseaman/industrialsmonthly
there is one file for each month of 0
i need you to update this for march
this will need to be distributed to gas control
logistics
and myself
let me know if you have any questions
tom
go ahead and make these changes in sitara
thanks
do i need to bring a pen and paper
is that considered
professional
i think it would be more impressive if you were taking my notes
let me know what you think
also
what is the enron dress code
do my clothes have to match
i don't think i've really ever had a professional image
do i have to shave
i don't think i've ever been anywhere on time
this whole meeting thing is going to be difficult for me
just thought you needed to know
that's fine
go ahead and change the deal if you need to
tom
for the eog piece
bring the nom down to 0 through the 0th
for the 0th forward
leave the nom as is
when we get more information next week
we can adjust as necessary
yates
what did they produce in jan and feb
let me know that and we can decide if we want to adjust the nom
vintage
adjust our nom to tie with vintage
it's fine with me to allocate everything to torch if they are paying for it
do you mean 0,0 at 0
if so that's fine
go ahead and bring the yates down also
i made the following industrial changes for march 0rd
chevron decreased to 0/day
this should remain for the rest of the month
lyon-citgo increased to 0,0
this is an increase of 0,0 that will need to be rolled daily until further notice
shell cogen increased by 0,0 to 0,0
this will need to be rolled daily until further notice
let me know if you have any quesitons
fyi
in february
0,0 mmbtu were allocated to the our index purchase from hplr liquids at king ranch
this allocation resulted in a large physical unaccounted for loss
effectively
the gas was being purchased twice in our systems
in addition
a sale to the liquids group
which should have been zero
was brokered with a purchase from swift
0 mmbtu/day
resluting in additional gas being allocated to the hplr liquids purchase contract
i have attached a schedule detailing the volumes that were double booked in february
this schedule also reports the daily volumes for march which will need to be adjusted
i have calculated
based on estimates
that we should have only purchased about 0,0 from the liquids group at king ranch for february
see the following
booked to hplr liquids
0,0 0,0/day incorrect liquids sale
0,0 0,0/day adjusted purch from liquids
0,0 0,0/day we usually input a purchase of 0,0 mmbtu/day from hplr liquids at the tailgate
we can increase this to 0,0/day for march
the majority of gas in the 0-rivers system is transported to the king ranch plant through hgpl
some of this gas is purchased at the wellhead by hplc
some of the gas is purchased at the wellhead by hplr liquids
and three producers have the option to either sell their gas to hplc at the wellhead or to process their gas and sell the residue to hplc at the tailgate of the plant
it is very important to keep the meters and volumes allocated correctly among parties related to these transactions
the attached schedule should assist in doing this
i have reported the meters at which hplc buys wellhead gas
the movement of this gas through hgpl and king ranch should be kept seperate from the gas purchased by the liquids group
a transport usage ticket can be used to show the transfer of hplc's gas from king ranch to hpl
let's plan on discussing this either friday or monday afternoon
let me know what works best for you
done
mtrs 0 and 0 are shrinkage and condensate meters
volumes are split among hplr liquids and hplc
with the majority going to liquids
mtr 0 is a gas loss meter
volume should be allocated to our operational ua0 contract
mtrs 0 and 0 should be allocated to liquids
you can see these allocations by viewing prior months in pops
on monday afternoon
clem cernosek will verify the above transactions and expain the split between parties at 0 and 0
cactus swift is now erac
#0 for jan
#0 for feb
let's shoot for monday afternoon
i will get a room set up for us
enron north america corp
scott
i left a message with vance and melissa last night about the base gas roll process
do you have time monday afternoon to discuss this
i updated deal 0
can everyone meet at 0:0 today
please let me know
daren
i extended both deals
hey ken
sorry it has taken so long to get back with you
but
we've had an interesting couple of weeks here
craig faulbaum has taken personal some time off
i think that this is the 0th week
so
we have picked up his trades
tom restructured the eol trading
carey has gone to gas daily and i have taken over the waha trading for an interim period
i'm still responsible for our overall position
but ami is watching it during trading
in other words
everyone on my desk is doing double duty
and
of course
tom expects nothing to fall through the gaps
not cracks
anymore
he has two opening on the trading side that we
stacey and i
are filling
i don't know if he has even interviewed anyone yet
i am getting very frustrated with the whole business
it doesn't see that he even appreciates the amount of time and stress we are going through to pick up his slack
wheww
that feels a little better
getting some of that off my chest
anyway
tonya is very uncomfortable
i think that baby is going to come along any day now
due date is still 0/0
we are both definitely ready
the desk is really going to be in a fix when i'm out with that
that's just too bad
i half expect tom to ask me to come in some
i've got a real quick answer to that
how are things at home
linda doesn't have you working too much does she
i just bought the materials to put a sprinkler system in our front yard
if things get weak on your stock trading
i've got some trenches you can dig for extra cash
it shouldn't be too bad
i bought a brand new sharp-shooter
of course with a new shovel
i'd have to knock some off of your hourly pay
the grant price on the employee options is $0.0
i hope everything is going good for you
i would like to have lunch with you sometime
i will let you know when things work out here
so that we can do that
or
i can give you a call when i'm out for paternity leave and we can go one day then
talk to you later
mike

i've got a message into julie meyers to look into the contract at meter 0
and will let you know what she determines
what have they been flowing for the past week
make the nom change
got it
drop the nom to 0,0
aimee
you need to set up a transport capacity ticket in sitara for this
heidi withers should be able to help you
i don't know the contract to apply to the deal
heidi or julie meters may be able to help with this also
keep them at 0,0 in sitara
ates is incorrect
there should not be a specialist in my group
george
are you looking into these variances
this deal was done with greg stockard
i have extended deal 0 to cover mtr 0 for feb and mar
i have created deal 0 to cover this meter
the deal ticket has zero volume
just allocate the actuals at the end of each month
i have created deal 0
zero volumes
to cover this name change

ena
texas currently has tranport contracts on pgev and oasis pipelines
listed below
since we are transacting as houston pipe line for the majority of our trades
we need these contractsto be assigned from ena to hpl
or
we need to enter into new agreements as hpl
what is the process used to accomlish this
we would like to get this set up as soon as we can
thanks
daren
we do not have deal to enter for this
you need to look at the entire midtex line for each of the days that are out of balance
if we are short at katy
i would think that we would be long at dewville
many times
our receipts from the midtex line at katy are offset by our deliveries to tufco at the tap
this should help you fix the january problem
also
for december
you may need to ask pg&e where they show the delivery for western
is it at hpl katy
as our records show
or is it at pge's another point on the midtex line
in any case
we don't have deliveries to make
the only other remedy is to book the variance on the partnership imbalance
the actuals should be allocated to the new ticket which has been nom'd
tracked
and balanced
no
deal 0 is good for days 0-0
we should have everything from vance by tomorrow
nx0
i don't have any expected volumes
you should use the best information you have from prior months
were these deals confirmed
what are the pipes and contracts
unsubscribe
for april
we agree to nominate 0,0 into eastrans
with redeliveries of
0,0 into pg&e 0,0 into hpl at fuels cotton valley 0,0 to hpl at carthage pricing for any additional volumes will need to be renegotiated
you may contact either myself or stacey neuweiler
for volumes in excess of the 0,0 on our term agreement which were redelivered to hpl at mobil beaumont
we agree to pay inside ferc hsc-.0 for the month of march
the price at which hpl delivered the gas at eastrans remains at inside ferc hsc-.0
daren farmer
don't we have an oba at this point now
is this still outstanding
craig is back in the office now
the deal for march was actually #0
i rolled it for one day
yes
this is daren
who are you
are you going to nom these volumes for the rest of the month
this is in reference to sitara # 0
gracias
amiga
steve
how are things going with this request
fyi
the majority of deals we transact on oasis are done as hplc
only sales to lcra and term sales to tufco are done as ena
thanks
daren
tom
leave the noms the way they are in sitara
these volumes are so small
there is no need to adjust anything
no
i don't want to
just kidding
that would not be a problem
do i need to give a review of our earlier sitara training also
let me know what you want
imelda
look on the texas tab
i've made some comments beside the names
these adjustments are for hplc and texas
we no longer handel efsc
mtr 0
i created deal 0 for 0/0-0/0 and #0 for apr
mtr 0
this meter is traded daily
spot
so
we can't extend the deal
when elsa gets back next week
i will check with her to see if she did a deal with encina on this day
mtr 0
a deal already exists for this meter
#0
if you view the meter in mops you can see the deal
it had zero volume before today
mtr 0
this gas is traded on the spot market
so there is no deal to put in
please look into this
leave the nom as it is in sitara
i have created deal tickets 0 and 0 for july 0
march 0 based on the info below
due to time constraints
i have not researched pricing and volumes
i trust that the info supplied to me agrees with the contract
robert
we need to get together tomorrow afternoon to set up april
i rolled deal 0
have you asked karry kendall about this meter
charlotte hawkins should be able to help you with this
just leave the nom as is in sitara
we will look at all wellheads next week
leave as is in sitara
i have created deal 0 to cover this flow
julie
this is actually volume related to the term deal 0
volume flowed in march due to timing on changing the meter
can you attach the term contract to this deal
i copied the term deal to create the march ticket
march is consistent with feb
charlotte
i need you to find out what's going on with this point and the transport on channel
apparantly
we are moving some gas on channel from hpl #0 to hpl #0
deals 0 and 0
why has this occurred each month
yes
you can create the deal ticket
i will not be in the office on friday
craig re-negotiated this deal
begining with april 0
enron north america corp
go ahead and make those changes
i've changed the deal to 0 for the rest of this month and for may
yes
who is this
that's fine
mike
what is the status of the list we compiled a few months ago
i had a few items on that list
but i can't remember the details now
since i don't deal with unify as much as i used to
the only thing that i can remember is
we need to add a column with the initials of the schedulers responsible for each meter
bob
on the texas desk
the majority of our deals are nominated manually
on excel or preprinted forms
with most of the information pulled from sitara instead of unify
so
these noms were not late
for a couple of 0rd party pipelines
we do use unify
but we did not have nom changes for 0/0
our only problem was sending noms to hpl
which is sending information to yourself
but it still delays the confrimation process for the pipeline
this nom was sent about 0 minutes late
let me know if you have any questions

markham gas merit energy partners reliant energy
entex reliant energy
hl&p southern union company texas utilities fuel company
now txu fuel co
union carbide corporation unit gas transmission company inc ena has transacted with the other companies listed below

hpl will trade with those counterparties
all ena trades on hpl will be in sitara
we have reports which can be generated out of cpr that can list all deals by counterparty for ena
let me know if you need something like that
let me know if you have any other questions
cheryl d king
is this in index related price
done
i've created deal 0
the pricing below looks in correct

what info do you have on the praxair deal

should this be on ena or cheryl d king
you may need to fax a copy of the invitation for the july trip to tim

at teco
lone star katy and sold it to tufco at that point on 0/0/0
at 0am tufco cut us on the sale
resulting in only 0,0 flowing to tufco for the day
we need to find out what pge did with the remaining 0,0 we bought from richardson
did they deliverit to us at hpl
or did they cut richardson
or
are they showing that we have gas stranded at that point
please look into this and let me know
i will be out 0/0 on a customer trip

daren
the position reports to me and is budgeted
let's keep the current noms in the system for now
after a few days have flowed
we will look at all the wellhead volumes and adjust if needed
enron north america corp
i have adjusted deal #0 to cover the first 0 days of flow in jan
you need to get with the east desk on this
were they allocated this volume on tetco
if so
you can adjust the deal and have the east desk approve it
if they were not allocated this flow
the volume should go on the oba
bob
go ahead and accept the nom revision
i believe that this is with pge
not el paso
how do the rest of our noms compare with eog
i f they have a higher volume at another meter than we do
i would like to increase our nom there
in effect
i want to keep our physical index position as close as possible to what we have in the system now
enron north america corp
this is a estimate for ua0
fuel
loss
and various other operational usages
this deal should be handled like the other operational tickets in the system
steve
i really need the oasis and pge transport contracts assigned to hpl by july 0
currently
we are buying gas in the waha region as hplc
but since our transport is under ena
we have to enter an additional transaction where hpl sales the gas to ena at the point of purchase
ena then transports the gas to a delivery point
if the gas is sold to another counterparty
an additional transaction between ena and hpl must be entered at the delivery point
this causes great difficulty in balancing out the pipelines and completing the scheduling in reasonable time
plus
it just doesn't make sense to keep the transport under ena since we transact all other deals as hplc
please let me know when we can get these contracts assigned
thanks for your help

sorry i didn't get these to you last night
i left the office sooner than planned
this list is pretty slim

with me now concentrating on operations and with the plan to hire an additional person
this will change

sitara
has moved the big entex ticket
#0
for july 0 forward to deal #0
this should help some with amount of time it takes to update and bridge back this deal
he is adjusting the swap tickets also
you should probably double check these to make sure everything looks ok
the programmers are also trying to find ways to further decrease the time involved in updating the deal
i received a call from jill zively about our supply at mtr 0
late friday night
0/0
a portion of this gas will be delivered into midcon instead of hpl
the nomination into hpl for the 0th through the rest of the month will be 0,0/d
jill knew this would be happening
so they priced the deal at gas daily
i changed deal #0 to reflect this change for saturday forward
since this is priced at gas daily
there will be no mark-to-market impact
we need to review the flows next week to see how much the volume changed and adjust if necessary
i need a number where you can be reached on friday evening
i will be getting the schedule after work on friday and will call and let you know when and where our games will be
this is correct

when will the buybacks and swings be set up for july
i am a little concerned with the long weekend coming up
i believe that we agreed that these would be set up by the 0rd work day

enron north america corp
during june
coral transacted on eol
however
they selected a july thru october deal by mistake
the marketer immediately called the desk and we agreed to let them out of the deal
which resulted in the creation of a second deal in eol
coral is not reporting anything on the deal
since it was unwound
but
since eol deals are automatically processed and are firm transactions
we cannot kill the deal on our side
even though they net to zero volume and price
logistics will be brokering the transactions in mops
please be sure that coral is not invoiced or paid on these deals
again
they will not have a record of the deals
the sitara deals are
0 and 0
let me know if you have any questions
you need to discuss this with the east desk
see if tetco allocated the vol to their contract

please get with some one in measurement to check the flows at the meter

the estimates vs acutals look odd
the gas that was coming to us in june
is going to koch in july
so we should not be receiving anything
see registration form below
we didn't buy anything from pan energy at centana mobil until april the 0rd
so
we shouldn't pay for this gas

toni was not very responsive to colls/voice mails
this has improved over the last week

the new fixed price deal with equistar is #0
just a little explanation on what you're seeing
we have a swing deal at this point with equistar
which allows them to take excess volumes over the base nom
we have been estimating the overtakes each day at 0
0
however
because of limitations of the scheduling system
we can't nom the volumes estimated on the swing deal
so
equistar is within their rights and i am monitoring their activity
but the nom versus actual doesn't reflect this
this occurs with a few of our industrial points
enron north america corp
i'll be there
which direction should i go on 0
this transport ticket should have been entered under ena

the pathing in unify is correct

who then transported it to mtr 0 on oasis for

we have it in as 0,0
as you do in this e-mail
please look into your lone star transport on this date and let me know what you find
thanks
i am calculating that only 0,0 should be applied to the hplr iferc contract at the tap to finish the obligation for the month
these deals should be converted to ena-im texas
is there a way that you can change all of these deals systematically
please see the attached tufco file for july
the 0,0 under the wagner brown contract on the 0th has been zeroed out
no flow at ls katy for that day
this resulted in a change between contracts/deals on the 0st also
let me know if you have any questions
jackie
what does mops show for the days in question
it would be incorrect to add any days to the adonis ticket mentioned below
it sounds as if the meter was allocated incorrectly in pops and/or a deal was not pathed correctly in mops

you can leave me a voice mail or call liz and stacey
please read the message below
what do you think about increasing the fee
the cleburne plant will be down for an outage during the following time period
0/0-0/0 entire day so
we will have about 0,0/day to sell
the supply costs are $0.0 for
we created deal 0 a while back to correct this
you will need to get vol mgmt to reallocate volumes from #0 to this deal to close it out
fyi
hsc-.0 is the correct price
based on the final agreement
i have corrected the deal in sitara
done
i have rolled or input the following deals for october
so
i am showing that the only deals we have outstanding for oct are
julie
please check these deals for the correct contract/terms
also
please look into heatherlock
vance is noming gas for this deal
however
the deal ticket does not have an evergreen flag
when i tried to roll another month
i got a message that another contract was needed
thanks
please adjust the deals in sitara to reflect this change
mark
it looks like we will probably take over the cornhusker deal in october
so
i need you to get the following information for lone star
williams
and apache
contact name phone # fax # mailing address we will be sending notices to these parties indicating our agency agreement with the plant
tenaska iv texas partners ltd
additionally
we will need this information from the plant manager
please gather this information as soon as you can from nancy stivers
thanks
i have entered the following deals into sitara for october
camden resources inc
@ mtr 0
0/day #0
this counterparty is not currently in the system
these deals have not been finalized as of yet
but
i have entered them to assist us with managing our postion and scheduling the pipe
let me know if you have any quesitons
melissa
it would help us considerably if vance would include the prices for new deals in the monthly nom
in order to manage our postion and schedule the gas
we need to put the deals into sitara
we will enter spot deals with the info vance gives us
when the deals are ticketed
the risk group will adjust sitara with the finalized terms
thanks for your help
enron north america corp
please see below
ena contact daren farmer
fyi
i rolled this deal for day one in october only
bob
please check with vance on this deal
has it terminated or should it roll for october
i don't think that vance nom'd anything
these are not spot deals
panenergy did not receive gas on the exchange
however
they did deliver gas to us at cotton valley
according to the contract
when volumes are overdelivered
hpl buys the gas at gd-.0
so
in order to correctly estimate our economics
i changed the price on the delivery to reflect how the deal will settle
this occurred in august and september
any spot deals will be on seperate tickets
days 0
0
as well as 0-0 should be settled as if the exchange was in place
panenergy overdelivered about 0,0 per day
which we buy at gas daily
0
enron north america corp
i have no idea why payment would be suspended
i don't remember having any problems with ocean energy
sorry
done
i could not seperate the excess charge and cashout charges under the demand expense
they are combined on the ticket
enron north america corp
i fixed it
enron north america corp
megan
i have made these adjustments
however
i would like for you to double check august
we knew that pan energy would be over delivering at cotten valley for 0/0/0 through the end of the month
so i changed the pricing on the deal to the gd-.0 settlement price for that time period
enron north america corp
i had problems in getting the newest version of access
so
please see the attachement below related to the opm hours survey
carlos
can yuou get with rebecca on this
it seems like we took care of this earlier
suzanne
i was out last week
so i am just now getting back with you
we primarliy served the texas desk commercial team
with about 0% of time spent on producer services
the non routine activity should be allocated to the texas desk
fyi
forward the info to me for anyone you want to send cards to
heather
i will have my group gather the names and i will forward them to you
when do you need everything
the price should be 0.0
there had been alot of price and volume discussions for this gas day and 0/0/0
i checked the notes and found that we actually settled at 0.0 instead of 0.0
since koch has told you that they sold the properties to duke
i would say that duke should be paying us for the gas
i had heard that koch sold the properties to another counterparty
but i wasn't sure to whom
i either talked or left a message with someone in the settlements area about two months ago about this after koch informed the trader that they should not be getting the invoices
however
i never heard back from anyone
this is related to the ces acquisition which came online the first of this year
the deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to koch
i can change the tickets in sitara to the duke counterparty
or create new tickets
today if you need me to
so that we can get the invoice out the door
you will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct contract in place for the deal
sandi
sorry for just now getting back with you
i was out last week
the rate
$.0/mmbtu
will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant
the fee will be adjusted yearly based on cpi
bob
i could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the delivered volumes
actuals or nominations
i think we should use actuals due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a daily basis
we would receive the estimates/actuals on a lag and may have to purchase gas to offset the imbalance
even though the plant kept the noms at the 0,0 base
i also think that if the plant does increase the nom
they are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less
do you agree with this
megan
for 0/0/0
allocate the receipt of gas a cotton valley to the exchange deal
since we did not deliver anything to them on that day
the settlement will occur at gd-.0
originally
we were working on a spot deal for this day
then
after the fact
we agreed to let the deal fall out under the exchagne deal
i apparantly forgot to change the deal ticket
for the weekend of 0/0
we need to prorate the gas over the weekend
due to operational issues
we agreed to receive gas all weekend and batch the deliveries on monday
i apologize for not getting this info to you earlier
enron north america corp
sandi
the exisiting contracts on lone star are sufficient to cover deliveries to the plant
0,0 mmbtu maximum daily quantity
in the event that we have to transport excess gas to alternate locations
we will be using an ena transport agreement and charging the expense back to tenaska iv
i created deal #0 for august
jeff
i am assuming that the price for august is gas daily
currently
we have the september deal priced at gas daily also
since this was flowing on the first
should the price be at inside ferc hsc for september
has this been resolved
jm
the message below is related to deal #0
according to joan
october is the last month for this deal
however
the evergreen flag is activated in sitara and a new line has been created for november
can you look into this please
consumer price index
i have created two new deals in sitara
you will need to get with someone in volume management to reallocate volumes from the old tickets to the new deals for jan-sep
the logistics group will be able to adjust october forward
deal #s
let me know if you have any questions
done enron north america corp
you're right
i have corrected the ticket
jm
is the contract for this deal still valid
i want to roll the deal for sep and oct
fyi
i changed the pricing on the september deal
#0
to if hsc-.0 from hsc
another national crown
it must be nice
we have to keep referring back to our one and only in 0
but
we will never forget it
i am looking forward to the 0th
tonya and i are going to the aggie/k-state game
we'll see how that goes
looks like your corn boys will be playing ou that weekend
that should be a good battle
ou also has a week off to get ready for you
i think they should be rated #0
things are going ok here
i can't remember if we've talked about the sale of hpl
that is getting closer to happening
i am hoping it does
i'm ready to go on to something else
and that would make it much easier
ami chokshi decided that she would leave the co
this week
she is heading of to san fran
no job or any specific plans yet
but it's always something whe has wanted to do
it would be nice to be able to pick up and do something like that
how's everything else going for you and the family
we are all doing pretty good
i actually took last week off
the only plans i had were to spend time with the family
it was great
it really drove the point home that i need to stop letting people/things around here set my proiorities
anyway
would you be able to come down for lunch on friday
i'm sure it's been a while since you've had your treebeard's
let me know
sorry i haven't talked to you much
i'm going to end up losing all my friends if i don't change my ways
why don't you come to the office around 0:0
i'll be trading waha until 0:0 or so
you can come up and say
hi
to everyone
or
we can just meet in the lobby and walk over
we have adjusted suemar in sitara
and will probably adjust it again in a few days
since we bridge back estimates daily
the production at the berryman well has been adjusted in the economics
so
this will not have an impact on ua0
lee
on deal 0
chevron @ olefins
we have a flex nom of 0,0 to 0,0/day
is this a monthly nom or daily nom
will we have a swing deal with them for the winter
the current swing deal is for oct only
for oct
they have pulled an average of 0,0/day
we are on the 0nd floor now
thru the glass door and turn right
if your badge still works
or
give me a call from the lobby and i'll come get you
would you like me to invite anyone else to go with us
carlos
lauri
etc
it doesn't matter to me
robert will be coming too
he said that he will be buying your lunch
since you wouldn't accept his x-mas present last year
just kidding
fyi
you may want to check with someone to see if this will affect you this weekend
susan
are you clear on what you need to do with this
pw
hpl's spot and base purchases by zone for april 0 are reported in the attached file
let me know if you have any questions
i created #0 for the flow at mtr 0
canny conner is looking into mtr 0
i will let you know when he determines what we will be doing
hey
dwight
everything is going fine here
thanks for your message
i'm feeling pretty confident with how things are going
i have received very positive feedback from my manager and my employees
i have learned much from you
especially related to communication
recognizing the different types of people
different ways to communicate
and
i appreciate the time you've spent with me
however
i would like to discontinue our sessions for the time being
when i'm in need of some
managing expertise
in the future
i will give you a call
again
thanks for working with me
daren
mike
based on the screen today and current spreads

jan 0.0 feb 0.0 mar 0.0 apr 0.0 may 0.0 jun 0.0 jul 0.0 aug 0.0 oct 0.0 nov 0.0 dec 0.0 of course
these are only forecasts and are very volatile
if you need anything else
or have any questions
let me know
daren
i have adjusted deals 0 and 0
password is now cole0jake
deal 0 has a start date of 0/0/0
jm
can you extend the contrtact on deal 0 thru 0/0/0
this should be allocated to the liquids group's transport
come by anytime today
i've already made the check out
i will be leaving early today
sick kids and wife at home
but i will leave the check and tickets on my desk
jackie
please get with the east desk on this
if they agree
we can roll the deal
stace
please look into your notes
you entered deal 0 each day for the purchases at this meter for the month
the 0th and 0th are ok in sitara
however
there is nothing for the 0th and 0th
sorry about this
victor
i didn't even pay attention to the date
i was thinking this was october business
we will definitely be able to do somthing with this on our side and not involve the east desk
enron north america corp
jackie
i didn't pay any attention to the date on this message
we should be able to handle this on our side with out involving the east desk
if the oba can be used
apply the volume there
if nothing else
we can write it off
charlene
deal #0 already had volume and price for the 0th and 0th
you may need to have the volumes updated by volume management
i added the 0th and 0th to the deal ticket
liz
please look into this
please move my group from risk to logisitcs
enron north america corp
i don't know what pc 0 is
but
in the attached spreadsheet
my cost center is grouped with risk management
i now report to bob hall
so cc 0 should be reported with the other logistics groups
liz
i would like for you to attend also
stace
you can decide if you want to come or not
la
can you look into the transport piece
we need similar numbers for sep 0
for this meeting
i will need a laptop and a projector in the conference room
can you take care of getting this for me
you can charge it to mine
patrick
the attached file contains the base and spot purchases by zone on hpl for september 0
let me know if you have any questions
the deal with oxy vinyls
#0
will covers the volume for all of october
we had zero in the system after the 0th because the plant was down
the deal should have been nom'd at zero on these days
i rolled deal 0 for nov 0st
done enron north america corp
i have created the following operational tickets to cover the big sandy ua0 and fuel
0/0-0/0
receipt 0 delivery 0 settlements with teco should be booked to the existing deals
hpl purchase let me know if you have any questions
the notice should be given on monday
the 0th by 0:0 pm
why couldn't they figure this out
i think i hate football too
0th and goal on the 0 yard line
to win the game
and rc decides to change his lifelong coaching strategy from run
run
run
to pass the ball
why not ja'mar
the guy who carried 0 defenders into the end zone earlier
anyway
we beat the spread and i got $0 from your friend mary
so things are not all bad
how did the corn boys lose
if i would have known about it on saturday
i would have called to console you and the family
maybe it's time to just turn our attention to the nba and leave this heartache behind
why is there a different deal
and what is the price
this has been corrected
a transport usage ticket should have been used
instead of a desk to desk
enron capital management
i added these days to #0
rolled deal 0 to cover flow at mtr 0
charlene
we should not have scheduled any volume for the 0-0th
no price was negotiated that i can find
however
since gas did flow
i rolled the last price on the deal to cover those days
what price is hesco showing
the old swing deals should not be used for october
please have volume management allocate any volumes on the old deals to the new deals
enron north america corp
jm
is the contract on 0 good for nov
i changed the price to 0.0
with the changes in personnel on the desk
we don't have a lot of info to dispute their price
it's not cost beneficial to do so anyway
fred
please look at the attached file below
can you give me the october volumes for these meters
hey
ac
how are things going for you
liking your new freedom
wild girl
i hope your having fun
i'm sure missing you on entex
i'm already feeling the heat from tm
with the cold spell and the change in weather forecasts
i have to re-evaluate entex everyday
but
that's the way it always is over here
i've been meaning to e-mail you
but i always remember after i leave the office
anyway
let me know how it's going
later
done
fyi
due to scheduling concerns and contract language
i changed the delivery point on this deal to eastrans pipeline
instead of hpl
this should clean up the allocations for this area
also
beginning on nov 0th
we cut the swap to zero
and i purchased the gas at cotton valley under a spot agreement
#0
let me know if you have any questions
enron north america corp
the buy and sale should net out
nothing to be billed to paid to tglo
the volumes should be the same on both sides
whoever backs up tom should reallocate in pops to make this happen
we had to show a buy/sale in order to schedule the delivery to tglo on a third party pipe
i extended deal 0 for the rest of october
thanks for the info
i appreciated the call the other day
it really helps me out to recieve info early like that
gary thinks that we will not have any problems with this
this is the course
the 0th is fine
i also have brandy looking into the tuition reimbursement deal
apparantly
the person she needs to talk to is out of the office
for october
tenaska iv should be paying us
we bought gas from apache and williams on lone star pipeline
we sold that gas to tenaska iv when the cleburne plant was operating
on days the plant was not operating
we sold that gas to other counterparties
the sales on lone star you see for ena
for september
we may need to pay them an amount
but i need to check into that
with the way this deal has been in the structuring process over a couple of months
there are some questions on how to handle sep
i'll let you know what i determine about sep
enron north america corp
if you need it
i've got a contract brief that lists the transport cost and fuel from each location
there numerous receipt points
it is possible that we may need to purchase extra gas for the plant on occasion
in that case
we can use the same transport contract on lone star and transport on other pipes also
any expense we incur to deliver gas to the plant will be passed on to the plant
if you have any questions
let me know
you've got to love idiotic calls
don't you
an onside kick after you've won the game
what was barnett thinking
i don't think i'll ever watch another aggie football game
ohh
the misery
i can't handle the emotional rollar coastar
anyway
how was thanksgiving
did you make your trip out to pick up the 0 ft christmas tree
or was it bigger this year
we made the journey to tuscaloosa
the trip wasn't too bad
that tv/vcr is a lifesaver
i ate way too much
but it sure was good
hope everthing's going good for you and the family
any processing is handled by devon
ena is buying the residue gas at the tailgate of the plant
we need to have all the links and the spreadsheets updated by the 0rd workday of december
0/0
0/0 #0
this deal is under samedan
are there any other days on the invoices
mp
apply that volume to the cannon storage deal
the meter is already on the ticket for that time period
apply this volume to deal 0
the point is on the ticket
but nothing was nom'd that day
buy apache #0 buy williams 0 trans capacity lone star 0&0 spot sales will be on various tickets throughout each month
deals are under the cleburne intramamonth position in sitara
megan
i have created deal 0 to capture the $.0 agency fee for the tenaska deal
this deal will have zero volume and zero commodity price with a demand charge of $.0 on 0,0/day
since there is no volume
mark mccoy will be scheduling this deal as a zero nom
hopefully
this will allow the demand charge to flow through the system
let me know if you don't see this happening
for sep and oct
you will need to get someone in volume management to create an accounting arrangement for this deal
pathed to the imbalance pool
when actuals come in
you can give me the volumes and i will change the demand charge
i took the demand charge off of the sale ticket
#0
that's not cole and jake
baby
do you know what our kids look like
mike
you can come down anytime
the mornings will be the best time to learn
but you can spend as much time as you want
since things are so crazy
i may not be able to answer all of your questions immediately
but can answer them later
i will probably be on vacation next mon and fri
you can start with me tomorrow or next tuesday
it's up to you
we usually start trading around 0:0
we usually start the day at 0:0 with the gas control and weather meeting
you need to speak with reps from exxon and highland
ask them about their lone star transport allocation
they had to transport the gas on lone star to sell to us
so
lone star should have given them an allocation on their transport deliveries at that point
or their supplier's contracts
to match the sale volume
adjust our purchase amount from each party based on the transport allocation
we're working on it
we have had alot of issues with the colder weather
i will let you know as soon as we get oct in
i adjusted #0
so hopefully the demand will come through better
enron north america corp
that's fine
never used it
i think mark got everything in last night
you may have to have vol mgmt send things through
look into it and let me know how it looks
i will probably be out of the office on monday
returning on tuesday
attached is the preliminary agency agreement related to the cleburne plant
this is strictly confidential
so please do not pass this info on to others
i will let you know when we have finalized the contract and send you a copy
hey
ken
wouldn't this be great
it's a little hard to read
but that's the way i got it
hey
ken
thought you would like this
it's a little hard to read
but that's the way i received it
i have rolled the hilcorp deal
i will get gary to look into the williams deal
gary
the deal with williams terminals expired in oct
however
about 0,0 flowed for nov
do you need to renegotiate this deal for nov
or
do we roll it under the terminated k
what do think about dec
what was going on in feb
cpr
jungle pops
daren unify
jungle
i created # 0 for nov and dec
in most cases
ena will be a net buyer from tenaska iv for activity related to the cleburne plant
however
for october 0
the plant was down the majority of the month and ena sold off the supply
resulting in ena owing money to tenaska iv
i have created deal 0 with a demand of $0,0,0.0
which is the calculated amount of income on the cleburne desk
please see the attached schedule
we need to pass this income on to tenaska iv
do we need to pay this amount
wire from ena to tenaska iv
or is there another way to do this
this is the case for october 0 and could possibly happen again in the future
greg
troy
jim
please let me know what you think about settling this
megan
don't pay the amount until we here from the greg
troy and jim
also
make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we reimburse tenaska iv
possibly friday
i will take mon the 0th off also
how much does that cost
i mayh run it through tom's rc
we should not be paying tenaska's lone star transport for sep
that should be paid by tenaska iv
we took over the payments with october production
i'm cool with it
i moved the cannon sale volumes from #0 to #0 effective 0/0/0
you will need to re-nom #0 for all prior days at zero and then allocate volumes at each meter from the old deal to the new deal
let me know if you have any questions
tonya and i will be there
with pma's
volumes can be adjusted through the system as usual and i can adjust the demand fee on the sitara ticket
i am not able to follow your ua0 calculation
however
there was imbalance payback that occurred throughout september and october
this should have been pathed to the lone star transport k in unify
is this in that ua0 number
williams had been trying to make up volumes from prior periods
so that's probably why their volume came in greater than booked
much of their gas is from el paso and volumes vary each day from scheduled
the volumes that they were trying to make up would go toward the transport imbalance also
i would think that cleburne will carry an imbalance on lone star from month to month
after novemeber
the imbalance should be fairly small
our scheduler
mark mccoy will have that number
when we took over this deal
the imbalance on lone star was very large
when the plant went down in sep
we decided to payback the imbalance then
so that we could take advantage of higher winter sales prices if the opportunity came up
the agreement does not specifically state anything about ua0
but
i will discuss that with legal
the intent is for all costs
including ua0 and fuel
to be covered by tenaska iv
i will be leaving at 0pm today and will return on tuesday 0/0
we can get together then if you would like
i can meet on friday from 0:0-0:0 or wednesday anytime after 0:0pm
wednesday would be the best for me since we will be into bidweek on friday
but
i will make it work
hey
ken
well
the folks are fine
but
they have a few friends who lost just about everthing
in fact
one family found only a couple of boxes of salvagable
items from their home
only one family picture
i understand that alot of homes were reduced to rubble with very little left to save
it was very bad
what made it worse was the freezing weather coming in
when we talked to tonya's parents
they were really in shock of bad it was
have you been battling those christmas mobs
i took friday and monday off and tried my luck at it
i didn't last too long
it doesn't seem right to be cussing everyone out at christmas
i think i hate people now
i think i'm becoming a scrooge
well
i hope ya'll are doing good and staying in the christmas mood
cole is excited about christmas
wants more hot wheels and monster trucks
jake doesn't have the foggiest idea what's going on except that he wants to rip every ornament off of the tree and eat it
we've told him
no
so much that he shakes his head back and forth and smiles while he's grabbing for one
he is a handful
jake has also started taking steps
he just turned 0 months old this month
that's a little over a month earlier than cole started taking steps
anyway
i need to go
i have tried to approve this a few times
but it does not appear to work
what is the process to approve this in the system
daren
esther
please add me to your first delivery distribution
thanks
i tried to approve this a couple of times
so it should be taken care of
aimee
i have updated deal 0 in sitara for this change effective today
this gas should be allocated to deal 0
unit gas transmission
that point is already on the ticket
under ena
we should probably take this deal to zero
carlos
please check with measurement to determine if this volume is correct
we may have some bad information feeding through
fyi
this volume should be allocated to deal 0 for jan
the meter has always been on the ticket
but with zero volume
done
didn't the deal that victor extended cover these days
i don't think anything should be adjusted on the dynegy deal
aimee
the global octanes plant crashed last night
the undertakes
volume below the base load sale
will not go to the buyback
this is considered a force majeure
do not allow any volumes to be allocated to the buyback until notified by either lee papyoti or myself
thanks
ow
i have changed the pricing on deal 0 for this message
please adjust the risk assignment
we already have a deal in place
#0 with torch-rally
luis
please see the attachment
this file shows deals that still need adjustment stemming from the base gas program being kicked off for dec
please have these corrected also
thanks
the
arranged_quantity
column contains the correct volume
daren
i have extended #0
any sales made to mgi off of hgpl or hpl should be billed by the texas desk
however
hpl will not invoice mgi
all trades are done under ena
daren

i adjusted deal 0 on the 0nd of oct and nov for the adjustments below
can you make this work
enron north america corp
i don't know anything about the transport either
but
i would assume the rate remains the same
deal 0 is active through oct 0
the volume on the ticket is zero
so the nom was probably never sent to pops
gary lamphier is working on negotiating a price for this
i have created deal 0 to cover the flow for nov 0 thru jan 0
this deal will probably be handled month-to-month from here on out
i rolled deal 0 for the first 0 days of jan
i expect this point to be zero for the rest of jan
this is a call out meter
i think the best person to help you would be kathy benedict in volume management
gary
have you negotiated a price on this
i extended 0 for the month of december
danny
what do you want to do about this
megan
please see the message below
the pricing on deal 0 was incorrect
should be hsc gd-.0
i corrected the deal ticket
i have rolled deal 0 thru 0/0/0
priced at dec hsc index

how are we looking on the rest of our estimates thru king ranch

can you forward your calculations on the pan energy swap for september 0 to me

the texas desk will not be trading on eol
we will not have trading or logistics personnel in the office
so don't come in for us
hey

well

we will have a texas desk

i may look into brenda's group

i will most likely interview with aep to see what they have to offer
but it has to be very good in order for me to leave the evil empire
i am just glad they finally anounced the sale
some folks are upset and concerned about the whole deal
but i'm glad it's happened
anyway
i meant to let you know how our christmas went with the boys
cole loved everything
he had a great time and was sad to see christmas come to an end
jake is a little different
we spent $0 on a couple of things for him
he hasn't touched them more than twice
he found his new favorite toy the day after christmas
it's one of those soft cooler things you carry your lunch in
he found that in the bottom of our pantry and now carries it around everywhere
now we have these two big plastic things just taking up more room in our already crowded house
we started our house hunting last week
i think this is going to be a long process
tonya's out looking today
i'm letting her make the first cut
i will come in on the second round
we will probably put our house on the market in a couple of weeks
we have a few small things we want to clean up
fix
etc
before we list it
according to the other sales in the neighborhood
we should make a little money
i hope everything is going well with you and the family
later
i will not be able to play golf or party
i was really wanting to go
but can't make it
bh
if the super saturday occurred on a different weekend
i would help you out
however
we have a pretty important family weekend coming up
cole's 0rd birthday is today
we will be doing a little celebrating with that
plus
we are putting our house on the market this week and are scheduling appointments to view other houses
anyway
i hope everything else is going well for you
we need to talk sometime
i will call you in a couple of days

i can meet with you on the pan energy swap anytime thursday or friday afternoon
early afternoon usually works best for me

hey
mom
i got your e-mail just fine

cole had a great time at his birthday party last night
when we were walking out of chuck e cheese after the party
cole asked me
daddy
am i three now
he got some good presents and got to play alot of games
it took him forever to go to sleep
he really loved the blues clues game ya'll got him
the packaging was coming open when he got it yesterday
so tonya let him open it before the party
he played it in the car going to the party and on the way home
i think i'm tired of that game
he can't play it in the car anymore
it so funny to watch him play though
he will repeat the question and go
hmm
anyway i need to go
sandi
do you have a complete contract for the apache purchase under the tenaska iv deal
apache is billing us a rate that is $.0 below the commodity rate stated on page 0 in the original contract
in the documents i have
i can't find a reason for the adjustment
i may be missing an amendment or something
i thought that you may have a complete set of documents and could help me out

i would like to deliver as much of midcon's gas as possible to mobil
0,0-0,0
for february
when the work is going on
we can move that around
also
we have 0,0 baseload on centana we need to deliver to the plant
danny will input a new deal for dec and jan in the morning
i need for you
or the producer services group
to determine if you think the gas will flow for the month and at what price
i will use your decision for
that will be fine
i don't think that we should have any volume on this deal
it seems like jan 0 was added after the fact to assist with allocations
but it was later determined that we didn't purchase anything from copano
you can change the tickets
thanks
bob
i didn't check voice mail until this morning
i don't have a blinking light
the assistants pick up our lines and amtel us when voice mails have been left
anyway
with the uncertainty of the future business under the texas desk
the following are my goals for the next six months
0
ensure a smooth transition of hpl to aep
with minimal upsets to texas business
0
develop operations processes and controls for the new texas desk
0
develop a replacement a
strong push to improve liz
if she remains with enron and
b
hire new person
internally or externally 0
assist in develop a strong logisitcs team
with the new business
we will need strong performers who know and accept their responsibilites
0 and 0 are open-ended
how i accomplish these goals and what they entail will depend how the texas desk
if we have one
is set up and what type of activity the desk will be invovled in
which is unknown to me at this time
i'm sure as we get further into the finalization of the sale
additional and possibly more urgent goals will develop
so
in short
who knows what i need to do
grab me when you get a minute
i have your bonus and merit info
you're going to like it
what are the issues with this
is the problem a counterparty name issue
did we pay the wrong company
is cleco billing us
i forgot to get with you this morning on this
i went ahead and changed the volume to 0,0
paul
how are you determining that we should have a buyback for this deal
enron north america corp
sherlyn will correct all the booking when she reallocates the meter
we will need to wait until janet gets back
this is a spot deal that was done by gary lamphier
did janet negotiate something with them after the fact
i created deal 0 under cleco
to forecast entex
we have a database that contains the citygate volumes by day
with the low and high temps for each day
when we get a weather report for the new day
we enter the projected low temp and the spread into the file
the database is sorted by that information with a +
0 degrees on the temps
and provides an average volume for that criteria
for example
with temps of 0-0
the sort would produce a list of the volumes pulled for each day with a low of 0 to 0 degrees and a temperature spread of 0 to 0 degrees
an average is then calculated from that volumetric data
in this case
the average is calculated to 0,0 mmbtu
upon calculating the average
we then apply information we obtain through daily business and adjust that estimate
things to consider
if weather is cloudy or sunny
wet or dry
wind chill
entex's obligation on midcon
entex's recent operating procedures
entex takes versus our prior estimates
have we been under or overestimating volumes each day
etc
additionally
since we only see about 0% of the meters
we apply a factor to estimate the remaining 0%
if we have an unaccounted volume for a few days that is fairly consistent
and we have determined that the ua0 has not been caused by something else
we may adjust the factor to bring the estimates more in line
let me know if you have any questions
daren
i have created deal #0 to cover the buyback for 0/0/0
that would be fine
liz
do you want to take this on

i will be leaving today at 0:0
we are buying a house and we have the inspection today

thanks
after speaking with danny conner
i have created deal 0 to cover this meter for the next year
i don't have any open positions
thanks
i would like to receive the alerts
i have created a spreadsheet to assist in the tracking and booking of the gas supply related to tenaska iv
if you have suggestions or comments on the file
contact either me or mark
megan
you can copy the jan 0 est tab and update the volumes with actuals
the file should calculate the resulting settlement with tenaska
i will then update the demand fee on the deal ticket to true-up the month
since we haven't gone through actuals in the spreadsheet
we may have to do some tweaking with the formulas
anyway
this should give us a good start and you will be able to see where we closed the month in logisitics
the file is located in o/logistics/cleburne plant/0fuelmgmt.xls
if you don't have access
we can look into creating a new location on the o drive
the spreadsheet is attached for this month
this is definitely a work in progress
so
if you have ideas to make it easier
or if you need something added
let us know
done
enron north america corp
i don't know
check with settlements to see if they are billing us for dec and jan
done

i have done deals with john at this point
why are we not being allocated any volume
that's fine
hey ken
how are things going for you
is the market loving you
we have been really busy
we sold our house after 0 weeks on the market
i don't think i had it underpriced
i looked at the average $/sq ft for sales in our neighborhood for the last 0 months and i was pretty high above the average
anyway
we got what we wanted and made a little money
so we were happy
two days after we sold our house
tonya found the one she wanted in oaks of devonshire
it's over at louetta and i-0
just before the thicket
it's a little bigger than we were looking for
0 sq ft
but it's got a great game room/sunroom for the kids
it was built in 0
so it needs a little work
but that's ok with me
anyway
we are closing on both houses on monday and moving tuesday and wednesday
we will have you and linda over for lunch or dinner one of these days
we also had tubes put into jake's ears this month
we hated having to do that
but it has really made a difference
he had a constant ear infection since october
now you can tell that he feels so much better
he's learning more and more each day
we have nothing that is
jake proof
even those plastic locks you put on cabinets don't hold him
he knows that if you keep yanking on the door over and over that it will eventually slip or break and then your in
i'm going to install pad locks on the cabinets at the new house
we'll see if that stops him
anyway
everybody's doing well
i will be alot better after we finish this house business
i don't feel so good when i'm writing all those checks
talk to you later
what does ooto mean
i will be out of the office on the afternoon of 0/0 and the majority of the week
march 0-0 is better for me
mike
i don't know of any deals that were negotiated for this delivery
so
why don't you check with gas control to see if they know why vol was delivered on that day
i would think that they had to send someone out there to make it happen
additionally
you can check with gary lamphier or lee papyoti to see if they made a deal with the plant
you can extend them
but make sure that the volume is zero
talk with the person in accounting that deals with teco
see if they are using a different counterparty now at the plant
fred
why is nothing being allocated to alpine
this is a good deal we have in place with them and i really need the problem resolved

i can always make time for you

i have created deal # 0 to cover this flow
high zeros
is that similar to going flatter
i extended deal 0 to cover 0/0 and #0 to cover 0/0
the new deal should have the same price as the deal that you copied
you need to delete the lines with dates prior to 0/0/0 on the new tickets
we are not interested in the sofa

reducing the demand charges

mark's scheduling contacts may help
stacey has a trading contact with the pipeline
when she returns tomorrow
i will have her give you a call
the beginning imbalance on lone star was around 0,0 owed to lone star when we took on the management services in october
mark should be able to get you an exact number if you need it
megan
i have changed the pricing on deals 0 and 0 for october flows to mtr 0
these flows should be priced at $.0 + 0/0 % fuel
the $.0 that lone star billed us is incorrect on the last deal
i'm not sure about the rates for mtr 0
the person who can tell us should be in tomorrow
i will leave a note for her
we should have similar deal tickets for dec forward
i will check with mark and trisha

stacey did leave
so i am back to trading waha
however
it's going a lot better this time
i am actualy enjoying it somewhat
with the majority of the desk leaving
i am looking into moving into the day trading arena for the new texas desk
we'll see how that goes
bidweek was kinda rough this time
in addition to stacey leaving during the middle of the week
we have some major outages on the a/s line where we have to stay balanced on texoma and balanced on the south end
the line has been split into two seperate systems
handling that has been a constant battle
plus
with the pending sale
people just don't care as much about the business
it's a little harder to get things done
anyway
things are going pretty good at the house
but
the list of things to fix and do keeps getting longer and longer
we are extremely busy
the kids are loving the stairs
you ought to see jake go down
we taught him to turn around backwards and crawl down the stairs on his belly
well
that was too slow for him
now
he get's on his belly
feet up in the air
and slides down
barely skiming the stairs
he looks a penguin sliding down a snow bank
except on his stomach
cole is doing his best to either run jake off or make him tough
cole runs over jake with his toys
pushes jake out the way
or just walks right over him
it doesn't affect jake
though
he gets right back up and keeps on going
anyway
i need to get back to work
hope the family is doing well
maybe you can come down for lunch next week
i'll give you a call in the next couple of days
march midcon volumes at mobil should be 0,0 each day

you should probably quote the bids for any of this supply

eric boyt is working on the structuring of the deal

i have included our bid price and additional notes for each field
if you will re-print the quote sheets
i will enter our bids on them

after filling with water and adjusting to the correct ph and bromine levels

is there a way to treat this chemically

on oasis and pgev
we have been buying and selling as hpl
however
we have been transporting the gas under ena
this is primarily for spot and base deals
we want to keep these transport contracts with ena
the only term deal we have at waha is to tufco
0-0,0/day
this deal is under ena with it's own firm transport contract
now on guadalupe pipeline
which was previously teco/pgev
the sale and transport will go with hpl
the sale to entex off of oasis
currently under the ena
will be assigned to hpl
must be served off of oasis
so hpl will need to acquire an oasis contract for this deal
let me know if you have any more questions

every evening and every weekend for the last month and a half
i have been painting and working on the house
the previous owners of the house had the worst color scheme going
pink in one room and a portion of the entry way
lime sherbet green in the other portion of the entry way
there is a lot of trim
0 doors
and a 0 ft ceiling in the living room and entry way
so it is taking quite a while to complete
one reason it is taking so long is other things keep breaking
disposal
toilet flanges
alarm system
in the middle of trying to finish painting
we ripped out the floors in the bathrooms and entry and laid tile
i got the floors ready
we paid to have the tile laid
tonya wants everything done now
it doesn't bother her that i haven't finished a single project since we started the whole renovation thing
but
it's killing me
i would like just one finished product
one small room would be fine
the house is looking a lot better
though
i'm trying to not let the work take time away from the kids
so i usually start after 0pm each night
plus
when i do work while the kids are running around i pay a high price
last week i was painting the baseboards in the dining room
with the gallon of white semi-gloss next to me on the floor
i had earlier used windex to clean the window seal and had left the bottle in the middle of the floor
jake was coming into the room
watching and climbing up and down the step ladder
0 ft
he climbs to the very top like it's nothing
other people come in and see him up there and freak out
we just let him go
he is big into cleaning
guts it from his mom
so when he saw the windex he ran and picked it up
i told him to
take it to mama
he started out the doorway
but came back in and walked behind me
i just kept working
thinking that he was watching me
then i noticed out of the corner of my eye that he had moved closer to me
when i turned to look
i just lost my breath
jake had dipped the windex bottle down into the paint can
pulled it out and was holding the bottle over our brown carpet
white paint was just pouring off the bottle
it looked like someone had poured paint straight out of the can onto the floor
thank goodness it was latex
after about 0 minutes we got it cleaned up
cole has helped me with some of the work
such as sanding the walls
but
he carried his work a little farther than i wanted
yesterday
he had a friend over
they got his tools
play sander/grinder
circular saw
screw drivers
climbed up on his bunk bed
and decided they needed to take the texture off the ceiling
you should have seen the mess
i am taking a break this weekend though
cole and i are going camping at lake livingston
i am really looking forward to it
i'm trying to start something with him
and will include jake when he gets a little bigger
where we do a guy thing each month
last month i took cole to his first rockets game
he loved it
they are getting too big
too fast
at work
i guess i'm becoming a full fledge trader
i will be getting my own book in a couple of days
i'm pretty nervous about that
there's not a lot of activity in the training/coaching area around here
hard to believe
huh
but
we'll see how it goes
the last of the hpl/aep people are moving out of the building tonight
everything is on course to close the sale on june 0st
anyway
i hope you and linda are doing well
we'd like to have you over if we ever get the house in presentable shape
megan
we did the swap with pan energy on 0/0-0 only
on those days
we received all the gas at carthage
nothing at castle busby
when we are not operating under the swap
duke markets the gas that usually comes in at castle busby
apparently
they sold the gas to highland in april
there are alot of names on that e-mail
i hope you spread all those pina coladas over the week and not drink them all at once
have fun
i wish we could have purchased that gas at 0.0
but
the correct price is 0.0
i have corrected the deal ticket
i have changed the demand fee
but
is this adjusted by the dollar amount that we need to recoup from williams
i don't want to pay tenaska until we get the money from williams
additionally
i believe that we need to keep the volume at 0,0 for the admin fee
since we originally nominated 0,0/day
mirant had a problem with an eol transaction where i bought 0,0 from then at $0.0 for the 0st and 0nd
i agreed to let them out of the deal
due to legal problems with killing or adjusting eol tickets
i entered a sale
#0
to balance the volume and price out
the two deals should be netted
we should not have paid the purchase at 0.0
take liz
gary
and earl off the list
add o'neal winfee and george smith
bob
in looking at the trends over the meters
i made a few adjustments
highlighted in blue
please use these changes and enter the deal changes in sitara
let me know if you have any questions
is
not going to aep
considered an accomplishment
by the way
most of the people who could give performance feedback on me are leaving or have left the company
i'm sure they thought that i was superior though
the price should be if waha
i have changed the price in sitara
see below
the deal was priced at index but entered as gd in sitara
this is going to give you a $0,0 hit for april
use deal 0
this deal was in sitara
but did not have the meter attached
ow
on deal 0 i added meter 0
there was no meter originally
done
see if you can find danny's deal book and verify the price for the deal listed below
the deal has been changed
sandi
i don't think that the agency agreement is going with hpl
if that has changed
please let me know
i asked dave baumbach about it and he agreed with me
as far as signing the agreement
i need one thing added
under section 0.a
we need to add something like
in the event that ena owes company
payment will be made to company after ena has received funds from third party sales of excess supply
this situation has occurred when the plant was down for the majority of the month
ena sold the supply and net owed tenaska iv a large sum of money after the admin fee was netted out
additionally
txu pipeline has sent an amendment to the transport contract
adding receipt points
the contract still has tenaska gas co as a counterparty
instead of enron north america
how do we get this corrected
carlos
is this the gas on blue dolphin
deal 0 should be kept whole
this is a baseload purchase
deal 0 should still act as the swing buyback on days that the plant underpulls
fyi
anytime a purchase is done at an industrial point with a fixed price
the purchase should be kept whole
only the buybacks with gas daily pricing take the swings
done
channelview i believe
that's where i put it
i believe that carlos rodriguez handles this pipe
attached is a schedule of tufoco take for may according to our schedulers
let me know if you have any questions
we did deliver 0,0 per day to mobil for midcon for the month of may
done
elizabeth
can you re-send the file with the attachement
i accidentally deleted the first message and i don't have access to the file online
its working
i love you alot
thanks
the fax we received from the plant reported the start up at 0:0am
reaching full capacity at 0:0pm
but
we shouldn't have a problem
bryce
please forward this to the appropriate person in your group
i need someone to look into deal sitara #0
referenced below
why were these deals actualized to zero
done
megan
i have created deal # 0 to cover a sale from cleburne to ena
i also repathed unify
this should clean up the ua0 after the actuals on the old path between deal 0 and 0 are zeroed out
let me know if you have any questions
annette
the transport statement we received from lone star did not show that this gas flowed
that is why we have not paid yet
we are in discussions with the pipe to find out what happened
i will let you know as soon as something is determined
the supply from the desk-to-desk transaction
#0
is pathed to the transport
the 0 contract is an ena agreement
so
deal 0 transfers the gas to ena
ena then transports the gas on it's agreement on lone star
becky
please change my e-mail address on your distribution list to
dfarmer0@houston.rr.com
thanks
i don't have anyone
can you look into this
i never doubted you
thanks
how does your afternoon look on tuesday
i'm thinking around 0:0
tuesday
around 0pm works for me and the texas group
hey sweet baby
i was just thinking of you
i love you
done
we did not sell to tgl for sept
where do you think you're going
i don't know if i can handle any changes in deal validation
i didn't know if you got this or not
i love you
i can't wait to spend the next week with you
me
i'm in
elizabeth
texas and wellhead were grouped under george
i adjusted texas
but not wellhead
i also added the market hubs that we trade
under the pipeline section
let me know if you have any questions
done
the revised weekend nom is attached
have a good weekend
just wanted to let ya'll know that we get the attached report each week from vol mgmt
we don't have any pending issues
we haven't had many since this started
which i like to see
thanks for staying on top of it all
mike olsen will be the critical user for texas
fyi
i believe that we did have some activity on blue dolphin
but it was done by the wellhead group
you should send the vol mgmt people to george smith
i know the following
0
gulf plains plant is in nueces county
0
marathon on tejas is galveston county
check with george to make sure no one in his group has called the other pipes
i f they haven't
you can look into the old scheduling contact list and call el paso and dow
for el paso offshore
we probably need points
but i believe most of their system is in matagorda county
the entity i trade with is txu gas distribution
i verified this with my contact this morning
so
deal 0 is correct
all of the exxon katy points are in waller county
tx
hey
man
can you fix the schedule so that i can play somebody this week
done
hey
ken
we are in sad shape
aren't we
i was on vacation last week
through monday
not a good feeling coming back to a sub $0 stock price and an sec inquiry
it never really seemed possible to me that enron would be here
other than concerns for my future
everything is going fine
things really are ok
i know i can get a job with aep if i need to
i actually started talking to them about it
but on wednesday
they made a few changes that i'm not so sure about
ed gottlob
recently made vp
was put over the origination desk
i heard that they weren't too pleased with ducoti and bilberry
with that move
they needed someone else to run the trading desk
that person is our fast-talking friend
carey metz
that blew me away
i believe their thought was that he would be the best to manage the financial risk
apparently he's made a ton of money since he's been in columbus
he's also going to stay in columbus with this responsibility
so
this may be the first move to bring the group up north with the rest of the famthe home-life is going well
we have 0 year-old soccer every sat
my lovely wife signed me up to be the coach
i'm going to get her for that one
it is fun
though
those kids are funny
they don't care where the ball goes
they just keep kicking
even through the woods
looking forward to halloween
cole is going to be a policeman
jake is going to be a jailbird/prisoner
cole has already handcuffed jake a number of times
he loves it
my vacation last week was very good
it was the first extended vacation that i have taken where we didn't have traveling and entertainment stuff planned
it was one of the best vacations i have had
we spent 0 days in san antonio doing the zoo and easy stuff like that
the rest of the week
we did things around here
like children's museum
big game coming up this weekend
do you think your huskers can pull it off
i think ou's going to win it
but it should be a great game
how about the 0,0
or 0th for lunch
later
please take care of this
i don't know of any days yet
i've been trying to call ya'll
both lines
one keeps ringing
the other one gives a busy signal sometimes
keeps ringing sometimes
is the answering machine not hooked up
or are ya'll not clicking over
anyway
we're doing fine
just wanted to let you know that i tried to call
isn't the deal pathed from exxon king ranch
deal 0
to reliant
megan
we didn't operate hpl in a way where we matched markets with specific supplies
the supply for these sales was the entire hpl system
you can calculate the wacog on hpl as an estimated cost for each day or month
but i can't give you a specific supply cost or deal
let me know if you have any questions
gas logistics
mike olsen jay smith laura vuittonet has all of their info
we had to get the gas from somewhere
did tejas owe hpl gas and make the delivery to settle an imbalance
it looks like ena transported the gas on tejas for feb
have you checked to see if ena transported on tejas for mar
hey cliff
which rogue spear do you have
i have created deal 0 to cover this supply
mike
please see that this gets pathed in mops and pops and let megan know when completed
thanks
ow
what do you think about the orig deduct
how do we usually handle orig on something like this
for
no changes
fyi
karen
mike olsen currently reports to me
i fully recommend mike as a candidate for the origination track
i don't think that he has decided which path he wants to take regarding his future
but i know that he would be very interested in discussing this track
please contact him at your convenience
thanks

hey ken
let's do lunch next week
we are moving into the new building this weekend
i'll be able to show you around
if i'm still here
we had a tough football weekend
it's about time we got beat
we didn't deserve the wins we had
anyway
i've got to get to work
trying to break $0.0 today
it's kind of odd
moving into a brand new building when your stock price has reached an all-time low
done
ene @ 0.0
i don't think i will be able to eat for a week
maybe you should bring a bullet next week and put me out of my misery
fyi
i set you up as our man
there is nothing that you have to do
i basically just reserved a second desk
computer
etc for us in this building in the case that we have problems with the move
who does tanya smith report to
what will she be doing
none
rita
i began digging further into how this was scheduled yesterday
it does not look very good
i will re-work it today and let you know when i'm done
are you still there
done
mike
i very much appreciate what you have done for our desk
let me look into the promotions within and out of the analyst program
i want to take the best option possible
let's og today if you can
or tomorrow
i'm available anytime after 0:0
are you going to try your badge again
they are reviewing the photos now
along with new scanners
we are in the same building
the move got postponed until next week
using the same badges
i have the same phone #
parking is the same
i believe that the drive down here is open
may be some slowdown on the way out
not sure
whew
i think i covered everything
see you in a little while
rita
in order to book the imbalance payback between hpl and lobo
i have created deal 0
ena selling to aep @ $0.0
i have changed the price on deal 0 from $0.0 to $0.0
from what i understand
we received the gas at king ranch
sold it to aep so that they would move it through the header on their contract and bought it back at a half cent difference
following that
we sold the gas to the central desk
who sold it to oneok at the south texas pool
with the changes i made and the entries you are able to do
hopefully this deal will be wrapped up
let me know if you need me to do anything else
i really like you eric and would like to spend some time learning how you are such a master of basis trading
have you seen this
bob
mike olsen
analyst 0 jay smith
specialist 0 let me know if you need explanations
yes
mike olsen will be coming in for the texas desk
hey baby
honey-bun
goodlookin
goodlovin
sexy sweet thang
we may need to start talking to byron or someone about investing and all of that
can you find out how much he charges
one visit and continuing
he sent out an e-mail about ira's
they are waving fees for those for lifetime thru 0/0/0
anyway
i love you
this ticket starts with 0/0 production
how were all of the other months paid
none for me
i can go any of the 0st 0 weeks of dec
he doesn't have to go if you will wear the horns and play the buck like he does
anthony
can you change the counterparty name on deal 0 to black marlin pipeline company inc
none
hey
ken we had a good holiday
except for the trip back
it usually takes around 0 hours
last night it took 0
other than that everything was good
played a little golf
play may be too strong a word
watched a little football
our game with texas was much better than i expected
i can't believe colorado ran over nebraska like that
and the ou game
i love college football
it is so much more exciting than the pros
right now
i'm just sitting here watching the stock price bounce around 0.0
the big boys have been huddling quite a bit today
i think that we are close to the end
layoffs should be announced tomorrow
so
did you get the christmas tree after the game
0 footer
we'll be out this weekend getting ours and putting up the lights
jake doesn't know what's going on
but
cole is all excited
everything he sees
he wants for
chrimsas
knowing jake
i will probably have to anchor the tree on all sides to keep him from bringing it down
we'll see how it goes
i hope you had happy holiday
even with the game
a preliminary copy of the cleburne activity for oct 0 is attached
mike will be in tomorrow
and will finalize it
anthony
can you take care of this
i sent an e-mail to anthony campos on the 0th asking him to change the counterparty
i don't have the access to do that
if he can change the name
then we won't have to create a new deal and re-path
i just sent him another message today
i just found out that anthony has changed responsibilities
he said that he forwarded the message to bridgett
i'll let you know as soon as i hear anything
have you taken care of this
i'm here
but barely
last couple of days we've just been battleing problems and putting out fires
hanging in though
this just seems so unreal
i can't believe we are doing this
personally
i've got options
so i'm not too worried
done
well
i'm here
we are not trading
actually
we are just hanging around
playing games and shooting the breeze
waiting for the next news story
it's really odd
it really is sad seeing all the layoffs
especially
when i think of the $ the bigwigs carry home while the honest working people search for a way to earn a living
anyway
things are fine for me and the family
i'd better go
we've got a crossword competition starting
bob
we have the following net-outs in place at the exxon katy plant
texas energy transfer as for contracts we will need as a new company
it transport
intrastate and interstate
on the following pipes
txu lone star oasis channel east texas gas systems
etxg
duke guadalupe park and lend contract on epgt
hub
or wheeling
contracts on epgt and etxg
let me know if you have any questions
done
what's the big deal
it's only one digit
but
if it will make you happy
i will fix it
where are you going
i'm sure that the panenergy deal is all yours
i definitely understand your concerns
good luck over there
home
0-0-0 cell
0-0-0 cell will be the best way to contact me
i will be out thurs and fri of this week
jeff
i left a voice mail message for you yesterday about our role as agents for the tenaska iv's cleburne plant
i wanted to make sure that you got the message
please give me a call when you get a chance
0-0
mike
here you go
you might as well bridge back the pipes now and be done with it
let me know when you start this and i will help if you want me to
done
hey ken
well
i'm still here for now
it's hard to leave
we have all taken quite a bit of time off
out all last week and a couple of days the week before that
i'll only be here a couple of hours today
but we had a great christmas
the kids have been so excited
i made the mistake of getting a couple of microphones/sirens for their tricycles
you can hear them all through our neighborhood
the neighbors have already asked my what i was thinking
cole wanted 0 things
a play airport
a pirate ship
and buzz lightyear
he got them all
with each present
he kept getting louder and more excited
jake was primarily interested in in opening presents
he didn't care what was in them
that kid gets more out of ripping things up and tearing things down than any kid i have ever seen
in fact
the other day
cole and i were stacking his big leggo blocks as high as we could go
cole likes to make things and he likes them neat and orderly
so
he was working hard at making this tower stand up and work
it ended up being about eight feet tall
well jake was chomping at the bit to run through it
after holding him off for a few minutes
i let him go
you should have seen his eyes light up
you would have thought it was the biggest event of the year
he tore through it
smiling all the way
saying
again
again
it has been so fun spending extra time with the kids
my mom and sister came in the weekend before christmas
tonya's parents and sister came in friday
with the couple of days between their visits
i remodeled our downstairs bathroom
strip wallpaper
paint
hung a border
hung crown molding
that was my first try with crown molding
it turned out ok
thank the lord for wood putty
so
we've been pretty busy
but
it's been fun
how was your christmas
was santa claus good to you
i guess your kids were in
i hope you had a wonderful time
i'm looking forward to corn boys bowl game
anyway
i need to go make a call on a tee time
tonya's dad and i decided that we would pay good money to get mad and lose a bunch of balls and break a few clubs
while out in the cold
it doesn't make much sense
does it
but then again
most things that men do don't make much sense
later
daren
bob
for the texas desk
mike olsen and i will start out handling the scheduling activities
as we start up we will not be doing a lot of shipping on the intrastate pipes
we will primarily be utilizing hub and cartwheel agreements and net outs
trading primarily on the waha
katy
and carthage hubs
i will cover katy and carthage
mike will continue to cover waha and any shipping activities on the intrastate pipes
i will need a second person fairly soon after we begin trading again
within a month or two
what are you thinking that we need to look into on the intrastates
also
with message of setting up new budgets
can you have brandy send me a copy of the budget we had in place for texas 0
thanks

i thought that i sent this to you a couple of weeks ago
sorry for the delay
bob
tom is asking aobut the budget info
when do you think that i can get it
we may be able to print this out
look on the texas tab
this is what we've got so far
due to our agency activity on lone star
i do not want to contact them yet
but
i have a copy of a contract they sent me a couple of months ago we can use
bobby
unfortunately
we will not be able to make it saturday night
we will be in dallas visiting my brother and his wife
sort of a late christmas get together
i hate that we are going to miss it
but i will touch base with you later
also
please change the e-mail addresses you have for me and tonya to

daren
bob
who is collecting the hard copies or e-mails of contracts
i've got the guadalupe contracts now
suzanne
below are the contracts we will need to ship on guadalupe pipeline in texas
jeff
the message below is in reference to the voice message and e-mail i sent you a couple of weeks ago
we are serving as agent for tenaska iv
with the duties of scheduling and settling for the fuel needs of the cleburne plant
in november
the plant was not running at full capacity
so we sold the excess fuel gas to txu fuel and txu gas distribution
in doing this
we ended up with a net payment owed to tenaska iv
in normal months
tenaska pays us and then we pay the suppliers and pipelines
all profits/losses are passed through to tenaska
ena receives a management fee
can we pay intercompany bills
how should we go forward with this agency responsibility
daren
james
i just sent a message to jeff hodge asking how we can handle this
i will let you know as soon as i hear something from him
i left messages with him prior to today to discuss this deal
ow
i went through the list on the sort by pipe and highlighted the curves/mapping we can delete
yellow
and those we can change
orange
the only curves we will have left are katy
waha
hsc
agua dulce
and thompsonville
i expect to be using thompsonville in 0 months to a year
if it easier or cleaner to delete that curve and add it when we need it
that will be fine
let me know if you have any questions
chris
what credit requirements to you have for a new entity with an
a
credit rating
daren
jeff
i will be happy to meet with you on wednesday
physically
yes
mentally
i've been gone a long time
i'm trying to make a decision whether to stay or go
how about you
how are things going
rick
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv
0
since the end on november
ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions
we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas
this
of course
is due to the bankruptcy
as a result
we are not able to sale tenaska's excess fuel
we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price
but they do not want it
gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while
in december
we had to cut 0,0/day from the 0th through the 0th
for january
we haven't had to cut yet
but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future
0
for november activity
which was settled in dec
ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold
however
due to the bankruptcy
we could not make payments out
ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline
james armstrong paid the counterparties directly
i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan
we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena
i don't know how enron's ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding
but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management
please give me a call or e-mail me
we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning
contract from oasis pipe line
suzanne
attached is an updated file on our pipeline contract situation
i haven't gotten much info from credit managers
but i wanted to pass along their names and numbers
bob
i would like to recommend a promotion for mike olsen
mike has been instrumental to the texas desk
with the sale of hpl
we were left with only one scheduler with texas experience
mike took on the responsibility that two people were carrying prior to the sale of the pipeline
waha scheduling
he trained our new hire
jay smith
and assisted in developing scheduling processes at the katy hub
prior to the sale of hpl
all of our activity at the katy hub passed through the pipeline
mike used his knowledge of the waha hub and helped develop a net out procedure that allowed us to effectively schedule our transactions
since june
mike has handled the logistics activities of the majority of texas pipes
westar
hpl
pge
channel
oasis
guadalupe
mike most outstanding accomplishment is the over $0,0 he saved us in hub transport fees from july to november
in july
i began tracking the amount of hub fees that we should have to pay in the waha area
on eol we transacted on the basis that the seller pays the transport fees through the hub
mike used his knowledge of the pipes
his business relationships
and his negotiation skills to decrease the amount of gas that we scheduled under our contracts
in essence
i kept a sort of p&l for him
mike has taken the desks responsibilities upon himself
as if this were his business
with the limited number of people on our desk
i needed to split my time between logistics and trading
truthfully
i spent the majority of my time with the trading
mike handled the daily logistics responsibilities
he acted as lead
supervising and training jay
our other team member
mike performed at a senior level since his first month with the desk
mike came to the desk with experience on the pipeline side of the business
accepting nominations and confirming the plants and interconnects
he came to the texas desk and exceeded all of my expectations
he has advanced quicker than any of the schedulers i've seen
in fact
he has gone from very minimal marketing logistics knowledge to explaining transactions and processes to other people in the industry with more experience than him
in short
mike has been the heart of the texas logistics team
his abilities and hard work have reduced our transport fees
kept our headcount low
he has fulfilled the responsibilities of two people
and enabled the texas desk to close time sensitive deals and transact in increasingly complicated deals
mike is a superior employee
his knowledge
ability
and hard work are essential to the success of the texas desk
please support him with a promotion
please let me know if you have any questions or need any information.thanks
daren
rick
i've had a couple of meetings today
i'm sorry i'm just getting back to you
i tried to call but the voice mail said that you were unavailable
so
give me a call when you get a chance
ed
ena has acted as agent for tenaska iv
a generation facility in cleburne
texas
in which
enron has ownership interest
our role was to manage the fuel requirements for the plant
this includes scheduling
invoicing
and settling the natural gas supplies and transportation
in addition to the daily activity
ena has the responsibility to sale any excess fuel from the baseload supplies and purchase an additional fuel needs
any profits/losses are passed on to tenaska iv
ena is just paid a monthly fee for the service
rick hill is my contact person for the project
he is looking into finding another party to handle this fuel management responsibility
if he can't find a party willing to do this under similar terms
we will need to find some one with the enron estate to handle this
the problem with enron continuing in the role is the inability to transact in the gas market
no customers willing to trade with us
so
the project is losing value
please give me a call when you get a chance
or
maybe we can meet sometime next week to go over this
my schedule is pretty flexible
daren
can have a cake with rough blue icing on top
seas
and find a pirate ship to put on top
get a bunch of blue balloons
ocean
to put around pirate ships

carol
i am interested in joining in on a group gift
let me know what you need
our risk manager has reviewed the insurance requirements
his only comment concerned the owner's/contractor's protective liability insurace requirement on the bottom of the first page of exhibit e
he thinks this is unnecessary as we have adequate coverage under the general liability and excess umbrella liability
since this cost is likely to be passed on to us
we should waive this insurance requirement
everything else is ok from our perspective
let me know if you need any further information or have any questions
attached are a clean and redline version with my changes

attached is the latest structure
this is still subject to change as aa has not yet approved
the deal basically involves creating a new entity to take ownership of 0 existing electric compressor motor drivers and associated contracts which ect currently owns
the compressor motor drivers are supplied with electricity from the navajo tribal utiltity authority
ntua
ect sells horsepower created by the motor drivers to transwestern in exchange for $$ and mmbtus
lance schuler will be working the finance portion of this project
this is a 0nd quarter deal
would you expect anything less
please let me know who will be working on this from your group or call to discuss any questions
thanks
attached is a short outline of the proposed steps to transfer the compressor motors
ntua contract
and tw contracts to ecs llc
i know we still don't have structure approval

how about 0 a.m
eb0
see you tommorrow
ted
attached is a revised draft of a letter
please review and let me know if you have any comments
please note the following with respect to this issue
0
we should make sure we have performed a gas analysis at each producers delivery point and are sure they are creating or contributing to the quality problem
i recommend attaching such gas analysis to this letter
0
the brg petroleum corp
contract doesn't give us any cause to send this letter
the contract requires brg to meet the quality specs
of the the pipeline which receives the gas downstream of the point of delivery on the confirm
such point of delivery is at the wellhead and hpl is the downstream pipe
hpl's specs
unless they have changed
don't have a limitation on gas richness
0
the texlan letter will be slightly modified from the attached
since we will reference force majeure
0
do we have a accurate list of producer names and address
if you are okay with the letter
i can have a paralegal prepare the letters with addresses

lisa actually just joined enron

we are doing good
we bought a 0 yr old house near downtown about 0 year ago and have been restoring it ever since
it really is amazing how all that bob villa watching is now paying dividends
i am considering getting a tool belt with my name engraved on it
we are both doing good
life for me is good
now that i don't have to go to school in the evening or study for the bar exam
i am just enjoying my free time now
i still keep up with george and ernie occasionally
george still lives in austin and is single
i visit him a couple of times a year
you wouldn't believe it
he still has the same furniture in his apartment that he had in college
kind of like stepping into a time warp
ernie just finished getting his mba at ut this spring
he will be working in san antonio for frito lay
no doubt designing a chip that won't break when you dip it
he now has a little girl with another kid on the way
i think due sometime this summer
he has really changed since undergrad
a responsible young man now
how are mom and pop bieraugel doing
is the big 0 going to take it in the shorts this year

i think she said john was in alaska
anyway
drop me a note when you get a chance
it is really great to hear from you again
we need to keep in touch
gerald

we are currently negotiating an interconnect agreement for an upgrade of an existing interconnect off the trawick system into tufco
the interconnect is solely a delivery to tufco
we are down to one point of difference in the agreement
typically hpl disclaims any liability for consequential damages to the other party
tufco is asking for an exception for any violation of gas quality specifications
this would mean that if hpl delivered off spec gas to tufco which required cleanup of their pipeline system or caused damage to a customer of tufco's hpl would be liable under this agreement
from a legal standpoint
we can make this exception
but i wanted to make sure everyone understood and agreed with the acceptance of this potential liability
assuming we are properly monitoring all our receipts there shouldn't be an issue
please let me know what you think about this situation
i can forward a copy of the interconnect agreement if you do not currently have one
i don't know if you have been keeping up with the recruiting info but mack has committments from 0 blue chippers already
one of them is the top lb in arizona
he is working his magic again this year
i haven't heard anything about the status of those recruits
except that it sounds like alfio randall will be a partial qualifier
this isn't great since we need ol for depth this year
tufco has agreed to remove the exception to consequentials for breach of quality provisions
they are preparing executables and will forward to hpl for execution
thanks for your help
tom

we made a change to the monthly contract quantity to exclude force majeure events and section 0.0 shaft energy interruptions
please review and call me with any questions

since we have circulated the prior amendment
i think it would avoid the most confusing by giving these amendments a new execution date
i also added a section which specifices that these versions replace the amendments dated the nbv letter values will also be redone

a quarterly schedule be included

however
in the interest of time
i am distributing these now for your information
this is incredible
the kid was a life long aggie fan
makes one trip to austin and commits to ut
i think we have finally found the guy to win it all for us
mb
also now chance is saying he will actively recruit for us
he wants this years class to be better than last years class
i think a few phone calls to roy williams and bj johnson
i can't wait til august
when are you coming back guy
are you ready for some football
might try this for the bar
while at the bar
paul
we need to plan on getting together sometime
when and how long are you going to be in san diego once you get back from stomping out the
angry red horde
might be an opportune time to hook up
i would love to see papa bieraugel in action and i'm not referring to your dad
not sure if you or someone in your group already had seen this
the form of right of way looks good
go ahead and forward to the land owner
what's up rude-dog
haven't heard any new recruiting news
i think it is going to be quiet on that front until later in the football season
i was up in denver this past week and talked to jessica wentworth
she said you have been exploring the australian countryside
bet there is some amazing stuff down under
anyway
drop me a note and let me know how its going
i know i have asked this before
but when are you getting into town
we need to have some repatriation beers upon your arrival
things are going good in legal
i am getting to work on some interesting stuff
i just finished working on a compressor deal with mark courtney
it was an asset and finance deal
i got to work with the finance commercial and legal types and learn quite a bit in a very short time
it is hard to keep up with the pace and not make a total fool of myself with my lack of knowledge at this point
tense but fun
i didn't see the any of the high school all star games
i heard babers and turner both looked very good in the texas
california game
sounds like they were covering some 0'0
bad asses from california and pretty much shut them down
at least that most other peoples opinion
sounds like kenny hayter look pretty good
leading texas rusher
he sounds like a power runner not a real juker
i am really worried about the nc state game
it would suck to lose the home opener
but i think that is a very real possibility
their quarterback sounds like a stud and they have some big recievers
ala ucla
i still think we will at least go 0-0 probably 0-0 best case
your right though
if we fall flat with 0-0 or something it will slow the momentum mack is building
i just don't think that will happen
mack is too smart and can really get these kids to overchieve
i think his players believe and are motivated to play hard
mackovic only won with offensive schemes and good athletes like james brown
when you think about it though
mack following mackovic is really going to pay dividends in the long run
mack brown and greg davis weren't exactly known for their high powered offense at unc
but mackovic had installed a strong passing game and quarterbacks which mack and greg picked right up on
now we have kids like mock
williams
and johnson wanting to come here for the offensive scheme alone
i like it
it is going to be fun in about 0 years with the quality of kids we are now getting
i will think about the groups i have worked with and let you know on any areas to go
i have worked a lot with larry lawyer in the finance group and know he is looking work people
i don't know if this was the same stuff you did in denver or the same group
might be
those guys do work a lot of hours
almost as bad as attorneys
i will give it some thought
well
all for now
keep in touch
i am glad you are going to be back in houston
we will have some fun
i want to hear all about how much you really like australian women or more specifically
how much they like you
i love you
a note from bieraugel
we need to go out and see these guys when we get a chance
hang in there
things will start to come around
it is just going to take some time
thought you might find the attached interesting
i don't know if any of the people you are talking to are on this list
but might be worth checking
jackie
could you have the entex contract the mike mentions pulled and forwarded to me
thanks
ken
attached is the form of row agreement and exhibit b that goes along with it
greg
attached is a draft of interconnect agreement form based on the discussion we had yesterday
i left the reimbursement provision open with only placeholder language that indicated they will be paying for the interconnect in some form
i made some assumptions about equipment that either party would install
however this can easily be changed
i didn't draft any credit language in the agreement
i think this would be best handle by simply having our credit department review these guys and if they are worried about them
we should require them to make an upfront payment before we buy or build anything
take a look at the draft and let me know if you have any questions
tommorrow at 0:0 or later works for me
thanks
works for me
thanks
mark
i made the change in attached note
let me know if you need anything else
i am glad you asked me to lunch today
i do enjoy spending time with you even though at times it is tough and our conversations are hard right now

it is extremely hard to watch you struggle through this
it is hard for me also
i sit up here trying to work when the reality of our current situation weighs on me like a ton of bricks
it is hard for me not to break down a couple of times a day
but the pace of my work usually forces me through those times
i don't know if my calling you
asking you to lunch
or holding your hand
helps or hurts at this time
but i am not going to let us give up on each other
my feelings for you run too deep to just try and bury them so that i don't have to think about all the pain
we are both struggling to find a place to start
i want to start by just letting you know that not a day goes by without me thinking of a time when we can put this behind us
i am not sure how to get there right now either
however
during those few precious time lately when i get to look into your eyes
i see the true lisa
changed as she is by the last couple of years
but still lisa nonetheless
i need to get to know this changed true lisa

the following steps follow the contract amendment
assumes bloomfield contract
0
calculate the number of hours that the driver was down for force majeure
0
subtract the hours in #0 from the total hours in the month
0
calculate the monthly contract quantity as defined in the amendment
bloomfield
0 times # of hours developed in #0 above
0
calculate the load factor as defined in the agreement
since we don't have a load factor during those hours of the force majeure event
we assume that the unit would have run at the load factor in #0 above if not for the force majeure event
thus
0
multiply the load factor times 0
max hp-hrs
times # of hours of force majeure event
this gives you the equivalent hp-hours that would have been used during the force majeure event or supply interruption
0
in accordance with the amended section 0.0
a
to calculate hp-hour charge do the following
multiply conversion factor
taken from exhibit based on load factor

let me know if you have any questions
we can work through an example if we need to
thanks
i know love isn't enough by itself
we have to give each other more
the types of things that make the other feel full and complete in life
we have focused on material things
when really more meaningful things
such telling the other that you have an interesting way of looking or thinking about some facet of life are what fills each other
we are both bright and ambituous people who should be able to enjoy the finer things in life
but in the right context
not as direction
but as background to connecting as husband and wife
husband and wife means many things
friends
supporters
providers
sounding boards
lovers
shoulder to cry on
someone to just hold onto
or walk hand in hand on the beach
i want to do these things for you and want you to do them for me
hope you can think of me
love
gerald

please review and call me if you have questions
0
0-0
thought you might be interested
just in case you aren't recieving these emails
has the few changes we discussed
meant to copy you on this
here it is
david
please review the attached document
specifically section 0.0
attached are the changes we discussed today
rude dog
maverick
it's no good up here
i'm holding on too tight
i've lost the edge
yes
it is close
i am pretty pumped
i am also extremely nervous about barnette and their passing game
looks like walker and hill will be the starting corners
yikes
i think our defense will be able to put some pressure on barnette with the type of speed we have at linebacker now
if we don't get any pressure on barnette
i think we will likely lose this game
but i am hopeful that big shaun rogers will wreak havoc in the middle
the offense is still a big questions
the level of talent on the ol gives me comfort
davis
kirk-hughes
so big they gave him two names
roesler
etc
are all big time
the 0st series should be really interesting
i think we come out passing lights out to loosen up the run defense
then start sending ike off roesler and davis
occasionally send flowers down the field on the fly and have applewhite throw it as far as he can
it is going to be a good one
which game is the first one you'll be able to go to
how are the australian women
bring pictures and stories
preferably with much embellishment
i recieved both documents
thanks
attached are the revised gas purchase and gathering agreement and the new collection facilities agreement
the collection facilities agreement has the insurance requirements but not the security documents
i will forward the security doc
shortly
attached is the security document form
section 0.0 is missing and i will provide tommorrow
however
in the interest of time i am forwarding the agreement for review
gt
i will be coming to this game w/o lisa
i plan on driving in friday night and probably getting there about 0:0 pm
if its okay i'll crash at your place
let me know how your schedule looks
since lisa isn't coming i'll have an extra ticket with me on the 0
interested
this version includes the section 0.0 language
attached is a clean and redline version of the documents
i have the powder river basin exhibit and can fax if you want to review
please note that i added a section that allows enron to relocate units if they are underutilized at their current location
this was resultant of the 0 year term for the units contracted for during the initial 0 year period
attached are the executable documents
bob
please print out 0 copies and have hanover execute
please fax signature today to me at
0
0-0 and fedex or courier complete contracts to me at
0 smith thanks for your help
g
i will be there about 0 pm tonight
my cell phone # is 0-0-0
i am fedexing the form of lease this morning
sorry for the delay
oooouch
that one hurt
we really kicked their butt all over the field
the defense played well
especially ahmad brooks
i don't think he had one completed on him all night
what really sucks is that we just gave this game away with the punting team
i am trying not to get too down about this
this is a young team that is going to make mental errors and they will improve
i still thinks we will have a good season
the only freshman i saw getting any pt was cory redding
he looks fast out there and really crushed somebody on a kick off return
he also got some snaps at de on a couple of 0 and longs
but didn't do anything outstanding
unfortunately he was also out there on the punt team during the debacles
victor ike should be our starting tailback
he look big and fast and gets yardages running in the interior
ike left a defender looking really stupid on his long td run
sweet moves
hodges look about like he did last year
had a couple of good runs but doesn't seem to use his blocking very well
ok
so we will begin our win streak with stanford
the thing i really like was that mack said he takes full responsibility for the punting problems and that he will insure that they get fixed
mackovic would have made excuses that essentially put the blame elsewhere
this season could be an up and down one
but the real prize is next year and the years after
did you get any info on the game
i was thinking of bringing along a friend from enron to the boat party
unfortunately he is not a female so this may throw off your proper party ratio
he is married though so he will leave the single girls alone for you and me
his wife is out of town this weekend
he won't mind sleeping on the floor
thanks for letting me hang at your place this weekend
lisa is a really cool girl
you two will have fun together

from the oklahoma 0
waylon turdsby
star te from the reigning 0-a champion fighting chick-peas gave the sooners a verbal commitment by letter late wednesday according to ok0 sources
this is a big boost to the sooners who were competing with tulsa
anadarko junior college and out of state powerhouse kansas for his services
waylon
who is 0'0
0lbs and runs a 0.0 0 chose ou because
they serve fried pork rinds in the cafeteria and the chicks there dig mullet hairdos
waylon plans to study business and eventually take over the family used car dealership
waylon added
my daddy says he has done a lot of business with sooner coaches and boosters over the years and that ou would be the best place to refine my used car selling skills
the great traditions of ou were also a factor according to waylon
they have this great tradition where they touch all the movie posters of ou legend brian bosworth before running out onto the field
you just don't get that kind of inspiration outside of ou
attached is a discussion draft of the compression services agreement for gallup
mary
i was out of the office on friday and unfortunately have a conflicting meeting scheduled
please let me know what we need to do to work out the details
the operations information you requested should now be directed to robert morgan in facility planning
i forwarded the sheets you left in my office last week to robert for his review
i handled this request before when i was in facility planning

shonnie daniel will work with you from the legal group perspective to give you any help you need
tom

but will let you know
call me if you have any questions
tom
those items will be sent to you tommorrow
lisa
i feel so bad right now
i never wanted anything but to be with you and love you the rest of my life
i wish we knew how important it was to communicate with each other over the past years
i think we are both guilty of not communicating
it is easier to talk to some besides each other about certain things because of certain expectations or assumptions that have been built up over our portion of a lifetime together
it hurts to now clearly understand this after things have happened
i am scared of you moving in with chris because i fear that we both may accept it as final
i don't want it to be that and i want us to genuinely work on this relationship
i want us to talk and do things together
you are my one true love
melissa

in a shocking move that will have the rest of the big 0 playing recruiting
catch-up
ou has snatched a solid commitment from all-state wide out delmer shanks as a freshman
shanks is expected to play in the
opossum
set of ou's daunting new offense
the opossum spread is going to really fool people next year
shanks explained in a phone interview from an oklahoma kwickie mart
in the possum set
we take the left tackle and line him up out with 0 or 0 of our receivers
i lay up in the backfield
like a opossum
and then the center hikes the ball to the tight end and then it's a hand off to either me or the quarterback
when asked about why he commited to ou in the middle of the season
a usually slow time of year for recruiting
shanks had this to say
well it was a no-brainer really.skoalis going to be sponsoring ou athletics next year
so it just seemed like a natural fit
i really liked what they're gonna do with the uniforms
that sown-in dip ring they're putting on everyone's back pockets are gonna look real nice
they're also gonna do some neat stuff with the switzer center too
gonna sell moon pies and stuff at the door
shanks did not take any official visits to other schools before his commitment
though he did say texas a&m and ou had expressed interest in him all along
yeah
they were plenty nice at a&m and coach slocum talked to momma a lot on the phone
he told her that this was gonna be the year they would pass more and that i would fit in real good with their high power pro-style attack
it turns out that delmer's mother did influence his decision some
a laughing shanks explains
yeah
we was out back pitching washers and momma come hollering outside
said stoops promised her i would wear #0 at ou
we all been dale earnhardt jr
fans for a long time
so we seen the importance of what they was saying
they don't honor you like that ou unless they done taken a real liking to you
as the interview came to a close
shanks had this to say
keep an eye on us
cause we're gonna be pretty darn good next year
we got 0 man plays in the book where the whole line is gonna go out on pass routes and we keep the water boy in to block for the quarterback
boomer sooner
only time will tell if schools like texas
nebraska and others can keep up with stoops and his amazing program
attached are the latest drafts
clean and redlined
there are still blanks to be filled in for the numbers

the only question they

enron midstream services
l.l.c

can you email the details on the agreement and forward a copy of the agreement
i will use the form of affiliate work order you forwarded prior
thanks for your help
ah yes
a mini 0 year old cheese burger
why should that cause problems
i again reviewed the storage contracts on which large value has been assessed
the cove point lng
limited partnership and egan hub partners
l.p
are both ferc regulated entities and both agreements have negotiated rates
the cove point deal has a negotiated reservation charge and the egan hub partners has a negotiated storage reservation and injection charge
since we are buying the assets of columbia and assigning the contracts to enron and these deals are at less than max rates
they would be subject to reposting upon assignment and there would be no guarantee that enron would receive these rates in a competetive bidding situation
it is my understanding the discounts were taken into account for valuation purposes
however these discounts are at risk due to posting requirements
the remainder of the storage contracts would require consents to assign
note
any transport contracts with discounted rates would be subject to the same as above
i am verifying the reposting requirements with randy rich of bracewell
patterson
ferc counsel
and he is to get back with me early this afternoon
i will let you know if anything changes
dan
attached is a clean and redlined version of my changes

since i have two tickets
let me know if that fits in with your plans
three problems with this draft
0
in paragraph 0.0
they removed my requirement of installing a system to meet
all of enron's electrical power requirements for the driver
my concern here is that they put in equipment that is not adequate to handle our load requirements
at a minimum we should state a specific load requirement for this station
e.g
0,0 hp
0
in paragraph 0.0
they inserted a requirement that plain's approve any in-service date for the driver and that the telecommunication equipment would be in-service by such date
my draft had a date established by enron solely and plains would have to meet such date
i think we need control of our in-service date without plains prior approval
we will be reasonable in establishing such date
0
plains disclaims all warranties with respect to the telecommunication equipment
this was not in the first draft
we need some assurance that this equipment will do the job we need it to
i would be happy to discuss these directly with plains
attorneys at their convenience
arnold

let's take out the reference to approaching the ferc in this letter
i would emphasize that they have had more than enough time for a response and while we would like to think they are cooperating
the lack of response little reason to believe otherwise
suggest that any further delay would require us to explore all our options for access into cms
at this point i would feel more comfortable with suggesting we would need to go to ferc via a phone conversation with cms
let me know if you want to discuss this further

please review and lets discuss any comments
after re-reading the purchase and gathering agreement
i think the amendments should work in their present form
the 0,0 western gas needs to be noted as an exception on exhibits a of both agreements
exception should read
up to the first 0,0 mmbtu/day of production from the caballo area shall be delivered to western
with ena
or ems as applicable for the agreement
receiving all volumes in excess of such 0,0 mmbtu/day
any decline in the caballo area production shall apply ratably between western's 0,0 mmbtu/day and ena's

the good thing is that the
dude
i met in joe's and i are now pen pals and he will be coming to houston to visit very soon
maybe he was my long lost brother
i am making a phone call to my mom right now too see if she has anything she wants to explain to me
steve
do you have an executed copy of the trunkline confidentiality agreement for the lng terminal in lake charles
need to get one for our files
thanks
that's not funny
it is all about drinking with you isn't it
you need to get a grip
i will have to pass on the rudz suds as i will be dining at one of houston's finer eateries with captains of industry tonight
however
eric and i were kicking around a possible road trip to the beautiful island of galveston this weekend
saturday or sunday
think that nice friend of yours
willis
might be interested
please respond appropriately with your level of interest
just to anticipate the tone of your response
i will go ahead and call you a
smart ass
right now
it is showing up on my computer and seems to be working
rfp
i had a good time also
the bands were interesting though
i bet that dude in the helmet sweated his ass off during the performance
the date was actually her call
we are meeting some of her friends out for dinner and drinks and then some sweet sweet love
seriously
this girl is cool and a lot of fun
should be a good time
of course i am assuming that the date is still on
in my clear thinking state last night when i left rudz
a la 0 pm
i called her and woke her up
i really have no idea what i said to her
she may not be speaking to me anymore
what was with willis last night
no show
let's circle the wagons this afternoon to discuss galveston
i'm sorry
eric and i aren't speaking at the moment due to creative differences
i want only the orange m&m's removed from our dressing room and he wants only the brown ones removed
attached is exhibit c to the gallup o&m agreement
the original document left this exhibit to follow later
we also still owe you exhibit b
description of compressor motor facilities
to the o&m agreement and exhibit b to the csa
proposed form of no
0 schedule
these will follow shortly
attached for your review is the letter agreement which locks in the gas conversion agreement pricing
sounds like a good trip if there are spaces available
i think our dive captain is checking availability
of course our dive captain is also hesitant about being swallowed whole by a whale shark
i told him that with a house to remodel that would probably be a blessing
let us know what your schedule is
see if we can't hook up thursday or friday for lunch
i open and i am sure nacious e would be too
true
especially after i cut e's fat plump rump roast with my dive knife to chum the waters a little
let's shoot for friday for lunch
maybe i go back to work after that or maybe i don't
no other three czech brothers can cruise so successfully in tight slacks
things are going well with little cynthia
she is really fun and easy to talk to
i am not sure what my intentions are right now but we enjoy each others company
stephanie

thanks
tracy
thanks for the pictures

anyway
hope to see you guys soon sometime and keep sending pictures
gerald

but i have been really busy at work and with other things
i will give a call when i get a chance
attached is a clean and redline version with my changes

hi katie
looks like you got the address right
i too enjoyed talking with you last night
i know you were disappointed to be distracted from your research project for a while
its been a busy week so far
the end of the yearly quarter always is
last minute deals have to be closed to book the income
at this time of year the commercial dealmakers get that wild eyed looked which says
i have got to get this project done or i am out of here
march 0 can't arrive soon enough
got any big plans for the weekend
hanging out at the dixie chicken or is that only where rookies hang out
take care and i'll talk to you later
gerald
how are things going
haven't talked to you in a while
as for me
i am fine
work is pretty busy right now
we are at the end of the quarter and have to get certain deals closed before march 0
so it can get hectic
my roommate will be leaving shortly
he got a job opportunity with his family in north carolina
so he will be moving
didn't last very long
but i knew that was a possibility when he moved in
are you guys getting into the wedding planning mode now with sharon
it should really be a beautiful wedding up in estes park
very nice mountain scenery
take care and i will talk with you later
gerald
gentlemen
yes that means you
eric
please review the attached and give me any comments before i distribute to the group
amy
i revised a few things in the agreement
should be ready to go
heather
i talked further with transwestern counsel today concerning the issues and have the following points
0
ferc was made aware of the compression services arrangement with ecs in the filings for the certification of the kachina units
ferc simply didn't ask any further questions in that proceeding
the operation
maintenance agreements in place for the kachina units essentially accomplishes the same tasks as the operational control agreement in gallup
tw feels the o&m agreements would be adequate to address any concerns about tw's regulatory responsibility over the compressor facilities
the operational control agreement was put into place in the gallup transaction because it was thought to be easier to give ferc exactly what is was looking for rather than provide them with the gallup o&m agreement which might unecessarily complicate the certification process at that time
0
there is no basis in ferc regs or the nga for ferc to impose any type of penalty or discontinue the compression service due to tw's operation of kachina without the operational control agreement
no regs or law address this situation
again this is tempered by the fact that ferc was made aware of the arrangement and didn't ask any questions and the o&m agreement is in place to accomplish control for tw
0
i also faxed you a copy of section 0
c
of the nga which indicates that the petition for rehearing does not effect the status of the certificate
construction is moving ahead and the targeted start date is may 0
i will forward the filing tw made wrt to the operational control agreement as soon as i recieve it
let me know if you have any further questions
0
attached is the letter under which tw approved the power purchase agreement
i will forward an executed copy as well
please review the attached
i am still waiting on an answer from davis concerning section 0.0
it may need to be tweaked a little more
hi katie
i am feeling good about status of the deals
looks like we should close next wednesday
so as it stands now
i don't think i will have to work this weekend
of course now that i just said that
it almost positive that something will come up
hmmm
actually work might not be such a bad thing as my alternative is helping my roommate pack his stuff up for his move to north carolina
have a great weekend
talk to you soon
gerald
in the spirit of your previous email
check this one out
susan
attached is the amendment we discussed
we would like to execute this today
mark indicated that steve would sign today if everything looks ok
thanks for your help
susan
john
good to hear from you
things are going fine
there aren't really any parking garages close to the ballpark and getting near the ballpark on an open lot will be damn near impossible
i believe metro will be running a shuttle from open lots in downtown which are probably about 0 blocks away from the park
there are several of these lots around the enron building and smith and lousiana st
might be worth checking the either the metro web site or the enron field web site to get exact details on the shuttle routes
i believe the shuttle will drop off directly in front of the park
i received the nemec family reunion flyer recently

hi katie
that email was pretty true
school can be extremely stressful in short periods
around finals
but overall compared to work it was really a pretty easy lifestyle
how are thing's going for you with school
sounded like this month was going to be a busy one
the good thing about school is that there is a definite ending point with a break between
it has calmed down some around here
focusing on things that i had dropped during the end of quarter stretch
i bought a new guitar yesterday
my friend eric and i had our eye on this black fernandes model for some time and yesterday we decided to go for it
i am still in the learning stages of playing but it won't be too long before fame and stardom are at my disposal
well maybe a little longer than that
playing is really fun and a good stress reliever though
hope everthing is going well for you
take care

thanks
the construction agreement with the date information we discussed
sounds like you are running and gunning
i know how those times feel
seems like it is never going to end
you have been through it enough times to know that it always does
i don't think there is any feeling like turning in that last paper or walking out of that last final at the end of a semester
feels like a huge weight is lifted off your shoulders
after that comes lifting the huge mug filled with beer
hang in there
gerald
i lost the information concerning fly fishing you left on my voice mail
could you be so kind as to resend via email
i am thinking of just taking a poll to see what everyone's interest are

katie
glad i cheered you up
believe me
i can relate
i could tell you horror stories about when i was studying for the bar exam
i'll save those for some other time
hope all is going well and moving forward
what always kept me going was the idea that in a few days or a week it would all be over and i wanted to be able to look back and feel that i had given the best effort i could
that's all you can do
it is typically more than enough to do very well in grades
i will quit preaching now and let you get back to work
no big plans for the easter weekend
will be here in houston
i actually have to work on friday
but am thinking about taking a vacation day
sounds like you will probably be busy with school and family over your weekend in katy
but give me a call if you feel like it
maybe we can do something fun
this too shall come to pass

enitity name
you noted that trailblazer is a limited partnership
the name should designate limited partnership in some form
e.g
trailblazer pipeline company
l.p
also for an lp the general partner will need to sign to make it binding
the signature block should read as follows
trailblazer pipeline company
l.p
by its general partner

the limitation on consequential damages limits any remedy under this agreement

i received your fax concerning the season tickets
thanks for quick response
i thought given the short time frame i would just email with my information
if i could get 0 season tickets in my name on the east side lower deck toward the neuhaus athletic center
that would be my preference
lisa
indicated you wouldn't be able to know what seats might be available until you got all the responses back
if you could email with the seats you have available prior to charging my credit card
i would greatly appreciate it
if the only seats you have would be worse than about the 0 yard line in the area i mentioned above
i have a friend who is a longhorn foundation member with 0 tickets in that area at about the 0 yard line
his name is patrick mcdonald
if possible that i could attach 0 more season tickets to his without affecting the location of his seats
that would be great also
i don't need ou tix
my credit card number is 0 0 0 0 expires 0/0/0 visa
if you really need the form filled out
just let me know and i will forward it
thanks for your help

permitting

those permits that ena would secure
and make ee&cc responsible for any others

cynthia
sorry about the way i left last night
but i needed to leave abruptly or i felt i would have lost it even more
you are right
this is a very difficult time in my life
however
i want you to know that you are a very special person to me
the more i get to know you the more i realize that we are very similar is so many ways and i think that is why we hit it off so well so very quickly
i wish i could throw everything i have into a relationship with you
but right now there is just too much anger
mistrust
and hurt in my emotions to allow that
all of these feelings result purely from a person i was so close with and trusted so dearly and who treated me worse than i could have imagined
these feelings have nothing to do with you and i am sure you likely don't understand it all fully
i am not sure i understand it fully
i fear i am making a big mistake
because i know you won't be available long
you have so much to offer
beautiful
intelligent
funny
and someone who can give as much to a relationship as you need from a relationship
all of these qualities made it so very easy to be taken with you when we orginally met
when i started sensing some of my destructive emotions
i freaked out because i knew we were becoming very close and it pained me to realize that i would hurt you
so i completely pulled back
thinking i should cut it now than risk making it harder in the future
believe me
it is not easy to stay away from you
because even though we have only known each other a short time
i miss you and think about you a lot
it would be hard to still see you and know you were dating others because i know i would react strongly as you witnessed at senor frogs that night
my kidding you about lee
i will have to admit
also shows my insecurity about that
mexico was so wonderful
because
except for that one night
i was able to put all of those emotions out of my mind and just focus on you
i think that is why we had such a great time
cynthia
when we were together on that trip
i felt a lightness that i haven't felt in a long time
you looked so beautiful and sexy in that swimsuit by the bar
and it was all about us and nothing else
i have been through it enough to know that reality of my situation creeps back eventually
cynthia you are such a great person and even just typing this note i feel like crying
sometimes fate is a wonderful thing and sometimes it feels like a cruel joke
i think the timing of our meeting was ill fated
i know we will talk to and see each other again but i know it will be different now
as much as i want to hold on to you
i know its stupid to attempt to keep you close and yet at some distance
you have are too smart and have too much to offer to put up with that
please know that i do have genuine feelings for you and i miss you
gerald
susan
attached is the supplement to the gas letter which increases the amount of gas tw delivers to the llc

does this day match the gas day for the interstate pipelines
if not will this cause problems in scheduling
0
general comment
does this interruptible agreement provide the level of service that this power plant will commercially require
hattiesburg can interrupt service at any time at its discretion and furthermore
never provide service under this agreement by indicating to caledonia that its storage capacity is full with other storage committments
does this work

thanks
how is it going out there brother
been keeping your sanity while living at home
things here are about the same
talked to your boy tree the other day
he had some interesting new developments in his love life
of course they were sordid and made me somewhat uncomfortable
well sort of
your furniture is still almost completely intact
the longer you stay out there
the better my chances of picking up some furniture real cheap
haven't seen that much of janel lately
she went out to florida this weekend to convince a gay guy that the opposite sex is not icky after all
should make for some interesting stories when she returns
drop me a note when you get a chance
talk at you later
check out the attached response from marathon concerning our revisions
i guess this is a new negotiation technique
just ignore the counterparty's concerns
let's discuss this before i call brad back
thanks
richard
the attached resume is from an attorney who is a friend of an associate here at enron
i had worked with the associate before but don't know his friend
i told the associate that i wasn't sure of our hiring needs
but that i would pass the resume along
barbara indicated you were our recruiting coordinator
so here it is
lori
thanks for the diskettes
the one disk did have the final version of the agreements
the other disk had earlier versions of the docs
i will use the final versions to develop the amended and restated agreements
should have drafts for br's review later this week
do you want these diskettes returned
i talked to shonnie about any amendments to the llc and capacity allocation agreements
and she wasn't aware of any
i don't think those 0 agreements were revised unless you have other information
let me know
thanks
gerald please respond to lmarlatt
lauri
per my voicemail
the attached docs outline the elements for comparable shippers in the railroad commissions eyes
richard
i wouldn't worry about a letter
it was a very informal submittal
i will let my associate friend know
thanks
i have reviewed your response and disagree with the characterization of our modification the documents
i would like to clarify our reasons for the modifications to avoid any further miscommunications
megs
alteration of the documents do not impair the protections afforded to marathon under the production handling agreement
our modifications were simply intended to allocate certain risks between megs and mariner with respect to marathon
as operator of the south pass 0 b platform
as such risks were intended to be allocated by megs and mariner
mariner's transfer of interest in the flowline to megs introduces a new party which marathon can look to for certain obligations with respect to the platform
the alterations do not remove mariner from its current role as operator and maintainer of the flowline and owner of the hydrocarbons
for these reasons
i would disagree with your response that the draft alterations do not provide the intended protections that marathon would expect absent such a transfer to megs
mariner still shoulders these risks and expenses under the production handling agreement
having megs fully ratify the production handling agreement and becoming jointly and severally liable to marathon is not appropriate
megs does not hold title to any hydrocarbon production or operate the facilities and should not be liable for all risks and expenses associated therewith
mariner should continue to shoulder those risks and as before
i would be happy to discuss your issues with our platform lease revisions at your convenience or to discuss the above further
i had actually called you before i had seen this email
i wasn't involved in the nox emissions deal
i don't think legal was involved at all
at least from a compression services perspective
mark courtney was the deal maker for compression services and i believe that john scarborough
an analyst was also involved
let me know if you can do lunch tommorrow and i can tell you exactly how exciting my weekend was
see ya
attached is a clean and redlined version of the capacity allocation and expansion determination agreement
i will follow with the llc and administrative manager agreement
however those changes will be minor
the substance is in this agreement
gt
looks like i will be hitting town on saturday morning
eric and his wife will be with me
we will come by your house in the morning
probably around 0 am or so to group up
let me know if everything is still a go for you this weekend
i will probably need directions to your house again
i don't remember how to get there from the last time
do you have any type of pro forma agreement that she refers to
attached is marathon's response to our email
i will call brad to set up a telephone conference
ted
steve asked that i forward this information to a lawyer at burlington
but couldn't recall the name
do you have any contact information for burlington
thanks

please see attached
thanks
attached is the draft ca for intergen
note that there are still several blanks in the agreement that i need information to complete
please review and let me know if you have any questions
greg
attached is correspondence between marathon and enron
megs
concerning the revised draft of the lease that i had forwarded for marathon's review and also to you for mariner's review
i wanted to give you the benefit of these discussion we have had with marathon concerning how the megs and mariner's responsibilities should be split
our intent with these revisions
and the our goals as we continue to work with marathon on these issues is to simply allocate the risks between mariner and megs with respect to marathon
as mariner and megs intended them to be allocated under the o&m agreement between the two
we are not asking marathon to rely on the o&m agreement to which they are not a party
risk associated with ownership of the flowline should run to megs and risk associated with the operation and maintenance of the flowline and ownership of the hydrocarbons should run to mariner as they currently do under the production handling agreement
we intend to work with marathon toward this end
if you have any comments concerning these discussions or would like to discuss this further with me
please contact me at

i would also be interested in any comments you may have with respect to the draft lease agreement i forwarded to you earlier

please note the following
0
the changes include those that chris and i discussed in denver
the capacity allocation agreement is redlined against the version br had reviewed earlier
all other docs
are redlined against the originals
0
due to the credit agreement structure
portions of the natural gas fuel liquidation concept were placed into the administrative services agreement
this was done in order to allow that portion of the natural gas fuel value which covers the power bill to be included in the debt service coverage ratio calcs in the credit agreement
the remainder of the natural gas fuel will be distributed under the capacity allocation agreement to avoid the inclusive of these excess amounts in any distribution tests under the credit agreement
0
since more significant changes were made to the admin
services agreement
it is now being amended and restated

i have also attached the tw gas letter agreement which i had forward earlier
these are all the operational docs
required for the amendment
for completeness
attached are the operational documents that reflect the gallup amendments

the confirms to the existing enfolio deals reflect the value for the gas which flows from enron north america corp
to enron compression services corp
and finally to the llc
the confirms done with the original gallup transaction are not being amended
new confirms are being added to handle the incremental gas from tw
please let me know if you have any questions

let me know if you have any questions
thanks
attached are the redlined revised docs and a new letter agreement for the payment of the $0 mil
dan
i have reviewed the wildhorse
mesa
gathering
processing
and transport agreement
this agreement is still valid and the gas is dedicated to this agreement through 0
the agreement present some problematic issues which i will outline
0
gas quality
the gas quality provisions only require wildhorse to transport the gas if the gas meets the downstream carriers
in this case northwest pipeline
gas quality specifications
we propose to put in a treating plant which would allow the gas to meet the specifications
however there are no provision in this agreement which allow us to insert a plant between northwest pipeline and wildhorse
wildhorse could delay are extract value from us for this connection
this is an uncertainty
0
wildhorse obligation to perform
based on my understanding of the facts
at some point during the term of this agreement
northwest pipeline enforced their gas quality specifications and refused to take the gas at the downstream side of wildhorse's gathering system
as a result
wildhorse shut in enogex's production and it has been shut in ever since
wildhorse has a right to do this under this agreement
see #0 above
and therefore wildhorse has not breached its obligation to transport under this agreement
wildhorse's obligation was suspended when northwest refused receipt of the gas
0
unprofitability
assuming wildhorse worked with us to install the treating plant which conformed the gas to northwest specifications
they could refuse to provide gathering service under this agreement if it was still uneconomical for them to do so
if they decided it is uneconomical for them to do so
they have the right to provide enogex with various potential solutions which include
i
renegotiating the terms
ii
allowing enogex to operate wildhorse's equipment at enogex sole cost
expense and risk
or
iii
release the gas from the agreement
the problem here is that there is no time limit under which wildhorse must reach a solution with us and no specific solution they must reach
wildhorse could drag this out for some extended period of time and they could extract significant value
my recommendation is that we make enogex's resolution of these issues with wildhorse a condition precedent to closing and funding this deal
i know the timing is late
however if enron funds this deal and takes on the risk of negotiating with wildhorse to resolve either a new deal or a release of the gas
everyone needs to understand that such negotiation could take substantial time and wildhorse will have significant leverage
let me know if you wish to discuss this further or have any questions
have a great trip and try not to hook up with too many italian hotties
must come back with lots of pictures and potentially a few life changing experiences
attached are executables for the hubbard transaction
heidi
attached is the modified confirm form
please note the following
0
this will only work with an interruptible all points master contract 0
this confirm cannot extend the term of a transport agreement
we need to make sure that the master is still in its term
0
the counter
party should sign off for every transaction
via fax signature is acceptable
0
a single form per contract must be used
0
this form is set up for 0 month or less deals
we need to make sure this confirm can be handle under the existing global contract # for the master contract
please review and let me know if you have any questions
fyi
attached is marathon's response
check's in the mail
sorry for the delay
i will review today
chris attached is a clean and redline version of the gregg agreement with my revisions
the form gregg sent was the original form they had forwarded for the first project
i change to reflect the change we made at that time
as you will notice it is quite a few changes
however
since gregg signed off on this form once already
they shouldn't have a problem doing it again
let me know if you have any questions
i reviewed the draft you forwarded
looks good
i have the following two questions
section 0.0
the fourth sentence down in the parenthesis
whether owned or leased by lessee
shouldn't that read
whether owned
operated
or leased by lessee
since mariner only operates the property for megs
term
shouldn't the term mirror the term for the production handling agreement
section 0.0.0.e allows termination after january 0
0
why would marathon want to terminate while the pha is still in effect
sounds good
pencil me in
of course this won't be as nice as going fishing to catch those small fish
eric
can you pull the ferc document cited below and print it out
here is the other one
attached is the cite you forwarded earlier
here is the other cite
will
sharon left a voice mail indicating that you could set me up with a set of clubs on saturday
that sounds great
i will plan on playing with you guys tomorrow
thanks
i will review and get back to you by no later than tommorrow
marlene
i am not sure what you are asking me to do
if these contracts are active then they should be put into whatever is the proper contract tracking system for these types of services contracts
transport
pooling
etc
if they are not active and are of no value
then they probably should not be put into the database
however
this is not a legal question
but a business question
if the business decision is made that they are of no value and inactive
then they should be terminated in accordance with their terms
let me know if i am missing the point of your question
if i am not
then i will return these contracts to you
kay
please see attached
thanks
ruth
attached is a redline with my revisions
i will be forwarding two hard copies of the revisions to your attention
i will have my comments to you by tomorrow shortly after lunch
dan and teresa
attached is the form of declaration of managing member under which crescendo appoints ena to exclusively negotiate a gathering deal with wildhorse
please review
teresa
do you think we need to get the class b member approval also for this appointment of ena as representative
the llc agreement is open with respect to the managing member delegating its duties
dan or ward
please note that the crescendo llc agreement section 0.0 indicates that if the managing member request the class c member
enron
to provide certain financial or technical services
then class c member may do so for market based rates
is it the intention that enron be reimbursed for any commercial or engineering services it provides to the llc such as negotiating with wildhorse or project management of the plant construction
see attached
sorry for the delay

confidential work material
attorney client privilege attached for review is a draft of the letter to be sent to wildhorse concerning the gathering agreement under which the entrada and dakota production is committed
please review and provide comments
to summarize activities to date concerning this gathering agreement
0
conducted a conference call with brett frie on wednesday
brett also forwarded some correspondence between enogex and wildhorse
the correspondence contained a summary of meeting minutes for two meetings conducted between enogex and wildhorse
no demands were made by enogex and no claims of unprofitability were made by wildhorse
brett stated that the entrada and to some extent the dakota gas were shut in or curtailed because the downstream carriers starting enforcing their tighter gas specifications
enogex took wildhorse's word for that and never checked with northwest or questar
i asked brett why he thought wildhorse would straight away release the gas
he responded that he thought they would do so only if crescendo negotiated an alternative arrangement with wildhorse
0
i received more correspondence on friday from ken krisa
nothing really useful
there was a letter from wildhorse to another producer in the area called lone mountain production company which stated that wildhorse thought these assets were in a state of economic viability decline
unfortunately this letter was not directed to enogex
however
the draft letter takes that position with wildhorse
0
i am securing local consul out of denver
i want someone intimately familiar with utah and colorado law from a litigation and timing perspective to be involved
we may need to seek a declaratory order
we have run into to conflicts with law firm that have represented either kn or tom brown
should have this resolved on monday
0
agreed to language on friday with ken krisa and jim osborne and the declaration by crescendo giving power to ena to negotiate with wildhorse
this draft does state our desire to pursue a release of the gas
however
to reiterate
based on the current facts we do not have a black and white right to deem this gas as released under the gathering agreement
the fact that the entrada gas is not in spec
with the downstream pipelines for inerts
allows wildhorse to suspend their receipt of this gas without being in default
joan
the contract states that wildhorse only has to accept gas from crescendo that the downstream carriers will accept
per brett frie at enogex
the entrada production is 0% nitrogen
until the plant is up and running
this gas will not meet any of the downstream carriers specs
i am not sure how we get the nitrogen out of the gas stream without the plant
the dakota production was not mentioned in the letter
because i have no facts about the gas quality of this gas
you had forwarded emails last week indicating the dan reineke was to take samples at the wellhead and downstream of wildhorse's plant
once we have these facts we can send a letter concerning the dakota
do you have any info on these samples
have you worked your way back into the real world yet or are you still adjusting
this week has been pretty busy already and it is only tuesday
want to try and hook up for lunch tomorrow
let me know how your schedule looks
here is the term sheet
chris can you give me a complete list of counterparties
with pricing and volume information for each counterparty
tomorrow at noon sounds good
i have primarily been working on denver stuff
although a new project up in denver
one that i wish i hadn't gotten involved in
i also need to hit the gym
been thinking about taking kick boxing lessons
a good way to take out aggression
attached is my draft revised term sheet for the producer purchase agreements
let me know if you have any comments
forgot to copy you on the original dist
my thought is just to take all this language out and solely leave us on out if we don't get the transport for any reason under the terms of the precedent agreement
counterparty might not go for it
but it would clear this issue up
attached is the latest version of the wildhorse entrada letter
please review
i reviewed the letter with jim osborne and ken krisa yesterday and should get their comments today
my plan is to fedex to midland for ken's signature tomorrow morning and from there it will got to wildhorse
please review
thanks
short and sweet

stop it
you're scaring me

let me know if you need anything else

also when is tw expecting the payment to be wired
need that date
fyi
attached is the final version of the letter that was sent to wildhorse
attached is the latest set of documents which have minor revisions based on my discussions with chris last week
these have been only redlined against the prior version
not the original versions
let me know if you want redlines against the original docs
the llc was not included as no changes were made from the versions already forwarded
with respect to the cash out imbalance procedures
the administrative services agreement
exhibit b
currently has a rough procedure for such cashout
it is also written such that the members can adopt a new procedure at any time
if the current procedures are not sufficient
it probably make the most sense to have only a working draft
approved by the members
of procedures in place until we have a few month of operations under our belt to work out the bugs
scott sitter will be developing this draft
the development of these procedures can be done outside these current revisions
a final imbalance procedure would be adopted by written action of the members upon development of those final procedures
let me know if you have any questions
i will be out the 0th and 0th
arvel
i received your pressure data
unfortunately the contract pressure is assessed against the 0 year period prior to the effective date of the contract which is oct

also
did we receive any quality information on dakota production

wanted to check and see if you guys were able to find any pressure data on wildhorse for the period of 0 years prior to the effective date of the gathering agreement

our letter was definitely structured to encourage a quick solution
as the situation stands now
wildhorse's possible responses to the letter are as follows
0
declare unprofitability wrt to the gas covered by the amendment
if they do so
then they have the obligation to provide alternatives to crescendo
one of which is release of the gas
you are right
there is no time frame in the contract under which they must resolve these alternatives
that is a risk i pointed out early
however
in our letter to wildhorse
i proposed a time frame to resolve these issue of 0 weeks
if wildhorse is not working with us in good faith within a commercially reasonable time then we will have to make a choice
a
go for a declaratory judgment to have the gas released from the contract
this will take time
depending on court docket loads
0 months to 0 year
b
inform wildhorse that we have been unable to reach an agreement within a commercially reasonable time and they have not negotiated in good faith and we consider the gas released
contract breached by wildhorse
and that we will build our own system
then crescendo would build its own system and risk a suit by wildhorse
0
not declare unprofitability if wildhorse does not declare unprofitability
then they have the obligation under the contract to take the gas in accordance with its terms
the only complication is that under the contract
wildhorse's obligation to take the gas is subject to the downstream carriers ability to receive the aggregate gas stream
depending on wildhorse's flow dynamics and our plant placement
wildhorse could use this as reason to refuse delivery of our gas
after your field meeting and our engineering assessment
hopefully we will have a better understanding of that situation
if wildhorse does not declare unprofitability
we would demand evidence and assurances that they will be able to take the gas upon start up of the treating plant
if wildhorse does not declare unprofitability
but continues to discuss renegotiating of this deal
i would very directly ask them
under what provision of the contract do they believe they have the right to renegotiate any fees
they don't have a right to renegotiate under the contract without unprofitability
chris

criminy
little seattle lingo
have i been busy this week
looking forward to the weekend to chill out a little
no big plans but to enjoy the college football extravaganza on saturday
maybe grill some beast depending on the weather and partake of a few sodas
it has been raining here all week which is good
because at least it isn't 0 degrees out
my clients in denver wanted a full download on all my cabo activities
these are the guys who have been to cabo several times including the 0/0 club
as a matter of fact
the project i am working on right now for these guys is called project 0/0
coincidence
i don't think so
anyway
when i told them i met this girl who went to 0/0 with me
they were very impressed
they now hold me in higher esteem than before
at least that's one way to gain the respect of your clients
so how is the great northwest
have your told grandparents about the wonderful time you had in cabo with some strange guy walking around in your shoes
some details are probably better left out
i am about out of here
take care and i will talk to you later

but it redlined the whole list
the only change of substance added was a new wyoming dot road crossing permit to maverick
also taken off were references to the documents that have been prepared and sent to gillette
that information was contained in brackets and began
see attached
that information was for the right of way agents in gillette so that they knew what documents had been prepared for them
please let me know if you have any questions
attached are clean versions of the 0/0 schedules

however
what does a flight to florida cost
i need to factor that in as well

i am trying to get tickets to the game this year and will probably go
i will check with my bro

hi katie
sorry it has taken awhile to respond
i have been out of town for awhile
good to hear from you again
i understand about the summer
sometimes we get so busy and it seems like weeks go by without noticing
i had a good summer
my little sister got married up in estes park
colorado in august
estes is a neat little town near rocky mountain national park
i spent four days up there
my whole family made the trip
so that was cool
the weather up there is awesome
i played around of golf and i don't think it ever got above about 0 degrees
they had the reception at the stanley hotel
this hotel was where stephen king was staying when he got the inspiration to write the shining
no weird events occurred at the reception though
i also just got back about 0 weeks ago from cabo san lucas
i spent 0 days down there with some friends
scuba diving
fishing
beach
drinking
and dancing
not necessarily in that order though
i was a little worried about being down there for that long
but it was great once i got used to partying till 0 am and sleeping til noon
enron is going well
we just closed another big deal last week
so the pressure is off for now again
there will surely be another next quarter
can't wait
i feel for you concerning statistics
actually that was one of the courses that gave me the most problems in engineering school
i must admit i probably didn't try as hard as i should have
i just hated the course so much that i just wanted to get it over with
hang in there
you will get through it
is this your last semester
if i remember correctly
i thought you were going to graduate in december
it is really good to hear from you again
take care and drop me a note when you get a chance
gerald
attached is a revised nomination letter incorporating comments received
please review
hi dee
i am really sorry to hear about your brother's child
i hope everything with you and your family is as well as it can be right now
i will say a prayer for yall
i am doing good
staying busy with work as you suggested
actually we closed our big deal last thursday
that will allow my hours to become somewhat more normal in the near future
they are planning a trip to reward those who worked so hard on this deal
guess where
cabo
went to austin this past weekend to watch my beloved longhorns play
they won
fortunately
it was good to see some old friends and hang out
i wouldn't mind moving back to austin
but the jobs there just don't pay as much as in houston
everyone wants to stay in austin after school
so they can lowball you on the cash
looking forward to the pictures
need to refresh my memory of cabo
take care and talk to you later
a redlined version with my changes
let me know if you have any questions
barbara
i put hard copies of these documents in your chair
attached is a rough draft of a response letter to wildhorse concerning the nominations

gt
i think i will probably come in tonight since the game is so early
are you guys going to try and buy tickets at the gate for bb
email back with your phone numbers
so i can call if anything changes
talk at ya later

it really breaks my heart to see the once great web master fall so far

the pictures were very amusing
thanks for sending those along
looks like you guys hung out quite a bit with the neighbors
i especially like the candid shot of me in my tommy hilfiger's
whoa
got to start working out and shed the love handles
i thought there would be more shots of squid roe since that is where you guys hung out most of the time
looks like your mariners made the playoffs
i really don't follow texas but i do follow the astros
i think everybody is just happy the season is over with so we can forget it as quickly as possible
the astros were pretty horrible this year
hope you are doing well
did you keep julie and angie out of trouble this weekend
i know that is probably impossible
thanks for the pics again and i'll talk to you later
gerald
i would call kent and ask about this
i would also remind him about our request for the pressure data in the september 0 letter and their obligations to keep pressures at the average pressure for the 0 year period prior to the effect date of the agreement
mark
we also need you to keep notes
with dates and times
of all your discussions and communications with wildhorse
dan
has been preparing his notes and you may want to just add onto his notes
dan
i also need to get a copy of your notes when you get a chance
davis
this actually sounds frighteningly like my experience at the big 0 game
however
just because i at one time worked at the posse doesn't mean my character should continue to be called into question
fyi
the call to kinder may not be needed

short flight
very cheap

i do have a trip to spain planned for november
some friends and i will be going over the thanksgiving week

houston pipe line company

we will be getting back with you on the site access agreement
mark
attached are riders to be added to the cig confidentiality agreement
please forward these for review to the proper persons at coastal
let me know if you have any questions
we should again nominate to nwpl
in our nomination we can state that if wildhorse again wrongfully rejects our nom to nwpl
we then nominate to questar solely to mitigate damages
i can draft the appropriate letter
joan or ken
will the nominations be done via the web site
do we have the information to nominate to nwpl via the website
ken
please respond to kckrisa

how does tomorrow afternoon look for you
about 0:0 pm
wednesday works for me
morning would be a good time for me
ken
our position has been that wildhorse doesn't have the right to curtail our volumes since we have a first que position
we could draft the letter such that we demand to send 0% of our gas to nwpl
in the event that wildhorse would only accept noms
0%
or some portion
of this gas to nwpl
we would nominate the remainder to questar to mitigate wildhorse's damages
once they accept the nom to nwpl
they have a first que obligation to move it there
from a practical standpoint
if wildhorse curtailed us to nwpl
to our protest
after they had accepted our noms
i understand this would cause problems
however
if we nominate gas to questar when wildhorse is willing to accept a nom to nwpl
we would potentially be waiving damages there
ken
please respond to kckrisa
hi janel
we have a couple of things on the agenda
friday night is fastball at the engine room
we plan on meeting on w
alabama ice house prior to the show
doors open at 0 pm so we will probably be at the ice house around 0 ish for free dogs and cold beer
saturday is the buzz monster mash with the toadies
some placed called americas near enron field
never heard of it
there are about 0 other bands
vallejo
and two others i can't remember
show starts at 0 pm
tickets are still available for both shows through ticketmaster
there are about 0 to 0 people going
including myself and eric as the foundation
if you guys are interested in either or both
more people would be kickin
let me know
no acid rock
just good easy listening tunes
fastball had the hit about 0 years ago called the way
toadies

under-paid and fairly disinterested attorneys
i would be happy to handle this
unless you want to
let me know
thanks
can you place these on my calendar please
thanks
dave
attached is a rough draft of the letter we discussed

hi sophie
i like the sound of the trifle described in your email to mark
i will have extra sherry on mine
how is it going
i had a great time at the party in austin and hanging with you at the brown bar
i am not sure what i was thinking toward the end of the evening by mixing tequila and cranberry
but i guess you have to get creative when the circumstances require
i was moving a little slow the next day and drive back to houston wasn't quite as pleasant
did you have a good weekend
i didn't do anything real exciting for the weekend before halloween
went to a concert that had 0 bands
one of them is a band from austin called vallejo
heard of them
now tell me the truth
do you really like yorkshire pudding
drop me a line when you get a chance

working on some products for enron's b0b internet trading site

the site was actually developed out of our london office
enron house is right next door to buckingham palace
some other trading deals as well
i usually get a pretty mixed bag of projects to work
it has been very busy the last couple of days
sophie therapy
that sounds extremely interesting
is it good for most of your normal life crisis type issues
i might need some now and again
i know you probably told at the party
but as you remember my mental state was not clearest it could have been
are you a student at ut law
forgive me for my mental lapses
ok
i have had yorkshire pudding and all i remember was a bland bread type substance
now the beef
vegetables
and potatoes sounds good to me but not sure about the yorkshire
might help to wash it down with a nice pint

i was just checking your story to make sure it was consistent with what you told me that night
everything seems to be in order
good
if we did sign it prior to getting bank approval
we would likely have to make the wic portion of the release
subject to the bank approval
otherwise huber could be put into the position of having the obligations but being unable to complete it obligation due to a wic process out of huber's control
but assuming that was done
i don't see why we couldn't sign the agreement now
i haven't answered him yet
i just plan to let him know that the contracts should be executed next week with the capacity release to occur thereafter
any thoughts
mike
still working on it
should have a draft by late monday or tuesday

that is it
i don't know the how and when
but i intend to devote the rest of my life to bringing down stoops and the ou football program
you will rue the day my friend
i will remove the open season reference
some pipeline tariffs do refer to open season for capacity release

the terms you referenced are defined in the product description
the eol access agreement makes it clear that the product description is binding on the counterparty
attached are a redlined revised version of the gtc and the product description based on our comments discussions of the previous versions
carlos

we have gotten approval of the assignment form from the pipeline and expect to execute the assignments and capacity release documents with huber next week
the capacity release document just specifies the details of the capacity release
huber is bound by the 0nd transaction to accept our release
i will let you know when these sets of documents are executed
let me know if you have any questions
i am composing this as we speak
should have a draft shortly
carlos
made one change
wanted to be clear that buyer's bid shall reflect the contract price
period of delivery etc

i do work for enron
i am an attorney for enron north america in gas and power origination
i actually worked with some attorney's from v&e on a couple of asset financing deals we did about a year ago

joel ephross also worked on those deals
but he is now at enron in our global finance legal group
sounds like you have worked alot on enron deals

this old house
second
the style of my hair is not a pomp
as you
commoners
like to refer
once we arrive in madrid
the madrilenos will recognize me at once as royalty and i should be running that country inside of 0 days

i left a question about the cash-out index
please let me know what is appropriate
miyako sounds great
why don't we meet there at 0:0
i didn't get to know terry that well
i was pretty green at that point
that was actually the first deal i worked on when i got to legal
i went to law school a little later in life
i have been practicing for about 0 years
terry reminded me of an absent minded professor
he had this pair of glasses that during the course of the deal
they became more and more broken down
by the end
one of the ear pieces was missing and they barely stayed on his face
at the closing dinner enron bought him a new pair of glasses
south america
that sounds pretty interesting
ever travel down there

i have not received this back yet

an agency agreement to you a couple of weeks ago
the agreement appointed ena as crescendo's agent to nominate and resolve allocations and imbalances on wildhorse's system
wanted to see if you have reviewed and executed yet
attached is a letter to wildhorse consenting to the assignment of crescendo's gathering agreements from wildhorse to tom brown
the letter reserves all our rights for wildhorse's breach
also attached is a letter for december nominations into questar reserving our rights
please review and provide any comments

only checked it for form and not substance since i didn't have the agreement to which it is referring
attached is the letter
please review
i am still giving it one read over

hi mb
not sure if you are in the office this week
but if you are
wanted to see if you would want to meet for a drink after work today
mark
i reviewed the csa for our obligations
they are as follows
0
ecs will work with the utility in good faith to establish the online monitoring automatic load controlling system for the no
0 schedule
0
if the online system can not be established
then ecs will work with tw to develop a manual system to accomplish the same
ecs will keep tw whole on any costs for incremental manpower required for such manual system
this provision was written very generally
i have reviewed the oneok westex transmission agreement
the only comment i have is that the daily balance cashout requirements in section f of the general terms and conditions seem very burdensome
this is really a business call
but the 0% tolerance or cashout everyday might be difficult to maintain
i will leave that to you to decide stacey
i am ok with everything else
no problem
i figured you weren't feeling well
sorry to hear that you are still sick
you might want to call the doc
i have been able to described my symptoms to her before and she usually calls in a prescription for me
antibiotics or similar
good luck with global markets
sounds like you had a lot of good opportunities
i think you will learn a lot by trading which will make you a better originator if you ever want to go back to origination
i am pretty open right now for lunch

i will circulate the letter for review by the group before sending
attached is my revised letter
please call with any questions
attached is a clean and redlined version with my changes
please note the following
0
i added back the limitation on damage provision i originally had
we need to be clear that the remedies specified in the amendment are the only remedies

the amendment for the powder river contract should reflect the same
please contact me at
0
0-0 if you would like to discuss

i also added a 0 day window during which enap must provide the data to enron
please review and let me know if you have any questions

ken
where are we on this
jack
attached is the release
settlement
and termination agreement we discussed
please review and let me know if you have any questions
lauri
from a legal standpoint
we can cut the nomination on an interruptible agreement at our discretion
the contract clearly gives us this right
i haven't specifically reviewed the contract
but i am assuming it is our standard form
i will check this
yes
i would consider hisd facilities to be state facilities
the fact that this goes to entex first complicates the issue
dan
was the intent that it be directly delivered to state facilities
or if it ultimately ended up at state facilities
i'll check the global database to see if i can find it
did shonnie paper that purchase agreement
lauri
i reviewed the contract with tglo
it is a standard interruptible form
so we should have no issues with interruption of the gas flows
i also talked further with dan concerning the contract
we feel that the agreement strictly refers to facilities that are directly operated by the state
e.g
universities and prisons
and not school districts
thus
we would consider hisd to not be state facilities
this argument is not a slam dunk
but we should probably take this approach and see how they react
the contract also refers to gas
destined
for state facilities
so the fact that the gas goes through another pipeline before being delivered to a state facility does not matter
it ultimately is
destined
for state facilities
thanks for the note
i am also glad we got to know each other this year
we will have to make time to hang out next year
now that your lsat is over
have fun in denver and be careful of who you hang out with up there

attached is a further revision of the capacity release doc
the comments are from counsel in the calgary office
all the comments are consistent with the intent of the prior documents
they mainly make the canada section symmetric to the ena section
please review
attached are clean versions of the most up to date documents
the confirm also includes a redline copy with the changes we discussed this morning
please note that calpine needs to execute the following documents
0
capacity release and assignment agreement 0

the confirm

nope
didn't piss me off
i know how to interpret mandy talk
i just have been extremely busy
most of the other attorneys are gone and i am catching all their overflow
the days off were mellow
went to corpus christi to see the family
usually holiday cheer
how about you
attached is latest version
due to quick turnaround
there may be a few julie
gerald and i will be present
talk to you then
please review and let me know your thoughts on their comments
the mac section will come out
so disregard those comments
attached please find revisions per our conference call

sec vii
re
mac
based on your quick feedback
we will send execution documents electronically so janet can initial
please call me at gerald's office if you have any questions
regards
stephanie
per janet's request
attached for your review is the final form of assignment
the only change from the prior version is that the renewal notice section was changed to reflect that ecc will renew unless calpine notifies ecc otherwise
this was a point negotiate with calpine
we plan on executing these tommorrow morning
attached are the executables
please note the a redline of the capacity release and assignment agreement is also included
i cleaned up references to the renewal notification
which are now the non-renewal notification
that were missed earlier in article 0 and article 0
please note the exhibit d of the enfolio master also needs to be signed by
thanks for your help and quick response on those comments
brant
attached is a clean and redlined guaranty with the changes we agreed upon
we still need hess
address for the notice section
sorry about the delay
dwight
attached is a form o&m agreement that was recently used on power project in the us
this form is very similar to the one you forwarded steve
but is more detailed in the scope of services to be performed
there are performance bonuses and penalties for electricity output
we would have to add the steam output
should be very similar
i think this form can be turned around to coogentrix fairly quickly once we establish what the performance standards to be met are
i will be out of the office on jan.0 but will be back on wednesday
please review
i apologize for not getting back with you yesterday or today
but unfortunately the calpine capacity assignment has to be signed today and it has consumed my time
thanks
brian
mark forward the executed docs
to me
the trailblazer assignment was not included
i have attached the assignment in case you don't have the one i forwarded earlier
please execute and return
also the amended and restated transaction no
0 was initialled
but was not executed
i am forwarding those back to you for execution
thanks for your cooperation
robin
attached is the revised letter
i added that enron north america corp
was performing these efforts
if an entity other than ena has the contract with gordonsville
the letter should be changed to reflect the proper entity
i removed the discussion concerning demand for cover from citgo
per our discussion
we don't have that right under the contract
and since our contract is best efforts
gordonsville doesn't have the right to demand cover
i think this letter should be strictly a notice out of curtesy to gordonsville
i am going to be leaving
but you can call my cell phone if you have any questions

barbara

please let me know if you have any questions

i also wanted to clarify a point on the tom brown form of gathering agreement
the revised form is an interruptible agreement with no acreage dedication
since tom brown removed all the acreage dedication language
it is my understanding that they were not willing to give us an acreage dedication
to the extent we modeled our economics on any tom brown production
i wanted to make sure everyone understands that these volumes are not committed to the system we are purchasing and can be taken by tom brown to someone else at their discretion
per your voice mail
attached is the tbi proposal as revised

mark
i talked with jeff stone this morning concerning the petition
the petition did not get filed on friday as planned
jeff had left for tallahassee prior to the fedex arriving on friday morning
they also wanted to have katz-kutter
our counsel in fla
sign the transmittal letter for the petition prior to sending
this way the petition is sent by the customer and not the utility
bill bryant at katz-kutter was unavailable fri
jeff assured me that they will get this filed today
i asked him to call me once filed
we need to start thinking about the best way to approach wfec after this petition is filed
it sounds like alabama electric cooperative is the way to approach this
do we know someone in our power trading group who works with aec
might be useful to approach it through that relationship
ernie
how is it going
did you have a good weekend
i actually had to work for part of it
so my weekend wasn't all that great
were you able to book a room for me
wanted to be sure that was taken care of

andrew
attached is a rough draft of the csa
i am still reviewing the version
but it is substantially correct
in the interest of time i am forwarding this for your review
please note section 0.0
i am a little concerned about this section from a retail wheeling standpoint
i am trying to find local counsel in pa to review this section
please review and lets discuss
mark
please review my attached change to the confirm
this makes it clear that if we don't like their changes to the master we will not accept them and the existing master still governs
if acceptable i will forward back to aec
russell
aec is reviewing the master and indicated they would have comments within a week or so
the plan is now to execute this confirm and follow up with the new master
the credit language that was in the earlier version has been removed
i know
it seems as though mr
rudy is in love
so damned the consequences
how are you doing
work treating you okay
how is the law school application going
my dearest barbara
i long for the time when i can gaze into your lovely golden brown eyes and lose myself in your innate beauty
the sheer black leather rockies revealing your strong athletic form tonight will be a wonderful memory upon which i can call upon to see me through any of life's most challenging obstacles
sigh
i plan on leaving for the magical journey tonight as soon as humanly possible
for who can think of work when one so lovely as barbara awaits
i can take journey upon my green camry steed to pluck the lovely young ms
waldrop from those two known as steve and gina
and we will abound on towards fate
perchance it might be best for barbara to come seek me out
as i am adrift without direction to the place where steve and gina reside

as of the closing
the permanent assignment/release from enron north america corp
to calpine of
i
that certain precedent agreement for firm transportation service between enron north america corp
and kern river dated _______
0
the
precedent agreement
and/or
ii
any firm transportation agreements entered into in accordance with the precedent agreement
i
and
ii
collectively referred to as the
kern transport
such that kern river
a
agrees to look solely to calpine for all obligations with respect to the kern transport and
b
unconditionally releases ena from all obligations for demand/reservation charges
and all other charges related to the kern transport
obviously there is still the risk that if calpine doesn't close or meet kern river's credit requirements
then ena is still left holding this contract

russell
i am still reviewing
we are light this week on attorney's due to spring break and i am catching a lot of overflow
i will try to get through it as soon as possible
brant
attached is clean and redlined copy of the revised credit services agreement with bridgeline
i made significant revisions to this document
in general the document was very thin and needed to be reinforced to provide a more detailed deal arrangement
please review and if credit is ok
i am fine to send this to bridgeline
please note that i did leave an open question on the fee structure
the agreement currently provides for a flat fee of $0,0 per month for the services
do we need to be reimburse for any third party expenses to perform the services or would all services be internal and included in the flat fee
need to establish this before we send out to bridgeline
let me know if you have any questions
you are so cool
i can't believe that the person in that picture with the biggest rock band of all time
was in my bed last night
wow
everyday i found something out that just makes me want you more and more
ha ha ha how is ms
barbara doing today
i am weary from the pile of other people's projects couched on top of my head but
i will survive
hey hey
i've lost the edge maverick
i am holding on too tight
in case you are not on your work email

jean
fyi
i have faxed the executed ca back to entergy concerning highland energy
they should be good to move forward with discussion
let me know if you need anything else
i forwarded your picture to eric and your little comment about you wanting to join quiet riot has sent shockwaves through the members of monkey pump
first of all
you haven't even been voted into the band yet
seems the chances are getting less likely with you already shopping your skills on the market
and now you already discussing new ventures
secondly
monkey pump is not a stepping stone
we are big time and those has beens
quiet riot
will wish for just a small portion of our fame and fortune
i guess this does add a new dimension to the much anticipated vh-0 behind the music
monkey pump episode
monkey pump was on its way
they were only 0 years away from their first album
but little did they know that the person who they weren't even really sure they wanted to be their lead singer
already had other designs on reviving a heavy metal icon from long ago
when we return on behind the music
eric and i will discuss this and get back with you
in the meantime we had better not see you at any photo ops with poison or warrant
mark
attached is the letter agreement we discussed
please review
it is rough
some issues to note
0
the kern pa cannot be assigned without their consent
which shall not be unreasonably withheld
if kern didn't like the fact that we are receiving assignment from 0 or 0 other shippers
they might withhold consent if they thought we were superceding their bid procedures
not sure if they would
but it is a risk
0
if the assignment is done after the producer executes the firm transport agreement
kern could require to capacity to be released via capacity release at max rate
0
i took a stab at the mark-to-market calculation
probably needs more substance though
lets discuss
attached for your review is a draft letter for third parties whom with we plan to participate in the kern river open season
barry asked that i forward to you as well for review
per steve's request
i am forwarding a phone number of a consulting company that produces maps which show all pipeline in texas
sorted by county
this might be a good place to start to find the pipeline you described in your voice mail to steve
the company is design technics corp
phone
0
0-0
the map will generally show where the pipeline runs
but it is depicted at more of a macro level
mary
attached is the list
let me know if you run into any problems
tyrell
i have made some revisions to the latest drafts of the letter agreement and your cover letter
please review
as i noted earlier
barry indicated he had some language that he wanted to revise concerning the mark to market
i have not been able to contact him yet
so unless mark and barry have talked
probably need to hold these until you or i hear from barry
also
if we are going to do any of these transaction with a canadian party
peter keohane and eric ledain need to comment on this form
i have sent them an earlier version and i am copying them here
i will be in a meeting until about 0:0 pm central and will be available after that
i again want to reiterate
that if the assignment takes place after the firm transport agreements are signed
kern could require the assignment to be done via the capacity release bidding procedures of their tariff
i noticed that one of the packages is less than 0 year in term
this means it could also be bid up in excess of max rate
anything over 0 year could only be bid to max rate
we may want to add a provision that to the extent the capacity is assigned via capacity release and it is bid up beyond max rate
ena will have no obilgation to take the capacity and make the mark to market payment
probably need to discuss this with mark
do you have addresses and fax numbers for these counterparties
attached is the latest draft for review
we plan on convening and 0 am central time to review and finalize
i should be talking to barry in about 0 minutes
and we will probably have a few more changes
add these two to the list
here is one more
great
thanks for all your help on this
brant
attached is a clean and redlined version of the revised agreement per our discussion
yes
i am alive
got in a little late
but still here nonetheless
deblah who
i am checking to see if anybody is up for tonight and i should know later this afternoon
i know we really need to have more drinks
its been so long
yes
i was serious about china
talked to eric this morning and they would leave on june 0 and return on june 0
i need to make sure this works with my work schedule
i think it would be really cool to see bejing
the great wall
etc
and hone my skills as show lin high priest martial arts badass
john
attached is the transco guaranty with further revisions
the following items of note were revised
0
transco added language stating that this is a performance guaranty
enron will only provide a payment guaranty
enron does not have the means to ensure performance by the llc
thus the language needs to clearly identify that this is a payment guaranty
as long as transco gets paid for the transport
i am not sure why this matters
0
transco would be able to collect interest for late payments under their tariff
putting late payment interest in the guaranty would give transco the ability to recover double interest on late payments
thus
the interest language in the guaranty was removed
please review the revised guaranty
i would be happy to discuss these issues with transco's attorney's at their convenience
let me know if you have any questions
thanks

kern river expansion bid
executed approximately 0 agreements with producers to partcipate in kern river's open season
producers were required to bid in open season and upon award of capacity by kern
the producers will assign such capacity to ena in exchange for 0% of ena mark to market profit on the capacity
overall objective of the project was to increase ena capacity stake on this expansion
the basis is currently very profitable between wyoming and california
worked with barry tycholiz and mark whitt 0
enron compression services
stagecoach
negotiating a deal to provide hp compression services to tennessee gas pipeline company in pennsylvania
drafts have been sent to tennessee
also negotiating a power and gas deal with ees to provide electric service to the compressor and sell the gas to ees which ecs receives from tennessee
ken
attached are the medusa docs with some slight revision
the revisions are all to make it clear that this is a nonbinding proposal
please let me know if you have any questions
debra
this is another one for a master firm/purchase sale
the enron entity in these deals is bridgeline gas marketing
llc let me know if you have any questions
here is the last one
stephanie
attached is a the form of assignment that we would use for the kern river expansion with the producer
please let me know if you have any questions
andrew
attached is a draft of the master firm/purchase between ees and ecs and its accompany transaction agreement
i think it does make sense to have a separate agreement to encompass the overall annual true between the power and gas sides
need to discuss this with ees
attorney
i will contact bo and see who is the lead attorney on this deal
please review the attached documents and let me know before you send this to ees
as you will see i have a few question noted on the ta
how is it going
i didn't get here until about 0:0
yikes
i had 0 voicemail messages
when i got here
help
bo
attached is the draft of the gas agreement for the stagecoach transaction
there are still a few blanks for which andrew is getting the information
please review and let me know if you have any questions
also to follow up on our discussion from earlier concerning who would actually contracts with the ppl for the utility agreement
we had earlier discussed tennessee gas pipeline contracting with the utility with ees acting as their agent for interaction with the utility
however
i think it should be ees who contracts with the utility to receive electric service
tgp has contracted with ecs for compression services and ecs has contracted with ees for power
tgp has no need for a power deal
let me know what you think about this
it is my understanding that ees is working on a revised draft of the ta for the power contract
let me know if this is not correct
thanks
dan
per our discussion
attached is the compressor services agreement between enron compression services company and tennessee gas pipeline company
this is a rough draft at this point
but should give you a good idea of the structure of this deal
note that section 0.0 will be removed as this is no longer part of the deal
ken
i am forwarding the initialed cover letter with the changes included
please revise the body of the proposal to also reflect the changes made to the cover sheet
let me know if you have any questions
that's fine
actually my friend paul called me and wanted to get together for a beer tonight with andy
so it looks like i will be blowing off working out
uh-oh
that sounds fine
tell shannon hello at the movies
ha ha just kidding
o
can't wait to hear your skiiillz on the radio
i couldn't have said it better myself
please review the attached response to the psc for accuracy
let me know if you have any issues
gnny
please see the bold sentence i added
wanted to make it clear that there would be no double interest
let me know if that works for you
i have left a voicemail with enron corp
counsel to review this and the other items we discussed yesterday
hopefully we can get this settled today
thanks
some thoughts that might help from time to time
this was forwarded to me
and i found it very compelling
maybe god wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person
we will know how to be grateful for that gift
when the door of happiness closes
another opens
but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has been opened for us
the best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with
never say a word
and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had
it's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it
but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives
giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they'll love you back
don't expect love in return
just wait for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn't
be content it grew in yours
it takes only a minute to get a crush on someone
an hour to like someone
and a day to love someone
but it takes a lifetime to forget someone
don't go for looks
they can deceive
don't go for wealth
even that fades away
go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright
find the one that makes your heart smile
there are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real
dream what you want to dream
go where you want to go
be what you want to be
because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do
may you have enough happiness to make you sweet
enough trials to make you strong
enough sorrow to keep you human
enough hope to make you happy
always put yourself in others
shoes
if you feel that it hurts you
it probably hurts the other person
too
the happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything
they just make the most of everything that comes along their way
happiness lies for those who cry
those who hurt
those who have searched
and those who have tried
for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives
love begins with a smile
grows with a kiss and ends with a tear
the brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past
you can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches
when you were born
you were crying and everyone around you was smiling
live your life so that when you die
you're the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying
please send this message to those people who mean something to you
to those who have touched your life in one way or another
to those who make you smile when you really need it
to those that make you see the brighter side of things when you are really down
to those who you want to let them know that you appreciate their friendship
and if you don't
don't worry
nothing bad will happen to you
you will just miss out on the opportunity to brighten someone's day with this message

attached is a blank form for use in the e&i work
the work offer form for the other contracts should be attached as an exhibit to the other contracts

steve van hooser forwarded two agreement for electric service from cp&l for the elizabethtown and the lumbertown cogen facilities for my review
i have reviewed the documents and they are standard tariff type service agreements
there are two items to which i would like to draw your attention
these deals look to have a 0 year term since they are being served from transmission service
0
if customer terminate earlier
there would be a termination payment equal to the loss in salvage value of the facilities used to serve the customer
not sure what this value is
but might be significant
depending on what facilities cp&l would install to serve these plants
0
there is a minimum bill each month that customer would have to pay
even if there was no usage of power by customer
if you are ok with these issues
i will initial the agreements and forward these to you for signature

the following are my responses to phillip's changes in our letter agreement
0
0st sentence of second paragraph
strike of reference to section 0.0 and reference to appendix 0
ena's right to decrease confirmed volumes and phillips
rights to release the gas are clearly set out in section 0.0
the
operations/delivery scheduling procedures
only are the method by which this is effected
this change needs to be removed
0
0st sentence of second paragraph
the remainder of the changes to the 0st sentence except for the strike of seller's daily deliverability are ok
seller's daily deliverability needs to remain as this is the correct terminology under the purchase agreement
all we are doing here is effecting the provisions of the purchase agreement to which both parties have already agreed
0
the added sentence at the end of the second paragraph
this needs to be stricken
the medicine bow system is not ena's and we do not want to create a firm purchase deal with this letter
0
0st sentence of third paragraph
the add from
that quantity of gas
to
the
released gas
should be removed
the term released gas is defined under the purchase agreement and doesn't need to be defined in this letter
i am ok with ena
hereby
agreeing to waive any and all rights it has to under section 0.0 to recall the gas
however
the term rights ena
may
have needs to be stricken
ena's position is that we have the right to recall the gas as long as it hasn't been released longer than 0 days
if you wish to discuss these comments or would like me to discuss these with phillips
i would be happy to do so
steve
i will be there

the lease for bay gas could be used
if hanover is providing a purchase option
the lease agreement would need to be modified for the purchase option
my suggestion is to provide these forms to the customer with the caveat that as the commercial terms are fine tuned
these drafts will be modified
but this gives them the basic idea
in my absence please contact barbara for coordination of legal support in the event you cannot wait until i return
thanks
mark
i forgot to mention in my earlier note
that for the parking/storage arrangement with bay gas
i would request their form of storage agreement
i makes more sense to have a separate agreement cover the parking arrange as this is really independent of the compression services
these storage company typically have their own agreement that not bad and usually won't use the counterparties paper
attached is the executable form of the letter agreement
i have accepted all of jerry's changes
please print out two executables of the letter and execute and forward to mark whitt for execution by ena
if you have any questions please contact me at

hey guys
i just got back from traveling two weeks in china
so i am now able to answer my emails
a friend of mine here at enron has a brother that lives in china and he got married to a chinese national
so i decided to join them for the wedding and sightseeing
the sights were pretty amazing
great wall
forbidden city
tianamen square
etc
definitely culture shock though
i know what it feels like to be a rock star now
i was pretty much stared at wherever i went
i am sure they think i look like a big nosed western devil freak
the food wasn't as bad as i thought
although i did get the trots the last two days in country
i knew i shouldn't have eaten the mutton
fortunately i missed the flood of the century
ernie
i heard about it the first week in china
wasn't much i could do from china
so i just kept my fingers crossed and fortunately the house was safe and sound when i got back
some jackass drove up on my front yard and left some tire tracks
there must have been high water in the street that he was trying to avoid
doooh
other than that everything is going fine
doing the old dating thing
boy is that a ton of laughs
women at this age are definitely interesting
i spend most of my time avoiding questions like
where is this relationship headed
uh excuse me
but we only met last week
congratulations
paul on little chloe
i checked out the pics on your website and the family looks great
bieraugel you still look the same as the last time i saw you
but whoa
is that a little gray hair i saw on you paul
oh well
we all have chinks in our armor
seriously though it is a beautiful family and i know it must be tough to be away from them
are you going to be staying in the navy for awhile
0 more years and you can retire eh
ernie
sounds like things are going well at work
congrats on the promo
we definitely need to do a better job of getting together here in houston
you need to get the wife and we need to have dinner one night or something
the buick sounds prime
0hp ought to take care of it
sounds better than the shaka-mobile
what the hell ever happened to that car anyway
i still love to tell stories about that car
you can't beat a k-mart lawn chair for comfortable automobile seating
ernie
i think my focus is on the 0 series bmw
unfortunately my stock portfolio has delayed my auto purchase for awhile
let's pledge to all do better at keeping in touch
it is great to hear from you guys
we need to plan a little get together when you get back from sea
it has been to damn long
take care and be safe

this looks to be a separate deal and mine was only a spot deal
based on our discussions yesterday
attached are the bhp confirm and gtc
please review and let me know if you have any questions
we still need to input the delivery point information
bill
the contract itself does not have a confidentiality clause
but per jeff stone's email
gulf does consider the contract proprietary information and does not want this info voluntarily disclosed at this time
i forwarded the email to you earlier
concerning the emails etc
as i mentioned before
ecs has a copy of a confidentiality agreement that we executed by gulf
initialed by me as ecs attorney
but not signed by an officer of ecs
our business guys think we executed this agreement
this ca would cover all information exchanged between gulf and ecs
i have asked russell badder's to check with gulf to obtain an executed copy
nothing in the ca agreements prohibit me from disclosing the ca
so we could potentially provide the copy of the ca we have to john
obviously the correspondence between ecs and gulf contains the commerical terms of our power deal as we negotiated with gulf
given jeff's email and the ca copy i have in hand
i would not want to disclose the emails and memo's without gulf's explicit permission
let me know if you have any ideas on the best way to approach this with wfla
chris
i am fine with his revision if you are ok with the terms

the product description was to be used for various pipelines

yes
in this product ena would always be the seller or the buyer of the capacity to be released
i visited with steve earlier

as far as i know
these were just discussions and the only eol product implemented was the one i forwarded to you

alan
with respect to the transactions for cheyenne and public service company
enron prefers to use the firm general terms and conditions as the base agreement for these deals
these two transactions are 0 month firm deals
the gisb is not set up for firm transactions longer than 0 month in term
there is no termination payment provision in a gisb and enron requires this language for any firm deal
enron's general policy is not to use the gisb for any firm deal that is longer than 0 month
i would be happy to discuss this further at your convenience
i can be reached at

alan
per our discussion
attached are drafts of enron's master firm agreements
sorry for the delay
enron's preference would be to use these master instead of the gisb agreements for the firm deals
the firm gtc were really meant as a stop gap until we could be these masters in place
i did review the gisb we currently have in place with northern states power
wi and mn
these agreements do not have the necessary credit provisions and termination payment provisions required for firm deals that are included in our attached master
these masters should address the specific concerns included in your email
0
the masters contains provisions to deal wth the possibility that a price will not published on any day in the same manner as the gisb does
0
the netting issue we need to address
the gisb don't have netting provisions
but we don't use gisb for any firm deals over 0 month in term
i am not sure i understand the regulatory issues with respect to netting
these master contain netting provisions
let's discuss once you have reviewed the masters
0
force majeure provisions are similar to the gtc
enron prefers a vary narrow definition of fm
we modify the gisb fm to reflect this with special provisions
if you could provide specific comments we can address your issues
0
audit provisions are included in the masters
0
any affirmative action statutes and regulatory provisions can be address in this master
if you could provide specific language we can address this issue
putting these master in place would really make business going forward much more efficient
please review and let's discuss and your earliest convenience
i can be reached at
0

night

ask them to print out two copies and execute
frank
attached for your review is a draft of the settlement agreement we discussed
attached is the letter
the address information and unocal's full name need to be inserted and then print two copies on ena letterhead for execution
i have reviewed the term sheet and i am fine with the form
i did spot a potential issue with the transport piece of the proposal
if ena holds transport on nng
it cannot simply sell use of that capacity to unocal
the shipper of record with nng needs to hold title to the gas that is being transported
for unocal to utilize this capacity
they would need to either directly contract with nng for such capacity
or ena would acquire the capacity then
capacity release
the capacity to unocal
the capacity release would be subject to nng bulletin board posting requirements
let me know if you want to discuss further
frank
attached is the letter with the revised section 0
i also added some language to the beginning of section 0 to make it clear how that section operates with section 0

after reviewing the mojave tpa
i contacted carlos pena with el paso to discuss
he agreed that section 0.0
b
can be stricken
he also agreed that the sentence in section
on page 0 which reads
text from here to the end of item 0 has been inserted by enron north america corp
is a note which should be stricken
also for consistency sake
section 0.0
b
in the main body of the agreement should not be stricken
exhibit a overrides this section so the strike is not necessary in the main body of the agreement
lastly
the full legal name
enron north america corp
should be inserted in the agreement

let me know if you have any questions
attached is the revised keep whole language
i assume this language would completely replace the variance langauge that we currently insert in our gtcs and any replacement price differential language in our pooling point and wellhead gtcs
i.e
this will be the only measure of damages for these deals
if this is not correct
let's discuss
ellen
this language would be the same language use for the w&t offshore and spinaker deals
is this correct nelson
please review before sending out to make sure i have correctly captured your business deal
attached are the cascade documents redlined with my changes
please review and let's discuss further before forward by to cascade

mark haedicke
0
executive vp
corp
development of enron corp
0
anyone else that ena requires to approve these non-compete agreements

ellen
has scheduled a meeting for thursday to discuss
it was very nice running into you also
banker
smanker
g works hard for the money
so you had better treat him right
what do you have going on this week
thurs
or fri
after work would work
that sounds weird
attached is the precedent agreement with changes redlined
i scanned their hardcopy
i added that same outs that were included in the momentum agreements
but i left the dates blank
please review and let me know if you have any questions
let's discuss on thursday
attached is the form of amendment to guaranty for tractebel
do you know the $$ limits for signing authority for bridgeline
i.e
when do the management member have to sign a guaranty as opposed to randy curry
fyi
i actually found a copy yesterday and forwarded to keith for him to review
i think we either want a cashier check or a wire transfer
do we have a legal description for these tracts to use in the sale documents
we will need to have one to finalize the documents
john
the meeting is tomorrow at 0:0 in 0c0
max
the agreement calls for them to provide to ena certification that they have set aside special funds to meet their payment obligations to ena under this agreement
a letter from the mayor or city manager indicating such budget approvals are sufficient
to the extent they don't provide this
an early termination event occurs
we can still call for collateral in accordance with section 0.0 if they don't meet the thresholds
the item added in your sentence #0 below does concern me
this seems to be a floated revenue system and i am not sure how we get comfortable that the revenues will be there
i need to review these additions with colorado springs
because it is not clear to me how they think such provisions operate in the context of the existing language concerning the budget certification requirements
we probably need to get on a conference call with them
i am probably ok with the arbitration provision
depending on how the other items turn out
tyrell
do you want to set something up a call with marcus and his attorney to discuss these issues
thanks for your help on this
i am fine with this form
after this hearing staff makes a recommendation to the commission
the commission decision should be issued in late oct
or early nov
ned
attached is the revised csi ca based on our discussion
the non-compete provision is removed
as we discussed they would still be obligated to not use our confidential information for any purpose other than to evaluate a transaction with ecs
however
they could still pitch a proposal not utilize our confidential information
rude dog
how is it going
enjoying every moment of marital bliss
must be weird to be a student again and have to do all that studying and drink all that beer
the horns are looking pretty good
the defense has really been spectacular as well as special teams
the offense is sputtering right now
but i think they will get back on track
i am going to the uh game this weekend

oh well at least my life isn't complicated
glad to hear things are going well for you
yes the days of surfing longhorn boards for 0 to 0 hours a day are over
i am really getting comfortable with our dts actually
maurice gordon
even though undersized has wreaked a lot of havoc
he crushed curry in the endzone for the safety
sounds likes tubbs is picking up the double teams
ala casey hampton
which allows gordon more room to work
he is very quick and can get to the backfield quickly
mark my words
derrick johnson is our best linebacker now
watching him against nc was a joy
he toys with the lineman and makes them look silly when he jukes and blows past them
the guy needs to be starting now
i know he has only played two games
but i haven't seen a more talented linebacker play at ut since i began watching longhorn football
the game against uh is national on espn0
i believe
you should be able to catch it
watch #0 on defense
look for me in the stands
i be the one wearing burnt orange

i did discuss removal of section 0.0
b
for mojave pipeline

mark
attached for your review is a draft of the capacity release agreement we discussed
the only way would be to copyright the material
any original writing can be copyrighted
at a minimum
i would mark any submission as copyrighted material
i don't know the specific requirements for filing

i would think the fed
government would have a web site on how to copyright material

but will check voicemail
nelson
i reviewed the form provided
some comments 0
generally we should make every attempt to get these guys to use our paper
from an ena upstream overall standpoint
if we start using other forms then we lose consistency with how these deals are administered
payment
noms
etc
0
with respect to this form there are some conceptual issues
a
no specific measures of damages if the parties breach b
no detail on the type of gas being purchase
i.e
wellhead
pooling point
firm
interruptible
contract states that
seller shall use reasonable efforts to deliver and buyer shall use reasonable efforts to purchase
we would have to tie this down
c
nomination deadlines and notification for production variances is not addressed
0
there are also some legal issues
state law
arbitration
etc
indemnity in summary
we would have to make significant revisions to this form and it would end up looking much more like our form
i don't know the dynamics of the relationship
are they insistent on using their paper
mark
attached are the latest
i smoothed out some of your changes and added a section in the ta to address assignment of the gathering agreement
please review
attached are the latest based on our discussions
i couldn't redline the capacity release agreement
so i am only sending a clean version

that we still need to do a final review of the gathering agreement
this could add to the transaction agreement

my only comments would be in the firm transport section
since ena can not directly provide firm transport on nng
i would rephrase it as
ena would arrange for firm transport on nng
as we discussed before
unocal would need to enter directly into the ft with nng or ena would have to contract for the ft and then release it to unocal pursuant to the capacity release procedures
which would include posting and bidding requirements

keegan's info
i have reviewed the dow agreement wrt to the dow invoice dated november 0
0 and have found the following section 0.0 of the agreement
as amended
provides for a lease fee of $0,0 per bcf based on 0.0 bcf until the date that gas injections begin in enron's well
which was july 0
0
and a fee of $0,0 per bcf based on 0.0 bcf thereafter
the fees are assessed per calendar quarter
the above fees look to be ok
0
final mining fee
$0,0.0 final land purchase offset
$0,0.0
section 0.0 through 0.0 of the agreement provide for a detailed calculation of the brine fee due dow based on the amount of salt removed from enron's new well and a corresponding credit back to enron for the conveyance of a 0.0 acres tract of land to dow from enron
the credit is also based on the amount of salt removed from enron's new well
dow should provide detail on the salt removed and someone would need to go through the calcs in 0.0 through 0.0 to verify the above charges
0
power credit adjustment
$0,0 i find no basis for this in the contract
under schedule 0 to the bridgeline holdings
l.p
partnership agreement
bridgline is obligated to bear all obligations under the dow agreement up to a maximum of $0,0,0 per year
so bridgeline should be paying these costs
assuming they haven't already paid up to $0,0,0
let me know if you have any questions
deb
could you pull data sheets for me on the following entities
louisiana resources company lrci
inc
louisiana gas marketing company lgmi
inc
thanks
brian
karen gruesen
and i had a discussion this morning with bridgeline
we agreed that they owed and would pay the lease fees
but the remainder of the charges were not subject to reimbursement
the only issue was would they reimburse us or pay dow directly
they are concerned about netting issues
bridgeline was checking the issues on their side concerning payment directly to dow
we made it clear that we prefer they directly pay dow
they were supposed to get back with brian later today
sorry i didn't make that clear earlier
i know how you feel
no way nebraska should be playing for the championship
should be oregon
i will see if we can get someone from the bankruptcy team for wed
attached is the review performed so far on the gas contract list you forwarded

your thoughts
stuart
i reviewed the contract files on the hubbard transaction and found the following agreements
all these contracts are in enron north america corp.'s name 0
compression services agreement dated june 0
0
i worked on this one
we basically restated the existing compression services agreement with nng to revise conversion factors to allow nng to deliver ena more gas and thus allow ena to mark more earnings
nng was able to book $0 mil of these earning as a fee paid by ena to nng in consideration for termination of the existing compression services agreement
this agreement has a provision for submission of a purchase offer by nng to ena for purchase of the motor and interconnection facilities
no specific numbers are listed and the terms would have to be mutually agreeable
no events of default specifically listed
including bankruptcy
thus it is not terminated
if ena fails to provide hp there are ld payments due up to a maximum of $0,0 per contract year
term is through january 0
0
0
first amended and restated operations agreement dated november 0
0
nng operates the electric driver for ena
fee is $0,0 per year with an escalater
term is through november 0
0
this works with the term of the csa above
even though physical operations stop in november
gas still flows for another two month period
no events of default specifically listed
including bankruptcy
0
agreement for purchase of power dated march 0
0 as amended on november 0
0
ena purchases electricity from midland power cooperative
term is through december 0
0
no events of default specifically listed
including bankruptcy
0
master lease agreement dated march 0
0
ena leases the electric motor driver and appurtenant equipment from general electric capital corporation
this agreement has a 0 year term with an option to purchase the equipment after year 0 for a fixed amount of $0,0.0
bankruptcy of ena is an event of default
ge must provide notice that they wish to declare an event of default
if they declare an event of default
ge could enter the premises and take possession of the equipment and hold ena liable for the
stipulated loss value
of the equipment and all rentals due thereunder
the stipulated loss value calculated is set forth on a table attached to the agreement
let me know if you would like copies of any of these agreements
mark
i didn't find any gas agreements in the binders that i have
most likely since it was done intra-ena
there was no contract and it was simply booked under a deal ticket
i will look to see if i can find any paper in our global database for the deal
i left it with leslie after i reviewed yesterday
i don't think there would be any problem with the ecs selling the gas to a third party
they are currently selling the gas to ena
i am not sure how the proceeds from the sale will be handled once ecs recieves them
since ecs is not bankrupt
i will see if i can find anything out about that
eric
you might want to check with ed and see if he has any insight
we found no termination notice
please see attached
please note that that physical gas purchase and sale is as follows
ecs compression company llc receives the gas from tw under the csa ecs compression company llc sells the gas to enron compression services company enron compression services company sells the gas to ena
gallup
or to enron gas marketing corp
bisti/bloomfield
i would like to nominate ou's 0-0 defeat by osu as the most humiliating upset of the year
at this point
i don't think any assignment to ecs solve any of these issues
we still have to get approval for any cash outlaws from ecs since it is 0% owned by ena
also assignment from a debtor entity to a non-debtor entity might require certain approvals from the bankruptcy ct
and the dip financing
i can look into it if it necessary
but does it really help the cash situation
susan
could you look for and email me the following
storage agreement with montana power interruptible storage agreement with wbi transport agreement with trailblazer pipeline company
think it was dated around 0
sorry for the sketchy info
but that is all that i have
thanks
bruce
give me a call when you get a chance
we have much to talk about in recruiting
let's see
albert hardy
rodrique wright
and now marco martin
unbelievable
if we could only land vincent young
kellie
have you updated the transport list yet
i still haven't received the final update
this is the latest
do you have anything for hometown communications network
looking for a gas contract dated 0/0/0
no
this must be the pulp
paper gtc to which they are referring
they didn't specifically note it as a gas deal
thanks for your help
attached is the only i have for kachina
thanks
could you also look for a enfolio master firm with kaztex energy management inc
and ena dated august 0
0
debra perelingiere had prepared this contract
since it was done so recently
it may not have made it into the system yet
thanks for your help
i'll check debra's files
jason
to follow up on our discussion last week
enron compression services company
not a debtor
and owned 0% by ena
is receiving physical gas under its compression services agreements with transwestern pipeline company
the gas is delivered to ecs on tw's system as consideration for ecs delivery of electric compression services
this gas was sold by ecs to ena under a long term master firm
but obviously that has blown up
tw has been desperate to get this gas off of their system since it is packing their pipeline worse every day
we put into place a gisb with richardson energy marketing
ltd
i made sure there was not cross affiliate netting language in the gisb
some of the gas was sold over the christmas weekend
about 0,0 per day
and more is being sold this week
we need to put into place a long term sale for the remainder of the term of the compression deals
approximately 0 years
to protect the compression services deals
sid may be a potential counterparty
but it may be sold to someone else
please provide any input you may have on how we need to structure this sale given the current situation
in addition to the philadelphia gas works contracts
could you also look for a husky oil operations limited with ena dated september 0
0
thanks
thanks susan
can you send me any gtc that would have been for nov
0 through march 0 business for pgw
per my phone conversation with cheryl hartsell
i hereby give permission for unimark llc to provide a copy of the contract with ena upstream company
llc dated october 0
0 to the producer who gas was sold by unimark under such contract
provided that unimark informs such producer of the confidential nature of the contract

attached is a draft of the dow amendment
i used portions of their proposed amendment which they sent of august 0
date and prices are left blank for negotiation
let me know if you have any questions
stuart
i have reviewed your comments and incorporated as appropriate
please review attached
the following are my comments on your changes that i did not accept
0
the replacement of section 0.0 and 0.0 with section
a
b
etc
is confusing
but unfortunately the september 0
0 amendment already made this replacement
i am staying with that format
0
since the original agreement was awkardly amended in september of 0
i think the references to the
original agreement as amended by amendment #0
are helpful
so l retained them
let me know if you have any questions
i am ok to send this to dow if you are
i am so sorry about jack
it is very difficult for me to accept that he is gone
he was a very special man to me as i was growing up
jack was as much like an uncle to me as any of my blood relatives
he always represented the pillar of strength while still being able to to be one of the most loving and compassionate people i have ever known
to me jack was everything a man was supposed to be
it always made me proud to talk to jack about my football games and later on the oil and gas business
it was neat that in a way i was following a similiar path in life to the one that jack had taken
and when my daughter was born i began to see how he must of felt about his three wonderful daughters
who i still consider to be like sisters to me
i was so excited when little jack was born this year because i knew how proud and excited he must have been to finally have his boy
i hope someday i have the opportunity to tell him what a special man his grandpa was
the thing i always will remember about jack was that when he walked into a room
he filled it up
not because of his size
but because of his enormous personality and lust for life
he could always put a smile on your face
the world has lost a very special man
i know this is hard for you and the girls
it is hard for me to write this without breaking up
i love you guys and wish i was there with you
love mark whitt
i don't know why it did not go
it was huge
he called it within 0 yds
and took it with a bow
we missed you in jackson
weather was great
so was the fishing
how is the little one
i'm sorry i missed the date
how much does logan weigh
does he stand a chance against his brothers
updated
please find the attached draft version of our proposed gas supply structure
we have focused on minimizing your fixed charges while still giving you the right to call on up to 0,0 mmbtu/d of firm cheyenne supplies
in addition
enron will manage your transportation and imbalances associated with your psco transportation contracts
obviously we will need to see those contracts prior to finalizing this transaction in order to assure we can meet those obligations
in addition
i am sure we will need to
tweak
this proposal to meet you physical requirements
volumes
terms etc
please give me a call once you have had a chance to review the attached
mark whitt
please find the attached firm contract
please add tbutt@pioneeroil-co.com
brian
after talking to our legal department it seems that in order to effectuate the wellhead purchase we will need assignment of the williams contract instead of being agent
this is important because we will have title to the gas at durango
therefore we need to have the contract assigned to us
can you talk to williams asap and see if that is a problem
thanks mark
please find the attached
theresa staab and i would like to come to houston on monday and spend some time with you and jason on tuesday
we need to discuss some specifics on the purchase proposal such as how you want each netback to be determined
logistics and documentation
let me know what time would work for you on tuesday
we probably need a fair amount of time
tyrell and i are working on a monetization structure for your gathering system
can you tell me if the oil and gas division was able to keep the gains associated with the rollout of the hedges
we think we might have a structure worth looking at
p.s
dan and i would like to call you on friday in regards to the ft union capacity
some time in the afternoon
please review and share your comments and concerns
let's talk it through
discuss with stephanie and barry
i would let her know that there is no definite timeline but we are closing a transaction next week
heidi
please sum up my costs and paul's cost for this trip and forward to barry
barry
all of the hotel costs were on my credit card
so all paul should have is his airfare and incidentals
but we will sum it up for you
i like those kinds of schedules
i suggest that you build a boxing ring in the back yard
let's try to get together soon
sounds like we have both been too busy
i made a few small changes
that is great
the attached can act as a starting point for discussions around enron's purchase of pioneer's powder river basin methane supplies
once you have reviewed it please give me a call at 0-0-0 and we can discuss it
not suprising
bud cranford
that should keep you busy
can we get this
let's plan on watching this
please look at this
i didn't know how deep to go with the desk
do you think this works
this is the contract # on el paso if you need it
let's take this injto consideration for kennedy's recluse gas
let's get a proposal from grasslands and we can put together a summary of the options for kennedy
laine could you add jay to your email distribution list
his address is jay.reitmeyer@enron.com
please include the following language
if both parties agree
the cig index portion of the pricing can be changed during the term of the contract to reflect other market and transport opportunities
this is all i have
could you have someone draft an interruptible purchase agreement for pioneer oil
i will forward you the address
here is an opportunity to get a box for one of the games
detroit on feb 0th would be great
that is a monday
if you and kim wanted to you could come up and ski that weekend prior
let me know what you think
please put together your vacation schedules for the rest of the year and forward to heidi by 0/0/0
heidi
please organize these into one summary and let me see them before they go to barry
the only thing we need to make sure we are covered on is all the huber purchases in the powder river will be starting on dec 0
they could be quite involved
so let's make sure we are ready
especially if you are out
those dates are fine
of course i am sending this to you on the morning of the 0th so maybe you are already here
i will be your contact
we are at 0 0th st
suite 0
the office is in the process of being subdivided so it will be easiest if you come by and i show you what we are doing
call me if you need anything at 0-0-0
the following customers are currently covered by fred lagrasta's middle market desk primarily for derivative transactions
in all cases except for hallwood
ena denver has a relationship with these customers that primarily covers their physical business
we would like to expand that business to cover their derivative business as well
the list is based on priority
we would be willing to cover them for their west gas business only
fred could continue to cover their east
central and oil/liquids business
xcel energy
psco
and affiliate e prime
devon energy cross timbers hallwood energy forest oil prima patina oil and gas westport
no problem
i can show you what the difference is between cheyenne hub daily prices and cig first of the month index prices
but that is kind of like apples and oranges
to clarify
you do not have to buy on enron online
eol
we can quote you physical prices over the phone and you can use eol for price discovery
you do not have to decide that now
my recommendation is the attached
major changes are
price
gas daily cheyenne midpoint plus $.0 demand charge
$0,0 per month in addition
enron will provide market based pricing for additional volumes above 0,0 mmbtu all of this is of course subject to negotiation of the appropriate contracts and enron's review of the psco transportation contract
let me know what you think
i wish i was that smart
i only added one line
otherwise it looks good
let's set something up for monday
ena and crestone
northern border's non-regulated affiliate
met with a group of developers and joe meyer
secretary of state in wyoming
who have proposed to build a 0 mw power plant
expandable to 0 mw
in the powder river basin of wyoming
their
angle
is that the existing utility
powder river electric coop
cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the coal bed methane boom that is happening in the basin
as you may or may not know
enron has been very involved in this coal bed methane play since 0
ena is the largest purchaser of 0rd party gas in the basin and crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin
crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site
the developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the coop's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks
there are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this
retail
market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market
however
they seem to have some political backing
these developers recognize that they need enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts
0
power marketing and project development 0
gas supplies and pipeline access 0
regulatory and transmission expertise given the fact that joe meyer is the early favorite to be the next wyoming governor and we are trying to work well with the state of wyoming
and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective
i would like to pursue this opportunity a little further
therefore
i am wondering if i could get a sr
commercial power representative and a regulatory representative
steve walton would be good since he will be on the wyoming energy commission
to attend a meeting in denver with myself and the crestone representatives sometime in the next 0 weeks
please give me a call and i can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions
i don't want to make this email a novel
thanks a lot
no changes to mine
what time are you meeting today
do you want me to participate
we are going to do a month to month interupptible purchase agreement with patina oil and gas
the gas will be delivered into lost creek
the price will be gas daily cig midpoint index flat
the flows will vary daily depending upon well production
i am not sure if we have an interruptible purchase agreement with kennedyl did paul ask you to put together a wellhead purchase for huber in the powder river basin
plain vanilla intervention is fine
would nov
0 or 0 work for either of you
email me your fax number and i will fax you a copy of what the developers have given me
thanks
i have to go to the management meeting in san antonio on the afternoon of the 0th
would it be possible to meet in denver on the morning of the 0th
what is your fax number
i will send you the project summary
it works for me
steve
would that be possible for you
brian
i propose that we use the attached contracts for the bridge between our two term deals
mark
these are draft versions of the interruptible purchase agreement and confirm for your gas into fort union
think about what you what to do for term
volume etc
we will then add in the gathering charges
we are pretty flexible
so let me know what works for patina
thanks
mark
sue
just wanted to let you know that we filed comments in support of xcel's ability to manage price risk and be incentivized to do so
if you have questions about our comments
give me a call
thanks
mark
i would like to see you get on the denver 0/0 day schedule
any 0 hours you choose from 0:0 a
m
to 0:0 p.m
no i am delerious because i am too poor to eat
it should be lost creek
i told alicia that she and the kids are eating way too much
she told me that her oils business is really taking off
i think she may need to start turning tricks
i will start to get you some good ones
can we meet next tuesday on october 0th
afternoon is prefferable
could you check this out
it should be on my mastercard
we are reviewing the security tapes today
the tape doesn't lie
may have to reschedule until the end of next week to bring bruce to houston
what does thurs/friday of next week look like
reminds of the old tlc days
worsley
you might even be able to find a woman with this kind of service
or if you prefer i hear they have some cute goats
i won't be available from0:0 to 0:0 mountain time
i bought in today i think that we are very near the bottom
mid-teens has to be a good buy
famous last words
you scare me
don't tell her i sent you this
this is still rough
but it is a little better
haven't heard form you in awhile
thought you might find this funny
what are the cost per trade
actually i don't have your number
i forwarded them our comments and characterized them as being supportive
really well
we are probably going to have another meeting on the 0th of october
jake thomas and steve walton are going to attend
either time is good
how long do you need
please check inot this
that seems really high
what can we do to lower that
anytime
i didn't think you ever wore a bra
can you find out wha the average rental income is on one like this
are they going to build it if it is not fully subscribed
or is williams going to take the risk
i wonder why entergy is taking space
i am never big on utility guys
this guy seems to be very focused on sumas compared to u.s
supplies
i think he is a want to be trader who got out of hand at a utility
i spoke with dale sanders at williams today
they seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right
of-way
regulatory filings
enviornmental and engineering work
i had previously put this project at a very low probablility
especially with the 0 mm/d kern expansion in 0
i did not think that they would be able to get williams marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity
however
they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity
obviously that is the key to williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality
williams is in negotiaitions to fill the other 0,0 mmbtu/d
i have to put that probability at still fairly low
but stranger things have happened
especially if williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the 0 mm/d
probably the entire project is still less than 0% but it is obviously something to monitor very closely
if the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for cig and northwest
especially on the heels of the kern river expansion
in addition
the cheyenne market will definitely strengthen in the back years
call if you want to discuss or have other ideas about how to monitor these developments
the meeting will be around 0:0
just come to our office at 0 0th st
suite 0
then we will go over to crestone office
i anticipate that the meeting will last about an hour to an hour and half
mark
i don't have a problem with it
i think he would be as good or better of a trader as some of the
kids
i have seen down there losing $0 mm
at least he has some concept of the physical market and how it works
i would think to get the best value he would have to be located in houston for that role
especially if steve wants to
pick his brains
can you see what this is and how we approve it
thanks
not bad
barry it looks reasonable to me
i sure would like to add something sizable to the totals for q0
but i'm a pig that way
i can't believe they are going to stop the employees from managing their investments through such a turbulent time
this will be a case study in how not to do things
i am ready when you are
let's discuss
please review and let's discuss next steps
i would like to have the physical guys you met recently give this the smell test
i can't pull up
i will be out the 0th but should be in the 0th
amy felling should be your contact on the 0th
she is most familiar with our computer systems
the enron north america offices are at 0 0th st
suite 0 in downtown denver
the office is over 0,0 square feet but is currently under construction in order to sublease approximately half of that space
we currently have 0 employees
i believe that you have copied all of the enron offices that i know of
the only other potential office is eott
let me know if you need anything else
i have to do a presentation on spark spreads for nov 0th
i need your help putting it together and probably running the presentation for me
this may have some good info
let's get a new product
i think they will struggle to get the 0 mm/d
have you heard anybody else contemplating taking space on western frontier
look at the weekly strategy product for producers
let's see what one of these will look like for our customers
that sounds good
we are probably more interested in people who have more experience in the western u.s
preferably direct producer relationships and rocky mountain utilities and industrials
we don't do any trading in the denver office
thanks for the lead though
is this your final version
if not
we need the final so we can get fundies to set up the updates
thanks for coming to denver for the meeting
i know it seems like a longshot but if it happens i think we have an excellent shot at being involved in some respect
thanks again
mark
that sports email was great
are you saying that the u.s
producers are hedging their canadian production with u.s
counterparties as opposed to canadian counterparties
or are the decisions being made in the u.s
and executed in canada
just wanted to let you know how brian was responding
we decide to leave out the $ value in order to focus them on the structure
i do not see the conversation about option values on the pipe
enron north america does transactions with the following companies which may be considered enron affiliates
crestone energy ventures bear paw energy lost creek gas gathering all three companies are primarily gas gathering companies
i had not heard that there was a discussion today
however
since we ran the economics for huber and discovered that enron's books do not appropriately value the permian capacity
we have been trying to convince bp that the value of the capacity is greater than the basis spread becase of the optionality associated with the variable costs of fuel and commodity
we used to have a model that the transport group used to use to value that optionality based upon the volatility of the basis spreads and the variable costs
steph and phil are running numbers to determine enron's
extrinsic value
we need to discuss how and what information we share with bp in order to convince them that the capacity is worth more than the value than that the outright basis markets
brian is showing up at our office at 0:0
we will be there soon after
you know that ena sold our pipeline assets to northern border partners in q0 of 0
that is what became crestone
the list i gave you is of who we do business with now
we usually see mostly regional basis deals out of our office
especially with the bigger guys
we do some nymex trades for our smaller producers
it seems the big guys use their banks for most of their basis
thanks for the info
you gotta see yhis
pass it on to other wgr alumni
make sure you read all the way through to enron
fyi guys
please review the attached
it's pretty scary
shows the state of the industry
doesn't it
we have a very good relationship
and long term gas sale with thermo partners who manage the 0 mw ft
lupton facility
they have inquired as to enron's interest in either buying the energy
tolling or buying the entire plant
the effective date would be july 0
the plant is currently under a qf contract with psco
mike
i would like to see if you have some time on monday afternoon to discuss the particulars and we can devise a game plan to get you connected with these guys
let me know your availability
thanks mark
that gave us a good chuckle this morning
these are the new days for the management conference
i made one change
let's talk about logisitcs and your ability to manage your kids schedules with being gone from 0:0 to 0:0 everyday
i have changed the dates and prices in these agreements
but those should be the only changes necessary
let me know if either of you see any other changes that are necessary
brian
let's get together this afternoon and see if we can organize our other capacity release transactions that need to be completed by december 0
does 0:0 your time work
sorry
let's talk about this today at 0:0
can you come in on friday for interviews
sometime around mid-morning is probably best
let me know
how is it going
i was just checking in to see where you stood on the selection of your gas supplies
plan on a couple of hours
i am not sure about lunch
i may already have plans
let me knowif there is anything else you need from us
sounds like we are still in the hunt
thanks for the update
we will coordinate with jason while you are out
as you evaluate the latest proposal
i understand that huber may have credit concerns with enron given all the rumors that are circulating
you know we are confident we will straighten things out soon
however
please understand that we are willing to do what is necessary to make huber comfortable
pre-pay
letter of credit etc
if you have any questions just give me a call
fyi
i told them we will address any credit concerns they may have
i thought we discussed lc's and prepays the other day and they were both options
fyi
for what it is worth
i spoke with bryan hassler today and he said
that everyone he has talked to
reliant
sempra etc
had told him that the market is very slow right now
for whatever that is worth
do you have an estimate for the cost for the christmas party
dow you want to split it pro-rata based upon headcount
you can bill us afterwords
i knew i could count on your support
did you see what happened today
we dropped to $0 but rebounded on rumors of a merger to $0
i'm sure it is sad
this is a lesson for those of us who are younger
diversify
isn't it crazy
i just have a hard time believing it is real
what have you been up to
i didn't know you were living in an apartment
when did this happen
what do you mean repair or rebuild
i hate to hear about you and nadine
that is too bad
didn't she know you were a piece of shit when she married you
i hate that these women forget that we have always been shitty
the kids are great
brock is finally becoming alot more fun
he and lauren get along really well
too hard to tell what will happen with dynegy
not sure i want to work for this new regime
i guess it all comes down to money
as always i'm still a whore
please add jeff to the daily email
wow
i didn't know that you got flooded
that's awful
i hate to see that you and nadine have deteriorated to that point
but if it is over you just have to keep your head up and move on
if it was me
i think i would start looking for one of those russian mail order brides
it will cost you a plane ticket and some braces but you won't have to buy a boob job because they all have great tits
you can't be getting fat
aren't you still running
if not you need to start
if not for your body do it for your mind
it is the best thing for that
this is sad
don't let him know i forwarded it to you
please add david pozner to our distribution
please email david pozner a 0 yr
curve by yr
for the following
northwest rockies
fyi we are planning on joining crestone for a combined denver christmas party
the cost for our share will be approximately $0,0
i know it is not cheap
but i think it is an important signal and morale booster which is critical at this time
we have a long way to go in this deal
we would love to have you and kim
might even be some snow by then
just let me know if you can make it so they can get a good head count
have you heard anything from the hr lawyers regarding our ability to fire her in the near future for poor performance
the following is a summary of the estimated costs of our buildout/subdivide project
blueprints $0,0 construction $0,0 furniture $0,0 *commisions were negotiated by enron realty we had a profit of roughly $0,0 on the sublease over the term of the lease and will save approximately $0,0 per month on the sublease
the crestone guys ar the map guys
really it is just wic
cig and williams
am i right about the wic
cig and williams
december 0th

nadine comes to our house today
when you come to our house for xmas try to be here by saturday afternoon
the party that lenny and laurie usually have may be at our house since they are in the middle of building their house
they are driving to florida after xmas and want to stop and see you either on the way or on the way back
i gave the dad's 0-0 number
she is not strict at all
jsut curious
let's see what she says
i admire your constant devotion to your customers and your unending desire to restore enron to it's once great status
as always you are the consumate proffesional
probably works depending on huber
are you sending out xmas cards
we usually do
and we usually send a small $0 gift to our best customers
ones we make money off
and those who do operational favors for us
there is an enron card but it does not say enron or we can order some
probably $.0 plus postage and 0 cards
gifts probably go to 0 customers for a cost of $0
$0
what do you think
mark
run the math on this real quick
ugly
very interesting
as a follow up to the written warning on august 0
0 to heidi dubose regarding her poor job performance i would like to submit the following commentary
heidi's phone coverage is still very inadequate
i have had two discussions with her in the last 0 weeks regarding this
she consistently does not take messages properly
most of the time all she tells us is the person's first name and that they are holding
when she does get the last name it is incorrect at least half of the time
she rarely gets the company name
and when she does it is incorrect or mispelled
the kitchen areas continue to be unkept and dirty
she has started to put the dishes in the dishwasher but she rarely unloads them
if she does it is after they have been in there for days
we continue to run out of office supplies and she does not consistently monitor the office needs
in summary
heidi's performance has improved some since august 0 but that improvement is not seen on a consistent basis
she has not elevated her performance to the level which is required to manage the office
that's great
thanks alot
look forward to working with you
have a great time
great to hear from you
looks great
