I have updated the Tetco 7c usage tickets to include fuel .
I have not looked at this file yet . Please pass it on to whomever you think might need it .
I have 2 storage questions for now . 1 . Cove Point LNG - it's my understanding that this is a LNG peaking facility . The current balance is 1,500,000 dth . Did you have a withdrawal schedule or were you going to use this as peaking gas ? 2 . TCO contract 63304 - has capacity of 7 BCF , and I think your current storage balance is about 5 BCF . What is your withdrawal schedule for Jan? ? thanks
FYI
I know you are going to make me a happy camper and let me know what you have executed for Jan 2000 so far! !
Where have you been? ? Why havn't you called? ?
Hey John , its a 30 min . trip for the email - go figure .
I believe the EOG volumes listed below are ANR citygate deliveries . Hunter , Dan and I will be entering all the physical retail volumes in Sitara for the East Desk . Let me know who you want us to give this information to on the Central Desk .
Linda , Sylvia , I need you to set up the Transco contracts as outlined below .

We will be billed commodity on the 4 contracts listed above . We will be billed demand on the contracts listed below . I'm sure I made a few typo's . thanks
I just spoke with John Hodge about Dayton's PEPL storage ( see items in BLUE below) . According to John , CES was not able to utilize the PEPL storage volumes . Hunter , someone on your desk needs to speak with Marke Breese and John Hodge about the Dayton Storage .
Are you ready for some FOOTBALL!! ! Sorry - that was just running thru my head . I am about to start sending everything I have to all you fine people . Transport I have the CES transport split between Wholesale and Retail . For the 1st , all CES transport will be in a file all to itself . The file is located at o:/logistics/capacity/east/ne/ces/2000ces01.xls . We have most of the retail contacts in Sitara , there should be a deal number in column U . Most of our transport problems for the 1st will come from the asset management deals . Ex . Tennessee MUNi's . How many of these are there? ? Good question . Good Luck Have fun ; )
I think that's enough stuff for now .
I don't think I have sent this to you yet . There are some ANR volumes down below .
Attached is the master list of contracts . I save this file as have an abundance of time on your hands so feel free to browse this tiny little worksheet . Call me if you have questions .
Deja Vu ! I'm waiting for those Final Final Revised Final numbers! !
This schedule just covers agencies with CES and CEM . For most pipelines , It does not cover contracts where CES is acting as agent for another counterparty . Call if you have questions .
Setting these up in Sitara will be part of my night job . I must have peace and quiet to focus on Transco .
How much of the NIMO capacity ( about 15,000 day of North to North ) was dedicated to retail ? From what I'm seeing , the retail volumes are looking fairly small .
According to Morgan at CES , the 5,000 dth purchase from Sempra is off ANR . Morgan is in our office today and will be here tomorrow afternoon . You may already know about this deal . Morgan handles all the nominations at East Ohio . Hunter , someone on the Central desk needs to talk to Morgan about this deal . Thanks
FYI - I believe this is important . According to Morgan ( CES's CNG scheduler ) CES currently has about 7,000 dth of idle capacity . I've had 3 people call me today looking for CNG capacity for Jan 2000 .

Dick bought some Agg gas from CNG Field Services Company - deal 143278 . Kimat entered this as TCO pool deal . The volume is currently 2187 dth per day . Dick said this volume should increase tomorrow . Robert , could you call CNG Field Services and get the upstream info ? They should give you an agg point - not the IPP pool . Thanks
I have all the CES and CEM capacity releases in Sitara We have; several contracts for Atlanta Gas Light - all CES , we have 3 small Boston Gas deals on 1 contract in Z6 - all CES we have 1 z3 to Z6 deal from S . Jersey - on CEM I still need to enter the PSNC capacity from St 85 to PSNC - real low on my priority list right now . I sent Janet Edwards at CES a request to get ENA set up as agent for CEM - this has not been done yet . Please show this email to the CES Transco scheduler for confirmation . ta da : )
Did you guys execute the PSNC contract? ? And if so - as CES or CEM? ? Also , I'd like to have the offer number . I think Transco is done except for PSNC . Transco Stuff I set up several Atlanta contracts and 2 storages - all CES I set up 3 small Boston Gas contracts - all CES . I set up the S Jersey capacity - CEM . I think thats it .
What pipe is this off of or is it split up between several? ?
Sorry if this is a duplicate - I don't remember if I sent this to you .
Why don't you guys try Pappa's Steakhouse ? It's about $20 - $30 a plate .

Please set up a meeting for this afternoon and invite the following people . Bob Superty Kathy Kelly Ed Terry Tricia Bowen Judy Townsend Dan Junek Chris Germany Victor Lamadrid Molly Johnson Randy Gay George Smith Maria Garza Mark Friedman Ami Chokshi Scott Mills Dave Nommenson David Scott - with CES Hopefully this will be a quick meeting .
David , I like to be include on the emails but I believe this will come from your people . Let me know if I need to do something .
Colleen will be attending via conference call .
Please discuss this with Morgan . I didn't know CGV had a delivery point off Transco .
Robert , please check on this with the TCO schedulers and let me know what you find out . Thanks
I don't think there are any Central Desk changes .
I don't understand the PA gas for Peco comments . Can you guys clear this up for me ?
I'm thinking about seeing them tomorrow - lettin' em chill . I'm going to try to make the Thursday 4:00PM appointment .
Hey team , I entered a sale of 10,659 in M3 for the 1st ( deal 144104) . This does not include anything that has PECO-PA gas . Morgan and/or Phil have to help me figure out what that is .
Dad is at Howard Johnson at 9604 S Main , room 403 , phone 713-666-1411
The 2000ces01.xls is the file I created . The other file was created by Jeff Hodge
How much of this capacity do we have for the first ?
Victor verified that the TCO storage is at 0 . He entered a volume of 1DT and the deal number is 143337 .
Final Final numbers? ?
CNG SAbine contact is Alain Diza 713-752-7690 .
Done , I think .
Is the TCO capacity from Eagle Point considered Retail or Wholesale ?
You are wonderful! !
Which pipe ?
Could you see if the retail people could use this worksheet format ? We may not be able to do this for everything but I believe we could use this format for Tennessee , CNG , Tennessee , Tetco and Texas Gas ( excluding AGL) . What do you think ?
Fred with Equitable said he has 2 deals with CES . 1 . Tennessee - Equitable is selling CES 2,500 day delivered to Zone 4 at NYMX + . 35 . Equitable has the trigger and this deal goes through March 2000 . CES is currently receiving this gas at Beldon & Blake . 2 . Tetco - CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April and Equitable is giving Equitable $.65 for the exchange . We call this a synthetic storage deal . Do you know anything about these deals ?
I'm sorry . I forgot to mention Kathy and I can't find these deals in our system .
Pop's just called me . He's done with his testing and he's going nuts staying in the Hotel . He is going home now , and will drive back tomorrow for the test results .
Beavy? ? I think the CES and CEM agencies are set up . I know I need to set up IT contracts in Sitara . And I think the agencies with other counterparties is at the bottom of the pile . Comments
I agree , you stay home . He didn't have any info on the test . He was ready to go. ,
Done again .
Hows your day
I need a new pipeline set up . CES currently has 1.5 BCF of LNG storage on this pipeline under 3 separate contracts . All 3 contracts expire 2/29/00 . Name: Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership Internet Address: Curve: Tetco M3 This deal is currently entered in Sitara under deal 142034 as CPR Storage on CGAS . We have withdrawals of 75,000 day from the 12th through the 31st . Linda , would you see if you have a copy of the contracts from CES ? Please let me know what I need to do .
What type of IT contract is CES contract #.6187? ? The contract description in Transit is Case-Pomeroy & Company , Inc . Hmmm ?
CES is buying 2500 dth/day from Equitable in Tenn Z4 . CES is selling 2500 dth/day to FirstEnergy in Tenn Z4 . Looks like a match to me . I told Fred with Equitable the information John Singer gave to Phil below . For future reference Fred's number is 412-395-3295 . A backup contact at Equitable is Steve Rafferty , 412-395-3268 . Per John , FirstEnergy bought the meter ( ?? ) from Beldon & Blake effective 12/1/99 . On CNG , we are showing a purchase ( deal 141688 ) and a sale ( deal 141952 ) for 2500 dth/day with Beldon & Blake . I don't see a sale anywhere to Also , I still see an Equitable supply ( deal 135956 ) on CNG for 3226 dth/day . I believe this is a duplicate of deal 138741 in Tetco M2 . Comments ?
I owe Victor $5.00 . I told him it would be 2 weeks before anything happened . You're right Victor , they are wonderful people . Victor , Robert or I will send through some meter request next week . Thanks

Please set up the following transport deals; #145949 & 145950
Please reserve a conference room for the people listed above at 3:00 PM , tomorrow . Mr . Javins will be present via conference call . thanks
CES has a synthetic storage deal with Equitable Gas Company on Texas Eastern . CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April 1999 and Equitable is giving CES the gas back in January 2000 in Tetco M2 . According to my new best buddy Fred at Equitable , CES will pay Equitable $.65 /dth after the January transaction is complete . Here are my questions/comments; 1 . David - please look at the new deal I created for this exchange ( deal 146788) . The existing deal ( deal 138741 ) is set up as a pipeline exchange . I believe the counterparty should be Equitable Gas Company which is the LDC . If it looks OK to you , I will kill the old deal and add the volumes to the new deal . Please let me know ASAP . 2 . Linda/David - do we have CES's contract with Equitable ? I would like to see a ) what CES was paying Equitable for this deal and b ) when the payment was due . 3 . David/Stephanie - if the deal is structured the way Fred described it above , where do we put the $.65 fee at ? 4 . Linda - Fred has not received any assignment notices regarding CES deals . He doesn't know if he should bill CES or Enron North America . Who should he talk to about that? ? Please forward this email to others that may need to see it . Thanks

Why Exercise?? ? 1 ) My grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was 60 . She's 97 now & we don't know where the hell she is . 2 ) The only reason I would take up jogging is so that I could hear heavy breathing again . 3 ) I joined a health club last year , spent about 400 bucks . Haven't lost a pound . Apparently you have to show up . 4 ) I have to exercise in the morning before my brain figures out what I'm doing . 5 ) I don't exercise at all . If God meant us to touch our toes , he would have put them further up our body . 6 ) I like long walks , especially when they are taken by people who annoy me . 7 ) I have flabby thighs , but fortunately my stomach covers them . 8 ) The advantage of exercising every day is that you die healthier . 9 ) If you are going to try cross-country skiing , start with a small country . 10 ) I don't jog . It makes the ice jump right out of my glass .

Contract 62039 was replace with contract 65402 . It's 20,000 day with a primary receipt of Maumee and a primary delivery of COH . The term is 11/1/99 - 10/31/2000 . Should I bill the retail group for this contract or does this belong to wholesale? ? Also , I'm showing a demand charge of $.15 .
Judy's name is not on the list either . What's up with that ?
Would you see if CES sent us a Sonat invoice for Dec or Nov ? I would like to see it . Thanks cg
Have I seen the Explorer? ? Nope . I just get to work for a living . I don't get to enjoy life's pleasures .
Is this the Eagle Point gas ?
Also , there is 5000/day of Leach to BG&E space at max rate for a term of 11/1/99 - 4/30/01 . Is this considered retail or wholesale ? I don't see any matching CGLG space to go with it . Is that correct ?
I'm showing the CNG/Nimo FTNNGSS capacity of 15,957 DT's and the MARQ as Wholesale - correct ?
I need to have a CES counterparty set up in global please . Customer Commonwealth Atlantic Limited Partnership ( CALP ) 12500 Fair Lakes Circle , Suite 200 I don't think CALP has assigned the contract to ENA . I have a copy of the agreement if anyone needs to see it . Thanks
I sold CES 1509/day starting the 14th - see deal 149770
I have more info on this deal - according to Colleen Sullivan , this is a CES Retail fuel management deal . ENA has the right to use the capacity and does all the nominations on the CALP contract . I still need the counterpart set up . Thanks Victor , for January , I have set this up as and exchange deal ( deals 149775 & 149776) . We may need to create 2 delivery exchange deals for constrained and unconstrained citygates . Scott , this is the deal we spoke about this morning . For January , we will treat this as an exchange . We need to chat about Feb and March .
I created a purchase from CES ( deal 149778 ) to replace the CPR STORAGE deal . Victor , please move the daily volumes to deal 149778 . As far as I can tell , ENA should not be billing CES for their storage gas . So , we should show a purchase from CES for the storage gas . Of course it will get much more complicated once we resolve all of the retail issues .

Per John Grass - CES sold Eagle Point gas on ANR ( deal 136749 ) at ANR IF +.01 . and bought Eagle Point gas on CGAS ( deal 149838 ) at CGAS IF +.005 . The sale to Eagle Point is in Sitara . I just added the purchase deal on CGAS , it was not in Sitara . Per John - Eagle Point is guaranteed to recover the ANR variable cost plus $.02 .
We know about this don't we Judith!! !
This is in Sitara .
Email works good . Do you know which deal I should put that on ?
No replying this late at night . Then I don't have an excuse for not doing my job .
I just created deal 149901 , an Equitrans , capacity deal . I populated all the fields because Sylvia Campos had created the information prior to my creating the deal . After I released the deal , the pipeline contract and agency contract disappearred .
The Equitrans capacity deals exist! !
I have very little info on this deal . Who pays for the FT on Equitrans ? Contract 270 , volume=1,000/day , start date = 7/1/97 , max demand , all receipts and all deliveries , AND the end date is 10/31/2099 ( looks suspicious to me) . Scott is trying to find the term of this deal from Equitrans . I believe Equitrans did say this is a capacity release deal . Scott , I'm going to list this as a wholesale deal for now . It was not on my wholesale transport worksheet from Mark Breese . Please email everyone with the end date when you find out . Also , please find out who the releasing shipper is and the primary receipt and delivery points . Thanks
Done - take a look .
Thanks Buddy
Not yet . However , the contract is valid because Vickie is using it .
I believe this was suppossed to be a much bigger deal . There was some confusion between CES and Eagle Point and it ended up just being more or less and exchange deal on ANR and a transport deal on CGAS .

We bought gas from Keyspan at $5.00 intraday today . We are shipping that IT to Emporia , Fuel is 1.52% . I estimated $.07 for fuel and $.17 for commodity . See deal 118105 .
CNG Transport from NIMO Contract 5A1866 Demand Dec $5.7690 Jan $5.7500 Feb 5.7510 Commodity $.0456 ( CNG does not bill the commodity part of GRI , also the commodity rate does not change during the term of the deal ) Note This should be valued at generic North to North space . CNG Volume 15957 Note: We have no value for this much MARQ . We might be able to use about 3,000 dth of this . I have a call in to Greg Synder at CNG . Greg is in the rates group . I believe it works like this; we pay max IT for gathering (  $.1980 for Jan) , If you have MARQ , the rate drops to $.1440 . IT is a pain to nominate . I will verify that this is the way it works with Greg . Contract 65403 Rate $4.8621 Rec Point Leach Del Point BG&E

I'm throwing away anything on my desk with Gatherco . I'm assuming you and Ms . Jordan are taking care of everthing on that .

So send her allllll of your paper .
My good buddy Scott set up contract . 9047 in Sitara . Please note: do not schedule gas on this contract . This contract was set up for accounting purposes only .
Here are the buy/sells we did after lunch . Supply Deal Market Deal The purchases are from CPA and the sells are to CES . Originally these deals were done for the 21st , I just extended the date and the volumes through the Let me know if you have any questions .
This is the way I show the Dayton Power exchange deal starting 1/21/2000 , please let me know if this is incorrect . ENA delivered gas to Dayton's TGT citygate . In return , Dayton is giving ENA gas at various CGAS citygates . There are no fees for this transaction . The TGT deal is 152766 , the CGAS deal is 153213 . The volumes on these deals should match . Also , Dayton should not be using any ENA supply ( pool gas or ENA storage ) to supply the CGAS citygate volume . Victor , I did not put a meter number on the CGAS deal . Also , it's time to introduce Steve Gillespie to Sitara .
Sorry it took so long . I believe this was the last email I sent out .
Hey , I'm too tired to think so I started going thru my emails . Here is what your buddy wrote up and its not exactly correct .
I forgot about this deal .
Please check on the actual storage capacity volume on FSS contract 63304 . I'm showing 7,503,838 dth and I'm thinking it might be closer to 7,000,000 . Thanks
Hi guys . We need to add the CES demand charges to the East Desk P&L . The impact to the desk is ( $694,399) . This includes the demand charge paid to CALP and the reimbursements for the Penn Fuel capacity . It does not include any demand charges paid to Dayton Power & Light . How are we accounting for that ? The file is under o:/logistics/capacity/east/ne/ces/2000ces01.xls Use tab CES WHOLESALE . All the demand charges under CES RETAIL are reimbursed . I sure we are missing some things . Scott Goodell will be going through this worksheet tomorrow .
I made a couple of changes . This worksheet will be your top priority for Friday .
I'm at work , where are you? ?
Deal 150348 . I have it in Sitara as 833 day for the 15th-31st . This deal is secondary recallable , which means the gas don't flow if secondary transport gets cut .
Do you mean an ENA sale to Keyspan ?
We should chat about CALP and Dayton Power & Light . Victor , should we invite Joany ?
Kim , please send Victor and myself an amtel message at 11:00am AND at 1:30pm on Feb 1 to attend the meeting below . Please include the room and time on the amtel . I think it will be a busy day . Thanks
I bet you think I have been ignoring you , right ? Does this mean I don't have to read all those emails you sent me ?
What did we do about this ? I'm thinking we let it flow .
Would you send me an amtel at 3:00pm Wed , Jan 26 about my review ? Thanks
You must have put a lot of thought in this . P
I think we chatted about this the other day . I'm waiting to see if we actually get the retail deal before I send any notification . Hopefully we will know the first or second week in Feb . I wouldn't tell Steve its not a done deal yet . Just tell him we are still working things out .
Should this deal be extended ?
This looks like IT stuff to me .
I was just denied access to deal 145893?? ? What's up ?
We extended the date and changed this to evergreen . Thanks

I replaced deal 155238 with 157242 and I fixed the metered volumes for the last day on deal 155244 .
I'm sure I asked this question before - ENA will be paying all transport cost for January , even if we did not get set up as agent , correct ?
I just created a deal for TRCO contract 3.3433 ( deal 157600) . This is the master contract for all ENA deals on rate schedule FTSR . We will be doing nominations under this contract .
This is ok . I sold them 767 for the 27th and 28th . I told Bryan to make sure he doesn't need the 767 for the 29th - 31st .
We have a 2500 dt/day supply from Equitable in Tenn Z4 . This deal is matched with a term sale to FirstEnergy ( deal 145648 for Jan and deal 157848 for Feb and Mar) . This is a John Singer deal . I have no idea what the price is on the sale to FirstEnergy .
Just wanted to make sure you received this .
We bought 1800 from CES/Allied Signal ( deal 158112 ) and sold to EES ( deal 158120 ) for the 29th-31st . This gas is coming from Allied Signal . Lee Tippet thought the contract number was 62672 . Joany , would you verify that , thanks .
Has CES global contract 96030669 / 65071 been transferred from CES to ENA ?
How about we move it to ENA .
Could you find the deal ticket for Trco k#2.7055 ? May
Sherry is waiting to make the payment - you guys tell me how to set this up ( CES - Cove Point or Cove Point)??? ?
Hey , we made a mistake and set up tetco contract 892510 as FTS . I killed deal 155389 and created deal 158412 . sorry
Please set up the following Sonat contract with ENA as agent for CES Pipeline Southern Natural Firmness Firm\ Service Type CSS Rate CSS Term Term
We still have CGLF and CGAS contracts showing up as CES and Columbia Market in Navigator . Scott and I will look at contracts 42789 , 63115 , and 66278 . Please let Scott know if you need any of the remaining contracts moved over to ENRON N A . Thanks .
I just sold CES 8980 day for 1st and 2nd at the CGAS pool for International Paper - deal 159101 .
Hi team . Guess what day it is??! !
It's ok to increase . I spoke with Kate about it . Increase your Emporia volumes .
I'm almost positive I approved of this deal and I didn't tell you . Do you have any comments to add ? I'm going to forward this to Scott and Dick and ask them how they would like for me to handle this . Do not share any of this with CES . Thanks .
I believe you did a fixed priced deal with Craig Taylor . The price is $3.06 . Could you get me the meter numbers ? This is what I have so far COH Mrkt Area Monthly Vol Meter
I just updated the transport rate and corrected some of the points .
Reminder
CES was cut 7314 at WGL on CGAS for the 1st . I sold CES the gas on TRCO for the 1st and the 2nd ( deal 159474) .
Per my discussion with Joann , it looks like we have covered this 240 dth at meter 80-03 on CGAS .
Opps - for gas flow day 2/1/2000 .
Robin only bought 2074 dt's for the 2nd . According to the sheet , the Tenn Z6 volumes were 2220 dt's . I told Brian at CES we were going to short Energy North by 146 dt's ( the requested 1227 dt's but we only have 1081 dt's) . Please let me know how you sourced the gas .
My mistake - we are talking about the 2nd . Brian , do we need to do anything for the 1st ?
We bought 8000 ( deal 160324 ) and sold it to CES in CPA 4-25 ( deal 160327 ) for the 2nd .
Brian with CES just called me and asked if we could take the cut at Colonial ? Let me know .
Alain and I are meeting for a little drink ( maybe dinner too ) tomorrow after work . I won't be in the office tomorrow . Alain , my pager number is 1-800-978-1788 . You can leave a voicemail or a numeric message . I will call you tomorrow afternoon around 3 or 4 pm .
Jim asked me to forward this to you . We should probably discuss this .
You're probably gone anyway . I'll think of this as "my note in a bottle" . Stumpy and his wife Martha went to the state fair every year . Every year Stumpy would say , "Martha , I'd like to ride in that there airplane." And every year Martha would say , "I know Stumpy , but that airplane ride costs ten dollars , and ten dollars is ten dollars." One year Stumpy and Martha went to the fair and Stumpy said , "Martha , I'm 71 years old . If I don't ride that airplane this year I may never get another chance." Martha replied , "Stumpy that there airplane ride costs ten dollars , and ten dollars is ten dollars." The pilot overheard them and said , "Folks , I'll make you a deal . I'll take you both up for a ride . If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and not say one word , I won't charge you , but if you say one word it's ten dollars." Stumpy and Martha agreed and up they go . The pilot does all kinds of twists and turns , rolls and dives , but not a word is heard . He does all his tricks over again , but still not a word . They land and the pilot turns to Stumpy , "By golly , I did everything I could think of to get you to yell out , but you didn't." Stumpy replied , "Well , I was gonna say something when Martha fell out , but ten dollars is ten dollars."
A much better "note in bottle thrown out to sea"! ! I didn't actually write all this mushy stuff . Someone sent it to me .

Sold 7000 to CES at meter 30AL for tomorrow - deal 169576 . The meter is not set up in Sitara . I sent a meter request to Faye Ellis .
500 and 800 are both Zone 1
Did you do the server bounce for me ? If not , it does not have to be done by I know nothing about Sonat . Sorry about that .
Hey , I glance at that photo every now and then and all I can say is Huba
I promise to be a perfect gentleman ( or as perfect as an Aggie can be) .
When you get a chance would you redraft the CES invoice and call me ? Thanks 3-4743
Bay States will be sending us an invoice for an Algonquin meter bounce fee . I would like to see when it gets here . It's not in the system , but Meredith and I will take care of after I get the invoice . Please call me if any of you come accross it . thanks cg 3-4743
Here is what I have so far . One of the floor tech's I chat with is Ishi Carter . His number is 713-853-5580 . I learned some things today . Ishi said Enron hires techies through 2 companies New Boston Technologies ( 713-626-4900 ) and Comsys ( 713-547-0700) . Techies work for these companies for 6 months and then Enron may or may not make them an offer . Ishi said it would be ok for you to call him . But , I'm thinking I should at least know your name first . Also , we have a ton of other IT type people in the company I'm going to chat with . I get you more scoop later .
I just sent you and email . Feel free to mention my name to Ishi . More names later today !
CES needs meter 30AL - Allied 7000 day
Joann , just do this on the baseload ticket if you can . I do like to see the incremental stuff though . Thanks
Sold 7000 to CES at 30AL for the 19th-22nd deal 169576 . We are getting the gas at Broad Run
Hey , how's my little boy doing ? When's the big ski trip ?
I included this on my worksheet . Here are some numbers you may need to reach me this weekend . Pager 800-978-1788 does not work at my Dad's house . And , you can leave me a voice message on my pager . Home Phone 713-426-1460 Dad's number 409-858-3818 I won't be going to my Dad's until Sunday morning , returning on Monday . This file is located at o:/logistics/capacity/east/NE/CES/CES Invoice Thanks
GET OUT ! No Way ? I think I'll change something in the system . I think its just the demand charge . Algon only has 2 firm commodities that we have worked with and both are fairly cheap . Most of the Algon expense is in the demand charge .
FYI , not the markets I was hoping to see .
Does any of this impact the Central Desk ?
My worksheet has a lot of support for the pricing we billed for January . Take a look at the worksheet and give me a call . We probably will not be able to cover everything at once . We still have a few items to bill . I will let you know what those items are and when we expect to bill them .
I just created "2000bug03.xls" and "2000tran03.xls" . Joe , we will continue to use the CES Wholesale tab in the 2000tran03 worksheet .
I sold 7000 to CES at the Allied meter for tomorrow - deal 169576 . Joann , let the Tenn schedulers know what additional volumes you need at Broad Run .
I knew we would have to address this eventually . CES is long 3600/month in TGT Z4 at CG&E . I showed them a $2.66 bid for tomorrow . Before I had worked up the price , CES decided to take the gas into CGAS at Lebanon . This gets real messy . Is there any way we can refuse this ? At first , I was thinking we would have to do this . Now , I don't like the idea because it will be really messy in the summer .
I didn't have this email when I left yesterday .
Always a pleasure :o )
You go girl !
CES has decided to take 600 dth/day of their Texas Gas Zone 4 length into CGAS at Lebanon for the 24th-29th . To keep the deal tickets simple , I am showing a purchase from CES at Lebanon for 600 dth/day at the first of the month CGAS price . Joe , I created a purchase from CES ( deal 202576) . Match this up with 600dth of deal 159319 . We will effectively be using 600 dth less of Dayton space for CES starting on the 24th . I will let you know if things change .
Hey ! Did you ever chat with my buddy Ishi ? Are you going to work for Enron ? We get discounted deal tickets to Astroworld every April - you don't want to miss that! !
Hey . It's international friend week . I'm sending Natasha an international friend email . I'll send you the email that I send her .

What do you think . What's your wife's name ? I'm going to mention you and your wife in my email .
Nonono . That profile is for Natasha - not me .
My techy's going to help me buy a computer . I'm thinking of buying a Dell Pent III 600 Mhz with a bunch of other stuff I know nothing about and an HP8? ? color printer . I was also going to buy a digital camera and start taking a lot more family photo's and save them to disk . What do you think ? I was also going to try and create a home page and keep track of the stuff I plan on doing . 1st up is Hang Gliding the first weekend in March . I have not registered yet . Cool huh ? Time for my free meal :o ) SEE YA ! Comments/ suggestions ?
Let's see , got a freebie at the Blue Agave last night ( Mexican food) , they fed us Curmley's ( crossaint sandwiches and tortilla soup ) yesterday , breakfast yesterday and today and tomorrow and Monday .

Jeff Porter is the CES person responsible for looking at their transport . Last week , he said he was working on their transport numbers . Also , yesterday I informed Jeff about some transport CGAS had listed on the EBB .
Good news , even better when it happens . My contract at CES , Brian Perrone , just told me CES will pay the invoice we billed them . They still need to reconstruct January . Billing I still need to work on January capacity and sales to CES . I found a significant amount of transport I left out of January . I want to fix the Feb capacity sheet and bill CES tomorrow or Fri for capacity and the scheduling fee . The Feb invoicing should be much cleaner and ready to go out by the 10th .
I love Chic Fe Le .
11:30 am am Dear Producers and Shippers , In January , you were notified that the Schultz Gas Processing Plant would be permanently shut down on February 29 , 2000 . We heard from many of you regarding the financial hardship this shut down may cause Schultz area producers while a gas delivery alternative was being constructed . Given your concerns and given that natural gas liquids prices have risen sufficiently to allow operations at Schultz to be marginally profitable , CNG Transmission will continue to operate the Schultz facility until: 1 . it becomes uneconomic to continue operations or , 2 . CNG develops a compression/pipeline alternative for delivering and processing the Schultz area gas elsewhere on its system . We remain committed to serving producers throughout the Appalachian Basin and hope this operating decision addresses the concerns voiced by you . If you have any questions regarding this notice , please contact Joe Thompson at ( 304 ) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at ( 304 ) 623-8705 . Sincerely , Director , Producer Services and Business Development
Please match deal 204176 ( CES sale Mar-May ) with deal 209005 ( what do you think , CES buy Mar-May) .
Please match deal 203315 ( CES sale for Mar ) with deal 209122 .
Here is what Vickie told me about capacity on your pipeline after you eliminate segmenting . Example #1 Assumtion: PECO has 10,000 dt/day of telescoped capacity with a primary delivery point of PECO in Z6 . What will Enron and PECO be able to schedule Iff PECO releases 10,000 dt/day of St 65 to PECO citygate under the following scenarios; PECO schedules gas from St 30 to WSS , and Enron schedules gas from PECO schedules gas from St 30 to St 65 , and Enron schedules gas from St 65 to Assumtion #2: PECO released Enron 10,000 dt/day of telescoped capacity . Enron schedules gas from St 30 to WSS , and from Tetco/Ragley to Z6 ?

nuthing but retail stuff . Why would anyone do retail stuff ?
Meredith , please path deal 209359 with 209371 for Jan 31 . This should capture the meter bounce fee ENA owes Bay State . Sherry , I don't remember who gave me this invoice . I will leave it on your desk .
M , these deals should show up in Unify by lunchtime today . Sherry , you guys should see this after lunch . Thanks .
Uhhh- you bet !
Call me if you have questions .
I believe we need to assign someone from the Central Desk to be the point person for CES Central Desk activity , for pricing and scheduling issues . CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon citygates . ENA delivers the gas to different Michcon citygates and each one has a different BTU factor . This causes CES to be long or short depending on the conversion factor . I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it but I would prefer to have someone from the Central Desk address this issue . Comments ?
Do you think Scott should go to this? ?
Done . Deal 210603 I just plugged/fugged/guessed at the demand charge . When Dana does her voodoo stuff , this deal will show up . Ms . Franklin , this might be my last contract to set up ( he he he <=== evil snicker!) .
I'm going to change the sell to CES on Monday for now . I will chat with my CES counterpart this afternoon about how to treat this .
Joe , it looks like we have already had some buy/sale activity . I'm not touching until you and I chat . I will talk to my counterpart this afternoon .
She's still a porker as of this morning .
I sold 30,000 for the balance of the month starting tomorrow to CES Who schedules this gas ?
Robin did a buy/sale on algo for tomorrow only . Match deal 211356 with thanks

Let's see . Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought I heard Jeff say "let me know if there is anything I can do to help" get those invoices out . Run that through the Chris translator and I would interpret that to mean "I welcome the opportunity to learn more about the CES sales/purchase contract and would be overjoyed at pricing the 30 plus 1st of the month pricing scenarios."
I think this is a Central Desk contract or its one of our agency contract . We have so many . Do you have a Sitara deal number ?
You left 2 TRCO invoice questions on my desk . 1 . Contract 3.3558 - this is a volumetric release from PSNC for CES Retail . The demand and commodity invoice come in together I believe . 2 . Contract 3.3509 - ? ? ? I don't understand this one . Take a look at k#1.3473 . Did we receive a demand charge on 1.3473 and not have the demand estimated in Sitara ? I may need to add 1.3473 and 0 3.3509 . Let me know what you find .
Scott misspelled your name . I hope I have the right guy . I listed one of the CES issues down below . The other issue I have is pricing . I'm not familiar enough with the Central Region to check the pricing . I will try to get with you this afternoon . Just a note , I bet I spent at least 2.5 hours on the phone with CES last Friday . Thanks cg

Hey Team ! Ms . "Terry" Franklin is part of the team now . Make sure you copy her on any appalachian/local production issues . She will be the one setting this up in Sitara in the future . Thanks .
Just to keep you in the loop . I have not responed to any of these questions yet .
Here are a couple of demand charges I don't understand . AGL released CES some ESR ( offer #18307 ) and WSR ( offer #18210) . The demand portion of these contracts being billed on k#1.3473 . What's up .
Just a note . Effective April 1st , we will not have the purchase at St 85 or the PSNC transport . This is a new contract each month - we are currently
I luv trucks . I was injured on Sunday , I use crutches now .
Hi . I will not be able to attend because I'm dislocated my ankle and I'm crutchin it now .
Who wuz receiving the bills on contracts 2.6598 and 2.6592 in December ? Wuz it CES or Union Camp ? Thank U
Not for me , I'm injured - I dislocated my ankle on Sunday .
Can you tell me which pools this impacts and how much by pool ( hastings , Bridgeport . .. )
I was running down a hill during my hanggliding class , lost my balance , stepped in a hole and dislocated my ankle . Jerry was taking the class with me . He was laughing really hard until he saw my foot. . If I was sitting in a chair holding my leg straight out and facing North , the bottom of my foot was facing North East . I got to ride in an ambulance to the hospital . I didn't hear this but the Dr . told them to take me to "a very quiet room" . He popped my foot back in place and sent me to x-ray . I don't have any broken bones but the ligaments are probably all torn up . I go to an orthopedic surgeon tomorrow . Right now , I have an ace bandage wrapped around a fiberglass support . I think you should buy one of those 4 door short bed Nissan Pickup Trucks . What are you looking for in a truck ?
Do you know if anyone in my office is using this on a daily basis ?
I have mixed comments on Dodge's . I think either of the other vehicles are perfect .
Did you get the PSNC invoice ? Can I throw mine away now ?
Personally , I think you should buy a F150 extended cab 4x4 with the 17" wheels . To heck with gas mileage when you look so cool .
Meredith , I see both of the Bay States deals in Unify on the 31st . I remember chatting with deal clearing about it yesterday . Could you path those deals and email Mark when you are done . Mark , I'm expecting you to see the amount of the invoice come across in Unify after Meredith paths the gas . Just a note , we will probably be billed interest because the payment is late . I think it was due on 2/26/2000 .
How does this deal work - deal 165385 ?
Opps . Wrong worksheet This is what I have . Good luck .
Kate left us a bid form for NYSEG capacity . For CNG , I would prefer to have the Cornwell space . I think the South Webster goes with Tenn Z4 . Dick , other than CES , do you know what our CNG citygate positions are starting April ?
Your primary contact for Central Desk activities is Kevin Ruscitti . His phone number is 713-853-6320 . I recommend that you still use me as your primary contact to email bidweek numbers ( with Scott Goodell as my backup) . I will forward the bid week numbers to all the East Desk schedulers and the Central Desk schedulers . After bidweek , you should contact Kevin with all Central Desk issues and myself for all East Desk issues . Let me know if you have any comments or questions .

Looks good . Hey !
Is contract 62164 a valid contract on CGAS ? It was highlighted in red in the 2000ces02.xls sheet . I updated the info based on what I see in Navigator and highlighted it in yellow . And , if this is a valid deal , we need to add it to
Same thing on k#65403 And k#65534 - I left this one in red .
Angie , this is not anything to worry about right now . When you estimate your flowing volumes for May , you need to decrease the total volume at Hastings by 3000 dth . I will try to remind you . Kim , please send me an AMTEL at 1:00pm on 4/24/2000 "REMIND ANGIE TO REDUCE HASTINGS BY 3,000 FOR MAY"

Jeff Porter and I have discussed this several times over the last week .
I believe Beverly uses this to get the gas from Nat Fuel to Transco .
Look a funny !
This was the original message Jeff Porter was responding to .
When you get a chance , would you path out deal 211642 please ? For Feb and Mar ?

Lindsey Elise Townsend Born 3:08pm has already learned to roll her eyes like all women do . Of course , her Mom is an expert .
Nope . That would involve reading .
Dear Mom , Let's try this with Beal . Daisy ( woof woof )
Should we stop withdrawing ?
Hey . What is your professional opinion about this ? This was sent to me by my scheduler . I assume this just means that if you don't have primary NIMO capacity on CNG , NIMO will continue to assign CNG capacity to you each month . True ? SENT VIA FAX , E-MAIL & WEBSITE NOTICE TO ALL MARKETERS PARTICIPATING IN BALANCED AGGREGATION: In accordance with P.S.C . No . 218 Gas Tariff , Leaf No . 184.2 , Niagara Mohawk will continue to assign CNG capacity unless a final determination in the gas rate case precludes Niagara Mohawk from such assignment . If you filed an Affidavit of Firm Transportation Capacity with Niagara Mohawk last fall and the contract number for the capacity is still valid , Niagara Mohawk will continue to honor that contract and will not release CNG capacity to you . However , if the contract has expired , you must either re-submit an Affidavit with a valid contract number or Niagara Mohawk will assign CNG capacity to you . The Affidavits are due Niagara Mohawk by the 25th of March , 2000 . Capacity will be assigned the week of March 20th for the month of April . If you have any questions , please call Dennis Bartlett at 315-460-4042 or me at 315-460-4041 . Thank you . Janice Bailey Manager Transportation Services Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation

I will not be attending .
CES needs 17dts/day of Mountaineer gas for the rest of March . The request was made by Kim Novesak? ? I will be out this afternoon . Please call Brian Perrone ( 703-561-6486 ) or Scott Goodell at 713-853-7711 . Thanks
Sorry guys . I'm still working on the February invoice to CES . I estimate that everyday this invoice does not get out cost Enron about $4,000 a day . Feel free to call my boss Scott Neal about the problems you are having .
Do we have an invoice from CGAS of Ohio ? I would like to see it if we do . I don't show any record of a deal like this . I'm going to send an email to my CES contact to see if he shows anything in his notes about this .
Brian , we have a deal we can't identify . Do you show anything in your records about purchasing 3,575 dt's on Jan 20th or 21st ? It looks like a 1 day deal and we bought the gas delivered from CGAS of Ohio . The delivery point in our system is 23N but that may be wrong . The price would be somewhere around $16.00 .
Do we currently have any Mountaineer or West Virginia production ?
Robert , I changed the volumes on the CES buy/sale deals 204462 and 204471 . I just entered a volume for the last day of the month . You don't need to do this right away , when you get a chance go into Unify for Feb and show an actual volume of 0 for the 25th - 28th and a volume of 991014 for the 28th . Then retrack and balance . Jeff , I will include these deals on my manual billing worksheet to you . You should be able to apply the payments to these deals .
I think we are good to go .
Jeff , I believe the manual billing items are in the "febsaleinv2.xls" file . I will be out for the rest of the afternoon . I will try to touch base with you later today . Brian , all of the support for the billing is in the "2000ces02.xls" worksheet .
1 . The index premium of $.032 is correct . 2 . Kimat Singla entered this deal in the system and it shows Maureen Smith as the ENA trader and Tim Ray as the EES trader . You should ask one of those 3 people . Enron North America Corp .
Nope . It probably should . It would also be flashed as a reimbursement .
I'm going to respond to everyone on the email with my comments but I just wanted to make sure I undersand the blue highlighted comments below . Please call me when you get a chance . Thanks
How did it go ?
Occasionally , when I have a question , I call my little EES buddies to get a better understanding of a specific LDC . I don't mention CES and I assume that's ok .
Is your Gain ID "ONX1666" ?
Kim is taking care of that invoice . Thanks
Hi gang . You guys may or may not be interested in this . The files "febsaleinv1.xls" and "febsaleinv2.xls" are excel formats of ENA's invoice to CES for the month of Feb . The "2000ces02.xls" file is where Goodell and I keep track of the CES transport demand charges and all the transport pricing . There is also a tab in this file called CGAS . I use the data in this tab to calculate the sale to CES on CGAS . It is a completly manual process . I believe it would be benificial for all of you to at least understand the pricing ( excellent performance review stuff) . I do want to go over the data in the CGAS tab just to make sure I'm looking at the data correctly . Thanks .
Did you ever send CES copies of the demand charges for Jan 2000 . My contact , Brian Perrone , said he has not seen them .
Were you just sending me the invoices as you get them or was it a box of invoices at one time ?
Hey - whats this "was" stuff??? ?
I'm a bad person . I forgot to tell you I sold CES 880 to 1000 day at the pool starting tomorrow on deal 217775 Also , I just sold CES 2500/day at CGLF Mainline starting the 16th-31st , deal 217854 . This gas is for Atistech . I assume we schedule that .
I'm so sorry . I hope things go well for you .
Hey , I'm not going to the party tonight . My William's ticket is yours .
Would you research this please ? Thanks
I spoke with Brian at CES .  He does not show this deal in his records . I don't show it in my records either .
I got it . Thanks
Attached is the storage schedule for CES . Scott , according to Colleen , this will take up a significant amount of someone's time to track .
I took the Egan Storage demand charge to 0 in the CES Wholesale worksheet until David can determine it we have accounted for the charge someplace else . The monthly demand charge is $125,000.00 .
CNG would like to stop by the office to do some TTT training next Wed , Thur , or Fri . Please let Marde know if you have a preference as to which day you would like to meet with CNG . I may or may not be here . Thanks
And modest too .
Brian Perrone with CES is asking me if they should pay the invoice for CNG Field Services for January . The volume is 13,113 MMBtu at a price of $2.61 . The delivery point is Caragie/CPA at Jefferson . I'm not sure what to tell him . I would have charged them $2.78 for this gas ( CGAS IF plus max IT transport) .
AND you are a good cook and you smell good too !
There is only a small chance that I will attend . Vic , make sure and/or Angie go .
Robin purchased 8500 dts from Con Ed intra day on the 15th . These are the changes I made in Transit on contract 3.2067 Activity Prev Volume New Volume 767169 25000 15000 Adjusted sale to Con Ed at meter 6571 down by 10000 789154 0 1500 Adjusted sale to Con Ed at meter 1183 up by 1500 789274 0 8500 ? ? ? Robin or Kate will go to jail for this one .
Nope . I think Gloria is though . I know Victor is but he is out the rest of this week .
Nope . Cove Point is a wholesale asset .
My CES buddy is starting to focus on local production now . What's bad is CES has seen some of the pricing for the local production , I was going to bill them a lot more for it . That does not mean they agree to the pricing .
Would you guys please give the latest CGAS number for CES ? You know , thats where you give the total volume delivered by day on ENA , CALP , and Dayton transport . Thanks
I know we have not been treating storage correctly in Sitara . I would like to disscuss the best way to handle the CES storage . It involves several pipelines . Who should I talk to ? On some storage contracts , ENA will buy the gas from CES on withdrawals and sell the gas to CES on injections . On other storage contracts , CES will give ENA a predetermined injection schedule . However , ENA will make the acutal injection and withdrawal decisions . Which means , what we bill CES will be different from what actually happens . I know this is what we did with BUG , I just don't know how to do it . Who do I need to meet with to discuss CES storage ?
I want to make sure Joni sees everyting on CGAS as well .
Brenda was able to obtain a copy of the CES Egan storage contract . We don't have a copy of the letter assigning the contract to ENA though . We do have copies of the invoices for Jan and Feb . The invoices are addressed to ENA which is good enough for me . I am going to set the contract up as an ENA contract effective Jan 1 , unless someone has an objection . Brenda will give a copy of the contract to Sylvia . Egan does not have a contract number so Brenda will determine that . Also , the contract has an evergreen provision but I don't think we should set it up that way . Let me know if you have questions . thanks cg
Dick , I don't have this deal in my records as a sale to CES . When you get back , let's look at your deal sheet and see if there are any notes .
FYI - need an upgrade on the 22nd . thanks
I understand . I'm involved because it may have been used to serve CES . If we used it to serve CES , I should have called CES to negotiate a price and thats what I don't see in my records .
I guess we won't be having dinner for a while , huh ? The web site is in the first paragraph . Have fun !
As you all know I'm handicapped and its not because I'm a agiee . Borrowed 10,000 dt from CNG Transmission intraday on the 17th , deal 219976 . Payback 10,000 dt over the weekend , 18th-20th , deal 219982 . ENA will pay CNG $.03 times the ending daily balance . Please let me know if you have any questions . thanks 3-4743
Please set up the following Service Type , Rate Sched combinations . Pipe Code EGHP Firmness Firm Service Type Storage Term Term thanks
I made a mistake the Borrowed deal is 220270 the payback deal is 220254
I extended Sitara deal 143323 thru march . This is a Boston Gas release to CES SS-1 contract . Should we release this to ENA ?
Nope .
Nope .
Let's try this again . I now have all the deals . Today , I took the price to 0 for the following deals 209176 and 209178 . All the other deals do not have any pricing . I would like to know the economic impact of taking the prices out before Scott see this in the morining report .
Ohh my poor ankle! ! Do you care ?
I changed the price on deal 145638 . I show we should make about $19,000.00 . Let me know what you see, .
Good . I'll be expecting you .
I just set up a new storage contract for Egan Hub Partners . Deal 205633 .
What's your work number ? I'm updating my Lotus Notes Database and I left my day planner at home - too much weight in the backpack .
I just changed the demand charge on the Penn Fuel capacity from 6.53 to 6.423 ( deal 205687) . I changed the price on the Penn Fuel released demand from 6.449 to 6.423 ( deal 205672) . We were billed 6.423 in January . That's an odd rate when everthing else was 6.50 .
I don't know if you ever got copies of the invoices . Everything given to me for you guys was actually wholesale stuff . However , I getting copies as I work on actualizing the demand charge sheet for Jan . I will make copies an send them to Brian . Brian , what is your mailing address ?
The Egan storage contract expires on August 31,200 . This is an evergreen contract which will automatically renew for 12 months unless either party gives 90 day written notice to end the contract . I believe it will probably be one of you three looking at this . Which one of you is it ? I left a copy of the contract on Susan's desk . Susan , you can toss this .
I sold another 30,000 for the balance of the month starting tomorrow to CES
I had this filed in the wrong spot . These are John's citygate production deals .
Hey Doug , could you change my email address in your system to thanks
Hey Buddy , would you change my email address to Chris.Germany@enron.com please . Thanks
I will assume you de' man on this one . This deal terminates effective 3/31/2000 . FYI - all BUG terminate effective
Done ! What's next ?
I updated the Transco rates and fuel for April . It is in the "Offseason Rate" tab in the "2000tran03" file .
I tried calling you last night but your phone just kept ringing . AND , John Kinder called me this morning and told me I didn't get my capacity . He said the winter goes for max rate and I bid $.16 , but the goober would not give me a good feel for what it went for .
It's not in the worksheet .
I sold CES 2727dt of CGLF mainline gas ( deal 221731 ) effective 21st-31st . Aristech only had enough mainline capacity to pull away 751 dt . I changed the volume on this deal and created another sale to CES at the CGAS pool ( deal 222359 ) for a volume of 1917 dt . 1976 at mainline less fuel of 2.988% = 1917 at the CGAS pool . . 1045 variable cost mainline to Leach . 0250 demand charge Please let me know if you have any questions .
For the balance of March , CNG has granted ENA fuel waivers from Iroq/Canajoharie to the following CNG citygates; NIMO ( East & West) , NYSEG , and Hanley & Bird . According to this morning's sheet , we are delivering about 11,000 dt to these 4 delivery points . Following are 2 ways of getting the gas into CNG at Canajoharie . 1 . Idle some of our Tenn Z6 capacity and flow Iroquois in to CNG . At today's prices we save: Savings Tenn Variable $.0491 at $3.00 CNG Fuel $.0672 at $2.88 Total Savings $.1151 At these prices , if the Tenn Z6 and CNG pool spread is inside $.1100 , we should idle Tenn capacity and deliver Iroq to Canajoharie 2 . Buy Waddington , get an IT discount from Wadd to Canajoharie . We save the CNG fuel cost . This usually only works when Iroq shows a discounted rate of Last year , CNG granted most of these fuel waivers all summer .
I always have time for you . I'm out all day tomorrow .
funny . Oh my poor foot . Noone cares about me .
Looks pretty empty so far .
That's all good and well buy where is my Diet Coke?? ?
I will be emailing all of you with any capacity issues I find . CGLF k#64502 ; This is an offshore FTS2 contract that we use with the West Cam Devon production . The demand charge is $1.4381 on a volume of 29,000 dts and the commodity is $.0024 . According to my notes; this is a volumetric demand contract and the volumetric demand charge in my sheet is $.0648 I am changing this to a regular demand charge contract in Sitara and the worksheet .
I don't think 3rd times a charm . Did you go to scholl at a&m buddy?? ?
For Jan , the difference between volumetric and demand was less than $200.00 Enron Capital Management
I'm out tomorrow and if I win the Lotto tomorrow nite , Mr . Goodell will be a busy fellow . I think I visit Tahitti
That's ok . I need to buy back the gas CES is not taking . I think that will be easier to do after the month is over . I will calculate the volume and pricing in a worksheet and just enter a buy and a sale with CES on the last day of the month .
Steve will find out what the pricing is and will let me know .
Cindy/CNG is looking at the park and loan deal . She laughed when I said gave her the volume of 100,000 . The most she will consider is 50,000 . So I told her to look at a total storage volume of 50,000 and ENA would pay $4500.00 in demand charges each month . She needs to think about it . I'm out tomorrow but I will call her . Also , we are actually looking at -25,000 to 25,000 and we would be billed fuel if the deal rolls from 1 month to the next .
i added deal 223021 , cglf k#66281 for feb to sitara . what is this capacity for ? its FTS 1 at rate $1.1600
pulled up deal 158501 and added a demand charge for k#66394
What's this - according to Navigator , we only have this contract for 1 day on Feb 23rd ? I just entered it in the ces retail sheet . MDQ = 5000 and the rate is $.01 ? Who did this deal ? The receipt points are Exxon-Chalkley , NGPL , and Tenn-Egan . The delivery point is Rayne . It looks like we nominated gas on this contract . I'm setting up this up in Sitara and on our 2000tran02.xls worksheet and I entered it in Sitara deal 223022 . Jesse , this will need to be scheduled in Unify .
I need to pull my tapes for Jan 21st . Would you take care of that please ?
Is Dayton showing the price to be To me it looks like options 2 . Enron North America Corp .
This is ok for March .
I entered the sale to Allegheny in Sitara ( deal 224977 ) effective 4/1/200 thru 10/31/2000 . Dick , Scott , the sales price is trigger deal priced at NX1 + $.22 . Allegheny holds the trigger and the daily volume is 1,532 day at Leach or the CGAS pool . My contact at Allegheny is Nat Miljus ( phone 412-394-2953) . David is going to make me fill out a term ticket and I'm running it through Dick's book .
Actually , my preference would be to have the contract released to ENA year round . This means Robin would have to bill CALP for the commodity and demand during the summer . Depending on the relationship you would like to have with the customer , I think it is easier to bill the customer for the demand and the commodity as opposed to reimbursing them for when we use the transport ( at least with the way things work in our systems) .
Yuck ! Some of this looked spooky . Baseball tickets: you and your buddy Maureen go to the game on Tuesday , June 6th . I believe the Astro's play MIN .
According to the CES Data Room book , the price on this deal is IF CGAS + . 015 . I changed it in Sitara effective Jan 1 , 2000 - Nov 30 , 2001 .
Joanie's email to me about the Roanoke pricing has me curious . Do I need to check the pricing on all the wholesale CES deals ? I do have some reports which Paul Drexelius gave me in January out of CES's GMS system . Dick had asked me to sit with Paul one afternoon and talk about the deals . I have not done any price verification or auditing of the deals in Sitara . Let me know if you want me to audit Sitara .
I guess my new address is chris.germany@enron.com
I changed the volume on the deal to 15,324 dts . Charlie , this is a deal Dick Jenkins did with John . ENA is buying this gas Let me know if you have questions .
That stuff will just make you fat ! You keep that up and you will never have a slim & trim figure like I do! !
What do I get if I break the chain ?
Yep . I'm a wild man now .
You know all and see all . Who can I start sending all these pricing questions to ? Enron North America Corp .
I'm thinking about getting a "Hang Glidin" tatto .
Them's fightin words ! Ahh my poor ankle . It's just about time for me to leave I think .
Since we now feel certain ENA bought this gas on Jan 21st , please path the supply deal from COH ( deal 153863 ) to one of those large CES deal tickets . I'm still checking the tapes to see if we can recoup the cost from CES . Joanne , to the best of your recollection , this gas did go to CES , correct ?
Hey Pops ! Here is the deal . If you can verify that you recieved this message , you can have Jerry's jet ski . That's right , its FREE! ! Just call me up within 10 days from the receipt of this email and say the word "BULL" and you've got yourself one semi-used jet ski .
Earth day info .
We parked 25,000 dt/day on the 25th-27th ( deal 225515 ) on CNG and we will be taking it out during April ( deal 225534) . ENA will pay CNG $.02 x 75,000 dt = $1,500.00 in April . Please let me know if you have questions .
Oh it hurts so bad . Sure wish I had a Diet Coke to take my mind off the intense pain .
Hi Team ! I just extend CNG deal 116090 through 1/31/2001 .
Hey , I just undid what I did because the deal already exist under ENA - Market East . Thanks dude !
I would change it to an IT gathering contract . I didn't know we had any firm gathering in the Market area . And currently , I am not working on the other gathering contracts .
Mary Theresa Franklin will be working on all the gathering stuff . She and I will be getting together tomorrow afternoon at 12:30 . Actually , you could set the priorities for us . What should we work on first ?
We borrowed ( deal227922 ) about 22,000 dt from CNG for the 28th and we will pay it back ( deal 227926 ) on the 29th . ENA will pay CNG $.03 times the daily balance on the 28th . This gets confusing because we already have a parking deal from the weekend that comes out in April .
I sure did work hard on this didn't I ? You de' Woman! !
What's the word Mr . Goodell ? I'm thinking there is no demand charge and this acts like a shell agreemtent which I don't understand .
i'm all over it .
I executed the Bug capacity for April . Offer #16219 , vol=103 , k#892865 , deal numbers 229304/229314 I set it up under MarketEast and East with Market East as primary .
Effective April 1st , we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up under 2 desk , Market East and East . All longhaul capacity on Tetco , Trco , and Tenn will be set up under both desk . All capacity on CNG , Iroq , Equit , Nat Fuel , and CGAS will be Market East . Now , all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug , which goes away on 4/1 , or East . So even on these pipes you will probably see the same contract under both desk .
Hi team . I may be inviting you to a chat on Thurs .
All very good questions and NO , we don't have an anwser .
Look at deals 99663 and 229143 for CNG/Sabine center contract I00059 . We did this exact setup on several contracts today .
My fault . I should have sent this out this morning .
I have all of you set up in my group profile for CES now .
Enron North America Corp .
Hi team . FYI - I just received the CALP invoice for Feb today in my inbox . I mailed it to Mark just so he could have a non-faxed copy for his files .
Anytime . I'll buy you a beverage next time you come down .
Hey! ! It worked ! Ankle is ok . I will start using your stock tips soon .
I don't remeber , who was taking care of changing the CES counterparties ? Was that someone in Global ?
Robin said you are going to be doing some of the Inside Ferc numbers . I'm out Friday so I'm sending this to you now .
I'm there . I'm out Friday . Also , Molly will be full time CES starting next week . Kim , please reserve a room for a conference call for one hour starting at 11:00 am this Thursday .
Hi Steph . Are you busy ? Look - work! !
Please review the following discrepancy and let me know what the price should be .
I'll be needing a "significant other" for the party . Do you have any spares ?
Created deal # 231048 to net out against Z6 sales on 527 a day . Molly
I would like to see the tickets for deals 100093 and 100096 . Thanks
Look guys - I suspect these are deal entry problems as opposed to deal valuation problems . Please take a look . Should I just enter these deals in Sitara for now ( just for April ) and let you know what the new deal numbers are ?
We have a new service on CNG . Pipeline CNG Transmission Start Date 2/1/2000 - 2/29/2000 evergreen Firmness IT Service Type Pooling Service Buyer ENA - Im Market East Brenda , for now the rates on this service will be 0 .
Mr . Monroy entered deal 218918 in Sitara on 3/15/2000 with a Tagg # NC3056 . I don't know who this is . Could you let me know which trader did this deal please .
You are most welcome even though you are too much of a tight wade to buy my capacity .
Hi gang . I'm fairly certain I entered this parking deal wrong for Feb . We will have to look at it next week . Deal 162283 and 162282 . We parked gas at S . Commack on Iroq and I think the counterparty should be CPR Exchange as opposed to Iroquois . we will chat .
Your back!! ! I almost called Spencer to chat .
We have decided to make Texas Gas Zone 4 an "East" desk pipe as oppossed to "Market East" . Please let me know if you think there might be any problems .
thanks
FYI
I have some suggested Gas Daily pricing on the attached . I will discuss this with Charlie .
Glad to hear things are going well . talk to you later, .
Dynergi released the CGAS capcity to us for one month so we could do it non bidable . Scott , it looks recallable . Its parcel number 28464 . Vol=7500 , receipt point is Leach , delivery point is City of Richmond . The rate is Everything looks good except the recallable factor . Also , there is a small NYSEG release for 24 dt's at max rate , offer #28446 . I can't get my machine to print out the forms . Good Luck .
Hi Team ! I will be out of the office on Friday , March 31st . Please call Scott Goodell at 713-853-7711 with any questions you may have . Later
Transco Beverly has all the numbers . Either Scott or Beavy needs to go into Transit as Enron North America tomorrow morning and execute the 4 segments listed . Beavy has the offer numbers . We will have ( hopefully ) 115,000 dt's of pure 3-3 segmented capacity , all on k#.7537 . Dan , next week we can probably create at least another 40,000 effective next Wed . We ran out of credit on ECT . Scott will talk to Trish Meigs about that in the morning . Kathy has a list of all the offer numbers that need to be executed . AFTER the all offers have been executed , have Meredith check screen AN52 effective 4/1/2000 . Kathy , you might be able to do this too . Dan , I think you will be hurting for Tetco capacity . Remember , we did CNG We have no fuel waivers from Canajoharie for April . I just never got around to requesting them . Scott , Call Cindy McGinnis at 304-623-8854 and ask for fuel waivers on contract 5A2500 from Iroq/Canojaharie ( meter 41101 ) to the following meters and Hanley & Bird 21100 . I left her a voicemail to call you . Ask her if we can send in the paperwork next week . Let Scott Hendrickson , Robin , and Dick know what fuel waivers CNG approves . I have all the CNG contracts on the worksheet . I will be calling in the morining .
Hey , you should see us up here . We are real nice and close . I was out Friday and we moved from 31 to 32 . The schedulers are up here with us , although we are so far apart , you still need to use the squawk box to chat with 'em .
Hey guys . I was in surgery Friday , everything went OK . I'm only here 1/2 day today and it's pretty much caos today because the whole gas department changed floors over the weekend . Let me know if there are any issues we need to address right away . Charlie , I would like to talk about the daily pricing if you get a chance . Thanks .
I need to check on this . I need to make sure we are not paying for this . If it turns out to be retail , I will make sure I give CES credit for the transport .
Scott Goodell thinks this might be wholesale capacity for April and May . This is the first time I've heard about this . I believe Joanie said this capacity is primary to Op 3 which doesn't do much for us . I need to know if we have to take this space . I would prefer not to take the space if we don't have to . Joanie will send us an email after she checks with the CES asset management group .
I segmented the rest of our Tetco capacity this morning effective the 4th . Please update your morning sheet with new AN52's . Thanks
This deal has been entered a CNG South Citygate deal and it should be entered and CNG Appalachian production . Jim Javins said he thought the deal was behind hastings . Could you guys move it . I would but Mr . Tengle yelled at me about messing up the risk assignments .
T&F Operating has sent ENA a "breach of contract" letter and is requesting to terminate the contract effective 4/1/2000 . Colleen , I will give you a copy of the letter that was faxed to John Singer . CES did a buy/sale behind Penn Fuel on CGAS for 1 year starting Nov 1 , 1999 . T&F is the supplier and Glenn Gary was the market . The market went away effective 4/1/2000 and ENA/EES has no other market behind this part of Penn Fuel's system . We checked with the Penn Fuel asset management deal and according to Penn Fuel , they can't take it either . T&F is looking for their payment for Jan , Feb , and Mar , and T&F will waive any and all "cover" cost that ENA would otherwise be liable for subsequent to John Singer wants to make sure we address the hedges in the books - will this need to be included in the CES true-up ? Also , John wants to know if he should sign the letter? . Colleen , I told John you would anwser that question .
Hey dudes , we need someone to attend this . I'm thinking Scott Goodell should go . Let's chat .
I took the volume on deal 226742 ( Devonian Resources ) to 0 for April . Hey John , give me a call when you get a chance so we can chat about this . Also , send me your phone number . I can't find it .
Hey John , did CES take this gas for Jan , Feb , and Mar ? Wade would like to see this deal in the system .
If this is metered production then its not cut ( it just flows to the pool) . If its pool gas then it probably is cut , so you tell me . Metered production or pool gas on CNG ?
OK this is metered production on CNG . Gloria will let us know which CNG contract to path this deal with . The meter numbers are 50089201 , 5105901 , and 5118301 and this is CES production . After Gloria lets us know which contract(s ) to use , Angie will path this deal in Sitara with a zero volume .
Secondary non-recallable , you can use $.14 year round OR $.05 for Apr-Oct which is probably a little high and $.15 for the winter . The non-recallable factor is the hard thing to figure in .
I faxed a copy of the PSNC invoice for March to Brian Perrone . I show this as a purchase from CES at St 85 . Also , I believe March is the last month CES is taking the gas from CES . Brian , I'm tossing my copy , let me know if you have questions . Thanks .
I would like to have the following 2 speed dials added to Page 10 , thanks
Don Kirkendahl ( in your Houston office 713-350-8445 ) contacted me yesterday . He is requesting copies of the transport invoices . Should I give the invoices to him or should I send them to Charlie ?
Hi Anita , my name is Chris Germany and my phone number is 713-853-4743 . My fax number is 713-646-8453 . I believe you and I will be working together .
We can do that . Brian , would you mail Don a copy of the CGAS and CGLF invoices for January ? We will take care of everything else . thanks
I guess you won't be taking me out for a cheeseburger this evening will you ? 
Actually , cheeseburger and a shake! !
I'm going through the Jan transport invoices . I see I need to bill CES for some South Georgia activity . How did we pay South Georgia , I don't see a matrix in Unify .
Big Bang? ? Are you saying I was born out of the lowest form of life on earth ?
I've gone through most of the CES stuff for Jan . I'm missing several demand charge contracts and commodity for CES on Trco . I think you need to call me .
Brian , I'm Fed Exing you copies of all the transport invoices today with the following exceptions: Transco: I missing some of the demand charges and all of the commodity charges . I am still updating my transport capacity sheet with actuals and I will be making a billing adjustment this Friday . I have not review all the invoices I am sending you . And I have made copies for Don . I will give him his copies on Friday or Monday . Let me know if you have any questions .
I do love chocolate malts though . i guess that's what us low life forms live on .
Hi campers . Its that time of month again , I need all the transport information for CES for March .
I apologize for this . May I get a copy of all the invoices we sent CES for January please .
I think the National Fuel is local production . I'm don't know how you would swing this volume .
Do we still need to be transporting Bridgeport CNG produciton gas through Coronado to CGAS ? AND if YES , will this gas always need to go through Coronado ? I thought that was just a seasonal thing
The CES/CEM CNG Appalachian production is still flowing into the CES/CEM gathering and transmission contracts . Unless someone objects I would like to get this moved over to Enron's pool . We don't need to have the gathering and transmission contracts moved over .
I havn't worked on any of the April pricing in the system yet . I'm working fast and furious on March . I was going to do most of April next week with Molly . Can I give it to you then ? Also , we can waive the 25% undertake limit on Texas Gas and Algonquin if you are ok with that . Just let me know . I also mentioned the intra day storage change to Dick Jenkins . I need to chat with Dick and Colleen about the storage . For now , I will allow the intra day changes .
Well , aren't you just full of wisdom !
Melissa , am I at liberty to discuss pricing information and to provide my price calculation worksheets ( transport capacity and pricing worksheet ) with Don Kirkendall ?
Thanks .
FYI , I just wanted to make sure we had CES's approval .
As always , they catch me at my most beautiful pose .
We received a prior period adjustment ( December activity ) on the JanuaryTransco invoices for CES . Its a credit of $6,432.31 . Its releated to the Lilco capacity CES Retail receives each month . This credit should be passed through to CES . How is that being handled ?
It looks like I'm missing demand charges on the following CES Transco contracts for January
I think I might call . Would you take me our for a free lunch ?
You bet . Don't you think we could send something a little better ?
C'mon - I want a free lunch . I could interduce you to a new place , real close to work .
I've been in you house since then . I also have a doggie book in the back of my car that belongs to you .
Terry , please call Jack Meyers ( 304-623-8811 ) at CNG Transmission and have these meters moved from CES/CEM pools to Enron's pools . I think all you need to do is send CNG a letter requesting; "Please move all meters flowing into contract 8G0A61 to contract 8G0011" . If CNG needs meter information , maybe you could send them the statement they send to Gloria , I believe CES/CEM has 11 contracts . Let me know if you have any questions . thanks
oh it is not . You Lie !
There is a sale to CES for a volume of 34,248 dts , deal 149430 . It has your name on it . My conterpart at CES does not recognize it . According to Unify the downstream k# is 94946 . If you did this deal , do you remember who you did the deal with ? Thanks .
Present this email at a time of MY convenience and receive 1 free $.50 beverage from the 32 floor pop machine! ! Have we got perks or what !
I would path the April deal just like we did the previous deals , 102122 and
Please unsuspend and bill the following Jan CES deals Deal Pipe volume Amount Comment 145311 ANR 5071 11992.92 we billed the Trunkline piece of this deal . Still researching the following deals Deal Pipe volume Amount Comment 149430 ANR 34248 76030.56 sent email to Tom Donoho to research . I will be in after lunch . I may try to send you more deals .
I will be out of the office tomorrow moring . I expect to be in around lunch time . Thanks
FYI , Joann scheduled the intra day .
This is more CNG fuel waiver stuff . Thanks
We parked gas ( deal 240072 ) on the 8th and the 9th and we are pulling it out ( deal 240073 ) on the 10th . ENA will pay Transco $.055 times the daily balance .
We have a sale to CES on ANR on Jan 13th - deal 149430 . The volume is 34,248 dts and the price is $2.22 . I did not Bill CES for this deal . According to Tom Donohoe , CES owed ANR the gas and we paid it back in January . Tom said CES was going to pay us for this . Should I bill the Retail group for this ? It looks more like a wholesale transaction .
I have my 1st therapy ( physical not mental ) session tomorrow at 3:00 PM and the lady said it would last for 1 1/2 hours . Matt , why don't you go in my place , that sounds like it is going to hurt. . However , Scott Goodell will be here AND we have new and improved smaller cubes now .
Hey Anita , I apologize about the delay . I have a lunch meeting with CES and I will call you after lunch . I do have the fax you sent . What is you phone number ?
Here is the transport data for the Cook School Road March April CNG Index $2.79 $3.06 Receipt Price $2.6029 $2.9294 Let me know what you come up with . Thanks

My January worksheet
Not bad . Went to a John Zurita fish fry . I rode to John's house with a power guy that lives in my complex and we stayed about 1 1/2 hours longer than I wanted to .  Live and learn . Ankle is doing ok . I wear an ankle brace and tennis shoes to work . I start my 1st therapy session tomorrow .
Hey guys . I'm cleaning up my emails and I don't know if this was ever addressed . Comments ?
This is a good time to bring this up . Unless the original CES agreement has changed , ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of $103,417 from 1/1/2000 - 4/30/2000 . From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000 , ENA will pay a ( volumetric ) demand charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA . Which brings up 2 important points; 1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss this with CALP ( and she may have already ) However , currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May . 2 . It's a new ball game starting 7/8/2000 .
Hey guys . I have a ton of emails to plow thru with CES buy look what I found . The CES storage proxy schedule is at the bottom .
Hey Sparky ! FYI . Hey gang . Dan caught my mistake . Tenn fuels change in April . March April CNG Index $2.79 $3.06 Receipt Price $2.6029 $2.9327
I faxed you the PSNC invoices for Jan and Feb . They have a little comment on their that PSNC has not been paid for either month yet . Give me a call once you get these . cg
Here is a quick and dirty worksheet . I've been trying to come up with a total daily activity worksheet on "Sheet 2" . The storage numbers and choice numbers are on "Sheet 3" and the proxy numbers with the daily storage volumes are on "Sheet 1" .
I need to talk about how to handle CES storage in Sitara and Unify . The people that need to be their are Jeff , Mark , Victor , and one ot the CGAS schedulers . Please let me know if you can meet tomorrow afternoon around 2:30 pm . Everyone else is more than welcome to attend . Please let me know if you will be attending . I will schedule a conference room after I know who is attending .
Hey Anita , I changed the price and attached is my calculation . Your rates are close enough as far as I'm concerned though .
Chewies on the way!!! !
NO . CALP is a wholesale contract .
Don't I always get back to you within 10 min??? ?
OK . Now either Mary Theresa Franklin or Angie needs to path out this deal in Unify with a zero volume .
Please reserve a conference room for up to 7 people for 1 hour on Wednesday , April 12th around 2:30pm . thanks
Hey gang . Joanie is still working on current day activity . Joanie , please call Jeff Porter at 703-561-6447 . I will try to update this worksheet every other day if not every day .
Could you get Terry authorization to path in Unify please ? Thanks
The meeting is in room 3259 from 3:00 - 4:00 . Experience has taught me that someone much more important may bump us . This meeting will focus on the CGAS storage contract . What we bill CES for storage injections will be different than what we actually inject . April is a little more difficult because we will be injecting and withdrawing at the same time . CGAS only bills on the net injections or withdrawal amounts . The deals in Sitara are set up as CPR Storage for the injections and the withdrawals . Which brings up the following issues; * How do we bill CES for injections if we don't enter buy/sales with CES at the storage facility . Kate Fraser said there were never any BUG buy/sale tickets in Sitara for storage . How did that work ? Mark , I'm counting on you for this one . * How do we track the storage balance in Unify ? * How are the injection/withdrawal cost capture , especially since CGAS will bill on the net injections/withdrawals I'm sure there are more issues that will come up during the meeting . Thanks Enron North America Corp .
FYI
Hey gang , the room number has changed to 3084 .
Why is Bill Clinton so reluctant to decide the fate of Elian Gonzalez ? Because last time he made a decision about where to put a Cuban , he was impeached .
Please change the zone location for meters T0012 and T0A62 from North Other to South Other . Thanks
I don't think CES has transport on these pipelines . I should have February to you by next week some time .
What happens if we sell CES spot gas? ? It would be fixed price . Maybe we could send CES a different type of report since they have so many deals . What do you think? ?
Hey guy , please copy Scott Goodell and Molly on anything you send me in the future . Molly will be working with me on all the CES deals . Her email address is Molly.Johnson@enron.com . Thanks
Molly and I discovered that CES has about 1400 dt of Texas Gas Zone SL to Z4 capacity each month . Dayton releases this capacity to CES each month . We have been using this capacity since Jan 1 to serve the CES Zone 4 markets . According to Steve , the primary path on this capacity is Zone SL to Dayton's meter in Zone 4 . I have been pricing all the Texas Gas Zone 4 at IF CNG App . I believe we need to add a Texas Gas Zone SL IF and make the premium $.01 . I have not brought this to CES's attention . They will eventually catch it because we have been billing CES the transport demand charge .
Seen this one ?
According to Ed Santa with Iroq , we paid the disputed parking for June 1999 activity and we did not pay $860.00 of expnese in May 1998 . I not concerned about the June 1998 . Would you once again please verify what we paid Iroq on the disputed parking fee from May 1999 through July 1999 ? thanks
Jeff , I have update this sheet for the actual storage to date . I'm trying to keep this worksheet simple . I added the actual numbers per navigator . I think I need to add an Enron balance and a CES balance . What do you guys think ?
Jeff , I highlighted all items that need to be suspended or changed in yellow . I'm still working on the purchases . I do have 2 significant purchase items that I want to include on the manual bill . AND , I'm still working on the pipeline demand charges . I call you with that number .
Please add the following demand charges to the manual invoice . Transport Demand $2,512,347.00 I may have included the scheduling fee in the manual invoice .
This morning , Roman Blake with CALP told Robin Barbe that CALP never received the payment for the wire transfer . This is the first I've heard of this . Mark , would you please verify that the payment went out . I've copied Joanie because she talks to CALP quite often and I just want her to know what is going on . Also , I have a copy of the March bill . I will go through it today and give Mark a copy . Thanks .
Joanie found the email from CALP stating they did receive the wire payment . Robin called Roman and gave him the info . thanks Joanie .
I love being a MAN!! ! Ain't life great ?
Hey , thats Mr . Turd to you .
Hi gang . Lunch with CES is on Wednesday , that day works better with Jeff .
You may not see this deal come through the normal process . Please set up deal 245855 . Thanks Brenda , this is for Tetco contract 892590 - the last contract on the email you sent me .
I added all of these demand charges as "Actual" expense items to the 2000ces03 worksheet . k#892722 - You De Woman!! ! k#892069 - added to deal 143316 k#892066 - added to deal 143315 k#892084 - added to deal 143318
Each month , Ed Glaum with CES in Herndon needs an invoice copy of the BUG release to CES . Please send him the Feb and Mar activity . His phone number is 703-561-6472 , his fax number is 703-561-7317 . You and I may need to chat .
All 3 of the TCO schedulers are back today and Joanie said she will get me an updated storage worksheet with the Choice information . Also , Scott Goodell , Molly Johnson , Jeff Westover , and I are having lunch with Don and Ernie today . We will be giving them the Feb ( and maybe some March ) invoices .
I don't know a thing , but I think Mr . Goodell is an expert .
Responses: 1 . I'll let Kevin answer this one . ANR and Michcon are Central Desk pipes . 2 . I would prefer to address all items on Exhibit 1 . If possible I would like to see the original Exhibit 1 volumes and updated Exhibit 1 volumes through March 2001 . However , I don't remember buying back any baseload gas on TCO for April . I thought we priced everything at FOM IF and every day , we are buying back gas at GD - $.01 . 3 . Are you doing a buy sell with Erron at the same price ? Does Duke bill CES directly for this ? 4 . See attached worksheets . 5 . I don't know all the information on the local production yet . The pricing I'm currently using is the Exhibit 1 FOM deliverd pricing ( pricing using ENA transport) . The attached April file has a Local Production tab . Molly Johnson is updating this information . After she completes April , she will recreate Jan - Mar . 6 . Since the delivered pricing on TCO is the same , I'm not concerned about the individual citygate volumes . For pricing purposes , I only care about total daily deliveries . It would be a problem if you were trying to take additional gas from a non-constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and you don't have enough capacity . This holds true for most other pipelines as well , Tenn Z6 , CNG North Citygate , CNG South Citygate , . . . This would be a better question for Charlie to ask me when he is looking for something specific as it comes up . The only thing I will not allow you to do is take gas from one pipeline to the other , Texas Gas Z4 to CGAS , and Colleen has discussed this with Melissa .
Transport Pricing info Formula Where: DP = Delivered Price RP = Receipt Price Commodity = Usage Rate ( $.0226 on CGAS ) The password is 2000tran04 .
Ain't I just the nicest guy you know , MODEST TOO !
My fault . The numbers in yellow are estimates .

UGI ships the gas for CES . Normally we sell CES this gas at ELA . It looks like it will be at CGLF Mainline for the next few months . Doug will verify this information and let us know .
We have a new Cove Point Storage deal , here are the details; Demand $.65 Demand Charge for April $117,000.00 Demand Charge for May - March $234,000.00/month Contract FPS1024 The CPR storage injection deal is 246517 , the withdrawal ticket is 249409 . I entered all the withdrawal volumes to come out of storage the last 10 days of March, .
Robert , let's deliver 1,000 day to Cove Point off CGAS for May . That should give us 812 day injected for May . This may change after I chat with Laura at Cove Point . I knew we could deliver 4,000 day for April but she never told me what we could do for May .
Just making sure everyone reads their emails . The term is 4/15/2000 -
Sorry , I sent this to you by mistake .
We have our CES/Bug contract for May . The MDQ is 103 dt and the contract number is 893255 .
Please unvalidate deal 229101 so I can change the buyer from ENA - Im Bug to This transport contract is set up under ENA - Im Bug twice ( deal 229101 and Thanks . I also need to make sure the end term date on both deals is 3/31/2000 .
What are you talking about ?
This is proof that we at least get reimbursement from ECT - Canada on the Boston Gas Transport . I feel much better about this part . Thanks Brenda .
I just sold intra day gas to CES on CGAS and CNG . The CGAS deal is number 250938 , the volume is 257 , the delivery point is BG&E , and the price is $3.53 . This deal is for 1 day only . The CNG deal is 250897 , the volume is 51 to NIMO East and 211 to Peoples , and the price is $3.60 . Thanks
Thanks for the reminder . I just faxed a confirmation for Dick Jenkins , Direcotor , Enron North America .
Doug , I'm killing both of these deals . The BG&E has been changing all month on an intraday and Joann uses storage to balance . The CNG changes were made yesterday it sounds like .
Lizy , I don't know how you see these the next morning . Please check deals 252056 ( primary ) and 252057 , I just set these up in Sitara . This is a Tetco contract I forgot to set up in Sitara . Thanks .
FYI
Do you guys know which contract this is ?
This capacity is in ENA's name and we have been billing CES the demand charge since January . The MDQ is 2300 . Thanks Joanie !
Please change the following deals to evergreen . Deals 231754 and 231748 . thanks
You are the GREATEST!! ! Thanks for the book . I'm going to do something nice for you someday, .
She's outta town .
Darn pager .
I want you to go to Forida with me !
Robert , our CNG/Cove Point meter is set up and we can fix the 19th . I just entered deal 253505 moving gas from CNG to Cove Point . thanks
Contract 230104 ( deal 231301 ) does not exist . The correct contract is 560104 ( deal 254262) . I just killed deal 231301 . thanks
I did get the email . I was looking right at it and couldn't see it I guess .

"Moths" A man and a woman meet at bar one day and are getting along really well . They decide to go back to the woman's house where they engage in passionate love making . The woman suddenly cocks her ear and says , "quick my husbandjust got home , go hide in the bathroom!" So the man runs into the bathroom . Her husband comes up into the bedroom and looks at her . "Why are you naked?" he asks . Well , I heard you pull up outside , so I thought I would come up here and get ready to recieve you." "Okay." the man replies "I'll go get ready." He goes into the bathroom before his wife can stop him and sees a naked man standing there clapping his hands . "Who the fuck are you?" the man asks "I am from the exterminator company , your wife called me in to get rid of the moths you are having problems with." The husband exclaims , "But you are naked!" The man then looks down and jumps back in surprise . "Those little bastards!"
Do you know if this has been addressed ?
They are all in really bad shape . May is looking pretty good though .
Has this been addressed ?
FYI
CGLF contracts 66680 and 66681 ended effective 3/31/2000 . thanks
It appears that the evergreen function on certain Transport contracts is not working . Take a look at deal 98243 . I just had to extend the date for May
I think Alicia fixed this last week . Take a look and let me know .
We sold 870/day starting 5/2 - 5/31 to CES for Timet . The deal number is
Scott , when would you like to go over the CNG scoop ?
Just had a thought , according to Joanies worksheet , we can inject a max of 1,210,121 into storage for the month of May . For now , our target injection volume in storage for May will be 1,210,121 . When we overinject , like we did for the first four days , we need to decrease the volumes on deal 231214 for the rest of the month so that the total volume on this deal will be I will try to monitor the deal volume . Thanks .
Richard , according to Marlene , she needs to put in an IT request to change the National Fuel contracts from non-pathed to pathed . Does this sound correct to you ? Please let me know .
I took the volumes to 0 on the following deals Deal 257285 CES Exchange Buy and deal 257287 CES sale - term 4/1/2000 - Deal 257288 CES buy and deal 257289 CES Exchange sale - term 11/1/2000 - Thanks
What do I need to do ? Should I end the exitsting contracts effective 4/30/00 and create new ones effective 5/1/00 ? Does Marlene need to create a new type of FT rate service to make these contracts appear different (  maybe that has already been done) ?
Hey , regarding deals 226462 and 258420 , should we take the volumes to 0 on deal 226462 ?
I think everything is OK now . I set up deals 260724 ( k#B00693026471) , 260689 ( k# F01978 ) and deal 260712 ( k#I00454) . I changed the end date for deal 235701 ( also k#B00693026471 - unpathed ) to 4/30/00 and it still shows up in Unify for May . Beavy , make sure you use the B*** k# with an MDQ of 9005 when you path May .
I have fuel waivers on my CNG transport contracts . I am entereing these fuel waivers on the primary capacity deal in Sitara . Do I need to enter them on the secondary capacity deal ticket ? Also , I have an IT discount on one of my Tennessee contracts on gas flowing from the Gulf ( East Region ) to CNG ( Market East Region) . Which transport capacity deal ticket should I enter the discount on ?
I'm about to set up 11 contracts on Trco for May . There is no rush on setting these contracts up for Unify .
Would you please write a description on how Consumers Energy works on the billing for title transfers ? I need to explain this to Doug Kenny still . Thanks .
Doug , I believe this invoice from Consumers should be paid by CES . Cora gave a description of the invoice below . Let me know what you think . Thanks
I believe Kodak just doesn't support the USB connection very well . I tried the other connection and it works great . I pulled all the tractor pictures off the camera with no problem . I still have not seen a photo as clear as the very first one Chance pulled up of the family reunion though . All the tractor pictures are a little fuzzy .
Hi gang . I want to meet tomorrow regarding the CES storage deal . Around 1:30PM ? Let me know . thanks
Kim , I need a room from 1:30pm to 2:30pm tomorrow . Thanks
Steve , I don't think you need to be at our meeting . We have room 3125B at 1:30 PM tomorrow .
Hi gang . We still need to make some changes to Sea Robin . I believe we need 2 pricing zones , Mainline Pool and Offshore . The new Sea Robin curve will be used to value the Offshore zone and we will use CGLF/La curve to value everything else . Per my discussion with Christine , the following meters should be moved/mapped to the Offshore zone; Meter Please let me know what I need to do or if anyone has any questions .
Do you have a current Citygate production worksheet ?
Deal 125925 has been replaced with deal 231766 and deal 125928 has been replaced with deal 234584 . Angie is all over this one .
I have a new toy !

FYI - PSE&G has 72,450 dt of primary capacity from Tenn Rivervale to PSE&G on Transco .
Just imagine a big smiley face with a tongue sticking out right here
I forgot to mention that my goal today is to have the Northeast transport split out by East and Marketeast .
I send it to your work address tonight buddy . You de Man .
That little project has been killed . I don't think Father needs another animal to take care of .
Kim , I'm at a CNG shipper meeting in Florida next Wed - Fri . Enron North America Corp . Molly will chat with you about this and Molly just found out about it . Hi Molly! !
Do you need a HUG? ? :o )
I changed the Oct 2000 volume on deal 203062 ( tagg NA1167.8 ) from 95244 dth Please make the following change: Deal 203030 ( NA1137.4 ) change the volume for April from 50,857 dth to 13,527 dth , and change the volume for May from 17,866 dth to 4,752 dth . Please verify the following info; The confirm for deal 169036 ( NA0713.1 ) shows a price of $2.295 + $.6800 , according to CES this should be a price of $2.795 + $.6800 . Please verify which price is correct . The confirm for deal 168997 ( NA0713.4 ) shows a basis price of $.455 for April and CES is showing $.175 . Please verify which price is correct .
Done , please review the following zones . They are different from last month's pricing . TGT Zone 4 <=== the biggest change Tenn Z6 And I added CGLF Onshore and CGLF Mainline . I don't know if we will have CGLF changes or not but I wanted to set up pricing to take care of it .
I was trying to send the tractor photo to you yesterday but I was having problems . I will try again tonight . It takes a long time for system at home to show a photo email .
Molly set up the following tickets to capture our CGAS storage transactions . This is how it will work , Deal # Comment 268093 CES Exchange Buy - use when storage injections are less than the proxy volume 268090 CES Exchange Sell - use when storage injections are greater than the proxy volume 268094 CES Sell - this is the proxy storage injection ticket . The volume should not change . The daily proxy volume for the month of May is 35,133 . When we inject 35,133 , the transport we use to fill storage will be the supply for deal 268094 . When we overinject like we did for the 1st - 4th , 35,133 of the transport will be matched with deal 268094 and the balance of the transport will be matched against deal 268090 . When we underinject , we will use deal 268093 as the supply for deal 268094 . This may seem a little confusing . Please call me if you still have questions . Thanks
FYI Robert , would you put these deals on the morning sheet please . Thanks . We will not be using the CPR storage deal ticket any more .
You know , I gave you the wrong daily volume for the month of May . I'm just going to change it effective 5/16/2000 so that the total volume for the month is correct .
we will showing CES a bid today .
I will be out of the office Wed , Thur , and Friday of this week . Please call Scott Goodell at 713-853-7711 if you have any questions . Thanks
We can use it as far as I'm concerned . Have the reimbursements been addressed ?
We have a sale to Tractebel on CGAS with a price discrepancy . This was a deal we took over from CES wholesale . Here are the terms per the confirm Tractebel faxed us . Type: EFP Differential: $.235 Point: Tco Pool Trans Date: 5/6/1999 Sitara Deals: 158716/227890 the price in sitara is Tco Index . Elizabeth faxed the confirm to me . I will gladly give this to David . Please take a look and let Elizabeth know which price should be in Sitara . Thanks .
Please check on the purchase from AEC Marketing . The daily volume is 9189 , the deal number is 227196 . I'm trying to find out if we get reimbursed for the transport demand charge we pay National Fuel each month . Thanks
I just found somehting that will probably stick out when you run the new demand charges . The TETCO demand charges on the ECT Trans worksheet were not subtotaled . The total demand for these charges was $18,424 .
I found $357 not showing up on Texas Gas , K#T016336 , AND the OLD total for Texas Gas is showing $18,423 when the actual total is only $1,442 . We are showing the Equitrans contract on both ENA and CES . For now , I'm taking it out of the ENA sheet - its $7,000 That's all for now .
As usual , you are awesome ! Let Steve know what the fuel waivers are when you get them . Thanks
New Virus Taking Offices By Storm This virus warning is genuine . There is a new virus going around , called "work." If you receive any sort of "work" at all , whether via email , Internet or simply handed to you by a colleague...DO NOT OPEN IT . This has been circulating around our building for months and those who have been tempted to open "work" or even look at "work" have found that their social life is deleted and their brain ceases to function properly . If you do encounter "work" via email or are faced with any "work" at all , then to purge the virus , send an email to your boss with the words "I've had enough of your crap.. . I'm off to the bar." Your brain should automatically forget the "work" . If you receive "work" in paper-document form , simply lift the document and drag the "work" to your garbage can . Put on your hat and coat and skip to the nearest bar with two friends and order three bottles of beer ( or rum punch) . After repeating this action 14 times , you will find that "work" will no longer be of any relevance to you and that "Scooby Doo" was the greatest cartoon ever .
Did Cove Point approve that ?
I'm always willing to drive for a free lunch .
Do you have a home for the T&F Explor behind Penn Fuel for June ? I left a message for Charlie at CES this morning about all the other citygate production . I'm also trying to get a bid from CNG for the month of June on the EOG and Peoples gas . I'll keep you posted .
Just got word from EES , they can take the EOG gas . Marde will show me a number after I find out if CES wants this or not . Marde also said the seller pays a flat $100.00 to transfer gas out of their pool to EES's pool . Marde said the nom for June would be done as an imbalance transfer and she paid IF +$.09 for gas this month . EES cannot take any Peoples gas . Should I have Scott Hendrickson try to sell it to Peoples ? I'm also going to leave a message for Paul at Clinton . Marde is going to check around .
Yep . So that would be part of our $100,000.00 gain , right ?
I just spoke with CES . CES will keep the National Fuel for the month of June since June is the last month . Please call me when you get a chance to discuss everything . I did not discuss the Equitrans gas with CES . I want to talk to Scott about that tomorrow .
Hey you said I could delete this one . Yea! !
Did you get the fax of the Consumers Energy invoice? ?
We have the Equitrans capacity ( 1,000 dt/day ) through July . Scott will tell John Singer we need to get out of this capacity . Scott and I have decided to leave this on the CES Retail worksheet and see what happens . ENA purchased the 19,000 of BG&E space from CES .
Did you get the fax of all the deals in our system for June ?
Hey! ! You still exist! !
One free soda for you upon request and providing I have $.50 in my pocket .
As of today's gas day , ENA has a balance of 658,375 dth in CES's storage . We still have 56,000 dth we can over inject for the month of May to reach our "approved" max monthly injection amount . In Sitara , I am showing all 658,375 dth of ENA gas coming out of storage in the month of August .

Scott Goodell will be attending as well . Could you make sure he is covered for lunch please ?
I killed deal 233231 . The contract number was incorrect .
Hi !
Chris , Iroq cannot find the payment for May 1999 of $1,934.42 . Can you provide some support showing the monies being paid to Iroq .
I thought the meter numbers were different .
Just be nice to me when you become my BOSS , Boss :o )
In today's Gas Daily , Northern Natural Gas has a help wanted ad - you probably aren't doing your job !
I found a couple of big adjustments on the April capcity sheet . I am still billing CES for the Union Camp capacity and it was terminated effective The net impact is $64,104.00 that needs to be credited back to CES . It also appears that I billed CES the scheduling fee of $20,000.00 twice . Jeff , the new transport demand charges plus the scheuduling fee of $20,000.00 equals $1,865,705.00 . If we billed CES twice for the scheduling fee , then we should issue a credit to CES of about $84,000.00 . Please redraft deal 227081 and let me know what the impact is . I would like to send out the credit either today or tomorrow . Thanks . cg
I changed the effective date on the following Transco deals in Sitara . Transco told me this morning that these contract agencies were terminated effective 3/31/2000 . Deals 165415 and 165423 .
Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it . I'm sure I left someone out . This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June . This will reduce the numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday . East Ohio Gas on CNG 10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing CPA on TCO 500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing 1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note: this is an estimated volume . We should know the actual volume in the next day or so . Note: CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA . National Fuel 250 dth/day from Belden & Blake . The deal expires 6/30/2000 . All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline . ENA nominates this gas . CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES . CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG .
I changed the end date on Transco deal 231538 from 4/30/2000 to 10/31/2000 . My mistake .
its a good thing i a good looking stud !
We have the following Transco transport for June Contract . 7537 ( does not include any AGL space ) Vol Comment 5000 3-6 Con Ed space released month to month thru 10/31/2000 Contract 3.4367 Other stuff 20000 of 6-1 I think . 6500 of 6-6 from PSEG . Open for bids until 2:00pm on 4/26/2000 2174 of 2-3 . this is on k#.7537
John , I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal starting June 1 . This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG . I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day . This is the purchase from StatOil at CPA . The price on this deal is NX1 + . 434 and the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + . 54 ( per MCF) . John , is this price adjusted for dth? ? I created deal 280185 , purchase from StatOil , volume of 333 day , the price is NX1+ $.56 PER MCF . This is a purchase of local production behind the citygate . David , this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara . Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy . I set up deal 280185 with the same counterparty . This deal should have been in the system effective 1/1/2000 . According to Elizabeth , we should not use the CES - StatOil Energy . It doesn't matter to me how its set up , however , this deal should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as deal 226563 . I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day . This is a purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA . John , there are 3 deals for Questar , the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 right now . Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing purposes ? Molly , I created deal 280132 , FOM priced sale to CES . This deal will be matched with the CPA local production deals . Let me know if anyone has any questions . Thanks cg 3-4743
Its good we didn't book anything because CES just sold a lot of their customers to another company .
It is definitely a CES deal that will be over in Sep or Oct of this year .
I made some big changes to the CGAS storage deals 268094 ( no changes on this ticket) , 268090 , and 268093 . Over the 4 day weekend we are over injecting 195,600 dth . We will show this volume coming out in June . I also made about a 7,000 dth change to the volumes coming out in August . I am still showing most of the withdrawal of the ENA balance in August . Let me know if you have any questions .
We are parking 4,875 dth/day for the 27th-30th on CNG ( deal 281565 ) and we are taking out 478 dth/day for the month of June ( deal 281565) . ENA is paying CNG $.04 times the total volume parked . Angie , these volumes may go up . I think Tenn is still trying to balance the weekend and they are a little long . Clarissa will let you know .
Whoo hooo ! I just took the demand charge for CALP to $0 for May . This affects our demand charges on CGAS .
Done .
I didn't even know about deal 219618 . I will chat with Dick Jenkins about this after trading .
I released the Transco and CNG capacity to Energy Express for the term of the deals . However , Boston should recall all this capacity effective 7/1/2000 . Transco Offers CNG Offers Let me know if you have any questions . Thanks Chris 713-853-4743
Hi team . Do not discuss this with anyone at CES or EES please . May not be a problem but just in case .
I shuffled the storage deal tickets ( deal 268090 and 268093 ) around for June . We are injecting more gas at the beginning of the month and less in the end of the month . On Tuesday , our net injection goes to 29,687 dth . On Sat , 19th , our net injection drops to 2,204 dth . This keeps us at our 60% max storage balance on 6/30/2000 .
Check out how I entered deal 289172 , the final prices are $4.415 , $4.435 , Comment ?
We are selling 20,000 day to Transco at TP #5564 . It will cost us $.0153 to go from St 65 to the Sims deal , no fuel . The transport usage deal is 289228 . Let me know if you have any questions .
Let us update the pricing and we will send you a confirm today or tomorrow .
Please put the Transco Sims deal #289172 on the morning sheet . The total volume we need to deliver to this deal is 480,000 dth and we may deliver 18,000 dt - 22,000 dt per day . We currently have 20,000 dt in the We don't have to call Transco when we change the volumes . thanks
Joanie called Kara at CES about deal 282945 . This is the CGAS citygate gas for Energy Express . We are selling the gas to CES and CES is reselling it to Energy Express . Kara told Joanie that she does not expect the volumes to change on this deal . Scott needs to work on the capacity sheet so we can tell how much transport CES actually has . There should be some big changes in CES's transport numbers for June . ( Ex ENA purchased the BG&E capacity on contract k#65403) . Also , if ENA elected to release CES capacity to Clinton or IGS , we need to make sure we record that correctly on the ENA sheet . Any credits we show on the CES sheet will be passed thru to CES .
AGA is 78 . Screen dipped to $3.95 , currently at $4.05 / $4.06
Test . Does this work ?

Cool
Call Chris at you convience about EES/CES .
Hi
sounds like some are selling at 44's , now $4.425 by $4.44
Paul Leanza with Clinton may have a market for the Peoples Gas . Dick wanted me to talk to you to see if it sounds ok . Give me a call when you get a chance .

I will have training class on the East Desk Market Area positions this Wed , June 21st , at 4:00 PM in conference room EB3084 . I will be discussing our operational flexibility with respect to Tenn Z6 and National Fuel .
You De Man . Could you change the spelling from Druckett to Dracut ? I owe you a Chic Fil A lunch .
Hey Jeff , we are meeting tomorrow because Molly is out today . Is that OK ?
Does CES have the ability to adjust the storage MSQ in Sep or Oct ?
How big of an adjustment can you make as a percentage and are you guys looking at that adjustment ? OR , are you letting the buyer know this option exists and you just hope its not your problem by then ( that's my guess) ?
Here is what I'm looking at for July 1 . Paul Leanza ( Clinton ) has a customer that can take around 1,000 day . I don't know if that's dt or mcf . I will use mcf for this email until someone corrects me . This customer has a special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the customer pulls . For July , assuming the gathering fuel is 5% , and this customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool , you will get a 5 mcf credited back to your imbalance account the following month . I don't know how this works with trading imbalances . But , at a NYMX of $3.95 that works out to $.21 - sounds good to me . Paul said this customer is looking for a CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number . Marde will not sell at that price but I will . Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing . Actually , I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES , settle up financially with EES and be done with it . What we could do to test Paul's statement , is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for July . It would be easy to see since that is the only deal . AND , have EES take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing . Comments / Questions ? Questions John 1 . Heidi ( EES ) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's pool . Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool ? If yes , how many meters ? 2 . Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples Phillips Power Gas Marketing Term Price Volume Heidi ( EES ) If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's pool , please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to EES's pool for July . Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that . I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES , where EES makes the payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer . At what price will you take these deals ? I assume we need to get this info from John before you can anwser this .
My YTD nymx and your YTD nymx don't tie . Here is my worksheet . Would take a look at it and let me know which deals are wrong . You are a wonderful person by the way .

You will probably get an invitation to the wedding . The date is Sat , July 29th , in Mangum , OK . at 3:00pm in the afternoon . I'll expect to see you .
Paul is out of the office today but I found the customer name in my notes - it was right below all my notes on CanFibre . The customer is Latrove Steel . I'm going to call Peoples myself to learn how this works . Does anyone object to that ? I will wait until this afternoon before I call . Heidi Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st ? If not , we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July . However , we will not see the fuel credit until August(??? ) to verify if this works or not .
Hey Z , would you show Beavy how to request the CNG Fuel waivers for July ? I want Beavy to do it for a couple of months so she will be aware of our operational flexibility . Remember , you need to keep track of all of this on your 2000 accomplishments for your year end review . Thanks .
ENA is selling EES gas on CGAS . Sitara deal #225818 . EES is showing a price of $3.347 for May production and we are billing them $3.324 , which price is correct ? Thanks
Please terminate the following CNG contracts effective 6/30/2000 . For June , we released this capacity to Energy Express . Boston Gas recalled this capacity effective 6/30/2000 . I changed the deal tickets in Sitara .
We currently have the following transport contracts on CNG for July . Angie and Beavy are working on the fuel waivers for July . And we can still take 7950 dth from Cornwell .
Hey Greg . Hope this works . My phone number is 713-853-4743 .
Good job . Now what price should we bill EES .
Check out this site:
Hey Rhonda , my sources tell me that this $3.324 is the correct price . Thats a big bonus for EES .
We have a new Park & Loan / Storage deal on National Fuel effective 6/23/2000 . National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract to our brand new firm storage contract . We are now long FSS and short PALS . We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day . However , we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth on any given day . Also , the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect , like Trco-Leidy . We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel . IAS We give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement ( Nat Fuel is still setting up the contracts) . We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any point we wish . We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we withdraw on the FSS . And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it . COST What we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy . ENA will pay Nat Fuel 1,000,000 dth x ( $.125 / 3 months ) or $41,666.67 per month for June , July , and August . This deal is over on Aug 31st . I just entered the demand charge on my Market East demand charge sheet . I do not have any deals set up in Sitara . I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first . I will keep track of the balances on an Excel worksheet . All commodity cost and fuel is capured in the $.125 demand charge . Beavy and I will make sure the payback and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on this deal . If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any withdrawals , then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to keep the tickets balanced . Payback Techniques Under the expert eye of the wonderfull , superfantastic , all-around great guy , Dick Jenkins , I've come up with some options on paying back the gas . Niagara - only works when Niagara is open . Nat Fuel has been very close to capacity this week . However , we should always see what Martin can do with the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL . OR if Niagara is constrained , we can ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel , at today's prices that cost about $.105 Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq , ship it to Trco- Leidy , and payback the gas at Leidy . At today's prices , that cost about $.055 , assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers . Tenn - we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the Gulf to Tenn Z4 ( Ellisburgh) . We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on segmented capacity for $.145 or move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11 . We cannot use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects . Let me know if you have any questons .
Modest Too! !
I called Peoples , Karen was out and Deana was swamped so I didn't ask her any questions . I also received one voice mail from the Can Fibre guy and I have not heard from him either . Don't seem like anything is getting done . I hope you had a good weekend .
Hey Team . I need the following services set up on National Fuel . IAS <== we just created k# A02353 ISS <== I think we already have this set up on k#H02262 FSS <== Nat Fuel has not assigned this contract to us yet . Believe me , this all happened really fast . I just sent some of the paperwork to legal and I need it back by Monday morning .
Lotus Notes columbus thanks Enron Capital Management
My location is EB 3224b and anyday after 3:45PM is good for me . Thanks
This transaction involves 5 contracts . Nat Fuel is billing ENA a total of ( $.125 x 1,000,000 dth ) or $41,666.67/month for 3 months . I don't think Nat Fuel knows how we will be billed yet so I am going to show this as a demand charge on contract A02353 until we figure it out .
Tim , call Dick Jenkins about this capacity . His number is 3-5136
Went home and went to bed buddy ! So which of the lovely young ladies did you spend time with ?
Hey buddy . We are having all sorts of problems with St 30 , 90% internal . You should try to sell to someone else if possible . Maybe Williams? ?
as soon as you vgive me back my ice chest
Hey Team . Doug , correct me if I'm wrong , CES no longer has any Equitrans market and we still have the production . For July , take all of this gas into CNG . You will probably need to get the CNG meter set up in Sitara . You should also make sure the interconnect with CGAS is setup . You are all wonderfull people - I will make this free pop Friday ( Wooo Hooo) . thanks
Hi gang . I have not changed anything on the storage deals since the middle of last week . I am still showing our projected ending balance on June 30th to be 3,626,785 dth . Let me know if you see something different . Thanks
If its Stephanie you die ! I'm working on killing JD now .

Hey Buddy ! I just had a chat with Kori . She is very sad she didn't get a birthday kiss from you . There will be a little birthday bash on Friday July 7th and she will be there . What do you think ?
FYI . I changed the meter number on this deal from IMB-508914 to 9170 . They are both Trco Non NY .
I show no sales to CES for the month of July . I created deal 315460 to bookout with deal 217769 and deal 315471 to bookout with deal 223967 . Please let me know if you have any questions .
John , call me when you get a chance . I called 330-493-7790 and there is no voicemail .

ENA is selling the Power Gas Marketing pool gas behind East Ohio ( 10,000/month ) to EES for the month of July . EES has the ability to take this gas for the term of the deal ( through Oct 2000) . I told Marde we would talk about that after the 4th . EES will nominate this gas directly from Power's pool , so Heidi does not need to be involved at all . Heidi , it looks like this pool can be terminated . Peoples , for July ENA is selling 430/day to Clinton Energy ( Latrobe) . Heidi is working on that . Heidi also informed me yesterday that CES was terminating the Peoples pool effective 8/1/2000 . I suggested that we may need to transfer the pool to ENA , because there will still be activity in August due to the Latrobe fuel credit . However , we may be able to transfer any balances to EES effectve 8/1/2000 . Hopefully , we can talk about this after the 4th . Let me know if anyone has any questions .

I have not discussed August forward with anyone yet . I would like to discuss our options on handling the pool with Heidi , hopefully after the July 4th holiday . I hope you guys have a happy 4th if I don't talk to you before .
Hey , send them again . I don't have them .
FYI . Also take a look at today's Gas Daily
I will try to find out this afternoon exactly what EES is doing and give you an update .
I'm still looking for other emails .
We are borrowing 110,000 dth ( deal 322012 ) on Transco on the 30th and paying the gas back on July 1st ( deal 322007) . We are paying Trco a one time fee of $.0386 ( see below ) Volume Fee
I will enter this deal in the system and let you guys know what the deal number is .
The deal number for the gas below is $4.44 . We are using ENA transport and the deliveries are on a secondary basis . The deal number is 322199 and I added the meter numbers that I used to enter the deals . Robert , Joann , the volumes should not change and CES would like to keep this deal seperate from all other deals . Please let me know if there are any questions .
Joanie Veselack is leaving . She is going to PG&E in Bethesda
We have some small annoying park & loan deals on Iroq for July . The parking deal is 323553 and the loan deal is 323558 . When we get cut by an upstream or downstream pipeline , Iroq uses the park & loan contract to balance the supplies and markets .
Per my discussion with Marde yesterday afternoon - EES is set up to serve CanFibre . However , National Fuel Gas Distribution ( the LDC ) will not let any gas flow until CanFibre gets a corporate guarantee in place . Per Marde , CanFibre is working on getting a guarantee . OK - I'm tossing all my info on CanFibre .
Shame on you :o )
What about my camera info???? ?
How's that going anyway ? I forgot I had a marriage "arrangement" in the works !
Not hardly . Will she buy me some toys - a motorcycle , let me get my flying licenses , and a cheaper 4 wheel drive vehicle ? I will also need to travel back to Texas once a quarter to vist my family .
Not a problem . She can stuff the little sucker if I get all the other stuff . I'll start working on that 50 lbs right after I finish this cookie .
Yep . Went to Dad's on Sat , left Mon before lunch . Took my woman and went to Jerry's on July 4th . Had a good time . He does a good job cooking on his BBQ pit . I was very tired on Wed though .
Colleen , this is the email response I received . Kim , could you find out from payables if we are making payments to a company called "Capacity Center" ? If we are , I would like to know who with Enron is authorizing these payments . Thanks .
I'm going over the Park & Loan discounts on CNG for May . I need to see the invoice to compare what we were billed to what CNG is showing on the discount letter . Gloria , Terry does not have the invoice . Could you get me a copy please ? Thanks .
I love Chic Fil A!@! !
Let's try next week , I'm bouncing in and out this week . And THANKS!! !
I made the following changes so we can track and pay the KO Transmission invoice . I terminated deal 236178 ( CGAS k#60094 ) effective 6/30/2000 . I believe Joann has been using this deal to path the KO Transmission activity . I created deal 327869 effective 2/1/2000 - this is a CGAS contract with KO Transmission as the service provider . We will still do the noms via CGAS on this contract . However , we will pay KO Transmission for the transport expense . According to KO , we have not paid our Feb - May invoices . I set these charges up on deal 327869 as demand charges . The amount are small . Beginning with July , we will reflect a usage charge on deal 327869 . Questions? ?
We do all the KO noms on Navigator via k#60094 . CGAS does not bill us anything on this contract , KO does . KO somehow gets the information from CGAS . That's what confused me because I remember us sending in a fax nom . We don't even talk to KO anymore . I wish KO would reference the CGAS contract on the KO invoice . Maybe we could ask KO to do that . I had to chat with 1 KO person and 3 CGAS people to get all that information .
Beavy and I changed the following deals for July and August . We took all the August activity to 0 . This is how these deals should be balanced Deal 318562 with 318686 . And 318691 with 318682 . I'll look at the economics in the morning .
I think we should try an evening meal again . This is fun ain't it ?
I would like to RSVP for Judy Townsend and myself . Is it too late , will we get a free lunch , you how Judy loves a free lunch . Also , we will not be able to attend until around 11:30 am . Let me know it thats ok .
OK - what kind of car and where are you and I going on vacation ?
Here is the transport sheet for July . I believe its fairly current .
FYI - we are moving our local production behind Peoples to Clinton's pool . John , I assume you will be the one talking to the producer .

Anyone there ? Helloooooo !
I just changed the rate on Algon/transport usage deal 233358 from $.26 to
I have to look for the house key at home . I know I don't have it on my keyring .
I just had a thought . Just to keep you guys in the loop , I will send this type of stuff to you unless you tell me not too . You don't need to do anything with it . Its more of an awareness type thing .
Hi Steph , I don't know if this question should go to you . If not , please forward it on to the right person and let me know who that is . The reservation volumes on the seasonal contracts do not look correct . The demand charge looks OK , its the demand volume which is not calculating correctly . And ENA has released this capacity to Energy Express effective June 1 . Please look at the following contracts/deals . Contract Deal Comment 779234 003589 Boston releasing to CES 771224 003786 ENA releasing to Energy Express Contract Deal Comment 779233 003581 Boston releasing to CES 771225 003785 ENA releasing to Energy Express Thanks .
Dan does not know what this contract is used for . I think it has ( or had ) something to do with the Boston Gas contract . We currently use k#29667 for that . I would like to terminate deal 77257 effective 6/30/2000 . Comments / questions ?
I just changed the rate on Tenn/transport uage deal 235293 from $.11 to $.0116 . We should get back 85,155 x $.0984==$8,300 tonight .
How will New Power establish credit on the intersate pipelines? ? EES and ENA used corporate guarantees . Also , should I set up ENA as agent ( when I do this I prefer to be the billing and nominating agent) ? Where is my free lunch and my New Power golf shirt ?
Whatever happened to the good ol' days !
What about my camera info?? ? Jerry said he could see no problem with you coming to Chad's wedding if you want to. ,
The exchange deal numbers are 323558 and 323553 . Also , I changed the rate on Tenn deal 235293 from $.11 to $.0097 . thanks
Lynn Burke with the CDC's needs to release some CGAS and CGLF capacity to CES/New Power for August 2000-July 2001 . She wants to know who she should release the capacity to for August . ? ?? ?

Thank you for sending my drill book . I believe I have the key your are looking for . I also have a "Dog Care" book that fell out of Daisy's folder when I got her out of "jail" . I will have these items delivered to you as soon as possible .
Actually , we should be nominating only 4,000 month from Power Gas and 300 day from Phillips Production . That works out to about 429 day . I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be 4,000 for the month . AND Angie ( my super fantastic , can't say enough good things about her , will probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it , CNG scheduler ) has agreed to help out any way she can . She knows escript pretty well . Chat with Doug , if you guys agree , Angie can use your ID and password and figure out how to run all the reports we need back to January . Also , we will not know the actuals for July production until September sometime . Effective August 1st , the Phillip's wells should be transferred to Clinton's brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool gas . Doug , John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi . With Angie's help , we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly easy . Let me know what you guys think .
I tried sending this email about 3 weeks ago and had problems . So here it is .
Is this something Scott did for you ? He has been handling all the TCO activity . Let me know if this is something I need to do .
Sorry dude , I don't have his number . And I finished my first civil war book . I'll try to get that to you . Where should I invest my money ?
I sold CES 174 dt/day ( deal 335917 ) from the 20th through the 31st , at a delivered price of $4.395 . We are using ENA transport for pricing purposes .
Chat with Alan at EES , I bet its the same escript you currently use . This might be one of those "let me get Alan to help me for a free lunch" things .
I'll give you a call in the morning around 8:15 am . Later Buddy .
I changed the rate on transport usage deal 227992 from $.27 to . 32 . Impact will be ( $18,400 ) I need your help changing the curve formula - please .
FYI The 4,000 the East Desk bought from Ontario for tomorrow will probably get constrained but we wanted to try it .
Read below , are you interested ?
FYI I requested fuel waivers from Canajoharie to Trco-Leidy for Aug and CNG said no . I think they will still have the waivers to most of the citygates though .
Effective immediately we are changing the way we handle deliveries to Oglethorpe on Transco . Current Process ENA sales gas to Oglethorpe at St 85 ENA buys gas from EPMI ( deal 318335 ) at St 85 at Gas Daily ENA sells gas back to EPMI at Doyle Plant at Gas Daily plus variable cost . New Process ENA sells gas to Oglethorpe at St 85 ( deal 329314 , baseload deal and deal 318423 , gas daily deal ) ENA does an exchange buy ( deal 338732 ) at St 85 . Curretly , this volume will match the sale to Oglethorpe at St 85 ENA does an exchange sell ( deal 338735) , volume on this deal will be the amount on deal 338732 less Z4 to Z4 fuel .
Just send me $50 and we won't worry about it . I would also like a new golf shirt but I don't think I want the name Clinton on it right now . Try to get me an AEP shirt .
Hey , I just created a new deal for this contract effective 8/1/2000 . I thought I had done this but I can't find the other deal I created . The new deal #is 340210 .
Just spoke with Pops . I let him know that his favorite son ( ME ) will be up there this evening . He thinks I'm in Lufkin .
FYI
Very nice - now where did you say you and I are going on vacation ? I suppose we could make it driving trip to take advantage of your new car!! ! Did some boy buy that for you ?
Hi Gang . Transco has a shipper meeting next week in the afternoon . I will probably be out all week . I believe Scott Goodell and Beverly should go and take anyone else that would like to attend .
Is Denver around the block? ? How about Colorado Springs - I think its closer .
Bids close at 9:00 am on the 26th . The start date is the 27th . Currently there are no bids (  Scott and I will get with Dick this afternoon) . The min demand is $1.0587 which works out to be about $.035 per dth . The commodity is $.0155 ( no GRI ) and fuel is around $.09 at $4.00 .
Let;s you and I chat this afternoon about getting reimburse from Oglethorpe on Transco .
Add the demand to the commodity , that's comes out to $.0505 , there is your nickle . However , being that we work for a marketing company and recognize the value of fuel , we take that into consideration . The pipelines don't usually .
Yo buddy! ! I do have a worksheet but I still need to go through CES officially . Let me chat with Doug Kinney . I think it will be ok . I also told Doug that my worksheet was probably easier to use when looking at total by Pipeline . Get back with you soon .
As we discussed on the phone , Mike Garred with CES is requesting a copy of the CES demand charge sheet . Please let me know if you approve .
It probably was and at this point I don't know what is and isn't in the system .
Mike , here is the worksheet . The 2 tabs you need to use are "CES Retail East" and "CES Retail Mrkt" . Also , CGAS contract #67693 goes from 54,327 dt per day to around 108,000 dth per day starting Oct 1 .
Kim , please note I will be on vacation all next week , Jul 31st through Aug
She sure did . Molly Sumrow .
Very funny Thought y'all would enjoy this one!! ! Hey.. . I'm thinking about having my personal "send off party" this Saturday Night around 9-10 pm at Dean's downtown . I'm having problems getting my e-mail address book set-up , so I may need your help in spreading the word . Married folks with kids.. . get a baby sitter!! !
Where have you been ? What type of camera was it? ?
Hey woman ! When do you go north ? I'm looking at taking you out for a free meal the second week of Augy . I off next week and you know where I'll be .
Not too good . Hard to tell right now wether its short term or long term . We will have a better fill for it in about 3 or 4 days .
You may already know this - the CNG commodity rates on FT and FTNN changed effective 7/1/2000 . New Old Rates
I owe you big time . Send me a bill .
I heard from Algon yesterday on those contracts I said not to pay . We made a mistake releasing the capacity so ENA will be responsible for the charges . I do not want to bill CES for these charges since we made the mistake . This should only be a problem for May and June , I think . Please pay the disputed amounts .
Can't make it but thanks for the offer . I do plan on coming up some time this year . Can you help out my buddy Mike ? He will probably take us out for a fabulous lunch .
ENA sold the 10,000 dth of EOG pool supply from Power Gas Marketing to EES for the month of August at CNG IF flat - this is the same thing we did for July .
Got it . Thanks .
Thanks . Come have a brownie .

Total Receipts at Young Women's for August is 3,300 dth .
East Ohio I created deal 348393 ( sale to EES) . This deal should get matched with the purchase from Power Gas Marketing , deal 264613 for July and August . The deal volume is 10,000 for the month . We have the Power Gas deal thru October . We still need to sell Sep and Oct to someone . I noticed the volume for July in Power Gas Marketing is 0 , so I entered an expected volume of 0 on the EES deal . I didn't want to mess anything up so close to nom time . Please put 10,000 for the month on both deals for July . Thanks . Peoples I changed the volume on deal 264595 to 3500 for the month . This volume fluctuates each month and John Singer will tell us the actual volume . This deal also goes through October . We are buying local production from Phillips Production Company . I did not see a deal in the system for August so I created 348434 , the price needs to be corrected . This deal goes through November . The estimated volume for August is 300 per day , this volume also fluctuates each month. . We are selling all gas behind Peoples to Clinton , deal 348443 . The price on this deal is CNG IF per mcf . Clinton will pay us based on actuals . Let me know if anyone has questions .
I just sold 3,000 dth to CES for July 31st , deal 348523 . Per Jeff Porter , this is an in-ground storage transfer . Jeff is faxing me the form to transfer the gas from ENA's storage to BG&E's storage account . The transfer needs to be completed by July 31st .

Why yes we do and here it is . We create a new worksheet each month . The worksheet you are looking for is "Rates" . Assume the rate you are looking at is FT unless specified otherwise . And , depending on what you are looking at , we may not have GRI included in the surcharges . The password to modify is the filename "2000tran08" . Enron North America Corp .
This deal ( #227738 ) was booked in our system on Jan 17th . According to my notes , this is an "unwind" for AK Steel . It was done as a physical fixed price deal and it goes through September . The volume is 5,000 per month for April through August and 20,000 per month for September . CES sold the physical gas back to ENA . The only gas CES has are the Exhibit 1 volumes . So I created a sell ( #226553 ) to CES for the same volume at a price of IF CGAS + $.0075 . The deal numbers for March are 157559 and 205228 .
I took off all last week . Chad was married last Saturday , and I spent the rest of the week at Dad's and the hospital . I talked to Jerry today - He has been up there since last Wednesday . The Dr . said Pops has anywhere from 2 weeks to 1 month . They are taking him out of the hospital tomorrow or Wed . I'll be going up there quite a bit for a while . There is nothing wrong with a good heart attack .
Hi gang . I will be out of the office quite a bit over the next 4 weeks . Please make sure you copy Scott and Molly on all emails and send all faxes to Scott Goodell , just to make sure we don't miss anything . Thanks
Wade , please forward this to the person that pays Statoil . AND I just faxed you a copy of the invoice Kara faxed me . I believe Heidi Boyd told me that ENA was not making payments to Statoil so CES made the payments . Let me know what you find out . Please include Scott Goodell on all responses .
Please send those to Scott Goodell and he will get them to the right person . I believe ENA should be paying all those bills effective 1/1/2000 . Scott's address is His number 713-853-7711 thanks .

Hey buddy . I would love to take a tour . I'm tied up with a family illness for the next couple of weeks so don't wait on me . Great Idea though .
Thanks for pointing this out . To my knowledge we have never even tried to overlap the contract or do any segmenting . Enron North America Corp .
I don't think we will be able to do any payback at Niagara or Tenn/E Aurora on the National Fuel deal . After adjusting for what we took out today , we owe Nat Fuel about 88,500 dth . Here are the points that I believe will work best Tenn/Colden ( meter #060003 ) Tenn Zone 5 close to the Niagara Spur - we can use Dracut supply or Iroq/Wright supply . Tenn/Lamont ( meter #020072 ) Tenn Zone 4 - we can use Cook School for this or Dan can flow long haul - Cook School is baseloaded into CNG . Trco/Leidy - we currently have 1,000 dth from CGAS going into CNG - we can redirect this to Nat Fuel at no additional cost .
Hey buddy , can you just send me $20.00?? ? I won't be around for the happy hour .
As most of us are aware , Trasnco will be terminating all master commodity contracts effective 9/1/2000 . I don't think we should make any changes to the master contracts in our system until after the 1st . However , we will need start adding the demand contracts to the East and Market East in Sitara . Following is a list of master contracts and the associated demand contracts effective 9/1/2000 . Master/Demand Rate Sched Start End Offer

We sold directly to Clinton for the term of our deals . Clinton ( Latrove ) should have pulled directly from Power Gas Marketing's pool . The Power Gas Marketing supply deal ends Oct 31st and the local production deal ends Nov 30th and then we will be out of the local production business . We've tried to tell everyone but I bet you still get phonecalls until we are out of it . Sorry .
Steve , would you take care of this please ? thanks
OK . Different now . Is it ok if I send Lexi her own thank you card ? I going to try and print a picture of the cows to send with it .

Hey Doug , I'm back in the office for awhile . Let me know if you still have questions .
How's this? ?
IT WORKS!! !
Doug , we billed you incorrectly for June on the CGAS storage . We should have billed you for 1,089,289 but we only entered 497,015 in our system . We will get that fixed .
OK . When accounting did their initial draft for June production , we had a volume of 1,089,120 on deal ticket 268094 . Today , this same deal ticket has a volume of 497,015 . I think this was loaded back from Unify . Can we get that fixed ?
Miss me ? Apparently not - no hugs from you . Who is doing my Market area stuff and why didn't Alicia tell me she was leaving? ? I guess we aren't the item I thought we wuz .

I think selling the Power Gas Marketing gas to EES behind EOG is working well ( other than the price) . I would like to sell it to EES for the term of the deal . You have not sold it to anyone have you ? If not , I'm going to try to sell it to EES for the term . And if I remember correctly , the volume is 10,000/month and the term is 10/31/2000 , correct ?
I didn't buy it yet . But I going to take a serious look at it .
Hi gang . Please read the following and let me know what you think . Also , what would be the best way to handle this .
I'm not above groveling for affection .
Use the "Daily Activity" worksheet in this file . The CES storage balance as of 7/31/2000 is 4,053,932 dth ( see balance in cell L146) . The actual sale to CES for the storage injections is deal 268094 - this deal shows the daily and monthly activity . If I remember correctly , the only confusion we had on the TCO storage was the beginning balance . There was 170,981 dth in storage on March 31st . To correct for this , we adjusted the injections for April so that the balance on April 30th was 13% . Let me know if you have questions .
AND my COH balance effective 7/31/2000 is 4,053.932 (  a difference of 26dt's) .
Angie , would you go into Unify on July 31st and change the pathed volume to Clinton from 430 to 651 please - this should make the total volume = 13,551 . Change the supply from Phillips to balance out the transaction .
Thanks . This all started last November - where did the time go? ?
Hi Team . I just want to make sure everyone gets this message . Effective September 1 , we will be using "The New Power Company" in sitara . All existing deals will need to be changed to "The New Power Company" in sitara . If you enter deals in the sitara or you find an existing deal with the counterparty "Columbia Energy Services" , please change the counterparty to "The New Power Company" . Thanks
Please take a look at deal 372088 . Its a new deal that starts Sep 1st and it was entered in sitara on Aug 21st . I changed the counterparty from CES to New Power .
I think I see whats happening . I believe deal 372088 is a bookout with deals 229344 and 229357 . Should it also be a bookout with deal 227882 ? What about deals 169036and 217764 ? What about dea
Let me know if you have any questions .
Perfect . I will buy you one free coke! !
Good job Chris . My contact at Iroq is out of the office . When she gets back , I will agree to pay $10,153.82 per my worksheet . Let me know what would be the best way to enter this in Sitara . I think she is back in the office next week . I also think she will agree to my numbers just to get this resolved . However , she may just want us to pay what I think we owe while she does her own research . Comments ?
Chic-fil-a?? ? No problem 4,053,906 sounds good .
On September 26-28 , Temmessee is doing work at the Lockport compressor station , which is accross the river from Transcanada . This work will impact the amount of gas Nat Fuel can receive from TCPL at Niagara . Max capacity is around 429,000 dth . During the work , the estimated capacity wil be 300,000 dth . Nat Fuel will have to cut firm shippers .
Some questions about the 1st . Per the proxy , we should be injecting 26,219 dt/day into storage . You are showing 36,304 dt/day on the FOM sheet . AND I see a citygate load of 29,461 This morning Tim Ray sold Dick 23,060 dt/day at the pool . Is this to reduce the citygate load or is this additional New Power supply ?
Jeff , welcome to the club . We are going to send you , Ora Ash , Jeff Davis , and Cindy McGinnis some goodies . You , Ora , and Jeff will get Enron shirts . Cindy gets a jacket . Don't try selling this stuff on the street , OK ? I will be checking to make sure you pass the "goodies" on .

Kimat , It looks like we have some deals booked twice . Take a look at my worksheet . All volumes are monthly , positive is supply , negative is a sale . Also , I believe deals 231667 and 226703 should be moved to New Power . What about deal 202939 ? Normally , I move this deal to CGAS and its very confusing the way I do it .
The Power Gas Marketing supply for Sep is 3,000 DTH .
Hey woman , how much vacation do I have left BEFORE i fill out a timesheet for the 2nd part of August ?
I copied deal 226703 to 380492 for Sep forward and changed the counterparty to New Power . Robert , The volumes for deal 380492 are included in the FOM citygate sale .
According to my Mr . Scott Goodell , deal 231667 is a true sale to CES for Allied Signal . This deal just goes away on Oct 1st .

Kimat , I copied Sep forward on deal 202939 to deal 380571 and changed the counterparty to new power .

I just spoke with the lawyer . We can't do anything until the end of September . Then , if no one contest the will , I will go to court on a Friday morning and be appointed executor .

Boo ! Mary's address is Rt 1 Box 315
I changed the demand charge for Equitrans k#270 on the Aug and Sep worksheet . Would you let me know what the capacity deal tickets are and I will change Sitara as well . thanks
Kimat , I think either 226553 or 372096 + 227882 should be taken to 0 for September . I'm taking deal 226553 to 0 for now .
Con Ed released Transco space to EES . The offer # is 21535 , volume = 10,0000 Con Ed did the release pre arranged , non-biddable . Paul , you should be able to execute this space before 9:00 am and re-release it to me ( company #7973) . thanks .

I made a few small changes to the storage balances on CGAS . I had to create a new deal ticket starting Sep 1st because the name changed from CES to "The New Power Company" . Joanne , I made a change to Aug 31st . Kyle , I think you need to change tagg . Let me know if anyone has questions .
Colleen , we still show the 1,000 dt/day of Equitrans capacity on our CES ( now New Power ) sheet . Do you know if CES ever agreed to take this contract ?
Dick wants to over inject as much as possible for the holiday weekend . I adjusted the deal tickets in Sitara . We will inject 31,463 on the 1st , and 31454 on the 2nd-5th . Our injections drop to 25172 on the 6th .
The PPL contract number for September is 523489 , volume= 2,400 .
Uhhhh - - - - - - - Yea . Whoo Hooo . Hold me back . I feel the excitement . Just kidding , hope your day is full of wonders!! !
Wade , I have decided that everything currently in our system is incorrect . Please set up a meeting with all the people shown above and we will discuss how to correctly handle this in our system . We also have some other supply behind the LDC that we might as well handle correctly . Wade , while we are at it , do you want us to look at NYSEG , CPA , and East Ohio?? ? Any others ? People I need in attendance Mary Theresa or Jeanne Steve Gillespie Angie Sylvia Campos ( or someone from the contracts group ) This is what I'm thinking , everyone please think about this before we meet . I think I will have Peoples set up as a pipeline and we will move all the deals to this new pipeline . Steve , get the Peoples password from Angie . I need you to go into escript ( Angie can help you with this ) and run anything you can get out of this system . These are actually CES passwords .

I reserved a one-way ticket on Continental last night for 6:45am Tuesday , 19th . It cost $263.00 and its completly refundable . Sounds good to me . I told the reservation lady that I was thinking about buying 2 tickets and just get my money back for the one I don't use . I would buy one leaving Monday evening and the one for Tuesday morning COOL , don't you think ?
Shipper Meeting
I thought I would sleep in the car , or maybe a shelter .
You need to give me a boottle in a brown bag .
I just noticed that ENA is still agent for CES and CEM on Transco . If we no longer have a need to be agent , I think we should terminate those agencies . What do you think ?
We have a new Transco 6-6 contract . Del Mainline BG&E #7221 ( Non New York ) Please enter this on the morning sheet . Thanks
Opps . I made an error . This is a Sep 2000 contract . I changed the term on
With the change in segmentation rules on Transco , it has become much more critical to know the primary receipt and delivery points for the capacity we are buying . Mr . Goodell said that Tennessee's EBB will indicate if the points on the capacity you are buying are secondary or primary . I would prefer to know the actual primary points on the contract , especially the delivery points . I just bought some Z6-Z6 capacity from Penn Fuel for the balance of the month . Steve Gillespie verified that Penn Fuel released the primary receipt and delivery point on the contract . But , I'm taking Penn Fuel's word for it and I am unable to verify the information myself . It could have a big impact on what we flow in Z6 . Colleen , can we do anything about this through the regulatory process ? Let me know if you need specific capacity examples .
I'm all over it . I have 2 plane tickets , one for Monday evening , the 18th , at 5:20pm and one for Tuesday morning , 19th , at 6:45am . Knowing what a wonderfull morning person you are , I will probably leave Monday evening . AND I will be in town next weekend . Who is giving you a pool party? ?
I'm looking for an invoice from El Paso Field Services for July 2000 production . The rate should be $.05 and the volume should be around 37,000 . Have you seen such a thing ?
What are deal tickets 299159 and 299192 ?
I changed deals 268090 and 268093 effective 9/7/2000 . We plan to have storage maxed out by 9/30/2000 and there will be no injections for October . Comments , questions? ? Will this cause any problems with the Choice program in October ?
I'm there !
You are funny . I laughed for 5 min when I saw this .
I just entered a commodity rate on deal 299159 . It has very big volumes on it each month and there has not been a commodity rate on it . Joanne just verified that this is regular transport , not Dayton or CALP . This will be a big OA variance for June - August . This deal is for deliveries to Storage . Would you verify if ACA and GRI are billed for storage deliveries please ?
You changed the rate on this deal from $.0227 to $.0358 effective 8/5/00 . What's up with that girl ?
SST and we always assume we are using FTS .
I changed the formula on the IF-CNRGATH curve in the EastMrkt file . Before the change it was CGT/APPALAC - $.32 . After the change its ( CGAS - $.30)x(1-.0492) . This widens the spread by about $.24 .
I justed asked dick , vickie is taking over Dan's job . Does that mean transport?? ? EOL?? ? dick doesn't know .
This impacts the following deals in Sitara , Deal 222734 - purchase from Alliance Deal 265943 - purchase from Meng Deal 227992 - transport usage
Vickie gave me an open season notice on Transco's Momentum Expansion Project . Bids are due Thursday , Sep 29th . Momentum is expected to be in service by 5/1/2003 . Shippers can elect the following receipt points , St 65 , St 85 , or Destin . The primary delivery point is St 165 . The minimum term is 15 years . I will still be here doing transport .
Crystal confirmed that items coded as a demand charge on physical forward deals in the "External Column" do not show up in our P&L . Example: See deal 113266 , sale to Reliant . I was concerned that we would double dip the reimbursements for transport demand charges if I show reimbursements on the transport sheet and we include the reimbursements on the Physical Forward sale as well .
I was going to send you a photo of your woman from the baby shower but I can't load it from work . I'll send it to you next week .

We are at a $5.44 in storage on CGAS . I don't think I can give you anything on CNG but I'm still checking . Just assume I can't and I call you if I find something . The screen went up $.20 today .
I just deleted the External demand charge on deal 233091 . I wonder if there should be an Internal demand charge for $.09 ?
I entered a demand charge on deal 396265 . This is a Market East desk deal . I tried to enter a demand charge on the original deal for Oct 1999 but I kept having problems saving the deal so I created a new one . Let me know if this works .
I killed deal 396265 and added the demand charge to deal 124109 .

I just entered a deal in Sitara ( deal 399824) . This is a sale to Transco at St 65 , 50,000/day on the 18th - 30th . I also entered a transport usage deal 399826 for 50,000/day starting on the 18th . This deal captures the commodity cost to go from our St 65 pool to the SIMS pool .
I'm here . Judy and Scott Goodell are out .
Where are the actuals coming from ? Is this someone changing the supply matched up with the Clinton deal ?
Jim , deal 226121 is our long term CNG pool sale to EES - the volume is around 1,000/day each month . Deal 348393 is our wonderful sale to you behind EOG for July and August . Whats up ?
I gave to Kim Olinger .
I will be out this Friday , Next Monday and Tuesday . Dan will be out Monday but I don't know what his role will be with respect to transport anymore . Judy is out in the afternoons . So , that leave Scott , Vickie , and myself . Vickie's role has not been fully explained to me but I'm sure she will be involved transport somehow .
I added Meredith's photo to the web page below last night .
I just received a call from Damon Sykes at National Fuel . He said we have positive balance of 797,464 on our FSS contract , and we have a balance of ( 797,163 ) on our ISS . It looks like we paid back 301 dth too much . Damon said we need to do a nomination to reverse the storage balances and we need to take out the 301 dt . Would you guys speak to Nat Fuel about handling this please ? Don't worry about doing it this weekend , take care of it early next week . Thanks
However , I will be flying out of Baltimore Monday morning and I'll be dressing business causal . I'm leaving tonight .
Damon just told me he had the numbers wrong . The FSS balance is 797,464 and the ISS balance is ( 797,771) . This is better . We need to pay back another 307 on the ISS and we need to do the inventory transfer . I know you guys will make me proud .
Dick , use this worksheet to calculate NIPSCO's price . Scott , Dick may have you look at this . The prices in Column H are for capacity demand charges .
According to Brenda we owe Egan 101 dts ( per Egan's statement ) on the expired Egan storage contract . Jesse , would you verify this with Egan and find out what they want to do ? Thanks
Effective 9/15/00 ENA sold NIPSCO 500,000dth storage see deal #401601 . Adjusted the deal # 268093 & #268090 on the CGAS storage worksheet . Please make the necessary changes in TAGG Chris

Hi there . We changed our CGAS storage numbers today and we have fixed the Sitara deals and worksheet .
You're good ! Trip was busy but productive - got more free food . I didn't get home until 10:15pm Tuesday . I'm still tuckered . Give Muffy a hug for me .
Brenda , Vickie is our new Tenn transport person . Please give her our most recent set of Tenn invoices to look at . Thanks .
Russ , Please add all the following trading pipes/zones to the VNG desk . Pipeline Zones TRCO All CNG All CGAS All Tetco All Texas Gas Zone 4
Wade , for July and August , give me the actual volumes and price for Phillips and Power Gas Marketing behind Peoples . AND are these volumes MCF's or MMBTU's ? AND do we back out any gathering charges on this gas ?
Russ verified that agency transport capacity deals can be set up in Sitara before the agency contract is in Global . That makes things quicker for Scott and I .
I sold the Niagara/Nat Fuel back to the Central Desk for the rest of the month . Please take the 16,500 dt of Trco Z6 to Z6 space to 0 in Sitara for the balance of the month . Thanks
When did Bay State bill ENA for this ? And , did Bay State pay there bill for gas ENA sold them or did they deduct this from the payment ? It does work out to 5,500 dt per day at $.09 .
I tried my new sweatpants on and I really like them . Thanks . Where is the place you used to get your car serviced ?

I entered volume and pricing on the following 2 deals in Sitara; Deal 418015 CNG citygate with Tenn Prod plus transport pricing . Deal 418065 CGAS citygate with TRCO and CGLF production pricing and Trco , CGLF , and CGAS transport pricing ( this will take a while to do) . Do we want to turn the auto-confirms OFF ? I think every time I create a VNG deal , a confirm is faxed to them . AND if anyone has a better was of doing the deals (  should we show these as production area sales) , please let me know . The easiest way I can come up with is to enter the sales at the citygate or storage facility and have most of the pricing done in a worksheet .
Correction deal 418015 is really 418051 .

Donnie , for July , adjust the Clinton volume to match the purchases from Phillips and Power Gas Marketing - DO NOT SEND OUT AN INVOICE ADJUSTMENT . I may need to change the price on the sale to CLINTON so that our receivables are netting to 0 . For August , September , October , and November , make the Clinton volumes match the Phillips and Power Gas Marketing Supply and DO send an invoice adjustment to Clinton . Paul , let me know if you have questions . For July , the imbalance is actually in CES's pool and I have no idea how to adjust that . For August forward , I believe we should just bill you for the actual metered production volumes since the imbalance will be in Clinton's pool . Let me know if you want to make any price adjustments - knock a nickel off the price - I just want these deals to go away . Oh yeah , and make Clinton a lot of money !
Update Jerry and I went to East Texas this weekend . we withdrew $750.00 from the Fredonia bank and I'm going to deposit that in the Credit Union . I also took the petty funds in the kitchen drawer - $72.00 . AND we did get $2,000.00 deposited into Dad's account from the Credit Union . later dudes

Hey Don , I'm still working on this . I should have an idea by this Wed .
Who handles the billing for Ashland Chemical ?
I think we need to make sure we are doing a "point nom" . Acually since we don't EDI , we probably don't even need to do a point nom in Unify .
We need to confirm all the data on Mark's worksheet . Let me know if you have any questions .
I think we need to get scheduling , volume management , and accounting together somehow . I don't think a happy hour would do it because people tend to get in their groups and talk . Let me know what you guys think . I would like to talk to Bob Hall and Bob Supperty about this, .
Yes I wuz !
We bought back some of New Powers first of the month volumes on deal 431846 . Please match this deal with 431849 . I did this deal on the 5th and its effective the 7th - 31st .

Hey team , I know you guys are concerned about my welfare so I'm taking vacation . I will be off on Tuesday Oct 17th and the week of Nov 13th-17th .

I just entered the following 2 deals in Sitara for September , deals 433359 and 433385 . Please path these deals in Unify . Thanks
Dan and I spoke with Jim Eckert at Tenn - VNG is his customer . Following are the MDQ's and rates on the Tennessee contracts effective 11/1/2000 Contract MDQ Delivery Point Demand Comm Comment 47 16,373 S Webster $6.0800 $.0500 Demand is $6.08 for daily volumes below 4,723 per day . Demand goes to $7.61 for daily volumes above 4,723 per day . Comments: If we flow to any points other than the primary delivery point , the demand charge goes to max rate which is about $9.80 . Questions for Tennessee; What are the rates for October ? Do the differences in demand and commodity apply to daily quantities or monthly quantities ?
Please redraft the New Power September activity . I'm looking for the deals shown below AND there should be a demand charge of $892,040.00 on deal 377245 and a demand of $624,028.00 on deal 381811 . If you see the items above , please send me a new worksheet . Thanks
Attached are my demand charge calculations for the month of September . I also included the scheduling fee of $10,000.00 . David and I discussed this . Let me know if you have any questions . Mr . Westover , there should be no manual billing for the month of September , everything should be billed through the system .
I will fax you another report that should have the same data in a different format .
I want to discuss further and you should probably buy me a drink . Oh yea , you already did ! Enron North America Corp .
Nuthin I want to put in writing .
We are missing 2 deals , 433359 ( sale ) and 433385 ( purchase) . Please redraft and let me know if you see these .
Oh now you're teasing me ! I went riding last night . I think I need some winter motorcycle gear . My brother and I are taking a biking trip in November - don't know where we are going yet . How's the new job ? What do you do with yourself in the evenings now ?
I went motorcycle riding last night - I think I need to get some better winter riding gear . We will definitely go to court next Tuesday at 1:00 PM . All we are doing is verifying Dad's signature on the will . Once the judge sees us it should only take about five minutes . That's all I have for now .
I'm having a problem sending this to Don . What is eamil ?
Jeff said he is still not seeing these 2 deals for September . These are the deals I entered in Sitara yesterday for Sep . Would you check on them and let me know what you find out ?
I spoke with Rich yesterday . He said it would be OK to net the storage true up invoice from Ernie with the Sep invoice . I mailed the invoice via interoffice to Jeff . There are 6 or 7 deals that ENA billed CES for September that should probably be billed to New Power . All of the deals in question are on the Central desk . How does the reconciliation look for Jan - June ? Rich said it was his understanding that these months look good and the adjustments are minimal .
Please forward to Don , my email is not going through .
I will be out the week of the 13th .
Cute , I want one! !
Did you call me ? I have a message from Mike at 3-5480 . It ain't your voice on voicemail .
ENA is set up as agent for Sithe Energies , USA , INC on CNG Transmission . I believe either Kate or Robin did a deal with Sithe last October . ENA released capacity to Sithe ( only 500 dth per day) , and acted as billing and nominating agent on this contract . It was a citygate sale in New York and we wanted to transfer title at the pool . I received a call from Scott Nelson ( 212-351-0494 ) with Sithe this morning . He is terminating the agency .
If I remember correctly , I believe Sithe had just purchased this plant from someone else . The delivery point on CNG was NIMO . And this was the only time we ever used the agency on CNG .
I didn't go to the shipper meeting . We sent Sean Boyle , he's an ex CNG guy that works for us now . You may have chatted with him at CNG/Sabine way back when . He's a combo physical/financial guy in our group . My Dad's estate stuff is still hanging in the air . No new news - I hope to find out more next week . Think I'll take half a day of vaca - later ! Tell Muffy I said hi !
I think everyone needs a good wife !
Let me know the deal # after you enter it in Sitara . Thanks
I will be out tomorrow and I may leave early this afternoon . Could you email me the deal numbers for the 3 purchases and 12 sales for the month of August ?
James Eckert with Tenn has agreed to have lunch with us on Wednesday . I don't think we all need to go and I don't need to go either . He is going to educate us on the VNG contract #47 . The demand charge and commodity is discounted effective 11/1/2000 . This is what we know about the contract: The 1st 4723/day that we flow is at a discounted commodity of $.05 and discounted demand of $6.08 If we flow more than 4723/day the demand goes to $7.61 What I need to know is exactly how the demand charge will be calculated for volumes over 4723 day . What is the demand charge if we flow 6000/day for November -
I need your SS #'s for my beneficiary form . Jerry , please forward to Don , I couldn't email him the other day .

Were you going to send me some deal numbers to check out for August ? 
Come chat with me when you get a chance . I see you are not at your desk , as usual .
No can do on lunch next week . How about after work at that little Italian place ( i think ) close to St Thomas High School ? We talked about this place before
5.215 by 5.225 , I bought 5.235 , thought it was going up
Judy bought some new capacity on TRCO Rec St 62 Delivery St 65
You're on !
CGAS storage looks good . We are still working on the ohters . I should have a better feel by tomorrow afternoon .
Call me when you get a chance . There is some new capacity to execute for November . Expiring contracts are show in purple , the new contracts are shown in yellow . Ignore the demand charges for now , I did not verify them . I won't execute these until I hear from you . The capacity listed below was purchased from the pipeline . Scott said Jeff gave us the OK on this one .
Opps . You don't work for CES anymore .
You are correct . The top 3 contracts were released to CES and the bottom one is released to ENA . I will execute all of them and re-release the CES's contracts to ENA .
I meant the top 4 contracts
I know , tell all the women you know .
Are you guys looking for people ? I have a call from an ex KN Energy lady looking for a job . Name Sharon Dale Beavers Phone 281-397-85285 Let me know .

I need to check this one . We have several contracts with evergreen clauses . I didn't think this one had an evergreen clause but maybe it did .
Call me buddy . Ingrid wants to come over and do a dog and pony show about Transco's new ? ?system? ? I think . AND I suggested she meet with EES and ENA at the same time . I'm thinking around the 1st week in November . What do you think ?
Run facilitation by location reports for November 1st for Columbia Energy Services ? ??(Inc I think ) and The New Power Company and Enron Energy Services , Inc . thanks
We both ran out of gas . I just happened to be 20 ft from the gas station when I did it . That was the first time we went by the skydive place .
CNG has new commodity rates effective 11/1/2000 New Old Fuel remains unchanged at 2.28% .
Update , Scott and I are still looking at the storage numbers . We hope to have it done today but we are having trouble nailing down the numbers .
Update . Spoke with the lawyer yesterday . We can't buy Don out right now . We need to turn in the final inventory list , get things resolved with Mary ( be it good or bad ) then we can buy Don out . She still thinks that we won't have any issues with Mary . After we provide the inventory list , she wants me to meet with her ( Joal) , Mary , and Mary's lawyer to see what we need to do to get this CONFLICT resolved . Joal thinks we should be able to do this during the first 2 weeks of November . I have a bad cold and I went scooter riding last night . Do you care ? I can't blame brother too much , I still bounce back and forth between major frustration and apathy on the East Texas issue . Hope for the best! ! Later
Kim , please forward to the traders . I think the schedulers have this already . Please forward: Room Change
Did everyone see this ?
I checked the CGLF and CGAS capacity against Navigator . Take a look and let me know what you think . Also , do you know the demand charges for the CGAS items highlighted in purple ?
Jeff Westover said you want the demand charges split out by pipe . I attached September , is this the month you are looking for ?
Steve Stonestreet said you have an email address for our team . I would like to have that please . I need to know what our demand charges are for some contracts that start in November . thanks
Deal 452810 is an ENA sale to New Power at IF + . 0075 for 10,000 dth day starting on the 27th . New Power is selling this gas to Aquilla .
Maybe we should add another section to Mr . Scott's worksheet for "Third Party" buy's and sells ( like the Aquilla deal #452810 ) and the deal we did on the 7th where ENA bought the gas back from New Power . Not a big deal for October , but we will probably start doing our maunal billing process again for the winter months . I could see you guys buying incremental third party gas that we may need to schedule , especially during high pipeline constraints . Example: You might buy gas from Sempra at Eagle into CGAS and we use your transport to get it to a citygate . ENA would buy it from New Power at Eagel and sell it back to New Power at the citygate . We should let you know what the deal ticket number is via email or phone call and Scott could put it on the worksheet . So if we had this tab for October , it would just have 2 deals on it so far . Comments ?
The CGAS exchange deals I set up for CGAS storage end Oct 31st . I'm thinking of changing the process effective 11/1/2000 - 3/31/2001 . ENA billed CES ( now New Power ) for the gas delivered to storage . Now ENA needs to pay New Power for the gas taken out of storage . In my example , we would need to recognize the beginning storage balanc e effective 11/1/2000 . Take a look - let me know if you have any comments .
Sean may want to go to this .
I just spoke with Joann and this is what we are coming up with on CGAS . Est Citygate for Nov 43,213 Storage Withdrawal 15,000 Net Purchase from ENA 28,213 Does this look correct ? We would enter a citygate sell to New Power for 43,212 and a purchase from New Power of 15,000 ( grossed up for fuel) . AND , Dave , it looks like you might have 3 or more worksheets that you are maintaining . Do you want to try and do away with any of them ? All I really need are the FOM numbers buy pipeline buy pricing zone .
Done deal 454150
Scott Goodell who knows all and sees all said he is at AEP , and his number is 614-324-5038 . Scott is THE MAN !
I entered deal 454356 in Sitara . ENA inherited this deal from CES . This is a sale to Nashville Gas Company at CGLF Mainline . I entered all the pricing and volume terms on the comments . P.S . Nashville is in the process of assigning this deal to Sempra .
Remember the Titans!!!!!!!!!! !
Who's gonna pay for my popcorn ? Did you like that pumpkin ?
Hey team . I just created deals 456630 ( sale to New Power ) and 456638 ( buy from New Power ) at the pool . This is to record the gas ENA is buying back from New Power when there daily loads drop below the FOM numbers . I'm using the following FOM numbers 7th-26th 41,762 New Power sold back 10,000 dth day 7th-31st Using these numbers , ENA is only buying back a total of 164,031dth through the 25th . Not as much as I thought .
We should have some impact from the following deals 456630 , 456638 , and I increased the price on 414075 .
YES WE ARE! !
We sold the 1533 / day to Allegheny - deal 459226 . This is back on a month to month basis . We don't know if we are selling them gas for Dec yet .
Contract MDQ
FLARE IT! !
Marlene , please call Beverly at 713-853-6357 when you get this contract set up . Thanks

When do you take the bike to the shop ? I have your key on my keyring .
I created deal 461123 ( purchase from New Power ) and deal 461134 ( sale to New Power) . I will price both deals using the FOM index pricing . Jeffrey Porter@EES
I just entered the CES demand charges for August on the following deals Deal 343896 - East demand charges of $655,443 Deal 231667 - Market East demand charges of $881,995 Thank you Melba
You De Man !
I moved the volumes on deal 241639 from Transco Leidy to CNG Leidy .
Just send cookies then and we will be happy .
I still have not released the 700 dth of capacity from VNG to Nabisco on CGAS . I just spoke with Henry Riewerts at Nabisco . He does not have a navigator ID and password . This will be the only CGAS activity he has and he has not bought any gas for Nov either . I think he needs someone to handle this for him . Is this the type of thing we can pass on to EES ?
I need to look and see what I have . But first , you are not going with some boys are you?? ? I have a really cheap sleeping bag , some collaspable water bottles , all sorts of small cooler type things , OHOHOH , I have a "wet seal" bag that you could put some goodies in to keep them dry . Do you need fishing stuff ?
Yes - a small one . So maybe you should go camping with me - and I have fishing stuff too . Where are you going camping .
I will bring it and anything else I might have in tomorrow that I think you can use . I will leave my sleeping bag in the car though .
We have a volumetric contract on Texas Gas and I'm not sure how to enter it in Sitara . The volumetric demand charge is $.005 , deal #461568
Jeff Porter with New Power just informed me that they are buying "a little more" than 4,300 dth per day of citygate gas on CGAS . Dick and I will be chatting about this later today . Joann found out about this yesterday and this is the first time I've heard about it .
I brought in my backback , 2 flashlights , and a small cooler type thing . They are sitting on top of my neighbor's desk . Come take a look when you get a chance .
I'll be gone but I will leave it on top of my desk . The backpack is dark blue and is has "CRUX by Gregory" written on it . There is a yellow cooler inside and 2 flashlights .
I fixed the volumes on deals 456638 and 456630 for the 31st . Please take all other volumes on these deals to 0 . Thanks
Have I told you how wonderful you are ? I actually the Gas Daily prices for every day . If you could just enter them in Column S I would be so gratefull .
Let's chat about CNG retail storage on Monday
I just set up all the deal tickets for the CGAS New Power storage contract for Nov-Mar . We believe our agency relationship with New Power will end effective March 31 , 2001 . The deal numbers are on the attached worksheet . I entered the following deals at a zero commodity 470563 Buy exchange 470582 Sell Cpr Storage 470587 Buy CPR Storage 470568 Sell exchange I added about 7500 dth to deal 456379 for November and I extended it through March 31 . I'm kinda sleepy so I probably made a few mistakes .
I don't think I ever saw the breakout on the access area since we didn't get this via capacity release . I'm here for you - NOT . Enron North America Corp .
I added the pipelines and zone/point combonations that I feel we will be using most on EOL . Let me know if you have any questions .
I've entered a mother load of comments on all the deals . please let me know when you validate these or what else you need . Kimat , the exchange deals were not validated yesterday . Did this have a big p&l impact ? My TCO schedulers said there volumes were off by about 6 BCF .
We are injecting gas into EGAN storage today through Monday , off of Texas Gas and CGLF . We will be withdrawing this gas ratably in Dec into Texas Gas . I will probably make a mistake or two on my deals because I'm kinda sleepy . Crystal will help me set up the deals on EGAN . I am currently using a CPR Storage deal ticket and I believe that is incorrect . I will let everyone know the deal tickets by the end of the day .
Donna explained how everything is working so Victor has killed the following deal tickets Deal Comment 470563 New Power Exchange buy 470568 New Power Exchange sell 470582 CPR Storage Sell 470587 CPR Storage Buy We will be using deal 456379 ( purchase from New Power ) through March 31st . Also , we need to make sure we do not recognize the storage balance in Sitara . Joann has the storage contract number if anyone has questions .
I can't see what you have in the 5th column . Buy , if the all meters on the pipe are marked at TGT/ZSL then that tells me what I need to know .
Great , exactly what I needed .
Have we scheduled any gas on the following contracts ? Deal contract
Use "Sheet 3" on the attached file . Page me at 1-800-978-1788 if you have questions .
I did vote for the new sports arena . AND , I'm sending the latest schedule to the lawyer today . I will wait till after lunch to send it in case you guys have any more input .
I took the volumes on deal 472520 ( CPR Storage ) to 0 and moved them to the following deals . Crystal , deal 472520 was valued at CGLF IF . Deal Comment 473178 Exchange sell for the November Injections 473190 Exchange buy for the December withdrawals . Susan wants the withdrawal volumes to go into Texas Gas . Tricia , deal 473190 has the daily withdrawal volumes . Please set up the Egan to Texas Gas ticket . All of my information is on the following worksheet 0:/logistics/capacity/east/NE/Egan_strg_NOV2000.xls if any is interested .
Look again and let me know . I had problems seeing the volumes at first , THEN I opend my eyes . Makes a world of difference !
Commodity and fuel should be 0 going back into Texas Gas . thanks cg
I know it , you know it , who's telling all the single women? ?
Please transfer the storage balance of 420 dth from contract 530750 to VNG contract 300008 . Thanks
My Tetco schedulers have not gotten back to me on whether we have shipped gas on these contracts . I'll try to check that myself today .
Don't worry about getting me a Diet Coke . I just got one .
I entered deal 477669 in Sitara as a purchase from New Power at the FOM index pricing . Jeff , I believe this works out because we should be increasing our citygate sale to you , also at the FOM price . Jeff , I'm out all next week , just call Joann and she will get the pricing and enter the deals . Also , just so I don't forget , I sold 5000 dth day of TCO Pool to New Power for the 10th-30th at $5.68 . I won't enter a deal for this , I just need to incorporate it into my citygate pricing . Jeffrey Porter@EES
Nov 1st . Enron North America Corp .
I bet everything we did in June , July and August is wrong in Unify as well . I wonder if we should go back to June 1st on setting up this contract ? We don't have that much activity on this contract . Let me know .
I just updated the Egan Exchange tickets and my worksheet for Nov and Dec . I think we were out of balance by about 10,000 last night - my fault .
What Chics will be there - and you don't count .
Hey , you're back . Did you have fun ? jerry and I are taking a motorcycle trip next week .
Thanks for the post card .
National Fuel Gas Supply is having a Customer Information and Procedures Meeting on Thursday , Dec 7th , at the Marriott West Loop by the Galleria . The meeting starts at 9:00 am and will probably last to mid-afternoon . I'm going . I don't know if anyone else needs to go - Algonso maybe .
Your camera takes good photo's . We are going to the timeshare at Canyon Lake . Remember , they had the pig and it sleep with Chad and Chance . We are trailering the motorcycles up there and we are going to take day trips around that area from the time share . We have the timeshare Mon-Thur or Fri . Then we are going to Dad's for a night or two .
I just created deals 480324 and 480325 on CGAS for Oct 31st . I missed these . Please path them in Unify . Thanks
Attached is my demand charge worksheet for October . Jeff , we should probably chat about the pricing . I'll explain it to you when I get back . On TCO , I averaged everything together and entered a fixed price on the big citygate deal .
Alfonso , you are off the hook .
Mary downloaded the purchases and the sales to excel . I spot checked some of the deals and they look good to me . There are 2 small deals that are missing , deals 480324 and 480325 . These deals are related to the CGLF NYMX purchase . I had the buy/sale on CGLF . I didn't enter the buy/sale on CGAS until this afternoon . Alvin should have these tracked and balance early next week . The dollar impact should be very small . Remember , I'm out next week .
Now that's funny !
I missed you too .
I LOVE MY SWEATS !
I can't remember , should the VNG demand charges be on I'm VNG or East and Market East ?
I deleted 2 meters from deal 418282 for 12/1/2000 - 3/31/2001 . Please make sure the risk assignment is still ok . Thanks

The delivery to the citygate should be on the big FOM deal ticket comingled with everything else . Jeffrey Porter@EES
I don't have any of the contract information . I will have to get the info , get Marlene to set these up in global contracts and then set them up in unify . It probably won't happen today . I'll keep you posted .
I entered this deal in the system with the wrong term date . I entered this as a Dec-00 deal . The term is 11/23 - 11/30/2000 . My fault . I corrected Sitara .
I know you don't believe this but I am working on a notional offer .
Man what a busy day . I guess Ingrid is ok . I have not spoke to her for awhile - since Peter Vint's wedding I think . I'm mooching off my brother's in-law's for turkey day , then going to my Dad's place this weekend . What are you doing ?
Would you get me all the contract details on this capacity and email it to me ? thanks
Please add the following person . Victoria Versen happy Turkey day .
I'm sorry I have not responded sooner . Any new developement on this ? To my knowledge , ENA has not done any imbalance trades . Do you have a contact at Statoil ? I can call and try to get more info . It could be some CES thing we were not aware of .
I think this is correct . We will show it this way for now . Can you verify what were billed in demand for Oct please . No rush. ,
Matched TRCO bid . I was bid #5 ! ! !

We are parking gas in Egan on the 30th ( deal 508572 ) and taking it out rateably in January ( deal 508582) . ENA will pay EGAN $.22 x total volume parked . These deals are seperate form the Nov-Dec parking deals . Currently , I show we are parking a total of 145,052 ( to be taken out in December ) and a whopping 48,025 ( to be taken out in January) . Lia , please make sure these volumes show up on Texas Gas - let me know if you have questions . Thanks
You are the best . I owe you a popcorn , small .

The following info was provided to me by Leah Moss at Tetco . Meters 71979 and 71980 are on non-contiguous laterals . Tetco doesn't know how this gas flows . They are still checking into this one . It may actually flow into CNG. , Meters 72554 and 72803 are "normal" Tetco M2 meters . This gas is a backhaul to Winridge and Hooker [make sure you use the backhaul contract] and a forwardhaul to Delmont and Oakford . The forwardhaul fuel is 4.11% .
I have an appointment to get fitted for a suit tonite and then I;m going drinkin after that . Is it ok we leave tomorrow ?

We have a 5,000 day purchase from Bay State that we can take at CNG/Trco Leidy or at CNG South pool meter 10002 . The deal number is 418282 . Could we put this deal number on the CNG and/or Trco sheet ? We currently have this deal baseloaded to CNG South Pool . We need to call Bay State if we move it . My contact at Bay State is Stacey Djukic 219-853-4320 . I gave Stacey Angie's number as a contact . If we can't get in touch with Stacey , then talk to Robin .
According to Kimat this is flash to actual stuff now . I made these adjustments today for Nov 30th . Joann , Alvin , the deals listed below are bookouts .
I'm having trouble getting off . What time is the flight out on the 29th - that's my trouble day , the latter the better so I can be here in the morining .
I am taking off half a day PM on Dec 29th and Jan 1st - 3rd . Please put this on Dicks calendar and the desk calendar . thanks
My worked . How many times a week did you put down ?
What should I tell the lawyer if she should call today ?
I didn't call be cause I got home at 11:00 PM. . I though you might be asleep .
We don't have a time frame and I have told her we need to sell the cows and the tractor .
Did Tim and Dick ever chat about the FOM stuff? ? What numbers should I be using now , FOM number , Volume sold back at Index Flat ? Jeffrey Porter@EES
Ms . Arnold called looking for the IF today . She gets a much better response out of me than you do .
The GD Flat buyback from Adams at the TCO pool is deal 516555 . I created the deal with 0 volumes .
ENA has a put to COH ( deal 213360 ) for up to 10,000 dth/day . This deal was in the system for December and I just took it to 0 for the whole month . I estimate we should make about $495,000 on the deal change . Kimat , this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put . I believe its in the deal correctly . Alvin , please show this on the morning sheet as a "Put to COH at IF" or something real intelligent like that . This deal goes thru 2/28/01 .
Call me Hussy ! I got questions .
Tetco is going to start scheduling Lambertville . Lambertvile is in Tetco M3 ( in New Jersey) . This means that anyone flowing gas through Lambertville on a secondary basis will probably strart getting curtailed . Lambertville on Tetco will be just like Linden on Transco Z6 . The following LDC's/points are downstream of Lambertivlle . E Town N Jersey Con Ed Bug Belle Mead ( interconnect with Transco ) Hanover ( interconnect with Algonquin ) Leidy is considered upstream of Lambertville . Also , deliveries to Algonquin at Lambertiville is considered upstream of the constraint . Tetco will not give me any indication as to how much gas may be cut or how much secondary will be allowed to flow through Lambertville . Meredith , when you get a chance , please confirm which points are downstream of Lambertiville .
I created deal 516907 as a physical forward sale to Oglethorpe Power . Jim , Judy has told me that under no circumstances should I be involved with Ogy unless she is out . But she also said she will gladly fix any deal entry misstakes I make . I humbly accept my position .
I love my sweats . Hows muffy ?
Sorry about that . Gotta go to a meeting . Give Muffy a hug for me .
I'll be winning the lotto soon . Nice knowin ya !
Oh be still my aching heart , filled with bitter sorrow at my loss , ( sniff ) I'm ready to move to Ohio and become a pig farmer and work on my poetry! !
There is a demand charge of $-.22 x 900000 on this deal ticket . I think the demand charge should be $-.22 x 10,000 x # days on the month . This equals 900,000 over the term of the deal . I changed the demand charge volume to 310,000 for Dec 310,000 for Jan 280,000 for Feb Audrey , the global contract is 96017642 and 12/2000 is the first month of this deal . We should receive and invoice from COH for the demand charge . There is a very slim chance we will be selling COH any gas on this deal for the month . Would you forward this email to the person that handles COH ? Thanks
I just faxed the inventory list to Jerry . Don , do you have a fax number I could send it too ?
Type Comm Fuel Total at $8.70 Diff . 1467

Hi . I probably will not be able to attend the meeting on Thursday . Should I let someone in your office know about that ?
Could one of you fine gentleman give me the details of what New Power paid ENA for October activity ?
This is a Zone 4 to 4 fuel percent . Doyle is . 8 miles off the Transco mainline . What do you think ? I thought Chris Meyers said they took this into consideration when talking to Transco . It has no impact on pricing when flowing the gas from St 85 or St
Why did you go to power ? Are you going to look for some of the mistakes I made back in 1994? ?
Hey Team ! This email is just an FYI for you guys . I don't expect you to see anything until January .
Early morning , right ? I want to be rested for the big party .
Do you have a total dollar amount that New Power paid for Oct production ? According to David Scott at New Power , they did not make any adjustments to the bill . He said they may not have received all of the bill , there might have been some Michcon activity missing .
You make it sound like you are going away for good . I'll see you when you come back .
What happened to all my emails ? How's my Duff ? What's going on ?
Call me , we want the backhaul contract
We have a new backhual contract from Transco . Demand $.07 Volume 5,000 Rec Zone 6 Del Zone 1 I just set this up in Sitara . Please try to set up an activity number on this contract this afternoon . Judy will be using this contract to flow 1 to 3 , 2 to 3 , or 3 to 3 . We may use this contract to hook up with Leidy gas and flow it to the 210 pool or to Doyle .
Dick has this in at a $6.89 , I assume you are ok with saving $2,250 on the Jeffrey Porter@EES

Have fun . Gas prices are going through the roof
I need to hold the New Power invoice until Monday . It should be ready to send out Monday afternoon and everything should be captured in Sitara .
I must have deleted the GRI memo I had . Sorry about that .
I need a volunteer . The "Vol" will be responsible for pricing all of The New Power deals in the market area . 99% of this activity takes place on CGAS . Who wants it ? Certain people have expressed an interest in learning more about pricing , Tricia Spence , Joe Casas , and Beverly Beaty . I estimate it will take about 15 minites a day during the month , and about 4-6 hours during bidweek . I also believe this deal will go away effective Pros Will learn the concept of a physical bookout - will become a Sitara pricing guru like myself . Will learn a great deal about transport pricing . May lead into executing capacity on CGLK and CGAS - I will not turn this over until I am satisfied with the Vol's performance on pricing . Can easily be done after the work day crunch ( this may be a pro or a con ) Will learn more about the pricing curves and how physical deals impact the desk P&L . Cons Somewhat tedious - not as bad as it used to be . May have to anwser Dick Jenkins questions . I will have to assign this to Scott or Vickie if I don't get a volunteer . I will do the training - possibly in the evening or on the weekend , AND I'm very detail oriented . I will provide feedback on this persons progress and I take this part of the job very serious .
opened $9.50 by $9.60 now $9.25 by $9.35
I need a Destin class . The only think I know about Destin is that its a Transco Z4 Mainline Point .
TP #6562 , North Carolina Nat Gas , is a true backhaul from the Z6 210 Pool . TP #6068 is the Trasnco interconnect with Col Gas at Dranesville . This point is also a true backhaul from the Z6 210 Pool . The meter number for Public Serv . NC is TP #6608 , and this is also a true backhaul from the Z6 210 Pool .
That means you didn't send me the attachment . OR if you did , I don't see it .
Would you send me the purchases ? thanks
Looks good with the following changes . If you see these changes come through then its good to go . Thanks The price on deal 511820 should be $4.7012 not $4.8041 , just corrected in Added demand charge of $1,233,260 to deal 508891 . Added demand charge of $647,256 to deal 380571 .
call me
We a conference room big enough for 8 people on Thursday , Nov 14 at 3:00 PM . Vickie , I will see if the meeting date can be changed if Dan calls .
Date correction , Dec 14 , not Nov 14 .
Don't forget to chat with VNG about Nabisco . VNG should have released 700 dth of CGAS capacity to Nabisco effective 11/1/2000 - 10/31/2001 . Nabisco was not set up as a prearranged bidder at the time . During Nov bidweek for Dec , Nabisco asked me to release the capacity . Since the term was less than 1 year , I couldn't release the capacity non-biddable . I spoke to Jeff Huston about it early last week and he said he would get back to me . Dick suggested I tell you . TAGG - you're it , I will await your command . Mr . Scott Goodell said we could release the capacity for 1 year eff 1/1/2001 and then recall Nov and Dec .
Attached are the purchases and sales with New Power for the month of November . The invoices are on their way , I think it would be easier to sort and review the data in excel . Let me know if you have any questions .
Do we still have any activity or imbalances on the following Columbia Energy Services contracts
NEWS FLASH!!! ! The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that there cannot be a nativity scene in Washington , D.C . this Christmas . The Court ruling is not based on the seperation of Church and State Simply put , the Court felt it could not find three wise men and a virgin in the Nation's capitol . However , finding enough Asses to fill the stable would not be a problem .
I believe ENA is still agent for Columbia Energy Services and Columbia Energy Marketing on several pipelines . Rich Contos's ( the only CES person I know ) last day is this Friday . I left Rich a voicemail asking him if CES/CEM should continue to exist as a legal entity on the pipelines . As ENA , I believe I sould at least begin terminating the agency ( and liability ) relationships .
Are we still getting a demand charge bill from Equitrans for contract 270 ? I am still estimating about $5,000 per month .
I just adjusted the November Market East demand charge from $1,233,260 to $1,194,758 . This is on deal 508891 . Would you please send out an adjustment for the decrease to New Power ? Thanks My fault for not correcting it sooner .
My fault . Try it again . I just released the deal .
We can sell the tractor anytime as far as I'm concerned . We will have to pay some extra taxes but that's ok by me . The lawyer said we may have to buy a replacement if we loose the case but she doesn't think we would loose .
I just updated the volumes on deals 523444 and 523459 for the 12th . This is a bookout . The volumes on these deals should always match , if they don't then I goofed .
I added a demand charge of $1,193,725 to deal 523459 for Dec 2000 . I don't think this should show up in the current month P&L , at least not from this deal ticket . Let me know if there are any problems . This demand charge is for the Market East and for the $10,000/month scheduling fee . We are still working on the East demand charges for New Power .
Found it .
The $10,000 scheduling fee is included and this demand charge is just for the New Power Market Area . We are still working on the East demand charges , they are not correct . I will probably add the East demand charges to a CGLF sales deal .
Nothing new to report . I received an official copy of the inventory list last night . I will try to get it notorized and mailed back to the lawyer today .
Welcome Volunteers! ! Beavy , since you are going to be out , and most of our work will be done next week , I will start giving Tricia "to do's" and you can catch up later . I have a meeting at 3:00 PM today . I would like to give you both a quick 15 min preview before then if possible . Let me know . Tricia , Please run a "monthly facilitaion by location" report for "The New Power Company" for both MarketEast and East for Jan 2001 and Jan-Dec 2001 . I don't know if you can run the Jan-Dec 2001 on one report . Tricia , if we do the 15 min meeting today , I would like to have 3 copies of the Jan 2001 facilitation . I create a ton of bookout deals for New Power and I always start with the CPR report . Thanks .
For Dec , we were taking 4679 day from the Egan parking into TGT . Effective 12/16/2000 , we moved the remaining balance to Jan 2001 . I made the following adjustments to deal 473190 , took daily withdrawal volumes to 0 effective 12/16 - 12/31 extended the deal to Jan 2001 changed 1/1/2001 to 2444 This might be a little confusing because we also have withdrawals of about 1500 day in Jan . Also , Egan is showing a different balance than what I have . I show we should have a total balance of 132,247 ( 4679 x ( 31-13 ) plus 48025 )  at the end of gas day 12/13/2000 . Egan is showing a balance of 134,302 . This just means that we parked more gas than I thought or we cut back on some of our withdrawals on the 1st through the 13th . No big deal , I just want to make sure we don't leave any gas in parking .
I'm checking all my deals and found I need to add the following . Bookout deal 533305 with 533306 ( volume of 688 day for the 1st - 31st) . Bookout deal 533317 with deal 533319 ( volume of 5000 day for the 5th - 31st) . The last problem deals I see are 516286 and 521475 . This is not a bookout , One of these should be killed and I think it should be the purchase deal 516286 . We should see New Power scheduling gas out of our pool . The volume on the 5th - 31st should be about 40,257 day . Just a note , since I think the purchase deal should be killed , this would make us 520,000 shorter for the month in Sitara . I left a voicemail for Mike Garred to verify .
Take a look at my worksheet and we will go over it . It's mind boggeling .
Should we release the VNG capacity to ENA effective 1/1/2001 ? If yes , then what time frame ( one year) ?
Screen is 8.375 by 8.425 , I'm happier !
Does this work ? You don't read your emails do you?Call me before 11:20 am and I'll give you a dollar .
Attached are my calculations of the IF volumes for CGAS . I will also try to update this schedule for the AGL production area volumes . I have also included the CGAS NX1 deals . I feel good about the NX1 volumes for Jan and Feb , I not sure about the Mar forward volumes yet . I will keep working on thei sheet .
I guess you and Muffy better be snuggling to stay warm .
I updated the worksheet with a little more info and I added Trco and Tetco Marktet area information . I did this quickly so let me know if something doesn't look right . On Monday , we will show you a bid for the Tetco and Trco volumes . Also , the Tetco and Trco volumes are monthly and the CGAS volumes are daily .
I do not see a Sitara deal ticket for Tagg #NR6345.A , a Trco Z6 sell to New Power for Mar and Apr 2001 .
What are you going to Chicago for ?
Please send all VNG transport items to Vickie but cc me as well . Thanks
I created deal 536707 for this gas . This has nothing to do with the voodoo deals I do with Jeff Porter . We need to schedule this .
Take a look and let me know what you think . Also , please check the volumes . ENA's bid is in yellow .
I added a demand charge of $93,835 to the Oglethorpe ticket for December .
That's fine . I will assume New Power is physically taking the Tetco and Trco marketarea gas unless you sell it back . Jeffrey Porter@EES
Please add Tricia Spence to this email . She will be working with me on the CGAS volumes . Jeffrey Porter@EES
I would like to spend 20 min with you today . I need to update my Gas Daily buy/sells for December and I would like for you to see it . It takes me about 10 min a day to do .
2:00 pm at my desk then .
I sold 10000 day ( deal 536976 ) starting on the 20th at $9.15 to New Power . Please bookout this deal with 536977 ( purchase at FOM index pricing) .
Nope . Just bring a smile .
I have update the New Power tickets 523459 and523444 for the 13th-15 .
Does GRI go from $.0072 to $.0070 in January ? And I love that outfit you are wearing .
I will . I hope you got my Christmas list .

Kimat , this is the offset to the big gain we made on CGAS last night on that one deal . I increased our sales volume on deal . 502957 by 10,000dth/day starting on the 19th . Deal 502957 is a citygate , index based sale and we should show a big loss on it tonite .
Suzie's working on your ICTS , it ain't working so far .
Per Leah , probably won't be able to get imbalance off after Friday .
I killed deal 454471 .
If you read this before I call you then I will make brownies and bring them in .
AGA is 158 , screen dropped about $12 or so , now $9.52 by 9.58 call me about
I just sold David Scott 170 dth of TCO pool at $11.06 for the 22nd ( deal 542442) . New Power will schedule this gas out of our pool . Bottom line ,  this is Mikey gas which is different from Jeffy gas .
I don't think we are doing anything . Dick had an idea but I didn't know what he was looking at . Jeffrey Porter@EES
Cindy , take all the M2 production gas into our M2 tabs and lets go long in the pool . We will sell the gas over the holidays or next week after we see what Dominion is producing . We will not have this gas for January .
Wonderful . One more question , could you give me the meter numbers for these points ?
Sounds good to me . I bet this is next to the Warick? ? Hotel .
This is the first notice from Transco regarding imbalances . Transco has not changed their IT notices since the 6th , when they closed down St 90 .
I changed the term on this deal ticket .
We need to chat about the following VNG deals .
I changed the term on deal 510007 . Steve , this is CNG contract #100104 for 15225 dth day . The primary receipt point on this capaity is storage . Is this a Nov-Mar deal or is this capacity good all year ? Brenda , what are the rules for setting up VNG demand charges ? Also , we are releasing most ( not all ) of the VNG space to ENA effective 1/1/2001 . Should I set up ENA - Im VNG as the primary desk for demand charges ?
Guess Who?? ? Its back on my desk . How do you feel about doing a manual invoice ? That will be the only way to get it out quickly at this point .
Attached is my pricing and the capacity for December . I went thru the capacity fairly close on CGAS so this should be correct . Let me know if you have any questions . Also , for the 1st , I'm showing a FOM volume of 31,679 dth per day . This is a combination of your max FOM Exhibit 1 gas , plus the CGLF volume plus some
This is where we are today on the VNG releases to ENA . All effective dates are 1/1/2001 - 12/31/2003 unless stated differently . MDQ/MSQ ( Storage ) CNG 200088 523667 10000 FT - to be used with Cove Point . Released CGAS - we may not release any VNG CGAS capacity to ENA . According to CGAS , we may loose some of our flexibility with the contract . Scott is waiting to hear from CGAS . At this point , we will not release the capacity effective for the 1st . Tenn - I do not have the new contract numbers yet . Per Tenn - Scott will send a letter to Tenn requesting that the VNG discounts be transferred to the new ENA contracts . Trco - Trco has a capacity release "glitch" in their EBB and needs to "temporarily flip a switch" while I do the capacity releases . Since I know Trco well , I've decided to wait until after the 1st to do the releases in case their are EDI issues with the "switch flipping" . AND we would not know about any problems until the 31st . Also , VNG has 35,930 dth of telescoped Trco capacity . Williams has 15,930 dth of the VNG capacity because of the FS service . I will release 20,000 dth to ENA . This will eliminate the overlapping problems we have with Williams .
HEY! ! I'm a sweet guy , modest too . Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year ! Enron North America Corp .

Would you give me a copy of the deal ticket for deal 295058 please .
These are the Market Volumes I have in Sitara for New Power for January and the assumptions I'm making . Pipeline Volume ( daily ) Point Comment CNG 4100 South Point Scheduled by New Power CGAS 4064 Pool NX1 - will bookout and include in Citygate deal 2013 Pool NX1 - will bookout and include in Citygate deal 1301 Pool From CGLF mainline , will bookout and include in Citygate deal 24301 Citygate Exhibit 1 max volume for Jan 2001 . CGAS 30000 Pool IF + $.04 , scheduled by New Power Tetco 215 M3 Scheduled by New Power unless sold back to ENA Trco 475 Z6 Non NY Scheduled by New Power unless sold back to ENA .
Would you look at this and let me know if it looks ok . I'm going to send this to Willie after I get your approval . My economic folks just gave me the Gas Daily prices .
Since we are selling deliverd gas , the Receipt and Delivery volumes should be the same . Also , we can fix it so the imbalance is 0 on the 22nd if that would be easier . Let me know buddy .
According to my records , New Power has 140,099 dt's of CGAS capacity . On the 22nd , we scheduled 143,400 dt's on deal 502957 . Please verify that New Power took 143,400 dt's on the 22nd , its ok , I just need to do a price adjustment . Thanks
What was the volume of Jeffy gas going to Mikey ? And what day did that start ?
That makes sense . So you really are not using any ENA space but then I need to check the overrun charges on the invoice . If its ok with you , I think I'll just wait to review the invoice before I do anything with that . Jeffrey Porter@EES
I will need to see the CGAS invoices for Dec when we get them . According to New Power , we should have overrun charges .
I created deal 546310 for pool sales to New Power . I currently have a daily volume fo 4250 on this deal . We should be able to move the volumes back and forth between this deal and the big citygate deal . Jeff , I will look at the volumes on our big citygate deal ticket and this one pool deal to calculate the Gas Daily pricing . Jeffrey Porter@EES
I don't see the facility numbers in Sitara . However , I do use meter numbers and the NFUL meter number for the interconnect with TCPL is 010902 . Deal 241639 is ( term purchase from AEC ) is at this meter . And deal 511043 ( ENA-Im Market East sale to ENA-Im Ontario ) is also at this meter for December . It doesn't matter to me which facility we use provided NFUL meter 010902 is set up in Sitara . Richard , issues to consider before Faye makes any changes , * NFUL is an EDI pipeline , how will the changes impact Angie's EDI file ? * Will we need to rebook our term purchase - ( this should be fairly simple) ? * Will Unify need to be repathed since the beginning of time ? * Can this change take effect 1/1/2001 ? * If Martin reads this without Darren tipping him off before 1:00 PM today , I'll buy him a "pop" .
For January , I moved 2 deals from Trco Non NY to CGAS/WGL meter 78-30 . Both deals are sales to New Power . Deal Volume Kimat , you need to do some of that voodoo economic stuff because this deal has hedges . Joann & Alvin , this will not be part of the Citygate deal for Choice , this is a citygate sale to New Power at WGL . Dave , where are my New Power golf shirts , one for me , one for my sidekick Scott .
Mr . Scott found and one of my errors . Deal 377264 is for only 470dt's per day .
I created deal 547910 , with a price of IF + . 0125 .
Any news ?
I changed the effective date of deal 547638 from Jan-2000 to Jan-2001 .
Jim had a death in the family and is gone . I didn't change any of the info at the top but the invoice number should be 18719SA I think .
I created a buy/sell with Hopewell that we are going to kill after the month is over . Deals 549136 and 549152 will be killed next week . These tickets are just estimating the loss on oil replacement .
I am showing a balance of 80,265 in the Egan park deal as of Jan 1 , 2001 . Egan is showing a balance of 84,944 . I am using our balance for now . I'm taking 2592 dt's in to Texas Gas for the 1st and 2nd , and 2599 dt's per day for the balance of the month . I tried to update all the deal tickets but I won't know if it worked until after our systems work .
I tried to fax all 4 deal sheets at once - and the pages stuck together . So I faxed each page seperately . Nice outfit . Judy says "Hey" .
This is all I've seen for the 1st .
This deal needs to be moved to ENA - Im Marketeast .
Cancelled my trip , I'm here all day , too great a chance for NY to get a blizzard .

I believe I entered all the purchases New Power made for January 2001 . Deal Volume Comment 551056 4000 Purch from EOG at Broad Run 551058 3674 Purch from EES at Delmont , the deal ticket is at the wrong meter number . I sent a request for a new meter to Global facilities . Whew , I think thats it . Deal 551058 will need to fixed next week . I'll do if I remember .
We have some volume discrepancies starting on the 23rd . The 3rd column from the right is my calculation of the Overtakes . The second column from the right is your cal of over's and under's . Our storage numbers are close enough for me .

Dick bought gas from Tim Ray , does this impact our stuff ? Dick bought 15000 day at 9.21 from the 4th-31st .
Are you and Muffy snuggleing ? I was in East Texas over the New Year's and I saw snow - just enough to make the ground white with a little grass sticking up thru the snow .
I have not updated the last 4 days of the month yet .
We made 1 big change that will impact tonights P&L . We chanbed the volume on deal 549411 from 72,000 per day to 106,000 per day . This is and CGAS index sale .
I also increase the price from $10.53 to $10.8003 , that should have a bit of an impact .
I changed the demand charge from $.155 to $.20 in Sitara. ,
I need 2 x-large shirts for Oglethorpe Power please . I am going to give them to Mr . Homco to pass on to Oglethorpe .
Please send me the Oglethorpe activity in excel for Dec 2000 . thanks
I added meter DOMSP to deal 549660 , please adjust the hedge . thanks
You guys may see an opportunity for this gas sometime . I have gas on National Fuel that I could deliver into CGAS at Ellwood City on a secondary basis . Ellwood in Op 8 , Market area 35 , I think . This trades around a CNG North plus . Let me know one way or another , I'm just eager to learn .
Opps . I took it home to read and I think I used it to start a fire and reduce my energy cost . Would you please fax it to me at 713-646-8453 ? You are so wonderfull .
I have 9000 day . Ellwood will be a secondary delivery point on my contract so any deal would be best efforts . I have a call in to National Fuel to find out how they do their constraints . Jeffrey Porter@EES
I sold gas to New Power for today and tomorrow , deal 557800 . New Power will take this gas into their pool . Date Volume Price
Revised the volume to 571 on the 4th and 615 on the 5th .
Dear Team , I updated the bookout deals 523459 and 523444 for the following dates , 20th , 21st , 23rd , 29th , 30th , and 31st . Please path this in Unify and let me know when its done . Thanks .
Attached are my demand charges and CGAS activity for December . Jeff , I have all the prices in my worksheet . It would be easy to calculate one citygate price to put on our big citygate deal ticket . And we are still out of balance starting on the 22nd .
Would you please be so kind and take a peek at this .
Thanks for the Oglethorpe . I just sent my info to Mr . Homco for review . Would you please send me the December purchases and sales for New Power ? thanks
This is ready to go . I highlighted areas that you need to fill in . Thanks .
I have a tax bill to Columbia Energy Services in the amount of $5,606.78 for gas stored at the Bear Creek Storage facility . The amount is $5,606.78 and it is for the the 2000 tax year . I was notified about this yesterday and I think it was due on 12/31/2000 . How do you want to handle this ? I was going to pay it and bill New Power for the whole amount . I will also have our tax department fax a copy to Jeff . Robert , please fax a copy of the letter from Jimmie Smith and the CES tax bill to Jeff Porter at 713-646-3499 . Thanks
Question: We received a tax bill from the Bienville Parish for gas in Koch storage for the 2000 tax year . I found out yesterday that ENA handles no-notice storage for NOPSI and it might be related to that . Do you know what Koch storage contracts we had for the 2000 tax year ? We also received a bill for Sonat Bear Creek storage . I assume this would all be for CES/New Power . If you know of any other Sonat storages we had for the 2000 tax year , please let me know . Brenda will fax the Koch storage tax bill to you . Thanks Chris .
Good point . Is that also Bear Creek storage ? The tax bill specifically states Sonat Bear Creek storage . I also left a voicemail for our tax guy . There is no support for the tax bill so I don't know how the taxing authority comes up with their number . I would like to see it but I bet it takes a while to get the support . I also have a tax bill for Koch Bistenau storage . We have some type of deal with NOPSI . Any other ideas on that ?
We have a FTGSS contract with a MDQ of 40,148 dts . The primary receipt point on this contract is storage . BUT , we can flow some of this gas from secondary points like Oakford or the Pools . How much gas can be sourced from Secondary receipt points ?
Hey gang . Attached is the maualy invoice for Oglethorpe . I have fixed the pricing and the volumes on the top part of deal 516907 to match the maual invoice . Can we adjust the expected volumes in Sitara to match the manual invoice ? If yes , how do you balance Unify since these are deal volumes and not actual flow volumes . AND Sherri , how this be entered from the accounting side in Unify , since scheduling vs actual flow vs billing are all different ?
Raquel , Robert Tilotta has the original tax bill and he is in your office . His number is 713-853-7995 . Please call him at your convience . Robert , can the tax agency provide us with support ( contract numbers , inventory balances...) ? Thanks
In the old days , you could only flow 7/12 of the MDQ from secondary points . That was when these contracts were good for the whole year . So you are telling me the "rules have changed" ? I can now flow 100% from secondary points ?
See below to see what "The Man" has to say .
For Tues through the end of the month , please show Tenn Z5 and Z6 flat , and have the Wright gas into Canajoharie . Tenn , I will be looking at what we have available on the Net 284 contract on your sheet to determine our flexibility .
Anyone here today? ? Deliverd prices are about $12.75 right now , using Non NY pricing .
My buddy is looking at lots on Seargent Beach . Drive from your place to Seargent , go over the intercoastal , and take a left . He said lots in there go for about $17,000.00 . He wants to buy one canal lot and one or two beach lots . Comments ?
The 2 Transco delivery points for the CP&L RFP ( #6608 and #6562 ) are upstream of the Zone 5 pool . So we should be able to segment the longhaul VNG space . Meter Mainline Mile Marker / Lateral Mile Marker
I extended deal 559947 ( Pool sale ) thru the 31st , a volume of 27935 per day . I changed storage deal 456379 from 196985 to 46985 on the 31st ONLY! ! Joann , for Jan , we are selling New Power 31,679 out of the pool and 25893 from other sources ( AO6 , Broad Run , Delmont , and Monclova - this includes the AO6 they are buying from us) . Which means we should only have 3844 out of the pool . Actually the citygate and storage should be as follows Vol Comment 3844 Out of the pool 25893 Other receipt supply xxxx Storage - and this should match whats on the storage ticket .
These are the meter numbers I changed on deal 549411 effective 1/8/2001 . The total changed on the deal was a decrease of 31205 .
Do you know the details of the Dynegy contract ?
Darla , this invoice is incorrect . Please send out the manual invoice I sent you .
Buddy , we need to chat .
Please let me know what ENA is taking from New Power's pool and what New Power is taking from ENA's pool for the following dates Date Jan 1 Jan 2 Jan 3 Thanks .
Please bookout deal 563831 with deal 563837 .
You are so wonderful . I am truly privlidged to work with you . OK . I would like for you to send Mr . Porter the remaining storage balance every other day and copy me - something like this . Date 1/7/2001 Balance 3,495,871 And I would do it on a 2 day lag like this , today is the 9th , give him the balance for the 7th . Or maybe you are doing this already ?
I've made some changes to the sales . Would you please send me another excel worksheet for December ? thanks
Would you guys see what is flowing current day at these points please ?
I don't know if this was ever resolved but Susan Pereira's name is on the deal ticket .
Where is my new Oglethorpe sheet ?
Exactly what an old married guy would think too !
I changed all the volumes to 0 on this deal now that I have a good picture of what took place . Please make sure you have 0 pathed on these deals for the 1st through the 4th . thanks
In the fridge next to the mustard . Jeff , don't forget that Mike is taking 27835 of the FOM gas into his pool everyday . With the Maumee cuts , I am showing that you are buying gas daily from ENA everyday . Column T under the CGAS tab shows what Gas Daily volumes you are taking from me . Column V shows the Gas Daily sells you are making to me . Column F is the citygate storage number that should match cell Q41 on your COH sheet . We have one big discrepancy on the 8th . Call me if you have questions . Joann , on the 8th , Jeff is showing a withdrawal of 57431(citygate number ) we are showing a volume of 49560 ( 48478 at the citygate) . Would you check that please .
Could you send me the excel worksheet so I won't have to recreate it ? Man you are a true Buddy! !
Please take the volumes to 0 for these 2 Hopewell deals on Dec 31 . Deal Robin , I took the price to 0 on both of these deals .
Tim Ray is "The Man" at New Power to talk to about the any asset management deals . I would love to be involved . Mr . David Scott can get you Tim's number .
I'll call you this afternoon after Joann and I talk about the storage volumes for Dec . Jeffrey Porter@EES
Could we meet to go over this ? AND are there any other folks we should invite ?
Thursday PM would be ok . Would you set it up please ?
contract T016937 . Our new MDQ is 14,225 for Jan .
Anyone there ? I sold 2500 at $6.94
Dick is changing his sell to NP price to $7.22
Should we just take the capaity for Feb and March or do you want to release the whole term then recall it later ?
These rates are correct and I'm assuming you want wellhead to the pool ( no surcharges) . Zone 4 to 4 is the most expensive zone on the pipe , Zone 5 runs a close second . Are you sure you want 4 instead of 4a ( mobile bay) ?
I sure wish you would send me the excel worksheet for this . I'm such a lazy butt .
Just looking high level , I see 3 days where storage is off by more than 1,000 dt's that I will check into . Date Sitara Jeff's I don't understand your storage number on the 16th . Does that mean you banked gas that day ? Also , I setup a column for Navigator numbers and it looks like we took out I need to reconcile storage back to Nov so I can track what we took out vs . what we pay New Power for .
I just checked the 24th , the actual number per navigator ( actuals delivered to New Power from Stow ) is 54246 . I'll check the others on Monday now that I know how to do it .
It's Leah Moss at the pipeline . It's Judy Townsend here . Leah's number is
Its ok to do the netout . The volumes on deals 502957 and 456379 need to be changed but I think that will be handled by Volume Management after they enter the pipeline statements in Unify .
Let me know if you have questions . I think we need to add Nov 2000 . AND , according to Navigator , the balance in storage on 1/20/2001 is 2,973,373 . Assuming ENA is owes you 40,000 , the balance is 3,013,373 which is about 49% of the total storage balance . Is this a comfortable number or Joann , are there any special storage rules for Feb and March ? Are we required to have at least 40% in storage on 1/31/2001 ?
Is this what you are looking for ?
I'm here for you . Just remember me favorably when you become my boss someday . I fetch coffe and pop , I always keep a stash of crackers,.. . the list goes on .
Please educate me - what are the current cashout rules ?
Thanks . You are wonderfulllll !
Yo ! Give Aaron his gift !
How does the VNG GSS work ? AND , Jerry and Barbara are coming to Houston tonight . They want to go to P F Changs . Jerry said they would leave around 6:00 Pm putting them here around 6:45 to 7:00PM . Of course you are invited and I told him I would let him know where to meet us when they hit the road . Questions ?
I'm emailing all of you because I never know how the deals will show up in Sitara . This is how Leidy looks for Feb Buy/Sale Counterparty Volume Comment Buy Poco 15,380 NFUL into Trco at Leidy Buy Bay State 5000 CNG into Trco/Tetco at Leidy OR CNG SP from the storage meter Sell N Jersey 2491 Any pipeline into Trco at Leidy , we usually match with Poco Sell Southern 5000 Any pipeline into Trco at Leidy , Brad just sold this gas today . we should match with Poco . Buy ENA Transport 9005 We have transport on NFUL , we sold 9189 to Canada desk for Feb , We will idle our transport . Let me know if you have any questions .
I will send these as I find them . This is the detail I sent to Jeff for the April 2000 manual invoice . It looks like the only deals that should have been suspended are the citygate CGAS sales . Line 7 under the "Manual Invoice" tab applies to deal 268094 , volume of 615600 at $3.1279 , sale to CES for Proxy storage injections . Line 6 applies to deals 227081 and 227113 , sales to CES at the citygate . Line 8 shows the incremental transport expense ENA incurred to allow CES to swing . Today I would take this expense and add it to the sales price on deals 227081 and 227113 . Line 9??? ? I still can't figure out what I did here . I think everything else is sorta clear .
Lines 6 , 7 , & 8 are sales to CES at the citygate , deals 250126 and 250131 . The schedulers wanted 2 deal tickets for tracking purposes . The pricing should be the same . I did make a teeny little error , line 7 should be prices at $3.4228 and line 8 should be priced at $3.4428 .
I'm sorry . I'm still looking for it but I think I deleted all the photo's . I'm checking my CD's . Just pretend you are getting a big hug from me and that I'm taking you to your favorite resteraunt - Chic Fil A .
According to my numbers , I show we have taken 67,560 out of storage through today . And we are taking out 12,995 ( 2599 x 5 days ) from the 27th - 31st . Could you double check my numbers please ? Thanks
How do you make those ham and tortillia thingys ? I want to make some for the super bowl party this Sunday .
Please change deal 583629 ( sale to Mirant on NFUL ) to Market East . It won't let me change it . Thanks
Just spoke with Jerry . Jerry , Barbara , the bird and the squirrel are on their way to East Texas .
Scott Goodell is the expert on this pipeline and I just can't say enough good things about him .
I changed the Egan volumes for the 30th and 31st from 2599 to 4793 on the 30th and 4794 on the 31st . This empties out our storage .
Hey Matt . Sorry about not getting back to you sooner . I probably won't move for another 9 months . I have some legal issues I'm heavily involved in that will be taking up a lot of my time . Thanks .
You are welcome and have a nice day !
Hey Woman ! This is the email I sent to my folks last week regarding Egan .
More Judy contracts for Feb Contract Volume Comment And Judith bought 1 dt of Stx Exit/ Wla Entry . I won't be informing you of this cotract number .

I just moved the following 2 sales to New Power from Trco Non NY to CGAS - WGL , deals 377264 ( volume = 515 day ) and deal 377268 ( volume = 5 day) . Joann , New Power will probably take some of this gas to BG&E .
Since we are suppose to be using IT , I would say Doyle's cashout should be $7.611 , the IT buy in zone 6 . You sure are a buddy , why don't you send me an updated doyle sheet ? Media Inquiries: Chris Stockton Other Inquiries: Rates Department 1-800-248-0404 Option #7
I'm way to tired to go drinking tonite .
Subject: Cute story Anyone who's been single and over the age of 18 can relate to this . When I was younger I hated going to weddings . ..it seemed that all of my aunts and the grandmotherly types used to come up to me , poking me in the ribs and cackling , telling me , 'You're next.' ?  They stopped that crap after I started doing the same thing to them at funerals .
Where ? Just curious .
yeah , I'm really busy . I gotta wash my hair . Where you guys going just in case I someone ask me ?
She doesn't know that I exist , now that I'm single again and all . I should be able to lose 30 or 40 pounds by then .
The gloves are off and the courtship begins - what's your work address ? Valentine goodies are on the way . I'm officially in love.. . with you !
I set up the following deals in Sitara Deal # Buy/Sale Counterparty Volume Price Comment 597316 Buy New Power 6160 FOM Monclova - schedule using New Power transport . This deal will also show up under the 3rd party deals on my February worksheet . New Power can change the volumes on this deal daily .
Bookout purchase deal 551027 with sales deals 380492 , 376880 , and 551007 . I created a sale to New Power ( deal 597332 ) for gas they take out of our pool into their pool . I created the following purchases from New Power Deal Volume Comment 597290 4100 EOG supply at Broad Run We should be hooking all these deals up to our transport . Let me know if you have question .
I was going to Mexico with the dough but decided against it . We received $11,240.63 from medical reimbursements and $5.00 from the Electric Company . I just transferred $3,749.00 to to your checking accounts .
You get our undying love and gratification ! I'll buy the next time we go to Chic Fil A !
I have problems sending things to you and Mike .
I left a message for the manager of Transco's Rates Department to call me . If I'm reading this correctly , the forwardhaul and the backhaul commodities are the same now . In Jan , the "true backhaul" rate from Zone 6 to Zone 4 was $.0448 plus surcharges , today its $.3037 plus surcharges . We actually did some deals based on the backhaul rate of $.0448 for the summer . I suppose its too late , is there anyway this could be postponed until October , after the summer period ?

Hey - I just started taking a Spanish class last week . My class name is Miguel and I'm a cocinero !
Nope . How's that for an anwser . Noone responded and I would be more than happy to have a big ol meeting on it too .
Scott Goodell said the Sonat items look correct . The other items are for the Central Desk and I don't know who looks at it . It's probably ok since the Central Desk items are more straight forward .
Transco confirmed that effective 2/1/2001 , the forward haul and back haul commodity rates will be the same on both IT and FT .
Could you give me the January 2001 Gas Daily's for the following points Texas Eastern Transco Zone 1 , Zone 2 , and Zone 3 Thanks
Beverly , what do you think ?
I'g going to have Judy work Tansco over for a backhaul discount for the summer .
We've never done this , I'm just thinking they may work with us on it since no one knew the rates were going to be effective 2/1/2001 .
Still hurts but just when I move it . Woke up at 4:15 am this morning . Worked out . Now I'm really sleepy . Got a dr appointment this afternoon .

Would you send me a copy of the new desk mapping please ? thanks cg

Thanks for the info , I see a couple of changes I need to make . We may send this out a couple of days late .
I don't see a year to date p&l for Judy . My worksheet shows NYMX position to be flat and her yeart to date P&L is about ( $146,000.00) . Would you just verify that for me please . Thanks
I changed the end date to 12/31/2000 on Trco k#2.2390 , deals 77157 and 320086 . I had it set up as evergreen .
Same thing for Trco k#.7537 , deals 232576 and 271489

Take a look at the daily volumes when you get a chance . I show you taking an extra 500 dts or so everyday .
We are off by about 1,000 dts . I show you taking an extra 500 dts per day and you show selling me back about 500 dts everyday .
From the Birmingham Sunday Mercury ( 7th Jan 2001 ) Worker dead at desk for 5 days Bosses of a publishing firm are trying to work out why no one noticed that one of their employees had been sitting dead at his desk for FIVE DAYS before anyone asked if he was feeling okay . George Turklebaum , 51 , who had been employed as a proof-reader at a New York firm for 30 years , had a heart attack in the open-plan office he shared with 23 other workers . He quietly passed away on Monday , but nobody noticed until Saturday morning when an office cleaner asked why he was still working during the weekend . His boss Elliot Wachiaski said "George was always the first guy in each morning and the last to leave at night , so no one found it unusual that he was in the same position all that time and didn't say anything . He was always absorbed in his work and kept much to himself . "A post mortem examination revealed that he had been dead for five days after suffering a coronary . Ironically , George was proofreading manuscripts of medical textbooks when he died . You may want to give your co-workers a nudge or kick occasionally .
Can you verify what New Power is getting at A06 please ?
Doesn't look too good right now . I forgot about the HPL people . I think we already have too many people and management may be waiting to see how many HPL people are staying with Enron on the trading side . I'll keep you posted . If you are bud's with Scott Hendrickson , he would be a good one to talk to . I don't want to mention your name unless I hear of something .
Sounds good .
Please send me a download of the Oglethorpe info for January . We might be able to do the billing from Unify this month . If not , I should be able to make the dollars match . thanks
I'm looking for the following demand charges Do you see those anywhere ? They are on deal 554846 .
This is what's in Unify . The only odd item is how I entered the cashout , as a negative demand charge . I used 1618 dts x $7.611 ( It buy in Zone 6) . Let me know what you think . Maybe we should add the IT transport to the cashout from Z6 to Z4 . I would certainly want to do that if they were short .
I made some changes to New Power . Would you please send me a new purchase and sales worksheet for Jan ? thanks
Mr . Homco gave this his stamp of approval . It's ready to go . thanks
Would you send me the Gas Daily's for Henry Hub , Transco St 65 , Transco St Thanks
This is everything scheduled on CGAS except the pool for the 1st . I'm working on that now .
Per navigator , this is the only New Power pool activity for the 1st .

I wuzn't invited to the wedding . AND when you sit down and think about the hedges and transport stuff , you will be surprised at how much stuff you remember . The quickest way to learn transport?? ? Get copies of the invoices . And guess what , I got another compliment on my sweat pants on Saturday!! !
I would like to see the Gas Daily's for the following , no rush . Transco Z6 NY Transco Z6 Non NY Transco St 65 Henry Hub Tetco M3
We should have included the ACA , GRI , and Great Plains in our sales price to Midcoast . You should still use the $.0792 in your calculation . Just a note , we could have shipped this gas to a zone 4 market , resulting in a much higher transport cost , OR we could have sold the gas at the wellhead , giving us a $0 transport cost . Most of the time you will use the IT feeder cost ( $.0792 in this case ) regardless of what we do with the gas . By the way , Transco's rates changed just a bit effective 2/1/2001 . The IT feeder for Zone 3 goes from $.0792 to $.0769 effective 2/1/2001 , fuel remains unchanged at . 45% .
I ended deal 340210 effective 2/28/01 and created deal 630810 effective 3/1/2001 . But , I see both deals active un Unify on contract 2891 on 3/1/2001 . I don't know what impact this will have , if any .
Please recall the following contracts effective 2/24/2001 I think this is all .
Can you get the deal ticket for me on this deal please ?
I just checked and I don't have any daily information . I know they sent it to me , I must have tossed it by mistake .

I changed the pipeline and the meter on deal 628466 from NFUL #7126 to TRCO
My Canadian folks gave me the wrong number for March . The correct number is . 62 instead of . 50 . Which makes the spread
FYI
Transco Z6 cashout buy is 5.5393 , and I think it traded around $5.52 . We will use the $5.5393 and I'll send you and email .
Could I get a copy of Trco cashout and the detail for Jan please . Judy and I are going to use it to decide what to do tomorrow .

Effective March 1st , I moved the volumes on deal 377268 ( Non NY sale to New Power ) to deal 643754 ( sale to New Power at WGL on CGAS) . Please correct the hedge information . I also created deal 643761 ( sale to New Power at WGL on CGAS) . I believe this deal is in the index book but does not show up in Sitara . I believe it was originally a Z6 Non Ny sale to New Power also . Let me know if you have any questions . thanks
Take a look at deal 168996 . I took the expected volumes to 0 . This goes with deal 643761 .
I moved deal 601925 ( sale to South Jersey at Broad Run ) from CGAS to Tenn .
I just fixed contract B00693026471 again . This contract ended 10/31/2000 .

For the year My NYMX book is a positive $138410.00 with the trade I did today . This morining it should have been $123035.00 . I still have only 3 physical deals ( all desk to desk ) in my book , all valued at CNG IF flat . I still don't see how I can have negative P&L of $128,818 .
I think you have my NYMX value in backwards .
What do you think ?
What mid price does this deal come to TP2 at ? Deal 655067
I changed the price on deal 636796 back to TRCO Z6 Non Ny .
Good to hear from you . Man I guess I'm just falling apart , physically and mentally . Can't invest worth a crap either . I'm going to start burying my money in a tin can somewhere . I also keep thinking about buying a place and/or a new car . But then I look at my $20.00 utility bill - thats a hard thing to ingnore . Someones waiting for me here . Chat with you later .
This is good to go . How about a new New Power download - I've been tweaking here and there .
Numbers still look good after inputting the 27th and the 28th .
How am I suppossed to determine a good back doctor from a bad back doctor? ?
I'm thinking about a Nissan Pathfinder . Then I think about just keeping my money and driving what I have .
Thats it for now . Thanks . I will probably have questions next week .
Good to go . thanks ONly one more month to go .
I think both of you should go .
Thanks buddy . Enron North America Corp .

I would like to RSVP for the Houston Energy Expo Customer Celebration in The Crystal Ballroom in the Rice Hotel on Wed , March 21 , 2001 . Please call me at 713-853-4743 if you have any questions . thanks
TP2 is buying Spinnaker gas ( deal 632998 ) from Gulf 1 at Zone 2 IF ( deal 657407) . TP2 is selling the gas back to Gulf1 at IF plus variable cost ( deal 657409 ) at St 45 . It is my understanding that the transport commodity rate for gas from this well is $.02 plus fuel . SO , I just changed the price on deal 657409 from Z2 IF + . 09 to Z2 IF + . 045 . We should see about $68,000.00 move from TP2 to Gulf 1 .
On the 8th , we went short on TP2 at St 65 . I created deal 665147 as a TP2 buy from Gulf 1 at St 65 . I entered the price as Z3 GD . Please let me know if you want to adjust it . thanks
I created deal 665150 , TP2 buy from Gulf 1 at St 30 priced at GD . We did this on the 7th because we didn't sell the St 30 .
I forgot to tell you - I tried to call you from my cellular when I was coming back from Jerry's yesterday . I kept getting a message like "We're sorry , this number does not accept calls from unidentified numbers" or something like that . I had that same problem with Mr . Homco's home phone number a couple of weeks ago .
Transco party on the 21st . I'm going , how about you ?
Beverly just announced her resignation too .
I'll give you an inviye to our party . I don't know when or where or if I'm gonna go but I'll give you an invite anyway .
Kim , I would like to invite Joni to our Gas Fair party . Please send her the info via email ? Thanks
Maybe you should just send an email request and see what you get for the Transco party .
My appointment is next Monday at 2:00Pm
Judy also bought 10,000 dt of long haul from you . Whats the term and the demand on that ? thanks
I updated the transport demand charges on Tetco and Trco for March . Please get those in the P&L sometime this week . Also note: I think I had Trco at TP1 instead of TP2 . thanks
NOOOO ! Tell me it isn't so!! !
You are welcome . I'm glad you enjoyed them .
Why are you going to Florida ?
Hey , I'm getting a mental image here (  of you pawing the ground that is)! ! Backs doing ok right now . I'm getting a second opinion next Monday . If the second opinion comes in with the same verdict , then I will probably have the surgery in April or May . Jerry said a friend of his told him it took a whole month to recover . I'm thinking a week max then I can go back to work , we shall see . I can't make money if I'm not at work , and my p&l is a big part of my evaluation next year . AND I'm afraid to buy a new truck with the stock market situation . Who knows - I may be out of work sometime soon .
Thanks for the invite . I won't be able to golf for awhile .
I'm very tired . WHAT A GAME! !
You are going to hate me . I lost all my little notes on the 40,000 backhaul and the 40,000 backhaul IT contract . Would you email that to me please ?
We have 9189/day of supply at Niagara on NFUL and transport through Oct 2001 . For April 2001 , we sold the Niagara Supply to the Firm Ontario book at Kimat , I told them to use IM ME CNG as the desk selling the gas .

This is what I have .

Thanks . He's one of the few people i do remember . I always like him and man could he weld .

My last electric bill was $22.00 - that's hard to beat . I'm so pooooooor now . Let's see 1700 options witht the stock dropping $20 per share means no big down payment on a house .
What curves are assigned to the following Transco meters Thanks
Would you check on the status of meter request 02325 and let me know where it stands ? We need to deliver gas to this point .

This is copied out of Transco's system and its allll i got .
YES I DID !

Kimat , I added TRCO meter 4091 to deal 30512 . Please do whatever crazy things you Economics people do . All you other folks , we will be delivering a total of 3503 for the month of March to this meter . We don't even need to chat with NYPA about this either .

Robin Barbe did a long term sale to EES . The volume is 1200 dt/day . EES has the option of taking delivery at Tenn Zone 5 , meter #20816 or on CNG ( Dominion) , meter DOMSP . The contract price to EES is the same at both locations . Deal 624140 is the sale on Tenn . EES requested the volumes on CNG effective 3/23/2001 . I created deal 686905 for the sale on EES . Kimat , I assume the CNG will need to hedged .
Phil , please call Jim Homco to discuss Oglethorpes needs . His extension is
Lunch was terrible today . I don't know who it was though .
He didn't invite me . He don't know what's good for him does he ? AND he lives in a bad neighborhood .
I should be getting my uzzi out of the shop on Friday too !
My contacts at The New Power company said you should call this number
According to Nelson this deal should be on GULF3 , not GULF1 . Woul you pleachange it ? Thanks
I just sent in a request for a new CGAS/NFUL interconnect - request #2410 . I entered meter number 6000065 for NFUL , it should be 600065 .
My numbers match . You de MAN
If you nom from Onshore straigt to Leach , you pay Comm ( meaning without ACA or GRI ) and ACA , the ship Leach to TCO Citygate and pay Comm + ACA + GRI . If you go from Leach to your TCO pool , you pay the same CGLF stuff and no charge on TCO at all . Next question , you have SST and you go from the pool to STOI , you pay the SST Comm + ACA + GRI into storage . When you use SST to go from STOW to the Citygate , you only pay Comm , no ACA or GRI ( i think) . Backs doing ok . Going on vacation on the 9th and I can't wait . And yes it has been a stressfull bid week . But you r probably making tons of dough .
Can you tell me if we have anything scheduled on this deal number for this contract please ?
I see you ran the March demand charges through TP2 over the weekend . What about April or are you waiting for us to clean it up ?
No back surgery yet . Second opinion Dr . said "let's just wait for 3 months and see what happens . We can always do the surgery." I liked that idea . Give Mom and Dad a big hug for me .
Hey Buddy ! Small note - on row 45 you show fuel of 19% instead of 1.90%

Hey Buddy!!! ! Wrong worksheet .
I just left Cingy a message - I said that I'm not aware of any imbalance trades that we intiated . However , it could have been done by CES or EES . I asked her to call me back .
I wanted to send you this email before I deleted it . Everything may have been taken care of already .
Would you see how much vacation I have taken for the year please . I took my floating holiday and 1/2 day of vaca on my last time sheet .
For tomorrow , I believe I'll work out tomorrow after work and I should still be back at my desk by 6:30 pm . Just in case , my pager number is 877-498-5497 . BUDDY!@!! !
I may have to get with you in the morining on this .
I think you should attempt to call me . You may be detained at some point . If I don't hear from you by 7:40 PM then I go home . If I don't hear from you by 8:15 PM then me go to bed ( and not with you) .
R U still in the office????? ? Call me! !
I just noticed , do you want my Bid or my OFFER ?
Hey buddy , how about the CGAS Gas Daily's for March 2001 ?
The password is 2001tran04
Please send me the Ogy invoice for March . I did such a good job of doing my job that I think everything in the system is ok . By the way - I'm on vacation for a week or so startig Friday . I should have New Power updated by tomorrow .
Russ , could you kill this deal please ? I keep getting a weird message when I try to kill it .
It's missing the demand charge . I'll get you to rerun it for me in the morning and see if the demand charge shows up .
You De Man!!! !
Cool! ! I'll start cleaning my apartment . Heck , I may even vacum! !
I'm going to see Mickey Mouse in Florida next week . My brother is taking me since I have failed at obtaining a wife and kid(s) .
Could you please re-send the Ogy invoice for March ?
Spoke to Jay . He's going to lunch with us .
This is the invoice download for March . Looks good to me . What do you think ? NO NO NO , about the invoice !
Good to go . Thanks
Spoke to the tax lady today . She mailed an extension for mine and my fathers taxes . I just know you guys care . I mailed all of Dad's tax stuff to her Sunday and she received it yesterday .
I don't have good numbers for the 30 or 31st yet but you I think everythink else is good .
You are a good gradson . I got a quilt out of Dad's closet and took to Ma Monday night . I was only there for 15 min and I bet she asked me 5 times if I had a girlfriend . By the 5th time I think I was telling her I was married with 6 kids . She only metioned you taking her for a ride 20 times . I seemed to have gotten in on the wrong side of NYMX today . I got short around a $5.24 and the offer is now $5.395 . Let's see - I've only lost $185,000.00 today . Oh well , its just money I guess . Its funny how unhappy that makes me . I'm gonna go pout now . Later
Getting short means I'm selling now - expecting the price to go down - and then buying . Getting long means buying now - expecting the price to go up - and then selling . I think you should be doing this with cattle futures . Right now I down $290,000.00 for the day .
Please bookout the following deals that I entered for 3/31/2001 . Match purchase deal 718081 with sales deal 718078 . I think this is my last New Power deal forever .
Thanks for the card . It was very nice .
I'm done with March . Take a look and let me know what you think .
I added a couple of deals that will not show up until the morning . If you could rerun this first thing tomorrow I would appreciate it . Thanks
Uhhh - NO . I did clean the bathroom last nite . I do that once every couple of months whether it needs it or not .
We should probably look at this sounds like a Hattiesburgh type deal to me . Gas Storage Facility to Be Sold Immediately A natural gas storage facility in Monroe County , Mississippi which is ready to be built out is being offered to be sold immediately . It will be connected to Tennessee Gas Pipeline and Texas Eastern and others . It has 12 BCF of total storage capacity and 8 BCF of working gas storage , with HIGH deliverability . This project is worth considerably more than the $4.2 million asked by the owners , who need to sell it quickly . The deadline for offers or serious interest is April 13 , 2001 . For more information on this gas storage facility please call ( 985 ) 893-9225 . EFS Energy or write: storage@enerfax.com
I'm out next week . Chat with Mr . Goodell if this comes up again .
This is how I priced the deal Sandra's May-Oct physical Ela Basis offer was about ( $.0725 ) The screen was aroung $5.30 Variable . 4500 Price to Customer . 48 We would do this to the extent Judy could get the capacity .
Well I guess you know by now that Jerry and I survived Florida . I had fun at Disney . The airshow was a bit of a let down though . AND NO , I didn't buy an airplane . Now I'm thinking . . . boat.. . yeah that sounds real good . See what you can find me . I'm tired of my Ford Explorer . However , I checked new car prices on the internet and I think I'll keep my Explorer for a little while longer . New cars are so expensive . So just go find me a boat and I'll be happy . Just came in to work for a few min . Later .
You really don't care about my back do you???? ? Its doing ok . Went to Florida with my brother last week . Spent 2 days at the airshow and 2 days at Disney . Enjoyed both very much . That was my first Disney trip and it was pretty cool . Need to go with a Chic next time though . Mr . Hodge is trading CGAS and his number is 713-853-7276 . And YOU ARE CORRECT AGAIN - he's the old CES dude . Behave yourself girl .
Very funny !
Very funny !
Hey there . I was on vacation on the 9th . I guess its ok to send out the invoice now .
Then try AEP in Columbus . They have a big shop and you should know some of the people there .
According to Kimat , TP2 gets the NYPA sale at Mamou at the prices show below . We have 3 options on serving this deal: 1 ) buy Texas Gas capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from the Zone SL Pool 2 ) use Transco Zone 3 wellhead 3 ) buy Trco capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from St 65 Most of the time we use option #1 . Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after paying the transport cost . However , this deal comes to the TP2 book at the prices listed below . For April , TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zone SL IF + $.005 and shipped it to Mamou . The total transport cost is $.02 ( including demand - this changes each month) . We don't arb the supply with Trco and Texas Gas because NYPA is extremely difficult to work with and this is a term firm sale to NYPA . Should we change the mid price for the NYPA to include both the Zone SL mid price and the transport expense ?
Please give Judy Townsend , Scott Goodell , and myself the ability to trade the physical Canadian products . We need to be able to see them on EOL . Thanks
Congratulations on the good news . Sorry to hear about the bad news . There seem to be lots of scheduling jobs around here but I don't know if you want to do that . Bob Superty is the best person to chat with their . Also , you might chat with AEP . They just bought some Houston assets and they might be keeping those assets in Houston .
This isn't the right guy but he can get you to someone - Mike Garred x35488 .
YES I AM . What are the dates ? And I love your outfit today .
Did she show you her tatoo ? I need to be back in Houston by 2:00 PM . I'm thinking about driving myself . Your the boss , what do you think ?
This is what I want , at 17 to 18 footer with a 70-100 HP motor . I prefer a shallow draft center console for bay or bayou fishing . Make it happen buddy - and remember , I'm not made of money .
YES I AM . What are the dates ? And I love your outfit today .

Why don't you get a hamster or something like that . You know my woman has a cat - he likes sleeping on my firm , rockhard stomach when I watch TV .
Ernie's on the team now .
I'll ask my woman her opinion about my rock hard stomach . I'm sure she will agree after I tell her what to see . I guess women can be sensitive . Ingrid's fine - and you ? How's your man ?
U forgot to copy you brother . I don't think he did it . I think it just kicked in somehow .
Should we start terminating CES as a shipper on the interstate pipelines ?
How sweet . Its doing ok . A better question is "how's the lovelife?" . That's doing ok too - although I wish I could find the perfect woman . Mine is wanting to take some trips - Maine , New York , EUROPE!!!! ! What's up with you girl ?
You like ( cat ) attitude don't you ? And what makes you think my stomach is cushy????? ?
Ernie's on the team now .
I include Darla on anything dealing with New Power or CES . Maybe CES should just be you? ? AND Wade can tell me what producer activity is going on or if he is aware of any items not in Sitara . But Ernie should have the whole CES picture nailed down . I'm thinking this Statoil should just go to Ernie and we not be involved . I spoke to him on the phone before I sent the email .
She has a mostly white one - at least those are the color of the kitty hairs on my clothes . She left his front claws in because she said it was mean to take them out . Of course she gets a little angry when he sharpens his claws on the couch . I figure he will get run over by a car someday and she will be said - I will be sensitive and caring and then she'll get another one . I guess I don't have to tell you that those long distance relationships are kinda tough . Good luck .
Ernie , this is what I think . ENA sold CES gas delivered to the NIMO citygate . I don't think we ever had supply behind the citygate like we did with Peoples and East Ohio . Heidi probably did the imbalance trades because it was after the gas flow day and we were unable to do anything about it . Comments , questions ?

The truth is out there ! Subject: FW: A Little Humor to Start Your Day Computer Gender An English teacher was explaining to the students the concept of gender association in the English language; noting how hurricanes at one time were given only female names , and how ships and planes were usually referred to as "she." One of the students raised her hand and asked , "What gender is a computer?" The teacher wasn't certain and divided the class into two groups: males in one , females in the other , and asked them to decide if a computer should be masculine or feminine . Both groups were asked to give four reasons for their recommendations . The group of women concluded that computers should be referred to as masculine because: 1 . In order to get their attention , you have to turn them on . 2 . They have a lot of data but are still clueless . 3 . They are supposed to help you solve your problems , but half the time , they ARE the problem . 4 . As soon as you commit to one , you realize that , if you had waited a little longer , you could have had a better model . The men , on the other hand , decided that computers should definitely be referred to as feminine because: 1 . No one but their creator understands their internal logic . 2 . The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else . 3 . Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval . 4 . As soon as you make a commitment to one , you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for it .
I figure buying stuff for me and making myself happy is just like making you happy : )

Use the following formulas to determine the price to Ogy The higher of St 65 Offer plus $.35 TCO Offer plus $.14 Good Luck
Little correction going forward The higher of St 65 Offer plus $.27 TCO Offer plus $.19
We would have been around $.39 to $.42 .
Are you looking at the imbalance trade behind NIMO with Amerada Hess for April 2000 ?
We would have been around $.39 to $.42 .
Hey . I went on a company outing to Aransas Pass last week . Left Wed afternoon and got back Friday afternoon . One of the pipelines I deal with has a hunting and fishing lodge down there . It was nice . I caught 2 redfish - both keepers too ! The guide would bait my hook and throw it in the water . All I had to do was sit there and look pretty till the fish started biting . I could really get used to that sort of thing . The fishing guide said I should expect to pay about $1,000/ft for my fishing boat . I guess my boat will only be about 4 ft long . Keep looking for my BOAT . Let's see - the ex wife came in from Denver for a wedding Friday night . She stayed with me all weekend . I took her to the airport this morining . Things went pretty well - no romance , just good friends . I introduced her to my girlfriend - we all had lunch together . That was a little odd . Nothing else going on . I'll try to have an update on the legal stuff by Wed . Later Gator .
Victor , doesn't matter to me . You pick - Mr . Goodell or someone else .
We'll chat later . I'm trying to get an invite to Florida for a CNG thingy next week . Leave Wed come back Friday . May not happen .

I added the demand charges but I still need one of my Transco schedulers to remove the volumes "actualized" on the 9th .
I entered ( $4.9951 ) x 12dt which should give them a credit on the invoice . I also entered a demand of $93835.00 . These items should show up seperate on the invoice .

Demand charges are showing up now . We still have a problem with the 9th ( 4500 @ $5.445) , this should not be on the invoice . My Transco scheduler has informed me that they have taken the volume to 0 in Unify and that this item will need to be "actualized" 0 by volume management . I don't know how that part works . Dara , are you volume manangement? ?
Mr . Homco will have to answer that one .
I just added the PSE&G demand charges on Transco to our capacity worksheet . The net impact is $0 because I'm also showing this as a reimbursement . How should we put this in Sitara . I'm showing a transport demand charge on the capacity deal ticket . How do we get the money back from PSE&G ?
Spoke to Carrie at the lawyer's office today . Everything has been signed by Mary and Carrie will mail me the originals to sign . I asked about a termination ont he $1500.00 , Joal told Carrie that since we couldn't include it in this agreement since we didn't agree to it in the meeting with Mary . IF Mary agrees , they will prepare and addendum to the original agreement . I've learned a lot and the sooner we are through with this lawyer the happier I will be . BE NICE NOW .
Mr . Homco will have to answer that one .

Hey buddy , this is out of a Duke Energy newsletter . I'll just give you the highlights . Duke Energy acquired Market Hub Partners Storage ( MHP ) from subsidiaries of NiSource , INC . MHP currently operates 2 facilities . The Moss Bluff facility in Liberty County , Texas , and the Egan facility in Acadia Parish , La . I have never used Moss Bluff , I know it interconnects with Tetco in Stx . I like Egan - it hooks up with ANR , Tex Gas , Tenn , CGLF , and Trunkline .
It is over with . The addendum may or may not be signed and its a seperate document and I will personally pay for all legal cost incurred regarding the addendum . But the other documents are in route to me , i get it , i sign it , you and donny sign it , i send it back , waaaala! ! The lawyer told that once the documents are filed with the courthouse then everything becomes ours ( I don't call the lawyer anymore because her time is "billable" ) I don't think its that simple though . What do you think ? So what are you doing this weekend ?
We may be dining with my brother and Sister in law tomorrow around 6:30 PM . Comments ? ?? ? Questions???? ?

Looks like we are getting another $5,000.00 from the asbestos settlement . Maybe I should just keep this to myself . I'm so poor and I need so much . Don , why don't I mail this other ag exemption to you and you can fill it out just like the first one you sent in ? What mailing address should I use ? I'm going to the doctor this afternoon for my allergies . I hate getting old .

A man was stopped by a game-warden in Northern Michigan recently with two buckets of fish leaving a lake well known for its fishing . The game warden asked the man , "Do you have a license to catch those fish?" The man replied to the game warden , "No , sir . These are my pet fish." "Pet fish?!" the warden asked . "Yes , sir . Every night I take these here fish down to the lake and let them swim around for a while . I whistle and they jump back into their buckets , and I take em home." "That's a bunch of hooey ! Fish can't do that!" The man looked at the game warden for a moment , and then said , "Here , I'll show you . It really works." "O.K . I've GOT to see this!." The game warden was curious , now . The man poured the fish in to the lake and stood and waited . After several minutes , the game warden turned to the man and said , "Well?" "Well , What?" the man responded . "When are you going to call them back?" The game warden prompted . "Call who back?" The man asked . "The fish." replied the warden . "What fish?" The man asked .
How many deals have you done??? ?

Maybe we should have the transport books roll up into the ENA Upstream book - then us little transport folks could work with the wellhead desk instead of against you . That way we could get credit for our knowledge even though it doesn't show up on the bottom line of our P&L .
Scott Profitt was looking for your phone number . I gave it too him . I think he misses you .
Please change the counterparty on deal 806589 from TP2 to TP3 ( sorry about that) .

And what exactly will you be doing while I'm bumping up that magic number? ?
Shooting for triple digits ?
Actually I don't need any more as long as my prospective mate has 1 or 2 less than me :o )
Hey , it works for me .
I want PHOTOs!!! !
It's not her fault . First , everything she does or knows is officially my business . Second , I tortured her to get information . Third , she's a great ol' big heifer ( <==female cow often used to produce many offspring ) and she really needs to go .

Yes I have and I still don't like it !
Take a look . Let me know what you think .
I called to hassle you and you were not there . The lady from Mike's party called me today . She wants to show me a couple of houses . What do you think ? I told her tomorrow would be4 fine .
I have to keep working until you get here!!!!! !
Suzanne is here . She said you and her are doing some Manual work this weekend . You and I are breaking up for the weekend but I need to get my car back first . Maybe after we go to the movie . PS Scott said the resteraunt to go to in Round Top is "Royers" . He said you go shop for antique crap and then go eat at this place .
I would leave early if I were you .
I finished all but one . Guess what time I finished??? ? Oh , and we have until the end of today to finish them .
Did mine . Need to do one for this person in risk management . I finished at 12:15
I'll call later with a whole bunch of tedious contract changes .
We have some Trco long haul capacity for 1 year starting 5/1/2001 , contract 3.8924 . This is a mini asset deal with PSE&G . Transco has agreed to bill PSE&G for the demand charge . I took the demand charge off the sheet and zeroed out sitara effective 5/1/2001 .
Jeanne , effective 6/1/2001 , we are going to move the TGT transport from TP1 to TP3 .
I dialed Suzie's number and Liz anwsered . Then I asked to speak with the other ____zzy and she transferred me to Lauri . I was expecting her to transfer me to you! !
Please set up and annuity for June where the TP3 book pays the New England book a total of $57,266 This will show up as a loss in TP3 . Let me know if you have any questions .
Kim , according to Dalton ( the IT guy) , I need 3 sets of monitor arms and Judy needs 2 sets . Did you order my other monitor ?
I changed the meter numbers on the following deals . Please check the hedges . Deals 816519 and 816524
I did take a look at the $139,000 home . This house has been on the market for awhile . The backyard sits next to some big building - that's a bad thing . I have not had a chance to look at the other house - the sq footage seems really small though . Based on what I've seen over the last 8 months , it would take something around $190's - $205's to make me happy and I'm not willing to spend that much right now . Another thing that bothers me is the economy . All I hear about are layoffs . The only industry still booming is the energy industry and we keep streamlining . That's what keeps me from spending the big bucks on a house . Thanks for the info though .
there is a lot of good stuff on this web site . Click on "HARDWARE REVIEWS" then select "DIGITAL CAMERAS" . Lots of good stuff .
Please give me view only access for the Power Products on EOL . My EOL ID is ADM81300 . Thanks .

Guess what ? The house is unsured through July 21st or 24th or something like that . I went digging through the papers last night and found it . Guess who the Goober was that paid it last year??? ? me . What I don't have are papers on the Silver Leaf resort thingy . I mean I don't have a stitch . That's ok - I mailed them a letter yesterday . I'm going to try to get a gazillion bucks for it and leave you guys high and dry ! Whoooo hooo - Brazil ( because of the ladies ) here I come!!!!!!!!! ! Movies I want to see - Swordfish ( John Travolta) , The Mummy II , and a new Jet Li ( kung fu dude ) movie . I'm still looking for a bay boat fella's - about 17-19 ft long with a 70-115hp motor . I'm willing to spend up to $6,000.00 .

Per VNG's request , ENA released 700 dt of CGAS capacity to Nabisco effective 1/1/2001 - 12/31/2001 . Yesterday , CGAS informed me that Nabisco has not paid any of their bills . CGAS was under the impression that ENA should be paying Nabisco's bill . I told CGAS to find chat with the company doing the nominations for Nabisco and to keep me informed .

I sold 4,035 dt to the Ontario Desk on NFUL for Sep at +.12 ( deal 1016673) .

Nicole , I have the Boston Gas confirmation letter . Thanks . Kimat , are you familiar with the Boston Gas worksheet Dick Jenkins would update to calculate the Tenn Z6 city gate price ? It wasn't very big , and Dick would have me verify the Iroquois and Tenn transport variable cost .
The Boston Differential for August 2001 is ( $.1166) . I want to understand the contract better before I give you the Sep price . Ruth , you and I are chatting about this today I hope . Kam , I'm guessing this becomes an O&A issue each month . I don't know if you need to be involved or not .
We have an discount on Tenn , for the 25th only . k#2891 , MDQ = 5000 , rate = $.30 , Receipt point = Z0 , delivery point = Tewksbury in Tenn Z6 .
I moved the sale to NYPA at Mamou from TP3 to TP1 effective 10/1/2001 . The old deal number is 815952 . The new deal number is 1063956 . Kimat , I just took the volumes to 0 effective 10/1/2001 on deal 815952 . Should we just delete the lines on the deal ticket for dates after 10/1/2001 ? Effective 10/1/2001 , the primary desk for transport on TGT will be TP1 .
FYI
When I look at my position manager for TP3 on 1st-4th , its short by 9189 . TCO is long by 9189 for the same time frame . Part of the problem is deal 1016655 . I can see that the volumes on the deal for the 1st thru the 4th , but they don't show up in Unify . These volumes also do not show up on my P&L . My unaccounted volume on TP3 for September is ( 36,846 roughly 9189 x 4 days) . TRCO Team , would you changed the pathed volume in Unify on this deal for the 1st thru the 4th by 1dt please ? I would like to see if that has an impact .
Thanks .
TP1 sold 323 day at CGLF IF + . 0175 for Oct , deal 1064505 , to EES .

Would you change the desk on deal 1064348 from Gulf2 to East TP1 please ?
I did a buy/sale with EES where EES will give me TCO pool gas and I will give EES TCO pool or CGLF Leach gas . The volume is 14,288 per day . The purchase deal is 1068442 , at CGAS IF . This deal will not change . The sale deal is #1068455 , at CGAS IF - . 05 . I have 2 meters on this deal , Kimat , let me know if that will be a problem booking the deal in tagg . Robert , please chat with Rhonda on which contract to use . We need to use the same Gulf contract all month long . It would probably be easier for Rhonda if we use the same contract we used this month .
? ?? ? At Leach or the Pool .
I'll be at the Texas Gas shin dig .
Got my ID and password fixed . Thanks . Has Corey said anything to you about my park and loan contract ? I just tried to call him but there was no anwser .
When I look up this contract in Passkey , I show an MDQ of 16,373 . We think it should be 4723 with the following primary receipt points . Leg MDQ I might be looking in the wrong screen . I am going under contracts/contract maintenance/review
Robert , Rhonda may be adjusting the Leach volume ( 14,288 ) up or down a few dth's to balance every day . That's ok . Somebody tell Barker what a nice guy I am .
The End Date on the following Park & Loan contracts has been extended from 9/30/01 to 10/31/01 . Contract Deal I had to create new sitara numbers because the old deal numbers were "Baseload" instead of "Term" .
Did you get your info ?
Let me or Gerald know if you have any questions .
Looks like I have the wrong contract . thanks
We have a discount on Tenn k#2891 , Z0 and 500L to Carnes for Oct 1-31st , up to 20,000 per day .

done
Got it .
I'm starting to think you don't care about me anymore . What are you doing ?
Frank , I was out last week and I'm just now getting to you email . As a Marketer , I agree with Dynegy's slide #20 , "the risk of not being able to find replacement capacity ( OR CITY GATE GAS SUPPLY ) within two hours or less may be too great" .  The only time capacity would be recalled is on peak days . Also , according to my Transco schedulers , PSE&G does not accept contract number changes after 12:30 PM the day before gas flows . If we were using released capacity to serve a market at PSE&G and the capacity was recalled intra-day , we would not be able to schedule the gas because of PSE&G's nomination and scheduling procedures . This is an interesting point because the only term capacity release deal we have on the East Desk is with PSE&G . However , we do support intra-day capacity release .
This is the guy in charge of all the transport for Cinergy . I have not been able to speak to him because he is out of the office so much . And I don't know if I'm still in his good graces either .
In September , ENA agreed to purchase capacity from New Power on Transco . The total demand charge should have been $9,000.00 on contract 4.0159 . New Power released the capacity volumetrically and I didn't catch it . The actual demand charge billed was $270,000.00 . New Power agreed to reimburse ENA for the difference of $261,000.00 . ENA will pay the pipeline the billed demand charge of $270,000.00 and bill New Power $261,000.00 on deal 1110019 .
My girlfriend is pregnant and we are getting married around January . But not too many people know about that . If anyone says anything to me I'm gonna deny it . Don't want no kitties . I'm going home now because I've lost so much money today . BYE
I thought you mite do that :o )
We have a discounted IT rate of $.25 for Oct . Receipt Points are 500L & 800L , Delivery points are Tenn Z6 .
Contract 888850 CDS Demand Charges effective 7/1/99 Rate Vol Factor Amount Contract Adjustment -$5,804.59 Days 31 Unit Rate 0.5532
Would you see if we have a discount for gas flowing from 500L to Carnes on Sep 14th ? We had discounts before and after so it seems like we would have a discount for that day as well . I can't find anything in my notes . Thanks
FYI - just sent this note to Tenn .
I believe I did because 1 ) I used the . 12 rate in pricing the deals in my system and the deals are at a fixed price which means I had to calculate it AND 2 ) I had the discounts on gas flow before the 14th and gas flow on days after the 14th AND 3 ) the 14th is a Friday which makes me think we would not have forgotten to call as oppossed to an intraday on Sat or Sun . Its only a diff of $80 or so . So if its difficult or "improper" don't worry about it . Thanks
Forget it . I don't need your lecture .
I get real tired of this guy . For whatever reason he and I just don't seem to comunicate real well .
You should call me so I can harass you .
I'm still passing out your name and number to people that are looking . I only give it to people that I think would fit in a capacity role . Are you OK with that or should I stop ?

You would have a hot ( oatmeal ) meal waiting for you when you get home . The dog would love you , the cat would love you , I would love you...... . What do you think ?
Robert , when you get a chance , please give me all the service deal numbers for CGLF k#37393 . Marlene , the new termination date for this contract is 5/31/2002 . If I have time , I am going to send CGLF a termination notice for this contract effective 5/31/2002 . Is that something you could do for me ? Let me know .
I believe its Janice Felton but I will make sure . Thanks
Hey there . Got your message . I'll get you the numbers by tomorrow afternoon , maybe today . Thanks
Who is my contract for capacity release questions ?
I know you told me that this capacity could be released . Can it be released in 4 seperate peices ? Plus I may be doing permanent releases too . Any problem with that ? Does this contract have an evergreen clause ?
I'm looking for the following capacity , let me know if you have it to sell . Z0 or Zl to Broad Run , 10,000 day for Nov-mar . I think Corey showed a demand $.22 before which is above TCO pool by about $.17 . Let me know . Thanks

Fuels from production area to M3
Hey team . I think I have everyone but feel free to forward this message on to others that may need it . Brenda Fletcher was asking me Enron has the following deals with AEC at Niagara and Leidy . Deal # Vol Buy/Sale Location End Term Book 592845 9189 Buy Tenn Niagara 10/31/2008 New England 223854 9189 Sale Tenn Niagara 10/31/2008 New England When this deal was done 2 years ago , AEC agreed to give Enron the NFUL transport ( I don't know who at Enron agreed to this) . Enron pays NFUL max demand for the space . I believe the contract price on deal 415547 is a NFUL Leidy price , and part of it should be adjusted for demand , commodity , and fuel . Also the net delivered volume at Leidy is 9005 dth (  = 9189 at Niagara) . Kam , I'm not sure which firm book this is in . Over the last few months , I would calculate the transfer price from the firm book to TP1 ( or TP3) . As TP1 , I take any NFUL length at a CNG equivalent price . I also created deal 1147662 at 0 price to balance out Niagara . Also , I believe we need to bill AEC for the demand charges for the last 2 years of this deal . That's around $1,340,000 . I'm sure AEC is not expecting that . Does anyone here talk to AEC ?

I chat with him via aol instant messenger . His id there is djunek13 . He's not in the office today . your msn doesn't work .
Thanks . I appreciate that . It is a bit gloomy and MOODY over here . I don't think too many people are excited about Dynegy but its better than bankruptcy . And I do appreciate the job offer , its just hard to do with a family . But I will chat with my significant other and see what she says . I've asked her about moving before and I thought she was going to hit me .
Does this email still work or is Enron trying to control all info in and out of the building ?
I'm cool . How are the kitties ? Ingrid is starting to expand , of course she's not as big as me yet .
The TCO book is buying 1,000 dth per day from Power Gas Marketing at Trco-Young Women's Creek . Effective 11/9/01 , CNG began restricting receipts from Trco-Leidy . We are taking 543 dth into CNG , VNG has 543 dth of primary receipts at Leidy on CNG . STEVIE , till further notice , the VNG book needs to sell the New York Book 453 dth of Trco Non NY , use deal 1165693 . The transport usage ticket is 1165849 , and the buy from TCO is deal 1165737 . GOOD LUCK !
Sure . I'll be there Monday morning . Ingrid woudl probably like it too . What would you have me do ? Mark Gazelli at Cook Inlet told me he had a job for me in LA . Talk about a change in location . I thought that was nice of him to offer though . So what do you think ? Wait and see if there is any severance , maybe a job , or activly look for a new job ?
Steve , I forgot to mention that we are using the Utos to Leidy contract #.6507 to flow the 6-6 volumes .
I sold my CGLF to Susan today so you dont need to worry about it on Monday . I'm flat CGLF .
And you thought I didn't have anything ready . I sent this to Paul yesterday , he said "I'll keep it and see were to fit you in , you should have come when I asked you to" I guess he's unhappy with me .
We had a meeting this morning at 7:00 am but we didn't find out anything new . Right now it sounds like its business as usuall for the next 5-7 months . I had a jury duty summons this morning . I didn't get picked and we got out at 1:00 PM . Sell my truck yet ?
here kitty , kitty ,  kitty , . .. . Oh this is funny .
Hey , I was waiting for you at the shark club and you never showed up . I think you stood me up!!!?!?!?!?!?! ? What's the deal ? Is that how you treat a buddy ? I may not show up the next time .
Can you tell what Sales deal this is going to ?
How would you like it if someone pulled out your claws???? ?
come on now . YOU NEED THAT COMMISSION!!!!!!!!!! !
Are they billing us for 530 dth of transport ? If yes , then its the VNG desk .
I gave it back to my assistant and asked her to cancel it . I have a company cell phone and I don't need a calling card . thanks
Robin Barbe just gave me a couple of day care's to sign up for . One of them is St . Luke's at Edloe and Westheimer . The other one is Becker's at Sunset and Rice . AND Robin just told me that St Luke's is Methodist , they have an 8:30 , 9:45 , and later service .
Hey , how does this get me a new job ? Should I study these and know them by heart ?
We have a discounted rate of $.1028 on IROQ for the 17-19th , flowing gas from Wadd to Wright .
Our contact for this is Janice Felton . Her number is 713-267-4210 . Please call her on Monday and let her know that ENA wishes to terminate contract 37393 effective 5/31/2002 . Ask her what she needs in writing from us then draft it and send it to her attentions . Thanks
You guys need to come see my new building before I quit , get fired or whatever . We moved into the new building over the weekend .
And , because I waited so long , it should be done in a great big hurry !
I'm wonderful thank you very much . Where have you been ? How are you doing ?
According to my calculations , TP1 demand charges should be $1,115,826 for Nov . Would you change that for me ? Thanks
You lucky girl . Let tell me all the interesting stuff that's going on!!!!!! !
I don't know how this asset management deal works on demand charges . Could you give me a demand charge report out of Unify please ?
I WANT TO GO . Do you want to come by Wednesday evening . I'm almost positive we are going to leave early ( around 2:00 or so probably) . You won't even get a chance to see my messy apartment because I am going to sleep over at Indrid's and kill ( bond ) with her cat .
The deal didn't go thru . sorry about that .
Is there a way I can see the amount of gas on my storage contract on the EBB ? I looked yesterday and I even tried the "help button" but I couldn't find anything . The contract number is 15692 .
Early this afternoon would be fine , say around 1:30 PM . My new location is 06456 . Thanks
Would you check on this when you get a chance . Let me know if I need to yell at someone . Thanks .
Please grant Robin the following origination from TP1
hey buddy , would it be better to sell this on sonat or tenn ? The storage balance is 500,195 dth or about 16,135 dth per day .
On Nov 13th , I sold 2700 dth to Black Hills in Tenn Z6 for the 13th . I bought the gas from Hodge on CNG . I need to know where the gas is if it didn't get delivered to Tenn . The deal ticket shows that I changed added the deal at 8:50 am . The volumes must have been in Sitara because Sitara shows Joann changing the volume from 14085 to 11348 on the 14th ? Then it shows me changing the volume back on the 14th . Lia , would you see if we even nominated the intraday on the 13th to Black Hills ? thanks
We have the following Tenn disounts for the 22-26th even though we may not use them . Z0 to Carthage meter #010031 on k#2891 $.1022 plus fuel . Any Z1 or Z0 point to Z6-Tewksbury on k#2891 $.3522 plus fuel .
Joann , is the Canajoharie volume for the Nov 13th still 23953 ?
Gerald , it looks like the gas I sold you on the Nov 13 did not get scheduled . The volume was 2700 dth . Still checking on the 9th .
Please order me a fan because I'm burning up over here .
We negotiated the following discounts on Tenn and TGT Tenn - all discounts are for the 27th only . Texas Gas - discounts apply from 26th-30th .
Maybe , but I know you will check my work because you are a caring individual - I don't care what everyone else says about you .
Ok , I would like to go over a couple of things this afternoon if possible . I'll try to come down for 30 min or so .
Hey thanks . You are sweet . Looks like that 5.25 was a great sale too .
Heads up . Andy should be putting in a request to increase my volume on k#37877 to 38,500
This is what I have for the East Desk . Let me know if you have questions .
I forgot to send this to you on Friday Jerry Buterakos This is the turbine job we were talking about last week . Also , Dynegy has Scott Prophit's job poested on their EBB today . Its got your name all over it . I'm going to apply for it too though . Click on the link above , then select Positions by date . It's a "Trader" job posted on the 17th . Thanks for the chat , it helped .
I changed your col gas password from ou1rules to clg12dec .
We currently have 2 park & loan deals with Colubia Gas . Deal 1 ) we have 310,000 that was scheduled to come out in December , contract #67401 , we are currently paying $8370.00 per month on this deal . Deal 2 ) we have 310,000 scheduled to come out in January 2002 , contract #70457 , we are currently paying $16,740.00 per month . I have not spoken to the pipeline but I believe we would have to prepay all of our transport demand charge expenses before CGAS will let us schedule any of this gas . Our monthly demand charge expense is $290,000.00 . I would also assume that we would have to prepay the EES demand charges as well .
I really need to chat with the pipeline on this one but this is my best guess right now . This gas was parked at Bear Creek on a Tenn park and loan contract . It is scheduled to come out on Sonat . To my knowledge , we don't have any Sonat demand charges . But our monthly demand charge expense on Tenn is at least $376,000.00 , mainly due to the Boston Gas netback deal . I think Tenn would make us prepay the Tenn demand charges to get this gas out of the park & loan on Sonat . We have 500,000 that was scheduled to come out in December on Sonat . I have no idea how Tenn/Sonat will bill us for this contract going forward .
This is what I have so far for Wholesale East TPort . I need to research the rest .
Why don't you guys plan an evening in Houston and I'll show you the trade floor . I really prefer to do it after 5:30 these days . It doesn't have to be this week , I was just thinking about it . Maybe I'll get a free meal off of both of ya!!!!!!!!! ! NO - we are not going anywhere afterwards to look at HALF NAKED BRAZILIAN WOMEN WOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOO ! You are both a bad influence on me already .
Steve Bennet
Thanks .
Sign us up . BUT , I may be WHO KNOWS WHERE sowing all my wild oats with half naked Brazilian women . I don't have that many oats left anyway , it could just be an oat . By the way , Suzanne made a Second Baptist comment to me yesterday when I was talking to Robert . I can't remember exactly what she said but I sure do wish you wouldn't tell her anymore STUFF about us . I finally figured out that her and Jim are very similar . Information is power that they can share with others , even useless trivia information about friends . I don't think either one of them mean any harm , they just can't keep their big mouths shut . I'm off to another wild day of tariff review . Call me when you can , it brightens my day and wakes me up!!!!!!!!!!!! ! Later Gator Boo BOOO
Fantastic . You behave yourself and try to get us jobs TOO!!!!!!!!! !
I didn't make tooo many changes . Take a look at Florida and Koch .

It was suppossed to come out on Sonat this month but we never scheduled it . Yesterday , Clarissa Garcia tried to schedule some of this gas for today's gas day .

We have not scheduled any of the CGAS park & loan deals .
I have 2 email addresses . chris_germany61@hotmail.com <==primary email address . I know , where did I come up with a name like trogg522 ? My apartment is only 522 sq ft and it makes me feel like a caveman ( TROGG) .
HEY!! ! Not too much time to talk . I'm wrapping a few things up before I take the longest vacation of my life . I may not come in tomorrow . We will be there Saturday with bells on . My little woman will probably need to take a nap in the back bedroom if that's ok . Send me an email at home AND here and let me know what time to show up . Also , she wants to know if we need to bring any snack stuff .
Hey , I just saw your email . I'm still here . I'm moving my stuff from 6 to 5 today and then I'm going to take the longest vacation of my life . I may or may not come in tomorrow but I will be out until Jan 2nd . I'm probably leaving early today too . I may actually take the first week of Jan off too . How are you ? I just called your nubmer and got your voicemail . I'm glad you have something . Don't be upset if I don't return your email for awhile . I'll be on vacation . Later Gator
I don't see you on MSN?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?! ?
Terry Kain with Keyspan Energy Services is looking for a copy of their contract with ENA . I didn't ask him any questions . I just told him that someone would contact him . His number is 516-256-2611 .
So it was 10:00 AM and I'm about to leave , RIGHT ? My new boss says go sell that storage gas . hmmm . WHAT IF THE g.D . PIPELINE WON'T LET ME SHEDULE IT ? SHOULD I TRY TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE ON A FRIDAY , THE FRIDAY BEFORE OUR CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY ? HOW ABOUT ALL THEM g.D . DAYS I WAS ASKING TO CALL THE PIPELINE TO SEE WHAT THEY WOULD AND WOULD NOT LET US DO ? I now have work to do . I'm not going shopping until this evening . Have a nice day .
I'm leaving for the day . All of my notes are on the word document . I just spoke with my contact at Columbia Gas and she suggested that we call Columbia Gas's in-house counsel to discuss the issue . I just update my word document with that information . Steve , you may receive this email before I get to your office . I will hand deliver the following items; 1 . The word document attached to this email 2 . Copy of the Columbia Gas PAL and FTS rate shedule from their tariff 3 . Copies of the 2 PAL's contracts that ENA is trying to utilize 4 . A copy of 1 of our FTS contracts 5 . Select sheets from Columbia Gas's tariff that apply to Creditworthiness . Ed , I will be in on Wednesday to resolve this issue . Then I will be taking ALL OF MY 2000 vacation until it runs out , which will be sometime during the second week of Jan .
ditto : ) See that means I'm like Patrick Swazzie in the movie Ghost . He was way toooo macho to use the love word so he came up with an acceptable alternative . But if I die and I come back to haunt you , I won't be using the word ditto . I'll probably make reference to a Shetlon Pony . That way you will know its me .
2 weeks ago , I received a page and the message box on my pager said "voicemail" . Would you see if I have voicemail and if I do , how do I access it . Thanks My pager number is 877-498-5497
Jared is here . I'll tell him to call you .
works for me . thanks
I don't see you in MSN Messenger either .
Hey , what about my pager ?
As of 2:00 P.M. , Steve has not heard from Col Gas . I will be taking my vacation through Monday , Jan 14th . I have a sneaky feeling that I may be let go before then anyway . I will be checking my voicemail everyday and my emails every other day . Also , I don't plan on being out of town for more than a day over the next 2 weeks . I may leave town a few days during the week of Jan 7th .
Thanks for writing buddy . Things are going very well on the home front . Things began to improve after you and I had our little chat before Christmas and they have been improving ever since . I really do appreciate it . How's work at Enron ? Good question . I started taking my vacation on the 27th . I'm scheduled to be out until the 14th to use up all of my 2001 vacation . I honestly believe some of us will be let go this week or next week . But then its anybodys guess these days too . I do check my emails from home and thats when I got your message . There isn't anything to do at work right now . I guess we should hear something this week . How are things going with you ?
Where the heck is Somerset ? And who cares anyway ? I hope you had a happy New Year buddy . Indrid and I went to Lulling City Market over the weekend . That is without a doubt the best BBQ I have ever had . YOU DE MAN!!!!!!! !
I was not in the office today . I just check my emails from home . I'm taking Matt Fleming to YOUR BBQ place next week . He hasn't found a job yet . I told him that it felt like a bunch of us estaters would be let go soon , don't know why , just a feeling .
Hey woman . Have I told you what a good person you are ? You're sweet . I have plans on Friday but be sure to give Dan a great big hug from ME!!!!! ! And thanks for thinking of me when you sent out this email . Later Gator
I received another voicemail notice on my pager yesterday afternoon . Have you had any luck with this ? How about this ? Do you know how long I'm going to be employed for ? Any news at all ?
Does that fried guinea pig taste like CHICKEN?? ?
I'm at work today and I assume we are going to the boat show tonight . You just let me know. ,
[Germany , Chris] Hey , I went drinking last night and you weren't there . So I just talked bad about you .
Just got back from and executive lunch .
I need access to the following common directory . o:\Gas Structuring\
I can't get whatever it was you sent me . It must be illegal or naughty .
The attached worksheet has the Boston Gas contracts on Iroq and Tenn and the AEC contract on National Fuel along with all the other contracts we have on Iroq , Nat Fuel , ant Tenn . The contract number is in column P and the three contracts are highlighted in a light blue .
Hey there . I'm working on your request .
Ed , ENA - Canada is requesting some pricing information from me on the Boston Gas Tenn Z6 deal . I would like to talk to you before I provide this information . Thanks
I forget and you are so wonderful . Who do I talk to about capacity release ?
Steve Menke said you would know the answer . I purchased capacity from Steve last October . The terms were as follows; Release Date 11/1/2001 through 3/31/2002 Contract T0181230000 Offer #200110000095 Steve said he thought they recalled this capacity . Would you see if it was recalled and if it was , what was the effective date of the recall . Thanks
This one is easy , Texas Gas k#T018123 was recalled effective 12/14/01 .
Hey woman ! What are you doing talking to my pregnant chic ? I going to tell her that anything bad you said about me is a lie . AND YES , all I do is goof off . What else is there to do ? How's your boy doing ? How are the cats ? How's the job ? How old are you ?
Well , I told Ingird that I was madly in love with you but that you constantly rejected my advances . AND I DO provide her with love and support . I'm all over this marriage thing and I told her "no more lovin until she makes and honest married man outta me" . We get our new apartment on Feb 22 and she be living together by Mar 1st . Don't know if I'll be a married man by then or not . We are going to look for a cute little chapel type thing this weekend . I'm still trying to make her cat disappear . I'm telling her if that cat leaves one mark on my little Christopher or Audrey , out the cat goes .
Yep . We went for and ultra sound last Thursday and the doc asked "do you want to know what the sex is?" I said YES and she said NO and the doc said ok we won't look .
I just received a call from Carol Taylor at National Fuel . She told me that contract B00693-038181 was recalled effective 1/1/2002 . This was capacity we received from AEC - one of those producer netback deals .
What the heck are you doing ? I know you miss me asking you dumb questions every once in a while . I'm still here , at Enron that is . Maybe I'll call you up and hassle you later .
Ain't that the truth . Wait just a minute , I took Monday off and I think I'm taking Friday of next week off . Never mind .
Now I remember!! ! Do you just need IT contracts on pipes with firm transport or it on all pipelines ? Who is Rita ?
Have we flowed any IT transport on the East Desk pipelines for the month of January ? I think the answer is no but I wanted to double check ? If we did , then I need to know the pipeline , contract number and probably the volume . Thanks .
Hey there , I need the IT contract numbers please . Thanks
I have one more person that I'm waiting on and Kathy is going to work on it after lunch .
Boo
Last Boo from me .
Thanks buddies and buddettes . I may bring yall some scheduler treats if I make it in on Monday . Then again I may just forget but remember I love you all .
Just so you don't forget me . I know its early but I'm interested in coming back . I'm sure you don't know what you will need until after we find out what happened today . Tom Martin was asking me if I would be interested in going to the Texas Desk to take Daren Farmer's place , Daren is going to AEP . I told him I would like to talk to you about the East Desk first . Tom would like an answer by Monday . Let me know . Thanks
HEY GIRL . It's so good to hear from you . Let's see , I'm still here . I work on the estate team which means I work on the old stuff until they tell us to leave . My buddy Goodell is will be working for NewCo ( The New Company - is this original or what) . They should find out something in the next couple of days I think . Other than that its just hand around and see what happens . So did you make good grades ? What's that report card looking like . How's the hubby ? You still in love or what ?
I think this is funny . I believe Enron laid off some incredibly talented people . Gloria might like this .
I've been waiting for an opportunity to speak with you but it appears that you have been very involved . Daren Farmer works for Tom Martin on the Texas Desk upstairs . Daren just accepted a position with AEP and Tom asked me if I would be interested in Daren's position . I told him I would and I asked him to touch base with you .
HEY WOMAN!!! ! What the heck are you doing ? I did make it back . I actually came in most of last week . I just get way to bored at home in my tiny little apartment . I have this strong urge to go out and spend money and that's just the wrong thing to do right now . We don't really know much about the New Company right now . I'm actually on the estate team anyway . I sit on 5 with Ruth Concannon , Sylvia Pollen , Robin Barbe , and Kathy Kelly . The rumor 2 weeks ago was that UBS was going to cut 25% of the jobs if they won . I think Victor said that we should know alot more by tomorrow . I think I know of a couple of people that have left; David Jones ( black guy in origination - real nice guy too ) starts working for TXU in Dallas today , Darren Farmer ( Texas Desk ) is going to AEP .
We don't have a deadline . Our lawyers are scattered pretty thin . What would probably happen is that you guys might show me a bid for some of the capacity , then we would have to talk to the pipelines and see what they want to do .
#67401 and #70457 are the correct contracts . #67401 was intended to come out in Dec and #70457 was intended to come out in Jan .
Wait just a minute . Don't Goodell and I get a wedding invite ? Maybe we want to give you an expensive gift ! YEAH RIGHT!!!!! ! We are poorer than college students now . I think you should send us an invite anyway . Maybe I could make a bachelor party out of it . At least I could get drunk . So do you have all that wedding crap stuff done or is your MAN taking care of all that ? I always heard that it was WOMAN's work anyway . Those are fantastic grades . You would have to ADD my old college grades together to get a 3.83 , and I still think it would be a struggle . I know you told me but I can't remember , whets is your major ? MBA ? Its good to hear about Alicia . Is she going to grad school ? I don't know when me and my very pregnant girlfriend are getting married . We move in together at the end of Feb . I'm nervous about that . I've been living alone since '97 and I just don't know why all you foolish people want to get married and live together . I took some digital photo's of her yesterday . I'll let you know if I get them on the web so you can take a look and make fun of me being a 40 year old father to be .
I have a copy of what's in the files we made before the holidays .
This is my beautiful transport worksheet for Uncle Frenchy . What do you think ?
Yes I will . You are my hero . I suppose I can do the title transfer in Brazoria county on Friday right ?
Here is a funny right back at you . This is what I plan on doing to my kid when it gets here in May . I'm also going to duct tape its little hands just for fun too .
Thanks . So far so good but I'm too damn old to be a dad .
You want to work out the title transfer with them . 979-798-8715 This is my beautiful transport worksheet for Uncle Frenchy . What do you think ?
When are you coming to town to visit me ? What do you do all day ? What's going on in the world out there ?
Do you know if Bruce McDaniels still works at Virginia Power ?

I just got a call from the guy that asked me to work on the Texas Desk . He just eliminated my position and I think he may be making another cut or two as well .
Hey you crazy girl , there is nothing here to look at .
Just a note , the colors at work are different than the colors at home . Good photo though . Now that I've started the process , I'm going to add other pregnant Immer photo's .
Photo of my woman on the net .
FYI
Columbia Gas sent me the December invoices via federal express . The cover letter states that Columbia Gas is aware that ENA will not be paying the pre-petition amounts but that they expect full payment for the post-petition amounts . I'm sending you a copy of the letter . I assume that we will not be paying any of the invoice . Any news on the Columbia Gas park & loans ? Thanks
I just tried to call you and no one anwsered the phone . I was going to hassle you before I leave . My appt is at 2:45 , I'll probably leave at 1:45 ish . Its up on 1960 . I was going to work out then come over and take you to dinner . What do you think ?
Does Johnny Trimble work up there with you ? I just heard his name and I'm curious . Have you ever heard of Jeff Hammond ?
Guess what ? My buddy at dinergy said Mike couldn't talk to me if I'm still employed by Enron . I'm going to call him anyway just to say hello .
Looks like I'm gonna try BIAXIN XL 500 mg tablets . Are you really cute today ?

How does the agency with PG&E Energy Services work ? I show that EES is agent for two PG&E contracts . Contract 67309 on CGAS and 67310 of Col Gulf .
I'm off tomorrow . What are we doing ? Selling my Dad's wares and making a fortune ?
I have these 2 contracts highlighted in yellow and coded as Agency/Release . They probably should just be release but I'll let you decide .
This is very interesting . It doesn't sound legal unless SIGCORP agreed to pay for November upfront . Thanks for the info .
Thanks . I think Susan Weison has been all over .
I'm trying hard not to call you and use up my phone call allowance this morning . GOOD NEWS . I'm reading an article on Yahoo and they use the word nebulous . Enron is , in part , the deformed offspring of a move to deregulate markets . It played fast and loose in a nebulous world of finance that received scant attention from lawmakers . I know what it means . And this is only the second time I have ever seen this word used!!!!!! !
Guess what ? I have you nameplate . I'm gonna take it home and cherish it forever .
Life couldn't be better . I have absolutly nuthin to do and I'm getting paid for it . Kinda makes for a long day . How are you ? Been partying latley ? Married yet ? How's the dog ? Give Steve a big kiss for me! !
He is officially a scheduler now . This is how the East Desk fared . Scott Neal , Judy , Chuck - associate , Andy Rind , Sandra Brawner , Brad McKay , John McKay . Frank Vickers , Craig Taylor , Jared . Scheduling - Victor , Clarissa , Chris Ordway , Meredith , Scott Goodell . Vickie and Scott Loving were moved to the estate team . If you didn't get a job offer you are considered part of the estate team .
Opps , he's UBS too .
Do you have the file sharing set up yet ? And there is one contract on the East Desk that expires 1/31/2002 that we will need to turn back very soon I guess .
I'm an estate person . Nobody at UBS wants me .
Lunch on Friday sounds great . Looks like I'll be walking over again today without my buddy . He works for Northern and he's waiting for a termination letter from Enron and an offer letter from Dynegy . Maybe I'll see you there!! ! A fellow can always hope . Indrid still hasn't got me a rind either . I bet she doesn't marry me now .
We have two firm transportation agreements on Tennessee Pipeline . The long term Boston Gas capacity release and a short term contract which expires on 1/31/2002 . The monthly demand charge on the short term capacity is $15,200.00 . Do we need to reject the short term capacity before it expires ? To my knowledge , we did not flow any gas on this contract for December or January .
My contact at Tennessee , Sherry Noack , said she doesn't see any problem with us releasing the Tenn Boston Gas capacity . Iroq pretty much said the same thing last week but I will verify that again after lunch .
And to buy my g.d . ring ?
Here is a picture of my pregnant woman on the net . I'll being adding more pictures this week . Make sure you scroll down and read the comments at the bottom .

Hey buddy . I'm looking for a Boston Gas contract and I thought you might have a copy of it . Its the involving 35,000 dth of transport on Iroq and Tenn . Don't look to hard for it but if you do have it , just let me know and I'll come make a copy . Thanks I've already gone through Maureen's desk and she didn't have a copy .
Please give Ruth access to o:\Gas Structuring\Bankruptcy Folder\Transportation Thanks
thanks
Please give the same access to Kim and Jeanne . Thanks .
Hey team ! Man have I been waiting for this day . I have a meeting at 9:00 AM this morning . It's a meeting with lawyers so it is very possible that it will go through lunch . Don't wait for me if you can't get ahold of me . I hope to be there cause I wanna see JEAN , the light of my life . Scott--- HANDS OFF JACK ! Later
I know , life is all about choices , Jean or lawyers , Jean or lawyers , Jean or Ingrid and a screaming kid?? ? Hmm , my choice seems much simpler now that I look at it like this .
I'm back and I'm gong . My MSN doesn't work . What time should I come to your desk ?
Just heard from Robin . Sad stuff . My MSN doesn't work .
Russell is going to RWE .
I would much rather go and annoy your happy butt as much as possible . Plus it make me feel like I'm doing part of the work . I just might come up and spend the night tonight . Be there around 10:30 or 11 .
Funny . No . I didn't feel guilty about the garage sale , that's why I was annoyed - being notified at 10:00 at night GRRRRRRR . I do feel guilty about you doing all this work . So I'm going with you , I pay for the gas and the twinkies .
Maybe we can go drinking too . That would be fun . I'll be at your house around 10:30 or 11 tonight .
Cullen and Dykman ( attorneys for Boston Gas Company ) approved all of our changes on the agreement to release the Tenn and Iroq space back to Boston Gas . They also made one other change , they are taking out the "subject to recall" language at the bottom of page 2 under item #1 . They will be sending the revised document to me . I will deliver it to you for your approval .
A heartwarming story of the advances of women in achieving equality throughout the world . Barbara Walters did a story on gender roles in Kuwait several years before the Gulf War . She noted then that women customarily walked about 10 feet behind their husbands . She returned to Kuwait recently and observed that the men now walked several yards behind their wives . Ms . Walters approached one of the women and said , "This is marvelous . Can you tell the free world just what enabled women here to achieve this reversal of roles?" "Land mines," said the Kuwaiti woman .
Steve , everything looks good with one exception . The rate schedule on Tennessee should be either NET-2 or NET-284 . I won't find out until Monday . You review and approve it , keep it on your desk , and I will come over and make the change at your desk on Monday . Then I'll take it to Ed for his approval . By the way , Cullen and Dykman is sending copies of what we are doing to Melanie Gray .
Don't forget about me . I'm still trying to find out what it will take to move gas on and ENA tabs agreement . No transportation at this point , just a tabs . Also , it will be much easier for you guys to monitor because most of the deals will be monthly .
Jared , Ruth and I are going to go over all the Florida activity tomorrow morning . If no one objects , I will be the lead coordinator on Florida starting tomorrow .
Yes maam , she's UBS now . She was just down here too .
Jared just told me you have a BUNCH of stuff on your plate and I think you are about to get much busier too .
She is now . I don't think she had a choice .
I heard that El Paso had cuts on Friday . Did that impact you guys at all ?
I just validated and saved this release to Boston Gas . Since I have not done this in awhile , would you please make sure I did the following things ? Released 100% of the volume biddable to Boston Gas and max rate . I will wait to hear from you before I submit my offer . Thanks .
Also , I'm using Scott Goodell's ID because my doesn't work . Who do I call to get mine fixed ? I know - you told me once before . I'm a baaaad person .
I think so . Probably some people in satellite offices too . I heard it was mostly originators and middle marketers .
FYI - We just posted the capacity release to Boston Gas . I created a biddable offer per Boston Gas's request . This deal is for the month of Feb only .
FYI - meeting to discuss Florida issues before Jared goes away forever . Scott - didn't know if you should be at this meeting as well . Daniel , you did schedule the room for Tuesday , Jan 29th , correct ?
Eric and Ed are in a Keyspan meeting at 9:00 AM . Would it be possible to move this meeting to a later time today ?
sniff sniff . I'm gonna miss you guys . Think of me everytime you get a HUG! ! sniff sniff . Throw me some crumbs when you see me on the street .
Good . Glad to hear it . We are going to try and meet at 10:00 this morning . Jared is still in traffic right now anyway .
Ed McMichael has signed the agreement . One minor change , I replaced all "FT-A"'s with "NET-284" . I will fax a copy to your attention . Also , does this need to be sent to you via over night mail ? Thanks
Ed has signed off on the agreement you gave me yesterday evening . Should I send this straight to Boston Gas's outside counsel or should I send it to Melanie Gray ?
Guess what . I have the deal numbers in my notebook packed in a box - but Ed McMichael said we are not going to flow this gas until March . I think he also said he is trying to resurrect the Con Ed deal - which is probably similar to the Lilco deal with respect to the pipelines it flows on . Transco does not have a pooling contract like many of the other pipelines on the East . They assign the shipper a specific meter for that pool and you use your IT contract to nominate pool to pool stuff . I DID NOT CHANGE THAT OL CAPACITY TICKET BUT I THINK I WILL . I'VE GOT TIME!!!!!!!! !
I wonder if you guys can attend these sessions as UBS ?
Oh girl I know I do . I'm very modest too .
I'm at my new desk on the 4th floor . I'm here , my computer is here , but it looks like my phone has not been activated . So I don't know when I'll be able to call and aggravate you . Email aggravations just aren't the same . Please try to think of some of our old conversations , especially those where you would look up and to the left uttering "oh my GOD!" .
Looks like my computer is working , not real well but it is working . I have my phone now too .
Oh yeah , whatever you want deal . I am completly indifferent . Whatever makes you happy .
I asked Victor about the files . I think keeping it on your h drive is still a good idea for now .
I can vaugly remember you calling me about Unify . Do I have Unify Estate access ? If yes , do you know my ID and password ? If no , how do I get it ? Thanks
Robin Barbe is a Northeast originator and I'm sure she will be interested too . Remember , steak dinner for the WINNER!!!! !
Hey woman . I need your phone number and Steve's phone number and John's phone number and Tammy's phone number please .
Update: ENA was buying daily swing gas from Sequent on Florida to supply the City of Tallahassee deal . Sequent says this deal is an administrative burden and has elected not to supply any more gas to ENA after 2/1/2002 . Scott Goodell called Aaron Bohall with PanCanadian to see if they would become our new swing supplier . Aaron told me that they would sell us gas under the following conditions , the deal has to be on PanCanadian's paper we need to let PanCanadian know by 8:00 AM every morning and ENA must take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays . This is a problem because Tallahassee does not have to take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays and Tallahassee does not need to notify ENA until 9:00 AM . Aaron will see if they can work with a 9:00 AM deadline .
I think this will do for now . I was sniffling the other evening when we went out for a little drinky and Meredith said you wanted to work out instead of seeing me . I was so sad and heartbroken . Baby's doing good . Woman has not had any problems so far and she's starting to feel the baby move on a regular basis now . I've never felt the little sucker move - maybe she's just getting fat . What do you think ? We keep loosing people . Christina is moving to the Estate Team power dispatch group . Good for her . That will make her in expendable . how the heck are you ?
Looks like it works . Thanks .
Nothing so far . Joe Parks is checking with Bridgeline to see if we can buy gas from them . It was late in the day before PanCanadian called . I don't think PanCanadian will work because they do not have the flexibility to sell different daily volumes over weekends and holidays . I hope we can work out a deal with Bridgeline . Joe or I will be calling them first thing this morning . Yesterday afternoon Tallahassee indicated that they may not need the swing gas for the weekend .
Interesting because this capacity was released non-recallable to CES which was assigned ( not via capacity release ) to ENA . FYI , demand charge = $2.6614 per month = $.0875 per dth and the commodity is $.0136 100% load factor cost = $.1639
ok , I see Russel and Chucks touch all through this .
I'm busy that day . JUST KIDDING>
Margaret I've attached the prepayment request . The physical address for the bank is Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company C/O Bank Of America File #96264 840 S . Canal Street , 6th Floor Chicago , IL 60693 The address of the company we are doing business is Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company Nine Greenway Plaza The person I negotiated the deal with is Andy Armstrong , his number is 832-676-5120 . The person at El Paso Corporate Credit ( Tennessee is a sub of El Paso ) is Julie Baker , her number is 713-420-7446 . Eric , Julie at El Paso said the only reason she is requiring a prepay for this small an amount is because her records show that ENA has not paid any monies for anything on the El Paso pipelines , including Tennessee , Sonat , ANR , or El Paso Pipeline . I know that we should have at least paid for the Bear Creek storage on Tennessee .
Who do I talk to over there about buying gas on Florida in Zone 2 ? And it was very nice to see you today .
Update on a new swing supplier as of 4:00 PM on Friday I've called PanCanadian , e prime , Cinergy , Reliant , Coral , ONEOK , and Entergy-Koch . I'm waiting for most of these people to call me back . The only positive response I've had is from Coral and he still doesn't know if he can sell us gas even if we prepay . ONEOK is the only counterparty that said they will NOT do business with us because we owe them $40 million . Today we learned that Bridgeline sent comfort letters to their customers , informing their customers that Bridgeline will NOT sell us gas . Margaret , it looks like Monday may be another fire drill day but I promise to keep working on it until 1 ) I have two suppliers that will work with ENA or 2 ) I've run out of customers to call .
scheduling contacts .
Same as before . We should have another supplier set up by the end of the day . The calculation for the prepay is 2000 dth x $.1221 per dth = $244.20 for gas flow on 2/5/02 on Tenn contract 2891 .
Reliant has agreed to sell us gas on Florida . My trading contact is Jim Taylor ( 713-207-1482) . The contact on the wire should be Pete Torres ( 713-207-1471) , he is in Reliant's credit department . Pete said there should be an active GISB contract with Reliant already in place . I would like to prepay for 5 days and I have my calculation on the prepay request form . Please let me know if you have any questions . Thanks
Please use bank account number 8188202747 for the wire to Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company ( subsidiary of El Paso) . Ted with El Paso's corporate credit department said this account number is good . Call me at 713-853-4743 if you have any questions . Thanks Chris Germany
Richard James Taylor was born on Jan 15th . He weighed 7 lbs 11 ozs . Jim would like to meet for lunch , HIS TREAT , one day . Of course he doesn't want to meet me , he wants to see Judy P . But the boy is smart , he knows that the best way to see Judy P . for lunch is to invite me . See there , you are still a benefit to me . So how about Thursday ?
I just got to work about 10 min ago . Key Lay has resigned from the Board of Directors . I brought in those chocolate hearts and passed them out to my little group . I told the guys that I DO discriminate because I gave all the guys 1 chocolate and all the girls 2 chocolates . How's your day ?
Pete , I'm following up the voicemail I left you this morning . In our initial discussions you indicated we could do business under an existing GISB agreement between Enron North America and Reliant . However , our legal department believes all of our GISB contracts with Reliant have been cancelled/terminated . Attached is a standard GISB agreement for your review . I understand that you need to send this to your legal department to include any special provisions that may be necessary . Please call me at 713-853-4743 or Eric Boyt at 713-345-7754 and let me know if Reliant Energy Services is willing to trade under this agreement . Thanks Chris Germany Manager , Gas Trading
Here is our unofficial Tennessee invoice for January .
Another prepay to Tennessee . The calculation for the prepay is 2,000 dth x $.1221 per dth = $244.20 .
Reliant has indicated that we must use their paper - this point is non-negotiable . Kay , we will not wire any funds to Reliant until we have your approval of the contract . I understand that you are also working on a gas contract with TXU . We need one of these contracts in place so we can buy gas tomorrow morning , it doesn't matter which contract we have in place first . Doug , Phil , Eric , The prepayment that we were going to send to Reliant may be going to TXU instead . We are coming dangerously close to defaulting on the Tallahassee contract . Robin and I are going to work on a prepayment request for TXU after lunch .
Thanks , I have sent this to my legal department .
I thought yesterday was going to be our last day but now I think today is it . This has turned out to be very frustrating
I have 2 prepays in this email . We will not need to wire money to Tennessee if we can get TXU set up as a supplier by 8:40 AM tomorrow . Note to all The first prepay is to TXU . I'm requesting $22,500.00 to be prepaid to TXU - that's about 5 days of supply for the Tallahassee deal . The second prepay is for 1 day of interruptible transportation on Tennessee . If we are unable to purchase gas from TXU or Reliant , we will use the Bear Creek storage gas on Tennessee to supply the Tallahassee deal . This is what we did on the 2nd-6th . I am also anticipating that the discounted IT rate on Tennessee will be higher for gas flow on the 7th . My goal is to maintain 2 active suppliers ( with prepays ) on the East Coast , TXU and Reliant . I would also like to set up a trading contract with another supplier ( maybe Coral ) in case TXU or Reliant decides to stop doing business with ENA . Our supplier for the swing gas on the Tallahassee deal in January was Sequent . However , last Thursday , Sequent stopped doing business with ENA because it was too much of a burden for them to keep track of the ENA prepays and the daily volumes . So far we have spent 3 business days trying to secure another supplier . We will also be able to use TXU and Reliant as suppliers for any other deals that we are able to start up .
Same thing as yesterday . I requested a wire in the amount of 244.20 ( 2000 dth x $.1221 per dth ) which is for gas flow on ENA's IT contract #2891 on 2/6/02 . I negotiated this deal with Michelle in the bid room . You should have received this yesterday afternoon . Thanks
These are my notes on flowing gas . Tetco will be the problem pipeline . I called my rep again and asked her to seriously look into it . I'm thinking worse case is they will need either cash or a letter of credit for about $1,000,000.00 . I'm using the following formula They may cut back on the number of days but the cashout price is the problem . It's a moving target and I expect prices to go up . I think that if we just agreed to give them a letter of credit for $1 mill and then prepay for any actual expenses we incur , we could build our reputation on the pipeline , at least until we get rid of these deals . If all the gas flows like it should , we should never have any actual expenses on any of these pipelines for the Keyspan deal . Who knows what volumes are going to be ?
This is what someone created for Sequent . I plan on doing something similar for Reliant and TXU . Call me after you get this and we can chat .
Look what I found in my inbox .
Iroquois is offering to market ENA's capacity for $1.00 ( see attachements at the bottom of this email) . Doesn't sound like a bad deal to me
i hope to quit before that becomes an issue . one can only hope .
How do I get Jim Taylor added as a contact at Reliant Energy Services , Inc . in sitara ?
Who do I call to get my palm hooked up to my computer ? I have the palm cradle sitting on my desk .
I found a mistake in my capacity worksheet . The term on the Boston Gas capacity , contract 125008 , 35,465 MDQ , is 12/1/1998 - 3/31/2007 . I think have the ending date as 2008 .
Do you want to work with Wade Price on the Appalachian suppliers on CGAS ? I think we are still getting gas because contracts have not been terminated or something like that . It will probably be tedious but it doesn't matter to me . Just let me know .
Following are the contract terms for Iroquois and Tennessee . I am more interested in getting numbers on Iroq contract 1250-05 . I believe we should not consider releasing the capacity for any term less than a year . Pipeline Iroquois Rate Schedule RTS12 Receipt Point Waddington Delivery Point South Commack Beginning Term 3/1/2002 Ending Term 10/31/2006 Pipeline Iroquois Rate Schedule RTS1 Receipt Point Waddington Delivery Point Tennessee Wright Beginning Term 3/1/2002 Ending Term 3/31/2007 Pipeline Tennessee Rate Schedule Net 284 Beginning Term 3/1/2002 Ending Term 3/31/2001
Wade called Eric about someone wanting us to cancel a contract then Wade said there are still lots of producers putting gas on our contracts . I was working on something else and I just asked Wade to send me a worksheet of what he was talking about . Wade actually called Eric .
Tennessee requires a pepayment or LC in the amount of $25,000.00 per SA pool . For the Keyspan deal , that essentially means we would need $25,000.00 of credit for each point , 500L , 800L , and Zone 0 = $75,000.00 total .
I echatted with Dan . He said the number is 212-398-6300 and HE THINKS the name of the person is Allen Fuchs .
I've would like to wire Reliant $9,500.00 tomorrow and then wire about $31,000.00 every Thursday to keep Reliant paid for 7 days of gas . I'm making the following assumptions; 1 . ENA will be maintaining this deal through March 31 , 2002 2 . Prices are going to remain flat for the next 2 months 3 . Tallahassee will call on the maximum swing volumes every day So far this month , Tallahassee has called on the maximum swing volumes every day . I will make adjustments to the Thursday wire amount as needed based on prices and how much Tallahassee calls on . The following worksheet projects how much we need to send Reliant each week and shows what days Tallahassee called on the swing gas . Phil , you mentioned adding a column for the sales price to Tallahassee . Sounds good to me . This file is located at o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy Folder/City of Tallahassee/Tallahassee Swing Cash Flow.xls The following worksheet shows ENA's activity with Reliant , our current cash balance with Reliant , how much gas we have purchased , and what price we used . I will send the following worksheet to Reliant each week . I also plan to copy Phil , Robin , and Margaret . This file is located at o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy Folder/City of Tallahassee/ENA-Reliant Prepay.xls Eric , Doug , Phil , let me know what you think about the wire for Friday and every Thursday .
Tallahassee called on the gas for the weekend . I had planned for that in my numbers but I had no idea prices would go up $.07 - $.11 for the weekend - my fault . This makes my cash balance at Reliant short by about $130.00 if prices post on the high side . My trading contact at Reliant said that his credit department DOES NOT want to work with us at all . My contact said his credit department could force him to cut the deal . We won't know until this afternoon or Monday . So please try to get the wire out today . Thanks
Jim Attached is my worksheet showing our daily activity and prepayments . I would like to send this worksheet to you 2 or 3 times a week . Let me know if you agree with all the information . We can also change the format . I will be out of the office on Monday so Robin Barbe will be calling you . Her number is 713-853-7177 . Also , we originally intended to wire more money to Reliant on Monday but we are trying to wire the money today due to the increase in prices . I will keep you posted and I will update the schedule for any prepayments made today . Chris L . Germany Manager , Gas Trading Phone 713-853-4743 Fax 713-646-3037
ENA is wiring Reliant $20,000.00 today at 3:30 PM . My goal is to send Reliant a wire every Thursday that will cover all ENA purchases for the next 7 days . Jim , your contact on Monday will be Robin Barbe . Her number is 713-853-7177 . Thanks everyone and have a good weekend . Chris L . Germany Manager , Gas Trading Phone 713-853-4743 Fax 713-646-3037
I adjusted my schedule to reflect higher prices and the wire scheduled to go out at 3:30 PM today . Did I mention what wonderful people we have working in settlements ? WELL THEY ARE!!! ! Thanks TEAM .
I'm out Monday , Feb 11th . I'm just cleaning up my apartment , getting ready for the big move . My pager number is 877-498-5497 if anyone needs me or JUST WANTS TO TALK . Do not leave a voicemail on my pager like Eric does , I don't have the code to check voicemails . Robin Barbe will talk to Jim Taylor at Reliant on Monday . Jim Taylor's number is 713-207-1482 . We should have enough money at Reliant to cover purchases through Friday of next week . Robin , Christina will let you know if Tallahassee calls on the gas .
I spoke with all the following personally about the Trailblazer capacity Kevin at e prime Greg at Dominion Calvin at Select Greg Hood at Oxy Steve at BP The only person I had to leave a voicemail for is Grier at El Paso . His number is 713-420-5673 . You may have already touched base with him . If not , you may want to call him on Monday , I will be out . later
Hey ! Congradulations on getting that new phone number . I knew you could do it . Would you ask Gerald Gilbert to call me when he gets a chance ? My number is 713-853-4743 . Thanks
I would like for you to get 3 or 4 bids for the Iroq Zone 2 capacity . And later , I may ask you to get bids for the Iroq/Tenn capacity .
That would be great if you could tell me . I show we wired $22,500.00 at 12:00 PM on the 6th , and we should have wired $20,000.00 around 3:30 PM on the 8th . I would be happy to include you on the schedule below that I email to Jim and Pete showing this activity . Let me know . You might let your accounting department know that we plan on wiring money to Reliant every Thursday , enough money to cover supply for the next 7 days .
Sorry about the email I just sent at 10:49 AM . Attached is my new schedule reflecting no gas flow on the 9th and 10th .
Let me know if you want to be added to this distribution list . I should only send this list out 2 or 3 times a week now that we have a process down .
Hopefully just once a week , every Thursday .
Guess what ? I just hired some mover to move me next week . Indrid keep telling me that you and I have bad backs and don't need to fool with moving furniture . So , I hired movers . They are charging me $60 hour and I figure 3 hours max .
37147 IPP agreement - our pooling contract . 39149 AS agreement - 66917 AS agreement - I think the AS agreements are aggregation supply and I believe the wellhead meters were attached to these contracts to help with allocations and billing . I not 100% sure so I left a message for our CGAS contact to verify .
Steve Stonestreet at CGAS did verify that metered production on CGAS is "attached" to the AS ( aggregation service ) contracts , and from there you would schedule it to a transport contract or into the IPP contract . CGAS and Dominion work very similar when talking about metered production .
Hey team . I would like to release the Iroq and Tenn capacity for March activity to Boston Gas by the end of the week if possible . Please let me know by Thur morning if I should wait until next week . Thanks
Who would have this info ? And it might be a good thing for me to add to the schedule . Thanks
Good idea . I'm checking on it and I might add this info to the worksheet .
I'm trying to get in touch with Gerald Gilbert . He started working there on 2/1 I think . You may not know him but if you do , ask him to call me at 713-853-4743 . Thanks
thanks
This prepay amount is on Phil's cash flow worksheet . I'm requesting $26,000.00 to be wired to Reliant tomorrow and currently estimating $36,000.00 to be wired next Thursday .
you don't have one here .
What bears ?
Here is the info and I'm putting a copy of the agreement in interoffice mail to you . Shawn Kirkpatrick Contract Analyst Reliant Energy Services , Inc . Phone: 713-207-6569 Fax: 713-393-0212
Also , please let me know what the global contract number is . I want to write it on my copy . thanks
Hey woman ! Things are going good , ok at work , better at home . Not too too busy but I'm actually doing stuff . Well , this is my last weekend as a lone bachelor . NONO , we aren't getting married , yet . I move out of my little 522 sq ft cubby hole into a 2 bedroom in her apartment complex . She moves into it on the 22nd . Ahhhhh the good life . I knew it couldn't last forever . I getting ready for some fighting too . We have 3 TV's . What's wrong with a TV in each bedroom???? ? I tell you we are gonnnnnna fight!@# How are things with you ?
Ok , since I have not seen or heard from you , I'm tossing you nameplate . Maybe my woman will let me put it up in the bedroom , the one we are moving into on Monday .
Robin needs a back doctor recomendation . Who do you think she should see ?
You still don't understand how things work . You are suppossed to always have that info at my beck and call .

I just received a copy of the executed Reliant agreement today . Do you want a copy ?
Hey there . I did get your message and yes we did wire $26,000.00 yesterday that is for a gas prepayment . Pete sent me an email earlier this week asking for a confirmation number from our treasury department of the wires we make . I like that idea and I'm still working on getting the info to add to my worksheet . thanks .
Congratulations . Of course I won't be able to give you any more candy on valentine's day . But maybe someone over there will take care of that .
Any news on this ?
ENA did not purchase any gas for the weekend or Tuesday ( Monday is an Enron holiday) . Have a good weekend !
Thanks , you too . How do I get my fax number changed in the contract ? My current fax number is 713-646-3037 .
Phil , I will drop my wire amount for Thursday if Tallahassee does not call on the gas next week . I need to research how much gas Tallahassee has taken in the past on the swing contract .
I finally got a response on the wire information . You should be getting a call from Ramona Rodriquez in our Treasury department . Let me know if you don't hear from her . Thanks Chris
The gentleman interested in our Florida space is Henry Barth with FPL Energy Services ( the retail group , separate from the group Mike Jessop works for) . His number is 561-694-4057 .
Bob Crites at El Paso Merchant Energy is interested in the Florida capacity as well . I don't know how he relates to Grier Martin's group . Bob's number is 713-420-2499 .
This would be for gas ENA purchased from Sonat . It's not transport related .
POINTY HEAD!!!!! ! I KNEW IT ! Poor little fella . I like the apartment but the walk to the parking garage is terrible . I don't think Immer is going to like it very well either when she's lugging the baby around . Talk about space , I GOT IT ! For now anyway . Yeah , I've emptied my car of certain items because I didn't want to carry them around . Hey we need to discuss how to divy those up . I've always wanted them even though I don't use them . Dad gave me the single shot 12 , but there is still the little one , the double ( the prize possesion ) and the new one that you wanted to use . The apartment is still pretty empty . I didn't want to empty my boxes until we got Immer's stuff in there . I don't think she has that much either , living room furniture , bed , 2 bedroom night stands , armwour , kitchen talble , 1 stupid cat.... .
I'm moving into my new hugh apartment with my first roommate - have not had a roommate since March 1996 .
I need Sitara access to all gas regions . I'm trying to look at some of the Central Desk activity and I don't have authorization . We might as well give me access to all ENA gas positions and the ability to create/update Sitara tickets for all gas regions .
I'm using March pricing for TCO and Sonat . For TCO , I'm using the financial basis offer for March provided by Dan Junek at AES at 9:45 AM , $.125 . Sonat basis is not as liquid so I'm using the Inside Ferc differential for Feb 2002 . For Feb 2002 , Henry Hub is $2.03 and Sonat is $1.99 , ( $.04) . At 10:00 AM , NYMX for March 2002 is $2.36
I printed this out and gave it to Doug . My revised prepay amount for Thur is $10,000.00 .
I've requested a prepayment of $10,000.00 to be sent tomorrow and I have that on my schedule .
You are most welcome .
Make Jim Taylor take you out to lunch sometime .
You need to get on the email distribution for this . I get emails from them every day .
I would like to have access to the following directory . It has the actual Gas Daily prices loaded into excel files . I'm not sure who you have to ask but they may not let me have it . The directory is o:TDS/TDS Curve/East/ Let me know . Thanks
Wade , 2 things , do you have any of the letters that the producers sent to Dominion , I would like one of those AND who are you talking to at Dominion ? Thanks
That's fine . I don't need AEP .
Tommy , I see you didn't approve my access for AEP which is fine . I only need access to all the Estate desks and I just asked Daniel to give me everything because I don't know where the deals are for the other desk . I didn't know if the Central Desk deals are under Central Desk or one of their many other books . I think I just need Central , East , West , and Texas . But , maybe you can help . My request for the Central Desk needs Darron Giron's approval and he's not in the People Finder . So he's either at UBS or he left the company . Do you know who I should be approving that now ? Thanks
I'm requesting the prepay for Dominion for March 2002 . I printed out the request , signed it , and gave it to Doug . I just want everyone to be aware of what is happening with Dominion . Dominion is still not delivering the gas to Tallahassee due to a Force Majeure event . We are expecting gas to flow any day , hopefully by the weekend . Eric , I left a message for David Walker ( 405-749-5240 ) at Dominion to call me about the prepayment amount . Following are my calculations Estimated payment due 2/28/02 $366,554 As of today Mops has been down from Feb 8th - 21st , 14 days . Mops may not come up until the weekend or early next week . I will adjust the prepayment as needed next week .
Robin is having back surgery next Thursday , Feb 28th . She went to a neurosurgeon for a second opinion , Dr . Alfonso Aldama was her second opinion dude. . Dr . Esses , my second opinion dude , is an orthopedic surgeon . And Dr.Alani , the guy I went to see first was an orthopedic surgeon . Robin said I should go to a neurosurgeon . What do you think ?
The file you guys sent is July 2001! ! Let me know what rates you are looking at . We didn't keep all of them updated and GRI changed effective 1/1/2002 . I did make some updates to this file . Also , I only have rates for East Desk pipelines .
I am still having trouble but I don't know if its and Enron problem or an Iroquois problem . I'm waiting to hear form Iroquois . I would like you to check it out if you have time this morning .
anytime monday morning is fine with me , EXCEPT , i need to be at my desk around 9:00 AM to serve the Tallahassee deal . It only takes about 5 min though
Updated schedule through Monday , Feb 25th .
Kay , per my voicemail , I need to meet with you , Ed , Shemin , and Wade to discuss how to handle producers that are still "attached" to ENA's pools on Dominion Pipeline . This should be a short ( less than 30 minutes ) meeting . Shemin and I are available anytime Monday after lunch . I believe Ed is available after lunch as well . Please let Daniel and I know when you are available after lunch on Monday and Daniel will get us a conference room . Thanks
Daniel , please get us a conference room for 30 min Monday afternoon and email everyone with the details . Eric , you don't need to be there , I'm just keeping you in the loop .
never mind
According to Iroq the problem is on our side . Please call me first think Monday morning at 3-4743 . Following is the address that I'm starting at . I go to this address and click on "Customer Activities" and that's when I get the error message . It should ask me for my ID and password . I'm at ECS 04425 if you decide to come by my desk . I'm out for the rest of the day . Thanks
According to Kay Mann , Shemin may not be here until late afternoon .
I'm not sure if it should be terminated but to my knowledge we are not serving this deal so it probably should be terminated . I'm going to a "terminated contracts" meeting this morning so maybe I will find out more about how this works . I also don't see any volumes on this deal for March .
I just showed Ed McMichael the sitara position screens for the East and Central Desk for March 1st . There are volumes all over the place . I asked him who should be taking these volumes to 0 since most of these deals are not physically flowing . Ed is going to discuss this in a meeting with Bob Hall today . I guess my next question is should the volume be taken to 0 in Sitara or Unify . Can you guys think of any other questions along those lines ?
Do you have a deal number for this gas ?
Could you tell me who in legal is assigned to this ? thanks
Hi team . I'm going to set myself up as the Navigator administrator for Enron North America unless someone else wants to do it . We use Navigator for activity on Columbia Gas , Columbia Gulf , Crossroads , and KO Transmission . I think we also use Navigator to download the invoices . I'm going to kill all the ID's shown below except mine . Should I set up anyone else with an ID ?
oh no , i insist that you do it since you started the process . i'm such a laggard .
I'm telling you life just can't get any better!!! ! We spent our first night together Friday night . Of course we both have colds / allergies real bad so it was a sniffly experience . It will take some getting used to thats for sure . She was trying to set up the kitchen yesterday , bless her pregnant heart .
I did have those set up pretty quick .
I know . I'm gong to recommend zeroing out the deal in sitara under "expected volumes" .
I have an id - what kind of form are you talking about ?
I just went over the March prepayment with David Walker ( 405-749-5240 ) at Dominion . On Thursday , ENA will wire $280,306.00 to Dominion . The Force Majeure event has ended and Dominion will resume deliveries effective 2/26/02 . We are assuming Dominion did not deliver any gas for Feb 8th through Feb 25th , 18 days . Following are my calculations Amount to wire on 2/28/02 ==> $280,306.00 There may have been some gas flow on Feb 8th , but David will let us know about that later . Doug , do I need to prepare a new Cash Use Approval Request form ?
FYI , I'm sure these are not in the system yet but will be soon .
Just a reminder that we still need to discuss the physical deals with volumes in the sitara for March . You said we were going to talk to Bob Hall about that today .
Congratulations! ! I would walk over and hassle your "MAN" but I don't see him .
Thanks for your help . Now go find me a job .

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd . ( an affiliate of Enbridge Inc. ) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31 , 2002 . Dan White ( 403-508-3184 ) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation . According to Dan , this gas was parked in May and June 2001 . Per Enbridge's confirmation , "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months" . The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible . Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!! ! So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that Tomorrow , I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn . Before I sell the gas , I will 1 . verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 2 . make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item . Kay , the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada . Are there any special tax issues to address ? Any comments or questions ? Listed below are some of the companies ENA has done business with at Dawn AEP Energy Services , Inc . Aquila Canada Corp . BP Canada Energy Company Cargill Energy Trading Canada , Inc .

I am changing the following deal tickets in Sitara for March 2002 . I'm still not sure what to do about all the volumes showing up in Sitara for non-active deals . Counterparty Sitara Pipeline Comment Midland Cogen 332163 PEPL Changed volume from 0 to 5,000 per day Midland Cogen 340362 TRKL Changed volume form 0 to 6,800 per day
Just sold 10,000 MMBtu per day at Dawn to MidAmerican Energy Company at $2.47 for March . My contact at MidAmerican is Dave Evans ( 515-281-2698) . Dave said he was using Apr Nymx + $.05 to calculate his price .
Hey , I don't think you should show any cash flow for the Enbridge storage until I talk to them this afternoon . I'm writing an email to you and a few others about what I think we should forcast and I want to talk to them first . But between you and me , I'm thinking we show about $600,000 or so .
yes sir
Per my discussion with Dave Evans - MidAmerican agreed to pay ENA for this gas and will not net this deal with any other deal . We also discussed doing this deal under a GISB agreement but if we have some other post-bankruptcy agreement that we can trade under then that's fine with me . You and Stacy can decide if we need to put any of this information on the confirm . Stacy also has some comments below pertaining to the GST tax that should may need to be included in the confirm . I did not discuss the GST tax , I felt fortunate that someone would do business with me .
Joe Van Zandt with Dominion Field Services wants to know if we are going to nominate his gas for the first . Their are 3 fixed price deals and 1 Index + $.10 deal . I can't find the deals in the system . What should I tell him legally besides NO ?
I would like to set up a GISB agreement to trade with Sempra . Could you send me one to send to Sempra please ? Thanks
I took 1/2 day off Thur 21st and Fri 22nd .
This doesn't have everything on it AND i thought about just doing something more like a summary thingy with pretty much the same info on it . I want you to take a look and tell me what you think . I actually think a summary thingy , sorta like the info we used to have on the grease boards for bid week , would be easier to look at . Give me your thoughts .
done
FYI: Pipeline name change . Not sure who this might impact . At least I don't see any deals in Sitara on this pipeline . There will be a quiz tomorrow afternoon at 4:45 PM .
Enbridge is going to send me an invoice tonight or tomorrow . They have been sending us and invoice each month . I'll get back to you . I just know we owe money on this and I hope its not more than what we are making on the deal .
I'm actully working on this . I should have it done tomorrow or Monday . Thanks
I need your expertise . If ENA nominated this gas , and I think we did based on what I see in Unify , then we are supposed to pay for it . So I just need to verify with you we TOOK this gas by nominating it . Deal 1143983 on Natural Gas Pipeline Company . thanks
Ed is asking me if we followed up or if we need to follow up . Please let me know . I am also going to send you an email of the letter we sent to Tallahassee .
I still am unable to get into the EBB . Did the capacity get awared to Boston Gas ?
Wonder where I should go to lunch today ? Maybe the BOOOOOFEEEEEET!! !
Sounds like a pizza night to me .
of course , its my perrrrogative to changemy mind and go burger hopping .
FYI , I just bumped up the forecast for next week from $19,000 to $37,000 because Tallahassee took the swing gas for the weekend . I've also put a manual date and time on my swing gas cash forecast worksheet .
I hope I have the right Bob Hall . I'm trying to get sitara access to the West and Texas Desk and they have not been approved yet . I'm waiting for Phillip Love ( now with UBS ) to approve the West and O'Neal Winfree ( not sure who this is ) to approve the Texas Desk . Tommy Yanowski was able to help with a couple of these but it looks like we need to get the approving parties changed . I also left a message for the help desk about this .
Goodell want phone numbers for the following WIlliams people . Jon Warzel in Tulsa Thomas Coleman in Atlanta
Update schedule through 3/4/02 . Have a good weekend !
Bernie said he has given Ed all the file locations and such . I asked him to email you and I anything he thinks important .
I was getting an error messge until I downloaded something from the IOL Setup & Help tab . Now , I go to and select "Transportation" at the top of the screen . Then I select "Customer Activities" from the left side of the screen . And this is where I used to get an error message , now I just get a small symbol - looks like some sort of "flash" plug in is not loaded .
U de MAN . thanks
I'm not aware of an AP rate schedule . AS ( tariff sheet #205 ) and IPP ( tariff sheet #215 ) are separate rate schedules in the tariff . AS pools are used to aggregate production meters on CGAS's system and are assigned a specific geographical location on the pipeline . AS pool meters can be used as primary receipt points on firm transportation agreements whereas IPP Pool meters are not .
I did submit a request via "e Request" - #83213 . I didn't know if you wanted to assign other people to do this and I don't know HOW you would do that either . I just asked for everything to cover all the bases .
Cash till Williams does a little better . I'm swinging back to pizza now .
The tariff sheets do not line up on the page so well , I did a cut and paste . You should see the following sheets No Comment File 28B PAL Rates CGAS_PAL_rates.doc 227-229 Rate schedule CGAS_PAL_Tariff.doc
I am micro-managing this deal and I don't want it to catch you by surprise . If you look at my schedule for March , you will see that it is possible for ENA to have a negative cash balance with Reliant before I make the Thursday prepay based on the daily spike in prices . I get the estimated prices from Jim . Do you want me to make a prepayment on Wednesday or are you comfortable with the regular Thursday prepayment ? I need to know by tomorrow morning . I have to request prepayments the day before the wire goes out . Thanks
Cash prices have jumped over $.20 since Friday . I may need to make my prepayment on Wednesday for Reliant and I've bumped up the amout to $42,000 for this week . I will have a much better idea by 9:00 tomorrow of course .
Hi everybody . It's Steve Cooper . It's Friday afternoon , March 1 . I hope everybody has had a great week . I want to update everybody on a number of things that have gone on this week , so that you all will be fully in the loop . The week started in a rough-and-tumble fashion . I went to a town meeting Monday night to meet with a number of our ex-colleagues . Their disappointment , upset and anger is very understandable . I , along with the entire management team , have committed that we are going to try to do whatever we can to fashion a reasonable resolution to their various issues . In order to make sure that those that are truly in need have something to fall back on , we asked the court later in the week and got the judge to approve an emergency $5 million fund . We are now going to fish around for an independent administrator to evaluate the needs and disperse those dollars to former employees . I wanted you to be aware of that . I really do appreciate and understand everybody's upset . Last Friday , February 22 , we presented to the Creditors' Committee a formal proposal on a retention and severance program . As can be expected , there was some push back from the committee -- there were issues about some of the data , there were requests for additional data and further clarification . The Creditors' Committee formed a subcommittee . We provided to them more data . Jeff McMahon and I met with them on Wednesday , February 27 , and we met with them again on Thursday , February 28 . We are scheduled to meet with them again on Monday and Tuesday to resolve all the open issues and to get the full support and endorsement of the Creditors' Committee on this program . I have indicated to the subcommittee that getting a plan in place is Jeff's and my highest priority . It is not right or fair for anyone to be in a state of ongoing uncertainty about their future , their future compensation , and any financial safety net , so we are going to have to move on this at light speed . I told the creditors' subcommittee and asked that they tell the full committee that we want to be in a position by the week of March 11 to motion this up to the court . I'll keep you posted on progress . I am comfortable that the committee wants to put in place the retention and severance program and now we are just working out the bugs . Hopefully , by the time we have the employee meeting , we can walk through the composition of the program in detail . The powers that be - management in conjunction with the human resources group - are working on merit increases and promotions . Hopefully all the details of a program will be finalized next week . Then , the process is typically that business unit managers begin to calculate salary increases . And it works its way through the review , approval and communication process . So hopefully , we'll have that all resolved in the next week or two and everyone will know where they stand with respect to promotions and merit increases . We reached an accord with the Astros this week to repatriate to Enron $2.1 million for the release of our rights to the naming contract . It is a shame we won't be in a position to support the naming of the field , but it is probably in the best interest of the estate . I got a great suggestion from one of our colleagues about auctioning Enron Field signs and contributing net proceeds to the ex-employees' fund . I'd like your input on that . I thought it was a great idea and very generous . We are moving forward with plans for an employee meeting later this month . Hopefully I'll be able to meet many of you there . I've tried to get around to say hello here and there . And again , I would encourage you if you have any questions , concerns or issues just give me an email or a buzz . Sometimes it takes a few days for me to get back to you , but I'm making a very concerted effort to answer everybody's inquiries . Other than that I don't have a lot to report . We'll continue to hammer out with the committee the retention program . Hopefully by next Friday I'll be able to report very substantial progress in this area . I want to thank everybody for their efforts , all their hard work and their focus on moving things forward . One other thing.. . We did have a bank meeting on Thursday afternoon . We have described to the banks what we believe is a very reorganizable entity here . We'll be sharing more about that at the employee meeting . I told the bank group , and it was echoed by management , that we believe there is a reorganizable , viable entity in Enron's future . I'll bring you all fully up to speed on that at the employee meeting . Anyway , as I was saying.. . Thanks so much for all your hard work , your efforts , your dedication . I hope you have a great weekend . I'll chat with next week .
Steve is working with the admins to see who needs what , CQG , Reuters,.... . things like that .

Moved the prepay to Wednesday . The amount is $42,000.00 due to the spike in pirces .
I've requested a prepayment for Wed in the amount of $42,000.00 due the rise in cash prices . I've also added a new and exciting "Summary" tab to the worksheet . That shows when the wires are made and my summary purchases for the month . One thing I don't have access to is any information that identifies the wire . Jim , Pete , Shawn , let me know if you have anything you would like me to add to this worksheet and go ahead and hit Jim up for a free lunch . That's what I plan to do .
Hey , I think you are the only person that doesn't delete this right away .
ok , now i feel like i'm doing somethig worthwhile .
Shawn seems like a nice person . You should take her out to eat then I'll take you out to eat .
Listed below are ENA's pool balances as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01 . From ENA's perspective , I would prefer to terminate the pools effective 11/30/01 . That would leave ENA with a negative pre-petition imbalance on Dominion and ENA would not have to pay the producers for December production or worry about selling a positive imbalance in an un-friendly market . However , Dominion will probably not let ENA terminate the pools until 12/31/2001 due to the negative cumulative imbalance . Questions that need to be answered , ** will ENA have to pay the producers for December ( possibly January ) production if Dominion will not let ENA terminate the pools any earlier ? ** how will Dominion handle the positive imbalance if the pool is terminated on 12/31/01 or later ? The operations contact at Dominion is Iris King ( 304-627-3213) , she is one of the managers over the operations group . In my opinion , we should terminate the pools as early as possible . 3/5/02 Per Vickie Coen at Dominion ENA Pool Balances as of Gat North 1,323 2,187 Tran North 0 0 Gat South ( 26,482 ) 31,583 Tran South 5,412 8,143

Kay , who should I work with at Weil ? Jeff , Loretta , are you the right contacts for me at PwC ? Shemin , my first queston for you is will ENA have to pay the producers for December ( possibly January) ? Kathryn , what are the imbalances for EES on 11/30/01 I've added Kathryn Bussell to the list . Kathryn is over the EES Logistics group . EES has been signing some of the producer letters allowing the producers
Shemin , Kathryn ( EES Logistics ) is going to send me some information on EES . I'm going to summarize the date for ENA and EES and resend this email , hopefully within the next hour or so .
I thought of a screwdriver and blue .

maybe i should go with you to get the carport .
Summary: TDC Energy Corporation is requesting payment of $203,196.00 from ENA for post-petition gas that flowed in the month of December 2001 ( sitara deal #1143983) . TDC stated that it would "file a claim for administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all other necessary relief against ENA" if ENA did not remit payment by the close of business Feb 22 , 2002 . Based on the information in this email it appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00 . Kay , Ed , Question: I have not contacted TDC to determine if they have filed a claim with the court . Would that have any impact on making a payment to TDC ? Should I contact TDC ? Calculation of Post-Petition Payment using Dec 3 as Post-Petition day Gas scheduled Dec 3-24 , 26-31 = 28 days , volume = 3,000 dth per day

3/6/02 2:30 PM just spoke with Louis Schott ( 504-529-3630 Sr . Vice President & General Counsel for TDC ) - TDC has not filed a claim with the courts at this time . TDC is trying to avoid the administrative expense and expects to be paid $203,196.00 . I told him I would call him back Friday afternoon and give him a status update . Please let me know what I can tell him . This was an ENA deal .

Wade , what are the contract numbers that the producer's gas gets allocated too ?
Are you getting these ?
Steve and I were talking about where to go . We don't know where yet but I bet we figure it out . Judy may come with us . I say goodell coming in this morning and I told him we didn't want him to go . YOU KNOW , THE ONE THING I REALLY LOVE BESIDES MYSELF IS FOOOOOOOOD!!!! !
Have a good weekend !
Shemin and I are going to lunch on Monday . She might even PAY!!!! ! I told her I was going to bring 12 of my closest friends . Well , I don't have any friends but I told her that you two might like to go .
I sent you the fax yesterday . It really looks like all the contracts were terminated effecitve 12/31/2001 to me .
Galveston sounds good to me .
I have asked my legal department about this a couple of times and I'm not sure if we have sent you anything . Would you please just send me a GISB agreement out of your shop . I see you have spoken to EES already . Thanks Chris L . Germany Manager , Gas Trading Phone 713-853-4743 Fax 713-646-3059
This is my Reliant Energy schedule . I send this to all the people you see below at least twice a week . I'm only doing business with them at one point and they are making money off Enron . But he has agreed to give me a little operational flexibility over the weekends if I need it . I send them a wire every Thursday , unless its like this week where prices ran up and I had to send it on Wednesday .
I'm your long lost brother BROTHER>
There are 2 Con Eds and I believe this is a contact for the unregulated side . I don't think Chevron-Texaco has a trading group other than Dynegy .
I just received a call from Joe Krajewski ( 617-723-5512 x4731 ) at Boston Gas . He is a Resource Management Analyst at Boston Gas working for Liz Danehy . According to Joe , ENA is still billing Boston Gas for part of the demand charges on the long term producer netback deal ( that Ruth is so familiar with) . This is Iroquois and Tennessee capacity I am releasing back to Boston Gas each month at a 100% demand rate . Joe asked me why we were doing this and I told him that ENA was probably not paying the capacity bills and Boston Gas was aware of that fact and knew Boston Gas would be liable for the demand charges anyway . Sounds like Boston Gas may be getting double billed and Joe said they will probably not pay the invoice .
Let me know if you get this . Outlook is up but I don't have any email for today which is odd .
I received your fax . Questions: at the top of the page from Dominion , it states that "effective FEBRUARY 2002 Production . . . WILL NOT BE CREDITED" . One of the column titles on the sheet is EFFECTIVE DATE . What does this effective date stand for . Also , were you able to find a contract for The Central Pacific Group ?

I'm stuffed like teddie bear right now .
Ohhh boy . I just know we are having a big party this week sometime .
U are so mean . i'm hurting , wait...........my little heart just broke into tiny little pieces .
All my Sonat notes .
Are you going to San Antonio Friday ? Is the little woman going with you - maybe make it a romantic encounter ?
Kathryn ( EES Volume Management ) and I are trying to determine what the Dominion Pipeline imbalances are from the Appalachian producers for EES . Dominion will not tell us without making a formal request to their legal department . We may have to do that anyway . I'm not sure what this report is called , I just know its on a 2 month lag . I'm also not sure if this report was mailed to us or if we could run it out of Escript ( Dominion's EBB) . If it was run out of Escript , then someone in volume management should know how to do it and that person could show me . If the report was mailed to us , then I'll have to make a formal request to Dominion's legal department . Don't spend more than 10 minutes trying to figure out how to do this . If the person that handled Dominion is gone , then I'll just go the "legal" route . Thanks
Lee Ann , sounds like Gloria is our key person . Don't worry about it my request . thanks
Do you have a phone number for Heidi ?
Do you have Heidi or Jim's number . They left EES .
thanks
I'm going to work out after work today . Should be home around 6-6:30
Ed , this gas was nominated on an IT contract into a pool on NGPL . I am unable to identify the gas after that so its difficult for me to tell if the estate benefited . Let me know what you want to do at this point . Thanks
Is this a new contract on our side to send to them for review ?
Updated schedule through Wednesday 3/13/02 .
Yesterday I asked you how to go about paying an invoice from Peoples Energy for $1,380.44 . The charges are for a license fee , a customer service , and an outstanding balance of $983.75 . I found out this morning that we are using this system to do nominations for Enovate . Eric Boyt said he thought the Enron people managing the Enovate deal are Beth Jenkins and J.O . Pagan . Should I forward this invoice to Beth or J.O. ?
These days , its easier for our legal department to draft or approve a new GISB than to find any of the existing documents . The attached document is for Enron North America Corp . David is going to see if they can use it . If your legal department approves , please print 2 originals , fill in the Sempra information , sign it , and send it to me . Thanks Chris L . Germany Manager , Gas Trading Phone 713-853-4743 Fax 713-646-3059 Address: Attn: Chris Germany ECS 04444 1400 Smith St
Probably spending the night there . You should go and have a goooood time .
Beth Jenkins gave me your name as an Enron contact regarding Enovate . I work for Ed McMichael on the gas side of the Enron Estate team . Kevin Brady schedules gas for the Enron Estate Team . Kevin received an invoice from Peoples Energy in the amount of $1,380.44 , it looks like this invoice has not been paid in a few months . I just faxed the invoice to you at 312-541-2728 . This invoice is for a license fee and a customer charge for Pegasys , the system Kevin uses to do nominations on Peoples Gas Light & Coke . All the activity is for the Enovate deals . Doug Sewell said that this should be paid by Enovate , not Enron . Kevin was told by Peoples that if this invoice is not paid , they will terminate Kevin's access . Do you know who we could forward this too so that it can get processed correctly ? Thanks Chris L . Germany Phone 713-853-4743 Fax 713-646-3059
gocha , not a bad idea . 2701 Revere St #221 home 713-527-0534
Are you familiar with this item ?
At this point , just send everything to me and I'll work with our legal department .
Sempra needs to get a copy of the court order authorizing ENA to enter into GISB's and transactions . Does such a thing exist that we can send to Sempra ? Thanks
Necessary items for the baby are down below with blue web links .
I don't know if I sent you guys this small humble list of things the baby will need . Its down below with blue web links .
I'm waiting to hear from Rita . I'll definitely let you know what happens . thanks .
Sure . I'll have Ingy wash and polish it first .
YES . I think we spent an hour and half at ? ?babie r us on hwy 59 sunday . Didn't know if i was going to survive .
Give me your fax number and I'll fax it over . Doug Sewell said he would not pay for it as ENA and I don't know enough about the deal to argue with him . I've pasted in Richard's response is in black below .
Kay , ENA has a user ID on a system called Pegasys . Peoples Gas invoices ENA about $400.00 a month for a License Fee , Customer Service Charge , and taxes and it looks like we have not paid this bill for the last 3 months . In the pre-petition world , we used this ID to do nominations on the Peoples Gas system . We are not currently using this ID and it looks like we no longer need an ID for this system . BUT , Kevin Brady , an ENA scheduler , uses an Enovate and EMW LLC id to do nominations for those companies . Enovate is paying the invoices for those companies . Can we cancel this ID , or should we just tell Peoples we are not going to pay the invoice and let them terminate the ID at their discretion ? Will not paying the ENA invoice impact EMW LLC or Enovate in any way ?
Prepay amount for tomorrow is $25,000.00 . Thanks Team .
I hope you are getting somewhere because this is getting annoying . First he wouldn't send me anything , now they are all over it when he should have just sent me something to begin with .
I need steve's email address . Do you have it ?
I've never talked to Ed about any of this . I just sent him this email the day you and I spoke . You might forward this on to him with your comments .
Ask Marvin or whoever looks at Tenn if they are interested in any Iroq / Tenn capacity . The capacity goes from Tcpl/Iroq - Wadd to Iroq/Tenn - Wright , then from Iroq/Tenn - Wright to Mendon and Boston Gas citygate .
I need to go get a beer with Jim for a little while . Is that ok ?

Hey team . ENA should be wiring Reliant $25,000.00 today . I will be out tomorrow and Christina Sanchez ( 713-345-7791 ) will be backing me up . Christina , tomorrow morning , call Jim Taylor ( 713-207-1482 ) by 9:00 AM and let him know if we are taking the gas or not . If Jim isn't there , ask for the person trading Florida . Malory ( don't know her last name or her number ) has been backing Jim up this week . Reliant has the option of giving us the gas in Z2 or Z3 at a Z2 GD price . Jim will also let us take different volumes on different days over the weekend , even though it hasn't happened before . Have a good weekend !
nope
sorry , not till i hear from legal but we probably won't pay the invoice . as of right now , don't pay the invoice .
9:50 AM Per Tammi Depaolis ( 832-397-1728 ) at Sequent . Tammi spoke to Lisa Guthrie ( 205-325-3816 ) at Sonat to find out what flexibility Sequent would have taking out the parked gas . Lisa said she didn't know if Enron could sell the gas .
Mark , I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting . Here are some items to consider , 2 . Loan balance on deal #1424 ( 96,000 ) dth 4 . ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002 , I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not . Rita , Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002 . We have Dec 2001 . Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please ? Sonat may have stopped sending us statements , but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3 . Margaret , could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002 ? I would be very surprised if they did .
Mark is our "hired" special bankruptcy attorney who works on transportation and storage . Enron goes to him to get expertise on how to handle the pipeline contracts . Shemin Proctor is like an Enron staff attorney specializing in transport .
Hey buddy . I'm going to another meeting . Don't forget to send me the worksheet . Thanks
thx buddy
Thanks Max . Per our discussion today I requested 64,000 dth per day from Duke Energy LNG Sales , Inc . I spoke with Carl Haugneland and I faxed him a copy of the attached letter and excel worksheet . Joe , I am mailing a copy of the letter with attachments to you . Thanks .
Recommendation for ENA Pools 1st choice Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/3/01 , no cash flow and everything is pre-petition . 2nd choice Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/31/01 and deal with one month's cash flow 3rd choice Terminate pools as soon as possible to eliminate the administrative effort involved . I've been trying to determine the EES imbalances on Dominion and I'm not having much luck . Dominion gave me the ENA balances over the phone . When I called back a day later to get the EES balances , I was told to submit a written request to Bill Saviers , Dominion's in house counsel . I have not done that . I would prefer that Dominion provide us a written document stating what the pool balances are as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01 . Based on the pool balances below , I would recommend terminating the ENA pools effective 12/3/01 assuming the following . 1 . Producer payments for Oct and Nov have not been made and go into the pre-petition bucket . 2 . ENA owes Dominion gas which is also pre-petition . 3 . The producers will be able to reallocate their gas for December forward to another marketer's pool . Items to consider If we terminate the pools on 12/31/01 or later , ENA will need to sell the imbalance gas and pay the producers . Dominion will need to provide ENA a method to do this if the pools are terminated . I would recommend paying the producers after we collect the money for selling the imbalance gas AND after we pay Dominion any gathering/transporting charges associated with those balances . The volumes are small so ENA will not see much economic benefit from this process . Also , the administrative effort involved is VERY VERY HIGH due to the small volumes per producer . Dominion will prefer to cancel the pools with a 0 or positive imbalance . On 12/3/01 , ENA will still have a negative cumulative imbalance . Most of the producers have not been paid for Oct or Nov 2001 activity . I assume that since those dollars go into a pre-petition bucket that we should not terminate any producer contracts before 12/3/01 . 3/5/02 Per Vickie Coen at Dominion ENA Pool Balances as of Gath North 1,323 2,187 Tran North 0 0 Gath South ( 26,482 ) 31,583 Tran South 5,412 8,143 Dominion IF Prices

Excellent notes . Thanks
I'm estimating a $50,000 prepay to Reliant this Thursday . Cash is up $.20 from Friday . I may need to make the prepay on Wed again . I'll have a better idea after 9:00 AM tomorrow .
We are having dinner with Suzanne this Thur if that's ok with you . I think you and I should register at the hospital tonight or tomorrow night if possible .

i guess you don't have msm Messenger do you .
Hey there team . We are starting to focus on Dominion pipeline and I need your help explaining the process to Shemin . I would like to set up a meeting with Gloria , Wade , Shemin , Kathryn as soon as possible .
Sounds good . I believe Alain is out till Thur and I hope we meet before then .
Silly me . I goofed , I had the wrong beginning balance in my worksheet . Currently looking at sending out $30,000 on Thursday .
Thanks for the info . I'm looking for a Dominion/Escript ID and password next please .
Just put the survey on the fax .
I need to get copies of all the invoices for Dominion for ENA , VNG , and EES for Nov-01 through current please . thanks Fax 713-646
Thanks
Gloria is out sick but she's checking her voicemails . I'm meeting with Wade at his desk at 1:30 today and Gloria is going to call us . We should be able to figure out how the contracts work then Wade and I can meet with you this afternoon when you become available . I'm still waiting to hear from EES - no word at all .
Where are you located ? I'll come by to get them after I go to the credit union .
Max , I forgot all about you needing this . I'm working on it now and I'll highlight the items as I do it in case it takes a couple of days . This is what I have done so far .
This has not been a good informative day . We just need to chat with Dominion to figure out how the contracts work and for me to find out more info the storage contracts .
Elizabeth Hernandez is currently working as a contract employee for Sherry Thomas . Elizabeth told me her contract runs out at the end of this month . Kathy and I both loved working with her and think she would be a good employee to keep on the gas side if you have any spots available . Her last spot on the gas side was in deal validation .
I have a bill from Cingular Wireless in my iPayit account . I called Cingular and asked them when this bill was last paid . They said before Dec 2nd . I told them they should cancel the service . Don't know if they are going to do that or not . 8:25 am Per Lisa at Cingular WIreless , this account has been cancelled .
Another interesting item . Call me when you get a chance .
Prepay amount for tomorrow is $30,000.00 . I gave Doug the hard copy of the wire request . Thanks team .
I have requested a wire to Reliant for Thursday in the amount of $30,000.00 . Thanks .
My Tenn emails from way back .
I , of course MUST have my lunch hour . But after that is over , say 1:00 or so , lets get together . Shemin , you set the time . Wade , bring some of those letters you are talking about down below . Kathryn , we are going to discuss what you and I talked about yesterday . Can we just go back to ? ?Dec 2nd? ? and terminate the pools without Dominion billing Enron all these extra charges . You and Patricia can decide if you want to come . Thanks
Shemin , just give me a call when you are ready . I'll let Wade know and we will come to your office .
Cool .
actually , could you or Kathryn send Shemin 5 Dominion producer contracts . Just any 5 will do . She just wants to get a feel for what these contracts look like .
It's the first day of school in Houston and the teacher thought she'd get to know the kids by asking them their name and what their father does for a living . The first little girl says: "My name is Mary and my daddy is a postman." The next little boy says: "I'm Andy and my Dad is a mechanic." Then one little boy says: "My name is Jimmy and my father is a striptease dancer in a cabaret for gay men." The teacher gasps and quickly changes the subject , but later in the school yard the teacher approaches Jimmy privately and asks if it was really true that his Dad dances nude in a gay bar He blushed and said , "I'm sorry but my dad is an 1 ) auditor for Arthur Andersen OR 2 ) a trader for Enron and I was just too embarrassed to say so."
You may or may not be able to do anything about this but I've requested access to several different desk in Sitara and the people that approve these items all work for UBS . Now I'm trying to pull up a deal that was on the central desk (  I thought ) and its showing up as a west desk ticket and I can't access it . I thought I was the one that entered it in Sitara . Sitara deal #1198936 is an example . Can you help get me access ?
I never know what contract the deal is under but I can confirm the price and the volumes for the following; Deal Counterparty Comment 1192958 Sequent Energy Management , LP approved 1198866 Anadarko Energy Services Company approved 1195770 MidAmerican Energy Company approved 1195777 MidAmerican Energy Company Changed price from $2.05 to $2.02 in Sitara per notes from Sylvia Pollan . 1195767 MidAmerican Energy Company approved 1192959 City of Tallahassee this should be on deal #30534 - part of the long term contract . I don't have access to view the other deals but I'm working on it . I believe I entered the other 2 Anadarko deals in Sitara but either I put them on the wrong desk or they were moved after I entered them because I don't have access to them either . GRRRR . Scott , Margaret , I changed the price on deal 1195777 ( Feb 2002 activity ) from $2.05 to $2.02 . We prepaid MidAmerican $1,158,864.00 for all 3 deals shown above . Not sure who to tell about Sitara changes .
Just Wade and I chatting with Shemin . We tried calling Dominion's Bankruptcy counsel , outside counsel ( which is seperate) , and in house counsel and couldn't get anyone . I believe Shemin has a much better idea though . BUT , I think its important to note that those producer agreements are Enfolio contracts .
Sure . I have one gas purchase that I make right before 9:00 AM every morning but I can be there at 9:05 AM or later .
I have an event that I need to attend tomorrow afternoon so I will be taking the half a day off starting at lunchtime . I will send out a plan of action for Trunkline this afternoon . IF anyone needs me you can page me at 877-498-5497 BUT do not leave a voicemail , I don't know how to retrieve them .
I have confirm letters on my desk . Should I send those to you ?
I don't use the start menu to access my pipeline EBB which is what I think this is . But I do go to this website on the internet to access the Dominion EBB . Dominion used to be called CNG .
I can't believe it . I'm having the same trouble again this month . I use this board about twice a month .
Greg We've chatted before but you may not remember me . I'm currently working for the ENA Estate team and I need to purchase some Trunkline Ela gas for April . Ruth Concannon suggested that I contact you but she didn't have your number handy . I also have other buy/sells that come up from time to time as well . Please let me know if you would be interested in selling us gas . Thanks Chris L . Germany Manager , Gas Trading Phone 713-853-4743 Fax 713-646-3059
thx , looks like its working . it probably already worked . i just forgot to use the icon you set up for me . i'll send you another nasty email next month .
I think you will be happy with me . I believe I was able to release the capacity for April under offer #50169 .
I am releasing the Boston Gas capacity on Iroquois ( k#125008 ) and Tennessee ( k#29667 ) for April to Boston Gas . I am releasing the capacity prearranged , subject to bid , minimum bid of 100% of max rate with Boston Gas as the prearranged bidder . Bidding will end on Monday , March 25th . Submitted Iroq offer #50169 on 3/21/02 Submitted Tenn offer #29667-6 on 3/21/02
I will be available by 9:05 AM . I have to buy gas around 9 am every morning .
Ruth , use this as a starting point for the payment to Tennessee . Make sure you copy Magaret Dhont and Rita Wynne on this .
The CIA had an opening for an assassin . After all of the background checks , interviews , and testing were done there were three finalists...2 men and a woman . For the final test , the CIA agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun . "We must know that you will follow your instructions , no matter what the circumstances . Inside of this room , you will find your wife sitting in a chair . Kill her!!!" The man said , "You can't be serious . I could never shoot my wife." The agent said , "Then you are not the right man for this job." The second man was given the same instructions . He took the gun and went into the room . All was quiet for about 5 minutes . Then the man came out with tears in his eyes . "I tried , but I can't kill my wife." The agent said , "You don't have what it takes . Take your wife and go home." Finally , it was the woman's turn . She was given the same instructions , to kill her husband . She took the gun and went into the room . Shots were heard , one shot after another . They heard screaming , crashing , banging on the walls . After a few minutes , all was quiet . The door opened slowly and there stood the woman . She wiped the sweat from her brow and said , "This gun was loaded with blanks . I had to beat him to death with the chair." Moral: Women are evil . Don't mess with them .
Prepay for Dominion for April 2002 to be made on Friday , March 29th . I printed out the attached form and gave it to Doug Sewell .
I just deleted something you emailed me on March 20th or 21st . I think it might have been related to Columbia gas but I'm not sure .
Prepayment and gas flow activity through Monday March 26th . I have added 2 new members to the team , welcome Melissa and Sheeley . Feel free to hit Jim Taylor up for a free lunch .
Hey , do you mind if I send her an email with all the stuff attached ? You are my hero .
i took the test and this is what it said . colors green blue yello purple red black white orange You are a very sensitive person and you try hard ( perhaps a little too hard ) to make favourable impressions and to be recognised by your peers . But you have that inherent need to feel appreciated and admired and you are easily hurt if all of your endeavours go by unappreciated or not acknowledged . Stop trying so hard . You are very talented , imaginative and sensitive but you are holding back as you do not really like going it 'on your own' . In preference you would like to team up with someone , someone with similar attributes as your own , to explore - to seek out and go perhaps 'where no other man has trod before' . It is the unusual that attracts you and which will give you a sense of excitement and adventure . Everything seems to have gone wrong and the situation at this time is such that you are not quite sure which way to turn . So it would appear that you are 'holding back' , re-consolidating your position and relinquishing all fun and games for the time being . You are holding back . You need to find friends in whom you can trust and once they have proved themselves beyond all possible doubt you will be prepared to give them your all . The existing situation is not of your liking - you have an unsatisfied need for mental stimulation with others whose standards are as high as your own . Trying to control your instincts the way you do restricts your ability to open up to others and the way you feel at this time is suggestive of 'total surrender' . This is not to your liking as you consider such thoughts as weaknesses that need to be overcome . You feel that only by control , controlling your innermost thoughts , are you able to maintain your air of superiority . You want to be admired for yourself alone and not for what you can do or for what you may have done . In essence 'you need to be needed' and at the same time 'you need to need' . You need to be respected as an exceptional individual . This is the only way that you can hope to achieve the status that you wish to achieve . You set yourself very high standards - and come what may - you abide by them . Don't date or hook yourself up with a hussy . Just remember , no woman deserves you and they should all thank their lucky stars that you even ackknowledge them .
I mean Susan . I assume you are talking about Susan Pereira .
FYI , ENA has ( or had ) about 50,930 of primary receipts at Venice .
I'm not sure . 9:12 AM - I left a message for Brian Lamb at Columbia Gulf .
I will be increasing my prepays to Reliant this week to cover any swing activity on the MCV Trunkline deal . I have changed the "est cash flow" tab in the Tallahassee Swing Cash Flow file .
I still don't have access to West ( deal 1198936) . I'm almost positive I entered this deal and I thought I entered it as a Central Desk deal . When I book my deals on Trunkline for April , should I use Central ? We will be serving the Midland Cogeneration deal #340362 for April . I also didn't request access for ENA Upstream but Kathy Kelly should be able to take care of that .
Barbara was going to tell you that I called . I'm going to get my morning diet coke and I would like to see the name that lady gave us last night that might have some daycare info . later gator
Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production , Inc ( successor to Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp ) is supplying ENA 10,000 dth per day at a Florida Zone 1 . This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to The City of Tallahassee . I believe both deals go through March 2013 . I prepay Dominion for the supply each month . This morning , I had a voicemail from my contact at Dominion , David Walker ( 405-749-5240) . His voicemail stated that Dominion was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying any gas effective April 1 , 2002 . Paul Vrana ( 713-752-4514 ) with Jackson Walker is representing Dominion , he prepared the termination letter . Just spoke with Paul ( 10:55 AM ) - he has not spoken with anyone representing Enron but he has worked with Harlam Murphy? ? in the past . He will fax a letter to me . Kay , I will leave a copy of the letter in your chair .
I posted the April TW capacity . 11:50 AM left a voicemail for Russell Williamson at BP Amoco 11:52 AM left a voicemail for Robert Eason at Burlington Julie Reames is on maternity leave for 12 weeks . 
3:30 at Ed's desk if fine . thanks
Conference room ECS04105 at 3:30 PM
Louis Dicarlo said you should chat with Sara Shackleton about the Dominion ISDA agreement . BUT you may already be doing that .
Done with these . Is there another list ? I can't remember .
You are my hero . I am going to have a 2 day backup plan just in case Dominion doesn't deliver any gas .
Will do . Thanks for the info .
Looks good to me . First word of second para - Ever or Even ?
I asked Kay Mann about that and she said that if we want the gas for April then we should continue with "business as normal" which means we pay for the whole month since that is what we've been doing . She felt that paying for the whole month was better than paying for just 5 days worth of gas . Ed , I gave this info to Doug before he went to the cash meeting . This was just in case you had the same question .
I wonder if HR changed this holiday schedule over the last couple of months ? Let's ask Kathy , she will know .
Should I cancel the wire that is scheduled to go out today ? It might be too late but I can check .
I want to cancel the wire to Dominion Oklahoma that was set to go out today and I'm going to revise the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant . The other wires to Reliant , the $701,760.00 and the $40,000.00 , are good to go . I will have this completed before lunch but I estimate that the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant will be revised to approximatly $995,000.00 . This net impact is an increase in cash outflows of $280,000.00 ( cancel the $646,860 and increase the $70,0000to $995,000) .
These are all the people I have been working with lately .
Thanks . You too! !
FYI
I can do it but I need to see the invoices in questions . Lee Ann , should we be updating Sitara with this info or do we just need to tell you ? Scott , I know last month Kim Olinger was running Sitara reports for ? flash ? maybe and trying to correct a few things . I'm not sure what the process is now . Should we continue updating Sitara for transport items ? By the way team , Scott is out till next week .
What is our Dominion status ?
You are a stud
I'm LOOOOOKING!!! !
I'm just glad you are working today . Makes me feel good .
Hey woman! ! How are things going ? Happy with the job ? Happy with the man ? Be carefull , something happened to my woman and she has a really big stomach .
Would you see if we sent out invoices our if someone at Enron requested that no invoices be sent out . Thanks
It looks like Cornerstone Propane , L.P . has not paid their December invoice for physical or financial . Is there anything going on with them that you guys are aware of ?
ENA has an approximate cash balance of $58,000 with Reliant after purchasing the 2,000 dth for tomorrow . Melissa verifed receipt of the $1.7 million wire made last Thursday . THANKS MELISSA! ! Let me know if anyone has questions .
I'm not actively seeking another job and I believe I'll be here to collect that pot of gold next year . But , I still need a backup for the gas activity . Unless you tell me to do something different , I'm going to see if Kathy Kelly wants to back me up .
I sold 3,253 dth per day of Florida Zone 3 gas at $3.60 to Bob Crites ( 713-420-2499 ) at El Paso effective 4/3/02 - 4/30/02 . I'm leaving this deal out of Sitara because its an Enron Compressor Services deal , not ENA . Kay , I need to send a GISB agreement as Enron Compressor Services to El Paso . Would you work on that ? Mark , I'm not sure who at Enron to notify about this deal . You and I can chat about that later . I only asked for 2 bids for the April gas . Reliant showed me a bid of $3.58 and El Paso shoed me a bid of $3.60 .
I'll check on it .
No buddy . Thank you . And I'll take you off campus for lunch next week too . My treat . Maybe I'll invite my work wife , Judith . I'm thinking about Luling City Market on Richmond - BBQ Cafe Express on West Gray - great burgers Berryhill Taco's - Westheimer at Kirby Ryans Steakhouse - poor man's steakhouse and buffet off 290 outside the loop . I'll have to decide next week what I want to feed you . Of course you have a say , a small one anyway .
They are starting on the 4th . I thought I told him the 3rd but I may have made a mistake . My fault . Thanks
Probably not . I'll introduce myself to Theresa later this week .
Let me know if you get this . thanks
Beginning Wednesday , April 4th , El Paso will be taking 3,373 Dth per day from DRN #716 , contract #101067 . El Paso will scheduling the gas on contract #5207 . Thanks everyone . Chris L . Germany Manager , Gas Trading Phone 713-853-4743 Fax 713-646-3059
Got it . Thanks
Just a quick note on the information I've sent you . The following two lines deal with the activity I've been involved in since Dec 2 , 2001 . Some of my coworkers have said I should leave these lines out . What do you think ? ?  Buy and sale gas for the Enron Estate Team . ?  Provide commercial evaluations on post-petition deals to legal counsel . Also , I sit right in the middle of the pack so it is a little awkward to talk if everyone is here like they were yesterday . Thanks
I walked to the park yesterday and didn't see you . It was such a bummer . Today is Eirc's last day , sniff sniff . It was good seeing you . Take care .
Hey buddy , please include Kathy on you distribution in the future . thanks
I don't know if I should call this the Ponderosa Pine plant , the Cleburne Plant , or what . Think I'll refer to it as Cleburne . Sabra , Joe Parks told me that you handling Lone Start in the future . I sold 10,000 dth to TXU for tomorrow . I believe we have sold TXU 10,000 dth everyday this month so far . Lyn at TXU asked me if the gas was at the same point for tomorrow and I told her "sure" and I have no idea what points our gas is coming from . I don't know how much time we need to spend on this . But , I have not put anything in Sitara and I don't know if I should . I believe Theresa Voss's ( on 3 in Enron Center South ) group is handling the accounting for this and I don't know what they need . I'm going to try and meet her today . Sabra , are you handling this ? Let me know . If you are , do you want/need/care if this is in Sitara and Unify ? I believe all of the activity for this deal flowed through ENA before bankruptcy . Now , I believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ENA a fee . Joe made it very clear that ENA is NOT supposed to send out an invoice .
Joe went to work for Bridgeline yesterday .
When she refinances , will your name be taken off the loan on the house ?
Our current cash balance after purchasing gas for the 4th is $43,350 . I've requested a prepayment of $37,000 to be wired tomorrow afternoon . Have a good day !
The prepay to Reliant for Thur April 4th is $37,000 . I left the Cash Request on Doug's desk .
You are my hero buddy . And you think I should get married ? FYI while everyone else has been stressed out about work , I've been focused ( VERY STRESSED OUT ) with more personal issues . Every time I ask for some kind of sign , someone comes along and tells me I should get married . Take care and best of luck to you and the family .
FYI , MCV swing activity on Trunkline , not ANR . Monday , March 19th was the last conversation we had with MCV regarding this swing gas .
I just spoke with Theresa Vos . She handles the accounting for these deals and she said they have to do everything outside the system because ENA is not collecting the slaes revenue or making the payments to the suppliers . Joe was very concerned about putting deals in Sitara because he was afraid that we might double bill TXU . There is also a problem with the Feb activity because TXU recorded all the activity as ENA activity instead of Ponderosa Pine activity . It also appears that TXU withholds payments for the smallest indiscretions in the billing too . We can chat about that next week . Sabra , do you know what points Apache/Cinergy and Williams is giving us the gas at ? I'd like to see that if possible . Thanks I'm taking off Friday .

Ruth , remember that moorning you "allegedly" called me from Shemin's office last week ? You said you were meeting with Shemin and wouldn't be in for awhile . I told you to ask Shemin "What the hell is going on with Dominion ? What's the latest?" . Well that's what this is . Never got me an answer on that now did you ? I'm betting you and Shemin were at the Waffle House smokin' cig's , drinking coffee , and eating hash browns that were "covered" with cheese and filled with "chunks" of ham Shemin , how about an update on Dominion ? What's the word ?
I sold 6,000 dth to TXU at $3.18 for tomorrow .
we have been selling txu 10,000 day on lone star since the 1st . for tomorrow we are selling them 6,000 instead of 10,000
I don't think I ever had the invoices . All I had were the statments showing the balance in the park and loans .
ship it to the plant
we've been trying to sell about 5000 of imbalance gas a day . lone star is aware of it and approves .
Susan , I got your email address from Scott Goodell . I hope things are going well for you and I don't know if you are working or staying at home so this may be a non event . CMS Energy is trying to develop a presence in the North East . A headhunter set me up with an interview at CMS last Friday . I spoke with Curt Lizzi , Vice President of Wholesale Gas Trading . I don't know why he agreed to see me because 30 min into the interview he said I wasn't what he was looking for . He wants someone with contacts and cash trading experience . He said he hopes to be looking for someone like me in about a year . You just never know . His number is 713-230-7205 . Let me know how things are going . ME? ? just focused on living in sin with a pregnant girlfriend . later
This is the info I gave El Paso . Its probably ok to use this .
Melissa just confirmed that Reliant received ENA's wire last Thursday . Thanks Melissa . Tallahassee requested 0 volumes for tomorrow so our current cash balance is $66,270.00 . Thanks .
You were on the phone when I came by so I left the TXU shipper imbalance statement in your inbox this morning before lunch . This is for gas being delivered to the Cleburne plant .
I just got Iris's voicemail . She is on vacation until tomorrow . I'll give her a call in the morning .
David is going to send us an email with as much information that he can remember regarding the storage contract on Dominion , including any lawyers EES worked with back in December .

I can't find any of the reports that Kim Olinger used to run out of Unify . BUT , Jeanne Wukasch was in Kim's group and she would know how to run them . I believe they were called Service P&L reports . The only thing we would use them for now are transport demand charges .
Just the East for April please .
YOU BET I CAN! !
I'm all over it . Hopefully there will be naked women too! !
We are taking you fine young people to Lupe Tortillia's at 2414 Southwest Fwy ( between Shepherd and Kirby on the north side of hwy 59 . We would like to meet there at 6:00 PM . We will have Ingrid's cell phone and her number is 713-304-6254 .

Hey team . I changed the wire date to Friday and I updated the MTM value on the cash request . Ed signed the wire and its sitting on Doug's desk . Thanks .
I'm not aware of anything like that . I'll ask around .
Don't know about this but I am handling the activity for the Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners , Ltd . ( a.k.a . Cleburne Plant , a.k.a . Tenaska Power Partners ) on Lone Star Pipeline . We have a large imbalance on the transport contract that I'm slowly working off but that's about it . Are you guys aware of any storage ? I'm going to call Joe Parks later and see if he was working on anything related to storage other then Centana . I also have a contact at Lone Star that I could ask but I rather see if what we know form the inside first .
Do you see any payables to Elvis Energy ?
Call the hospital and see if you are registered please .

Our current cash balance with Reliant is $52,850.00 . We did not request any gas for tomorrow under the swing arrangements . I have requested a wire in the amount of $22,000.00 to be made on Friday April 12th . Melissa , I had to move the payment to Friday because some Enron "approval" people are out of the office but we have a large cash balance and it shouldn't be a problem if it gets delayed untill Monday . Also , Tiffanie Wheeler discovered an error in my worksheet that impacted the cash balance effective March 1st forward . My worksheet is set up so that any change in a volume or price for a prior month will change the current cash balance . I will keep track of all changes at the bottom of the Summary worksheet in this file .
When you get the price for the 10,000 dth we are selling you for Friday , would you send it via email . I forward that info to 3 different people . Thanks
Suzanne , give them Priscilla's number or my number . Priscilla is at 713-345-3736 and my number is 713-853-4743 . thanks
im an email mo fo . whatever that means
I'll be taking off the 1/2 day next Tuesday April 16th and all day next Friday April 19th unless someone has pressing needs . Kathy Kelly will be backing me up on all gas activity next Friday .
Phil and I were just looking at some of the invoices created for March activity and I noticed the sale to MidAmerican Energy was not in his stack of invoices to review . Would you see if we billed MidAmerican for March please ? The deal number is 1199439 , the volume is 310,000 dth and the price is $2.47 per dth . This was gas that the ENA Ontario desk had parked at Dawn . There are more notes at the bottom of this email .
You better believe it . I'll bring my photos for the "magazine" shoot .
Would you see if we sent out an invoice for deal 384258 to Tenaska IV Partners , Ltd . for December 2001 and January 2002 ? And if we did , did they pay it ? Thanks
Oh yeah , I'm looking good now . I found some 5 year old "Tan in a Can" and spread it all over . It caused a small rash in a couple of spots but I brushed those up in the photo .
How much should we sell for Sat - Mon ?
Thanks
Doesn't look like tickets were ever entered in the system . I've requested access to change the tickets . I'll send a new email once I enter the deal . Thanks Let me know if you see any other missing items too .
Judy is going to send you an email . I don't know what they changed to .
Who and where are they located ?
I think it needs to be pathed in Unify . Here's the problem . I created a sales deal ticket and Kim and I didn't know if the supply just needed to come from imbalance or if I needed to create a one sided exchange ticket . I have no idea how the ontario desk handled it in the past . They probably were not consistent any . Would you path this ? Just take you best shot on how to do it . I think we are going to have quite a few things like this . I'm trying to figure out how to put in a sales deal ticket for Jan 2002 on Montanna Power which is in the west .
I just created deal 1204869 per the notes in o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy/Storage Inventory/Daily Inventory Update.xls , an ENA sale to PanCanadian Energy Services Inc with the following details; Price: $2.25 Volume: 1,121,702 Location: MPC/Dry Creek Storage/2-02125-1 Rita , there is a storage contract 7010 in Unify for MPC . I assume this is the contract that needs to be pathed in Unify to withdraw the storage gas . Do you get any statements from MPC ?
I'll copy you , but it is Ponderosa sending out the bills correct ?

Watch him , he's sneaky . Just look at those beady eye's - just like an originator/car salesman . And you can tell him I said so . lynn8464 ( 11:10:17 AM): where does he work here ?

Did you listen to the retention talk first or were you already out the door mentally ? I wanna do lunch with you . When can you pencil me in ? I'm out next Friday and half of next Tuesday .

No flying , my brother and I have a pontoon boat . It has a potty on so I think it will work . Next Wed it is .
Good morning ! Would you let me know if you received a wire from Enron on Friday april 12th please ? The amount was $22,000.00 . Thanks
Looks like a pain in the ass girl . Let's see , that would make 2 in my household .
Hi Jon . We just spoke on the phone and I work with Ruth Concannon and Maria Garza on the Enron Estate Team . I'm trying to calculate the demand charge on the following capacity release Offer #20275 Released to Enserco Term 4/8/02 to 4/30/02 demand rate $1.30 Please call me when you get a chance at 713-853-4743 .
Priscilla said Mid American just called her and said they won't pay us until they receive an invoice . Have you pathed this yet ? Let me know .
Leon Payne , Ingrid's boss at Transco is resigning for personal reasons . That kind of came as a surprise to everyone over there . They supposedly have a reorg thing going on over there too . Don't know if that's it or not . The lease at the tower is up ? next year ? I think . The new CEO said staying in the tower is their first choice but they want to lease 20 floors instead of 40 . If that doesn't work , then they may move West to Beltway 8 somewhere .
FYI
Melissa verified our payment on Friday so that makes our estimated current cash balance is $61,790.00 after purchasing gas for tomorrow .
Jon asked some lady to call me back and she didn't know either . At first she did it the way you show it on your worksheet . Then when I told her that normal demand charges (  a 1 year deal at max for example ) are the same each month regardless of how many days there are in the month she got confused . I guess we will find out when we get the invoice .

Don't lie to me . I know you didn't read the "fine print" where you are taking everyone in your shop out for a free lunch .
does that mean we don't have to count half day tomorrow or all day Friday then I'm even ?

Max , would you call Tiffanie Wheeler at Reliant to discuss the volume discrepancy on 2/27/02 . Her number is 713-207-6790 . I believe she said that if we provide them with pipeline support from Tallahassee , they will adjust our bill . Thanks . Keep me posted .
Deal Counter party Sitara Contract Comment 942720 California Energy Hub , SOCAL 96063621 this is an exchange deal . California Energy Hub is not listed on the Master Letter Log . Socal is but there are no contract numbers listed . The hedge on this deal was killed in Sitara on 1/8/02 . The March invoice is for demand charges of $.10 x 310,000 dth per day , which may be incorrect . Its possible that the volume should be 310,000 dth per MONTH . 773141 Central Illinois Light Company 96000389 No changes made to Sitara ticket since 5/4/01 . Per Master Letter Log - ENA cancelled the financial agreement due to Central's failure to pay . No reference is made to the physical deal . Per Sitara - this deal has a min and max volume . The March invoice is for demand charges of $.425 x 10,000 dth per day . 889014 Colorado Spring Utilities 96062701 No changes made to Sitara ticket since 6/29/01 . Per Master Letter Log - only activity with EPMI is listed , no mention of any contracts with ENA . The March invoice is for demand charges of $7,200.00 per month . 22109 Consolidated Edison Company of New York 96000908 Long term sale to ConEd on Tennessee pipeline . Not listed on the Master Letter Log . Per Sitara - the hedge in Sitara was killed on 11/26/01 . The March invoice is for demand charges of $101,339.35 which is a percentage of the Tenn Z1 and Z0 indexes . 1161432 Superior Natural Gas Company 96052897 Not listed on the Master Letter Log .

The March invoice is for the difference between the trigger price of $3.05 and Nx1 for March $2.388 = $.662 x 10,000 dth per day x 31 days . This deal probably should not be in Sitara . Its related to sales made by the Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners , Ltd . to TXU . This activity used to handled by the Texas Desk . If Feb 2002 , it was decided that all activity should flow through the partnership instead of ENA . I took all prices on this deal to 0 .
when does this thing go away ?
The baby would be automatically covered for up to 30 days . I would need to get a social security number and then file the paper work . Call 1-800-332-7979 for more information .
I'm out but Kathy is probably going to be the chief on this anyway and I would just be her backup . So you guys could probably meet without me . FYI , I'm out all day Friday too .
My fault , I didn't see the Wed . I admit it , I'm worthless .
I would like to RSVP for the Zippers concert at the Houston Hyatt Regency on Wed May 1 , 2002 .
Correct , I'm IN on Wed .
wooooooooohoooooooooooooo I'm all over it .

I hope I have the right email address . Let me know .
OK then . Don't forget about me . Someday you are going to want me working over there . I'm a jewel , and modest too .
Our current cash balance is $54,820.00 AND we are moving back to the old building today so I've decided to wait until Friday to send a wire . Thanks
No wire for tomorrow since we are moving . We will do a cash request tomorrow and send out a wire on Friday .
We are still meeting for beverages this evening around 6ish , correct ?
I didn't call to check on this but I've never seen an email like this from CGAS . I just thought it was interesting .
we knew we were moving yesterday but we though we would have our systems availabe till after lunch . I was wrong . We were working at 9:45 , I stood up for something and the movers took my chair . We had just lost our phones at that time too .
hey what does xoxo mean ?
I am requesting a prepayment of $17,000 to be paid to Reliant for Friday April 18th . Priscilla , let me know when you have the wire ready and I'll come get it OR you can leave it on my desk at ECN0604c . Doug , are you still on 4 in the new building?:
not unless EES had some TCO storage we were not aware of . They would be doing something with 620,000 if they were fooling with our stuff .
yes i did . Friday April 19th . Well their we go , I've made my 1(00,000 ) mistake for the year and I'm all out . Nothin' but perfection from now on .
I just got a call from Kevin Hyatt , Director of Marketing at TW . He said that Sempra just called him and wanted to know why WE locked the points on the contract in our posting . I told him we locked them because we didn't want to get billed a potentially higher rate . 1 ) This guy acted like he knew me and of course I was embarrassed so I acted like I knew him , AND I DON'T EVER REMEMBER TALKING TO THIS GUY . He knew that I had gone to EES and that was back in 1997-1998 . 2 ) Sempra told Kevin that we would get more value if we let someone change the points . I wonder , even though we might get billed max rate , would it be possible to allow the replacement shipper to change the points for "the term of the release only AND the releasing shipper would be billed more that max rate" and that way the capacity would go back to its original contract points in October . Just a thought .
I think I have access to everything now . thanks
My bunkmate , Troy , would like to speak to your cleaing person . He's thinking about hiring someone to clean his apartment . What do you think ?
Larry and I have wires request for you and we don't know where you sit now . Where are you ?
Ed was questioning the value of the Tallahasse deal due to the higher prices . He said we should check into it . I guess it doesn't matter now with the screen back down .
I'm out tomorrow and Kathy Kelly will be backing me up . Instructions for Kathy 1 . Call Mike to find out how much to sell for Sat-Mon . Mike's number 248-813-1063 Mike's cell number 248-345-4002 2 . Call Sabra Dinari or Jackie Adams at Cinergy and find out if the gas is coming in at the following 2 points . Meter #17-1436-00 Conger 10,000 dth per day Jackie Adams number is 713-393-6889 3 . Sell gas to TXU Energy . Either Lynn Handlin at 214-875-9789 or Fran Russell at 214-875-9793 . I believe Fran will be handling the TXU activity tomorrow . I let TXU pick the points they want the gas . Thx , call me on my cell if you have questions .
Deal 1035543 , a sale to Giant Refining Company , was terminated effective 12/1/01 . It looks like the Trk Nom and Schd volumes should be taken out .
PNM Gas Services was terminated on 12/7/01 . Same as the previous email where there are Trk Nom and Schd volumes in Unify but nothing in Sitara .
I've requested a $17,000.00 wire to be made tomorrow and we still have a cash balance of $54,820.00 . I'll be out of the office tomorrow so Kathy Kelly will be handling our activity . Her number is 713-853-5858 . Thanks and have a good weekend .
Kathy , we have a deal on Trunkline where Midland can request up to an additional 1,700 per day and it could be just 1 day over the weekend too . Reliant has storage that can flow into Trunkline Wla . We don't have a pricing mechanism in place so its pretty much automatic and Reliant can bill us whatever they want . If it ever happens on the weekend , Jim and I will discuss the pricing the following Monday . Its only happened once in the last 2 months but YOU NEVER KNOW , especially if it happens on the weekend . If I remember correctly , Midland would call Kevin and Kevin would call Reliant . Are we sill set up that way ?
These are funny . I thought it might be enron photos at first .
Good Morning ! I love taking Fridays off . I see Kathy sold 10,000 dth for the weekend . Let me know what you want to sell for tomorrow . If I don't hear from you by 8:00 AM C.T . I'll just sell 10,000 dth . thanks
Thanks for the info . I voted to get that sucker lowered to 45 and 10,000 of my closest friends are doing the same thing .
Kathy said some Mobil traders created National Energy And Trade after Mobil let go of a bunch of people . I guess you know that both Molly and Chris worked for Mobil . By the way I did the math on Sabra .
Rita , I am mailing you the original Columbia Gas invoices for Feb and Mar and a copy of what I have for December . I don't have the January invoices and I have requested a copy from Jeanne Adkins assistant at Columbia Gas . I will also ask to have these sent to your attention in the future . I gave Maria a copy of everything I'm mailing to you . Thanks
sounds good to me
Sold 10,000 dth of Conger to TXU for 4/23 at $3.37 Our scheduler , Sabra Dinari , quit on Friday so I will be handling the noms for awhile and Kathy Kelly will . I think its easier for me to do the noms on this since I'm selling point specific gas and we are not putting this activity in Sitar/Unify . Theresa , looks like I will be the one addressing the accounting questions .
I had the time of my life . My only regret was not being able to spend more time with you . thx for the invite . i think my happy hour days are almost over .
did you count the half day on 4/16 or all day on 4/19 or should we leave these as unofficial time ?
Melissa Garner verified receipt of the $17,000.00 wire last Friday . Thanks Melissa . Our current cash balance with Reliant is $57,180.00 after purchasing gas for tomorrow . Thanks .
yeah i know . i'm looking at that now .
I'm moving my cash payment to Reliant to Friday . Phil is going to give me new market values for Tallahassee and Midland tomorrow morning .
MCV faxed their May 2002 requirements to Kevin Brady . MCV is requesting 6,800 dth per day on Trunkline ( MCV I deal ) and 15,000 dth per day on Trunkline , ANR , and Panhandle ( MCV II deal) . I assume we are still physically serving the MCV I deal for 6,800 dth for May 2002 . Please let me know . Does anyone need to see the notices from MCV ? I am going to send a copy for Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan and put a copy in our contract files here .
you know the talking part is hard because its so quiet here and i know some people just listen to other folks conversation to see whats going on . it makes it a little harder to chat and I'm kinda self conscious about it . i don't know why it seems so awkward here and not in the other building . oh well , YOU ARE MY HONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
What is the status of the Dominion issue ? Thanks
I am doing the noms on this one .
Just faxed them .

Let Kevin know about any suspected unpathed deals and he will get all over it . This guy is going to be my boss someday .
Rita FYI - I told Ed that I would go with Bridgeline's number because 1 . it is more conservative 2 . the difference is small 3 . that some trader may not have put in a deal or volume management didn't path the deals correctly....anything is possible with the turnover we have had . If you have reconciled the numbers and know where the difference is let me know . Thanks
this is what I expect to be paid out next Tuesday I'm buying all the baseload gas from Reliant I will probably pay NX1 + . 05 or so for the Tallahassee gas because I'm buying point specific gas and NX1 flat to -.02 for the Trunkline . I would prefer to be conservative so bump the prices up as you see fit .
I wonder if that bigger volume is a gigajoule thing ?
take me with you where ever you go . You de MAN
do you have sabra's cell number ?
filled internally with some guy whose name i can't remember , it was a southeast orig spot . i went to lunch with jim taylor and malory ? ??? , she knows you . she is from coastal
Please read the note below from Jeff at Lone Star , it looks like we may need to be particular for May . Of cause that would involve me knowing a little more about the pipeline .
Kevin is my hero .
Sold 10,.000 dth of Conger gas to TXU for 4/25 at $3.29
I decided to wait until tomorrow to do the prepay to go out Monday . Margaret , for some reason my cash request form has Susan Helton's name on it and she has to sigh the wire I think . Why wouldn't that be you instead ? [Germany , Chris]
Susan just called me and said she is the CAO for ENA and she should be the one to sign off on the wire requests . I didn't know .
Yesterday David Drapper ( sits a few rows over from us and works for EES ) asked me what the status was with the Dominion producers . I told him we were still waiting for Dominion to call us back . He said that Sean Holmes told them to "just pay the producers" . I told David that I wouldn't do anything without knowing what Ruth and legal are doing . Sounds like a little tendency to "split up" . Just like the old days .
Thanks
Do my prepays to Reliant for gas fall under your exception comment below even though they are not same day payments ? I can prepare my weekly cash request for swing gas with 2 days notice . I will just need to maintain a bigger cash balance with Reliant - probably about $20,000 more than what I've been keeping . Let me know what your preference is . I have 2 important payments ( estimate of $2.1 mill ) going out next Tuesday that are on Phil's Cash Forecast worksheet but I won't know the price until late Friday afternoon - usually this only happens during bid week and I hope this qualifies as an exception ( let me know about this one too) . I actually prefer to see the price in print the day after NYMEX rolls off . I will also be hounding you several times next Tuesday afternoon just to make sure these payments go out on time .
I am requesting a prepayment of $45,000 to be paid to Reliant for Monday April 29th . Priscilla , please bring me the wire request and I will get Ed and Susan to sign off on it . Stephen , Drew , who should I give the wire too and where are you located ? Thanks
Sold 10,000 dth of Conger gas to TXU for 4/26//02 at $3.24 Also received a call from Jeff at Lone Star telling us to work a little harder at working off the imbalance .
nope , i think it looks real good with burns like that . but when you see a low day come in we should probably sell a littel more for the next day .
Insurance Trina need to contact them within 45 days of birth , qualifies as a life event and its effective the date of birth my flex dollars received will increase from $164.29 to $182.67 My current flex dollar expense will go from $103.62 to $165.22 with Immer's kid .
Scorpion King , The PG-13 1 hr . 29 min .
Priscilla won't talk to me but this is what I think she billed Mid American Priscilla , do we know who at Enron will pay the Goods and Services Tax ?
Melissa , I requested a prepament of $45,000.00 to be wire on Monday . On Tuesday you will receive our prepayment for the 2 baseload deals we did for May 2002 , about $2.1 million or so , depending on where NX1 settles at today . Our current cash balance for the swing gas is about $43,200.00 after making purchases for the weekend . Thanks
You bet .
NOW THAT's WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR!!! ! Thanks Drew . Ok , no more bad talk about Drew for the rest of the week . Is today Friday ? just kidding
yes maam . GOOD LUCK! !
Jackie , just wanted to let you know that there is some work on the pipeline in May . I'm not sure of the impact just yet but either I or Kathy Kelly will keep you posted . Thanks .
U are here!!! ! LUcky me .
Cute little bugger . Scott Goodell said forget the Salt Lake City thing . He said Suzanne is paving the way for him with Michael Cathey . I don't know him .
OK , that's it . NO VACATION FOR YOU !
FYI I just checked the Tenn EBB and it does not appear that Boston Gas is releasing the Net 284 space to anyone . I also just got off the phone with Ivy at Iroquois , she is the capacity release lady . She said she didn't think that Boston Gas has been using this space at all .
I just spoke with Janelle Shaunghnessy ( 517-768-2076 ) at CMS Marketing regarding our March 2002 production invoice to them . The invoice is for the 50,000 dth per day of Michcon Storage gas that we were selling CMS . The total amount is $3,695,975.00 . According to Janelle she has not received the invoice yet so I just faxed it to her at 517-768-2110 . She said that they should be able to make the payment tomorrow . 1:28 PM , I just confirmed that Janelle received the faxed invoice .
I don't know if you guys can pull up my file from the previous email . Here it is again just in case .
Hey you . Two changes for me . Home number is 713-527-0534 Mobile is 713-557-5095 thanks , pretty email too .
Who did you talk to ?
Buddy!! ! I'm still here and stll kicking . You know I have a baby on the way . Its due May 7th . My woman is getting BIG! ! GOOD LORD! ! Enron is still going strong . Looks like I'll be here for at least a year but you never know . I bet you guys miss me too , calling up , asking dumb questions , falling off horses at the shipper meeting . How's life for you ?
Lets see if this works . My response is down below in blue .
Vince Hawkes is faxing Justin Fernandez a daily generation and gas plan sheet . Kevin Brady is in the group that Justin was in before he left and Kevin is delivering this report to me everyday . Is this something that we should continue to get ?
that sounds good to me , unless i hear from you in 30 min or so i'll toss what we have from them .
consider it tossed
I don't see you on MSN . My time free's up after 9:00 in the morning . Tallahassee has to call on the swing gas by then .
4/30/02 8:25 AM - Janelle said they would send the money today .
Melissa verified receipt of our $45,000.00 wire yesterday . Thanks Melissa . You should receive the following wires today . Our current swing gas cash balance is $81,700.00 so we may not send another wire until next week . Also , Robin Barbe will be my backup when I'm out . Her number is 713-853-7177 . Thanks
Scroll down and look at the list of names .
Jared Kaiser at UBS said we should speak with Roger McDonald at Tallahassee and that Pam McCullers ( my contact ) would be able to give us his number . I just left a voicemail for Pam McCullers - asking for Roger's phone number and title .
Harry , I think we finally have everything done on our side . Would you give me your phone number and address and we will mail you the GISB . Thanks
Contact info at El Paso
I just briefly told Ed what you and I discussed . He doesn't seem to want any additional info . I'll keep my notes of our conversation anyway . thanks
Sold TXU 10,000 dth of Cayanosa for 5/1/02 at $3.45 . I actually sold TXU the gas yesterday and I didn't want to change the volumes for the 1st . Let me know if you want to sell more than 10,000 for the 2nd . Thanks
Would you let Phil and I know when you hear abuot CMS's payment please ? thanks
I've adjusted out weekly prepay to reliant down to $10,000.00 to go out on Friday . I want Robin to go through the wire process once just in case I'm not here next week .
FYI , just verified with Melissa that Reliant received $2,049,602.20 for the items listed below . Thanks Melissa .
Thanks
Robin confirmed that we did receive the payment from CMS . This is the amount we invoiced CMS or the Michcon storage gas . Thanks Robin !
To my knowledge that capacity is still valid . It's one of Connie Moody's leftover contracts for 117 dth . Ruth , I had asked George Linder ? at Nat Fule about Nat Fuel taking this capacity back or at least including it in an open season several times . He never did anything with it .
I am requesting a prepayment of $10,000.00 to be paid to Reliant for Friday May 3rd .
April prices Inside Ferc Per Midland ANR LA 3.31 3.3125 Looks good Pepl 3.29 3.3345 appears high by about $.0245 but not way off . Trk Tx 3.28 3.28 Trunkline should be an average but this is great , our price would have been $3.305
Please add Robin Barbe to your distribution . Robin , I glance at Phil's worksheet everyday since I generate most of the cash payments in our group .
You should have the email below in your inbox talking about the producers on CGAS . Reply to the email below once you find out if you are able to use the producer's gas without maintaining a balance .

Hey , I normally talk bad about you but lately I've been bragging because of your good notes on Ponderosa Pines .
But I'm going to try and keep it down to minimum .
One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well . The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do . Finally he decided the animal was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway . It just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey . He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him . They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well . At first , the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly . Then , to everyone's amazement , he quieted down . A few shovel loads later , the farmer finally looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw . With every shovel of dirt that hit his back , the donkey was doing something amazing . He would shake it off and take a step up . As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal , he would shake it off and take a step up . Pretty soon , everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and trotted off ! Now , the Moral of the Story: Life is going to shovel dirt on you , all kinds of dirt . The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up . Each of our troubles is a stepping stone . We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping , never giving up ! Shake it off and take a step up ! Remember the five simple rules to be happy: 1 . Free your heart from hatred . 2 . Free your mind from worries . 3 . Live simply . 4 . Give more . 5 . Expect less . P.S.: The donkey later came back and kicked THE SHIT out of the bastard that tried burying him . Moral: When you try to cover your ass , it always comes back to get you .
I also have imbalance statements that I have received in the mail that I will be sending to Theresa .
I would bump up the cash payment to Reliant for next week . I'm estimating $56,000.00 . I do expect it to come down some .
Reliant should receive a payment of $10,000.00 today which will give us a cash balance of $60,820.00 . Have a good weekend .
Nosir . You are the man working on this FREAKY pipe .
I'm good for $3
The name sounds familiar but I don't know this guy . He's over scheduling at El Paso . Greg Stickline 713-420-6463 . Good luck and let me know how it turns out .
Shelley verified receipt of our $10,000.00 payment o Reliant last Friday . Thanks Shelley . Our current cash balance with Reliant is $60,880.00 .
I was just looking at the confirm for April and I believe the pricing doesn't match up . Let me know if you have any questions . Thanks .
I'm forcasting $30,000.00 to be paid to Reliant this Friday for the Tallahassee deal .
For gas day 5/7/02 , Cinergy/Apache moved 10,000 dth from Sid Rich Cayanosa to Oasis Mi Vida . Oasis Mi Vida is not a Lone Star point but I didn't know it at the time and I sold the gas to TXU at $3.20 . No sales were made for 5/8/02 .
thanks
Mike , I'm faxing you official statements from the pipeline and I'm going to mail them to Theresa Vos .
Let's see if this works .
Let's try again .
I have a problem keeping my cell phone battery charged up . But , my pager still works so I'm wearing it if you guys need me . My pager number is 877-498-5497 . Do not leave a voice message on it because I can't retrieve those . Thanks
I have the gas Sales Invoice List Report that you just gave Phil , I think . Would it be possible to format this with the deal numbers , or give me the invoices so I can see the deal numbers ? Thanks
Actually , I need all of them because I can't tell what these items are for . I will highlight the items that I think need to go out and put this report on your desk , can't be that many of them . But I would still need the invoices to see what these items are for .
When: Thursday , May 09 , 2002 11:00 AM-12:00 PM ( GMT-06:00 ) Central Time ( US & Canada) .
this is looking good .
Just checking to see if things are going back to normal for Friday , the 10th . I would like to start selling our imbalance gas again on Sat if possible . Thanks .
i don't have it . I think Max Doner gets a copy from someone but I'm not sure who .
2701 Revere St . #221 Phone 713-527-0534
I didn't send this yet and I have not spoken with Cinergy either . Would you call Jackie at Cinergy please . Also , the scheduling contact at TXU is David Avila , his number is 214-875-9792 , his aol id is avila4404 . I gave David the upstream information . He said that for the weekend the downstream k# is 1901 .
Just all outstanding unpaid amounts . it mite be easier for me to just go through the file and not worry about the copies since we are on the same floor . I just need you to tell me what is outstandind and what isn't .
does this mean the system was keeping track of my unofficial vacation ?
Hey , I hope the web link above works . It takes forever to respond when I log into Enron's email and hit reply .
i'm working thru my 188 emails , would you see if there are any invoice drafts for april 2002 for midland cogen please
thanks buddy

Midland sent their volume request to Kevin Brady for the month of June 2002 . Should I forward this to Oxy ? Should I tell Midland to contact Oxy in the future ?
Here is my little angel . The first web site is my aol homepage and some people have a hard time pulling this one up .
Should I go in and fill this out or is it to late for our group ?
I'm going home for lunch every day for at least the next week or so . Ingy had a c section and there was a problem with part of it . I have to doctor it twice a day . I'll try to get pictures of that for you . yech!! ! uhhh , it has brought us closer
sold 10,000 for 5/24 at gas daily waha - $.05 which is $3.035
Just making sure eveyone gets this .
Hey team! ! I'm back . And while I was gone it looks like our cash balance with Reliant is $228,419.05 , which is due to ENA selling Reliant the gas back on Trunkline from the 14th through the 20th . Jim , I've updated my schedule for the gas flows on Florida . Tallahassee sent me a schedule of what they show . I'l like to compare that to what you have .
very good and tastefull
Hey , I live like that .
I have some really bad news . My little girl , when she makes a frown face , she looks just like her Uncle Jerry . I think that's a very bad sign . She weighs 7 lbs 4 ozs as of today .
I see that Shemin is out until next week . Since you are becoming a law guru you might know the answer to this question . The following document is an order from the court . Does that mean it has been filed and is in effect now ?
Due to credit concerns , Carol and Bjorn would like to know all counter parties that we are currently buying or selling spot gas with . Ex: I've been buying gas from Reliant Energy Services , Inc . each month to serve one of my term markets . According to Bjorn , the Credit Committee will no longer approve of my prepayments to Reliant for base load supply .

A.K . is looking for the volumes and dollars on deals ENA has done since March 1 , 2002 . I would appreciate if everyone would look at my worksheet and let me know if you are aware of something I have not included . A.K . I just includes the spot deals that we have done to support term deals or to liquidate storage/park & loan positions that we have . As I said in my voicemail , you might also be looking for capacity release dollars as well .
Done .
Thanks! !

hey I'm sorry about your summer vacation not working out . it would have been cool to take all that time off but you wouldn't want to come back now would you ?
she is at superior , do you need her for something ? what are you doing ?
You sure are sweet! ! 2701 Revere St #221
HEY , we need PHOTO's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
Do these counterparties look familiar ? Call me when you get this please ? Thanks .
El Paso and Reliant don't have time to talk about right now but I'm also having a problem telling them about the deal because there are too many unknowns . It's not the same as selling parked gas on Sonat . Still working it though .
Is my buddy Robert Allwein working with you ? If so give him a big kiss and a hug from me .
I don't think the triggers are correct . Ed , this brings up a good question that may already be addressed . Both of the Midland deals still show up in the trading system . Should they be terminated effective 6/1/2002 ? One of the Midland deals ( MCV 2 , deals #340305 and 332163 ) was put in Sitara with triggers . We stopped serving MCV 2 effective 4/1/2002 . These triggers will continue to create an invoice each month unless we change the deal in Sitara .
BETH!! ! Donna!! ! Welcome to the party ! Wade , I don't know how to handle these deals in Sitara or Tagg but I bet someone on this distribution does . 1 . Does anyone have any idea on how to stop deals 340305 and 332163 from creating an invoice each month ? 2 . There are deal volumes in Sitara for the East , Central and West desk . Should these volumes be zeroed out or should we just focus on keeping tagg updated and not worry about Sitara ? Maybe someone is working on the Sitara deal volumes .

I guess you don't have pictures for me do you ? I saw Traci Wood Tuesday evening at a little resteraunt on Westheimer called Paulie's . Do you care ?
I am a proud papa ! She's so cute too ! What are you doing in CT ? I thougt you were in CA ? Things are going ok for me . Me and my "Woman" ( we are not married - yet ) are living in an apartment near Kirby and Westheimer . I'm tired all the time anymore - not from staying up with the baby , that's woman's work .

We are going to send them and invoice for $156,000 for sales ENA made to Reliant . That will leave me with about $71,000 and maybe we can do something to work it off . Cinergy will not trade with Enron . Robin Barbe's contact told her they would not trade with us regardless .
Hey buddy . You gave us the info for NNG , any luck with the SCAL and PGEN volumes ?
Actually I am . The little woman and the little bundle of joy both sleep in the other room . Makes it easy for me . My woman is trying to breastfeed . I can't tell you how stressfull that has been . There needs to be a class for guys on how to best support their "Woman" after birth . Ahhh , my little bundle of joy is cute though . And her mom lives in town and spends a lot of time over at out place which works out great . We can go out for dinner pretty easy . A lot of people don't seem to have that . Judy said she would baby sit but it's not worth the trip to the edge of the earth in Katy .
I'm not sure what you mean by valid . We are not physically flowing any of this gas right now . There are some small Appalachian producers on here that are still up in the air but we will probably reject those contracts anyway .
Done . Kevin , I bet this will involve you doing some pathing in Unify .
These are the points we used for June and July 2001 to deliver gas on the Bridgeline FT contract . June 2001 delivery points . 1225454 BRLH/FGT ( COW ISLAND ) 69930 BRLH/FGT ( COW ISLAND ) 528099 BRLH/FGT ( COW ISLAND ) July 2001 delivery points 1742620 BRLH/FGT ( COW ISLAND )

are you on a conference call with ruth and mark ?
I just heard that Michelle Yee Lokay is leaving TW for Cook Inlet in LA . I've never heard of her . How about you .
OK , I never get to talk to Ruth because SHE IS ALWAYS ON THE PHONE . And I bet she's on the phone with Shemin too!! ! Should we all get together and make a conference call to Dominion like we did before or should I just call Jeff Davis myself ? Our last call was Iris Kind , Bill Savier(sp?) , and Jeff Davis .

Hey team . I had every intention of being there this morning ( even though I was running late ) but my daughter was awake and I couldn't resist spending time with her . I'll be there next week .
I am a proud papa . Tired but proud . What happened to all my spare time??? ? Here is a link to my homepage so you can see the little angle . Its and AOL homepage and many folks have a hard time seeing the photo's .
hey , i thought you were out of the office .
Fred , let me know if you get this . thanks
I'm working on my contact list . It looks like I'll have better luck after lunch . FP&L asked me to call back after lunch . Judy said that Scott Neal just doesn't want to talk about it till after trading . Interesting note ( and I'm keeping track of my notes ) AEP will not buy gas from Enron . I spoke to Elsa Villarreal ( works for Houston Pipeline) . She called Todd Lambert in her Columbus office and Todd told Elsa that AEP will not buy gas from Enron . I'll keep you guys posted on my Bridgeline notes through out the day .
I've heard that there may be some job opportunities with Transwestern Pipeline . They recently had an employee leave their marketing department . I would like to talk to Kevin Hyatt and at least let him know that I may be interested in any future opportunities . Would that be ok with you ?
Max , would you provide Phl with the amount of money we expect to receive for the Tallahassee swing gas for May please ? Thanks . Also , let Phil know if there are any reductions on the baseload amounts too . thanks
I am requesting a payment to Dominion Oklahoma ( aka Louis Dreyfus ) in the amount of $10,334.67 . This payment is for gas that flowed in Feb 2002 to the City Of Tallahassee . According to Max Doner , ENA billed Tallahassee for the incremental volumes and Tallahassee paid for the gas . Doug , Drew , I am requesting the payment to be made on Monday , June 17th . I will get the wire request from settlements , attach the supporting documents , get Ed's signature , and leave it with Susan . I assume Susan will pass it on to one of you after she approves it . Is that how the process works these days ?
I see job #1154 ( Origination - Wholesale ) on the job posting board . I am going to apply for it online ( hopefully today) . I thought you said yesterday that there are two postings for your area . Do you know if it has been posted yet or are you using job #1154 to fill both positions ? Thanks .
We are double checking your work and this is what I have on my swing worksheet . Day May Volume GD GD +.10 Amount I'm using the Zone 2 gas daily . Are you using a different gas daily ? Let me know where the differences are . Also , would you let me know what days we did not get the baseload gas please .
I misunderstood . I thought it was ok to pay based on my email from last week . My contact at LD ( David Walker ) asked me about this amount last week . He didn't mention any other outstanding items .
PG&E may have some scheduling jobs open in Bethesda , Maryland ( just outside of DC) . Send your resume to this person and mention my name if you are interested . Joni Veselack Phone 301-280-5277
I leaving for the day . I'm going to drop by Shemin's office ( if I can remember which one it is ) and leave what I have on the contracts . It's slow going because it takes a long time for the contracts to pop up on the screen .
I applied for the Origination - Wholesale position , job #1154 on the job posting board . I would like to have the attached resume sent to the hiring manager as well please . Please let me know if you have any comments or questions . Thanks
I believe our new Tennessee rep is Sherry Glazebrook at 832-676-2635 . If she's no longer there then call Andy Armstrong in the bid room and he will find out who our rep is . His number is 832-676-5120 . Anyone that answers the phone in the bid room should be able to tell us how our rep is . Our rep at Iroquois is Robin Zaleski at 203-925-7274 .
I spoke with Steve Stonestreet at Columbia Gas . He will do a conference call with us tomorrow . I told him it would probably be around our lunch time . He said that is fine . I can set up a time tomorrow . His boss , Jeanne Adkins , told him she doesn't need to be there if we are just talking about the mechanics of how the producer gas flows .
howdy
Chris Lee Germany Phone 713-853-4743
The two attachments show all the contracts that are active for ENA per Columbia's system effective 12/01/2001 and 06/01/2002 . This might be handy to have when we talk to Steve today . The file name tells you what effective date I used on the report . The effective date is also shown in the upper right part of the report as well . The column in the far left indicates which pipeline the contract is for; TCO is Columbia Gas and CGT is Columbia Gulf . The attachments below show all the active contracts for Columbia Energy Services ( CES ) and Columbia Gas Marketing ( CGM ) for the same time frame . ENA is agent for both of these companies .
Jeanne Adkins 304-357-2865 Jeanne's title is Manger and Steve's title is Lead Facilitator .
I would be a likely candidate . I checked my desk and I don't have it .
Ruth , I SEE YOU ON THE PHONE OVER THERE . Probably with Shemin too ! Shemin , I'm sending this to you company email and your Enron email . Do you use the Enron email system ? Wade said he just received a call from Gary Novenski ? at DRI . Gary was asking Wade if he had any new information . I'm waiting for Steve Stonestreet to call me back so I can learn how to run all of these reports . Wade is making copies of the reports he has to give to Ruth .
Could you get me the Inside Ferc file for June 2002 please ? Thanks

Bryant Baker at Bridgeline is asking me to approve this deal so Bridgeline can bill ENA for the storage service . Normally I wouldn't worry about it but since we are in negotiations with Bridgeline I'm not sure what to do . Is a confirm generated if I approve this ticket ? Also , when does this deal terminate in the global contracts system ?
WOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO , Daddy's getting a new Blue Wave Bay boat!!! ! WOOOHOOOO
ENA and Bridgeline use the same trading/accounting system , Sitara and Unify . In the good ol' days , the traders would enter the deals in Sitara ( which includes volume and pricing terms) . Accounting would use Unify to track the volumes and bill and pay our counter parties . Unify gets the pricing information from Sitara . Bryant Baker at Bridgeline is asking me to approve Sitara deal #1190691 . This deal shows Bridgeline Storage Company as the seller of storage service and Enron North American as the buyer . The demand charge on this deal is $313,500.00 . Bridgeline needs someone at ENA to approve this ticket so the Bridgeline system will be able to generate and invoice . Would this have any impact on our Bridgeline negotiations or our legal rights if I approve this ticket ? According to Cyndie in Global Contracts , this will not create a confirmation .
With a heavy hand I write this message to the Aquila Merchant Services people . As Bob mentioned in his earlier message we must now reduce our Wholesale Group to reflect that we , ILA , do not have the credit capacity to continue to support the needs of the business . Starting today we will begin to wind down our Commodity Services and CapitalServices groups , both in North America and in Europe , with the goal of being significantly out of all commercial operations by the end of the summer . Later today we will take the first step to reduce the headcount of the organization . For many of our fellow workers today will be the last day at Aquila . For those not released today , we will need to , as carefully and responsibly as possible , put our beloved company to bed . At the end of this process , the remaining employees , as is true with me , will be let go . No one is to blame , it is just an unfortunate reality we have found ourselves in , and we are left with this ugly choice . Please try to hold your head up , we have built a great company of talented , motivated , creative , and dedicated people . Hold on to your integrity , respect yourself and each other , and remember what a team we have had . Ed
In the past someone at Bridgeline would call someone at ENA or vice versa to approve the deal ticket so that the deal terms would populate the accounting system . Note: this would only happen with Brigdeline because it is and Enron affiliate and because we are using the same trading systems . Approving this ticket will give Bridgeline the ability to bill ENA . I think there might be another way to do this without someone at ENA approving a ticket . I'll see what I can do .
I'm keeping this file here ==> o:/gas structuring/bankruptcy folder/transportation/appalachain Producers
Hi team . Here is my new cell phone number , 832-867-3346 . I just changed it in People Finder so it may not show up until tomorrow .

Ed , per our discussion , an assistant from Shemin Proctor's Houston office is coming over tomorrow to help print contracts from live-link . She will be over around 11 AM . I am going to log into Julie Gomez's computer with my ID . Let me know if you have any comments / concerns . Thanks .
She is going to print all the Appalachian Producer contracts that she can pull up out of live-link from my master list . I also asked Melissa if she could help and she said she would be glad too . Let me know if that's ok .
Judy gave me these names of people that were cut . Keith Taylor Ken Nelson - i don't know him Brenda Crockett - judy's old roomate when she first moved to houston and i know that jim barker was let go . he was from ees , he just went over in oct of last year i think
if the counterpart is in cash disbursements then yes , if its an accountant in an operational area then they should know what its for .
i would just call oxy and ask them . there's no sneaky stuff anymore and its not like we would send them their money back either .
You might like to get this .
good luck . when is comes to daycares . it probably good to look at quite a few to have a sense of what's out there . another place you could look is st . andrews presb . at buffalo speedway and bissonet . when i looked at that place it was for a three year old and it appeared very nurturing . it is or was an accredited facility . Barbe , Robin says: that facility really didn't have much of an academic program . at this age it doesn't matter but i nicer to have them in an environment that fits all needs now and later, . it better not to move kids alot . Barbe , Robin says: the lonestar pigging is tomorrow and i told kevin if something happens this afternoon to get with you
Ilene Leahey is going to help print contracts from live-link . She is from the local Andrews & Kurth office . I have set her up at Julie Gomez's desk and she is using my id to print contracts . She shouldn't need anything but if she does please help her . Thanks .
Do you ever talk to Bob . What is he doing ? I want to call and hassle him at home .
Thanks for the invoices and the Tidelanders Chorus info . You gave me Feb and Mar 2002 . Do you have the Dec 2001 and Jan 2002 invoices ?
Perfect . thanks
Call me ASAP please . My number is 713-853-4743
Works great . Thanks .
Quetion about March 2002 , it looks like the volumes used in the Payment file are the gross volumes from the CNR volume file , not the net volumes . Would you check on that please sir ? Thanks .
I see there are some processsing charges for CGAS and CNR . Who bills us for these charges ? I may need to add another column to my worksheet or at least at the payment amounts to the numbers .
Do you have the April CNR invoice file ?
I just found it . Sorry about that . I will probably be sending you several emails between now and Monday . Thanks .
I would prefer that you fix it . Just come over when you are ready . thanks

I will be taking a ( much ) later lunch today . I mean look at the time and I'm still here . And you all know how food pretty much ranks number one in my life too . Call me on my cell if you need me . 832-867-3346 . I'm not sure what time I'll be leaving .
Still looks like Columbia Gulf is selling Enron space .
You gave me 2 invoices for CNR that are not on your April 2002 payment worksheet . Producer Volume Amount Carol Littleton 748 $239.36 Should I toss these 2 invoices or should they be included in the list ?
There are some volumes without prices on the Dominion files . Can you tell me what these are ? Acct ID
Works for me . thanks
Yes I did but....we lost our list of who gave us what . All though its pretty easy to see who gave me the litte Duff with the black nose .
Just thought I would let you know that we have a prowler in our midst . I had about $30 worth of change ( loonies and twoonies ) taken from my desk drawer between Friday and this morning . Could have been the smed guys , the cleaning staff or the Easter bunny for all I know . Just thought I would mention it because Milly said he had the same thing happen to him last week . Chris
How about my RRSP contributions for this year ? Chris
The tag number on this deal is N67904.2 Please address all future deal inquiries of this nature to Scott Adams or Kathy Reeves . Thank you , Chris Dorland
Angela , I'll take the 2 tickets for Feb . 25 th vs . Phoenix Chris
If you find any fundamental problems with this model let me know .
Andrew , Nice to hear from you . Hope all is well in the UK . The millenium came and went and I think I had a good time . I understand MH has formally resigned his position at ML . Good for him . That is a shit business with no future . The broker is the buggy whip of the financial services industry . I have another friend moving to London soon so I have another reason to visit . I have to run but I'll keep in touch . Take care , Chris
Kramer , How are things going ? We are thinking of coming to SF on a golf / party trip sometime in the next few months . Things in Calgary are relatively unchanged . No chicks . Work is going great . Cowan and I are trading Alberta and having a great time . Poker and buying electronics have become the hobbies of choice around here . I am terrible at poker but good at buying electronics . Take it easy and w/b ,
Kramer , Cowan is trading Alberta cash and I'm trading the front of the curve . Lavo still trades the term in Alberta but is never around . As for Benny , after an unfortunate incident at September's craw fish boil , he has moved to Houston to trade power . No shit ! Drop me a line with a number where you can be reached . I have an idea , like everyone else in the world , for an internet start up and want to pick your brain about the process of doing a business plan , getting VC $'s and such . I don't know if you know much about that stuff but your thoughts would be greatly appreciated . I have a friend in the Internet group at Goldman Sach's and I've talked to him about it but I want insight from someone inside the industry . There is a revolution going on and I think I am the only one not getting rich off of it . Check out enron stock ( ENE) . We announced an alliance with Sun Microsystems to build a bandwidth network and the stock has doubled in a month . Not bad for a small Texas pipeline company . You would need a sand blaster to get the smile off of Lavorato's face . However I don't think I'm going to retire on my Enron options any time soon . Gotta hop ! ( PS You should send Wilson a Bigwords t-shirt . The Jannon's would do the logo justice. )
Hi Andrew ! How are things in London ? I am talking to MH right now and he says you are getting a little tired of school . I don't blame you one bit . I need a vacation . I bet you do to . What do you say to a little Amsterdam trip in April ? I think we deserve it . What do you think of MH changing companies ? I think he should get out of that business altogether . He will hate NB just as much as ML inside 6 months . Take care , Chris
Dianne , There doesn't seem to be a new March Aeco product set up . Give me a call . Chris
Dianne , Can you break out buys and sells separately . That format would make it easier for me to transfer the info . to my model . Chris
Brad , Just thinking about my RRSP's . I want to make sure I have maximized my contributions . Chris
Mike , Good to hear you arrived safely . Reno was very average . Too much travel . I guess you know all about that . Hope that work is going well . I am trying to take it relatively easy on Rob . Benson's email is Rob.Benson@enron.com , if that doesn't work try Robert.Benson@enron.com . Let me know if those don't work . Gotta hop ! Keep in touch , Chris
Brad , Could you e-mail me your mailing address so I can send off a cheque . Please make sure I've maximized my foreign content as I don't love the TSE at What did you think of that Enron announcement ? Chris
Not having to add products ( ie . Hub cash ) to our composite pages everyday would be more convenient .
Mike , Hope you found a great place to live . It is ridiculous how expensive flats are in London . Thank god your making pounds now . Tahoe was too much traveling for that short of a stay . Good weather , good friends , beautiful scenery , all right snowboarding , shitty food , cheesy casinos and too much time in fucking airports . That about summarizes the weekend . Laird is doing fine . Things have been relatively slow and the market is very choppy . I've been pretty quiet . No major axes to grind . Just trying to look for the next big trade and keep from getting my head ripped off on EOL . You have to go out for Middle Eastern food . Go to The Lebanese Restaurant . I think it is on Oxford street but I'll find out for sure . Also try Ranoush Juice for a falafel . Good luck and keep in touch ! Chris
Please don't change any deals until we have spoken . I need to talk to John about how these changes will affect his positions . Chris
What's the new job ? I'm good for sushi any day next week ( Tues-Fri) . Give me a call or e-mail me . I'm off to Kimberly snowboarding this weekend . I've done some good snowboarding trips lately ( Lake Tahoe and Fernie) . Not making big $$$$$ lately but things are looking up . Going to Santa Fe grill for lunch ( mmmm!) . You need to come check out my new home theater system , it's crazy ! See you next week , Chris
What date do I need to get you the money by ? I am going to Red Deer this weekend . Chris
Call me at Mom and Dad's on Saturday and I'll pop down and see you at work . Chris
How is tommorow for sushi ? Chris
Mike , How are things going ? I trust that you are adjusting relatively easily . Things have been relatively quiet lately . Doing a little snowboarding and watching lots of movies . Trying to drag my lazy ass to the gym at least 4 days a week . So far I'm at one in a row . Things are looking good for a repeat today . Laird popped by today and brought us some lattes and saw the office . For all your hard work we are actually getting some term business done with Optimum now . I think Lambie helped them out there . Take care , Chris
Morgan , Heard through Bugg your in SF now . You should rethink coming up to Kelowna for May long . Thinking of going to the bay area to visit some friends sometime soon . Send me your number and I'll give you a call . Any good stock ideas ? Check out MSIA on the Nasdaq OTC board . This could be a Qualcomm . Gotta hop , Chris Dorland
Kathy , Could you find out what the breakdown between the $CND and $US monthly index positions transfer to our book were for the month of March . I just want to double check that it is being represented properly in our currency positions . Chris
Kathy , Could we sit down for about a half an hour this afternoon . I Have some questions about how our new FX book is going to work and how to transfer current positions into this book . Let me know when you have a few minutes (  any time after 2pm) . Chris
Ryan , There is some confusion regarding the premstar deal from yesterday . Could you come see me when you get a minute . Chris
I am organizing a bachelor party and am interested in information on group rates and facility availability . Our group will require 5-7 tee times , dinner and cocktails . I am hoping to book for one of the following Saturdays: Information on transportation to Red Deer would also be appreciated . Thank you !

DO YOU HAVE AN E-MAIL ADDRESS FOR MIKE KRUEGER ?
There continues to be confusion concerning the Premstar deals . Can you come see me when you get in . Chris
Call me at work . Chris
Scott , The ROM gas daily deal that I did with IM-Central-Transport on Friday appears to be booked backwards . The trader from Houston called me this morning . The deal # is NB9860.1 . Could you see that it is booked properly . Chris
DID YOU BUY ANY ? 
Rod , Any thoughts on Phillip Morris ?  How bad can you do ? Chris
Dan , Could you set up my SDI direct line on my turrett today please . Chris
I guess the question is whether the cost of pending lawsuits is priced into the stock ? I see an RJR Nabisco deal here . Break off Miller and Kraft and let the death merchant division die slowly . Chris
I don't care what we do . I am going to go for a couple of drinks after work but nothing out of hand . Mike called me and said he wanted to hook up with Johnny tonight . I don't really want to go back to Red Deer to go out . Give me a call at work . Chris
Call me . Mike talked me into going back to Red Deer . Chris
New plan . Staying in Calgary . Want to go to Earl's ? Call Me !
This file contains a list of FX swaps that need to be transfered from Lavo's currency book to our new currency book . Once the deals have been transferred the corresponding annuities need to be killed from Lavo's and our financial books . Let me know if you have any questions . Chris
Dad , Apparently Duke Energy injected 50 Million of cash into Canadian 88 . Greg Novall has been replaced as President and CEO . Chris
Dad , Canadian 88 up $0.25 to $2.05
Kathy , Could you run a NX1 / NX3 report for our book . Chris
Lon , The last couple of days the April basis market on our morning sheet has been the financial curve rather than the physical . We should use the physical curve for the prompt month comparison analysis as it is more relevant as the index gets set . Chris
John , Where are we at on credit with these guys . They won't sell me gas because they say we need to increase Enron Canada's parental guarentee . This is costing me deals and I need to know what is going on soon . Chris
John , I need a response on this issue . Chris
John , The credit contact at TXU is Chris Papousek 713-210-5085 . Chris
How is my SDI direct line coming ? Chris
Kramer , I'm going to sunny Mexico on April 16th but we should get together for a beer before you go to Banff on the Friday .
Dianne , I didn't get my spreadsheet from Friday . No biggie I just used the average of my buy and sell from stack manager in my model but I would like to have the actual deals . Chris
Dan , How is my SDI direct line coming ? Chris
Jill , Just dropping a note to say hi ! Will write more soon . Chris
How's your day going ? Have a look in your humidor tonight . I brought you 13 Monte Cristo #4's (  I got a great deal) . When I put them in there I noticed that you humidor seemed a little dry you might want to fill it up . 2 1/2 weeks to Mexico . Chris
Scott , I think your EOL report was incorrect regarding the Henry Hub gas daily deals from Mar.28th . Mike and I had a total of 3 sales at 2.945 2 done by Mike and 1 done by me The trade I did was done late in the day and you might have missed it . We added the deal back to our model . Let me know if there are any problems . Chris
Dan this is Chris . I case you have forgotten I am the short guy that sits between Cowan and Just wondering how my SDI direct line is coming . Just kidding ! Call me
THE TECH SECTOR IS GETTING THE SHIT KICKED OUT OF IT . I DON'T HAVE ANY MO , UNFORTUNATELY I BOUGHT XEROX ! YOU MIGHT WANT TO STAY OUT OF THE WAY OF THE MARKET . NORTEL IS DOWN $19 / SHARE
I am going to stay in Calgary tonight . I am getting a massage tommorow and need to go tanning . I also have some errands to run . Dan and I might come back saturday afternoon . What are you guys up to ?  Chris
It's great that your coming to Calgary to study for a couple of months . You'll have to work extra hard in June so you can kick back during Stampede . Things here are pretty much unchanged . Working quite a bit and doing a little snowboarding and beer drinking on the weekends . Things could definately be worse . Going golfing in Playa del Carmen in a couple of weeks . That should be fun . Looking forward to chilling out by the pool for a week and doing nothing . This year has been a roller coaster ride for my trading profits and I need a break . Met a really cool girl recently . Will advise if anything interesting devolops there . It's a beautiful Sunday afternoon and I have no idea why I am at work . I think I'm going to go to the driving range . Take it easy and w/b ! CD
Kathy , Could you run a mini-book of all the deals in my FX book as of today . I am setting up a new model and want to double check that I have all the correct deals . Chris
Check out MSFT . Getting the shit kicked out of it .
Dad , This article does a very good job of explaining what Enron does on a macro level . Check it out ! Chris
Check out this article !
Kathy , Aquila accidentally traded my financial product instead of my physical product . Could you change the financial deal they did to phys ? I buy 5000 from Aquila at 3.645 for May . Chris
Dad , Looks like you were smart to wait to get into this market . It has done nothing but go straight down today . Chris
Did you notice the stock market is a little lower today . The fucking nasdaq is down 10 % today and the dow was down almost 5% at one point . The TSE was down 770 to 8880 at one point . I think that a lot of margin positions got squeezed out of teck length . I say buy the solid stocks CSCO , LU ,  MSFT , ENE all look great . Chris
Lavo is going to bring it in for me . I bought QQQ today at 93 . Traded 102 in afterhours trading on the island . Enron is free . Chris
Dad , I really think you should think about getting in on this 360 networks deal . Even if only a small piece . I would take a piece . Talk to you about it on the weekend . Chris
I accidentally entered a X-Alta storage deal twice on Friday . I have already taken it out of our model it now needs to be killed in Tagg and Sitara . The Tagg deal # is NE4430 . Let me know if there are any problems . Chris
No problem . The walk to work in the snow was invigorating at 6:45 . Just kidding , it wasn't that bad . Big news around here today . Lavo is moving to Houston . Chris
Varsity called and the water pump needs to be replaced . It is going to be $700 . I told them to go ahead and fix it . Hope that's OK . Chris
Dan Just a reminder to order an attachment for my phone . Chris
Just a note to let you know we have changed our fee structure with NGX . As of April 1 , we are no longer paying any fee for deals beyond the prompt month . Chris
Dan , I need a ride to go get Mom's Jeep sometime tonight . Give me a call or write back . Chris
Tasha . Good to hear from you . I have been quite busy . I am out of town all of next week but we should get together some time . In terms of careers I don't have much in the way of ideas . Have you thiught about sales of some sort . I think you would be good at that . Not necessarily business to consumer sales but perhaps business to business sales . Just a thought . Chris
Kathy , Could you run a report that lists all of the FX hedges in our book . I just want to make sure we aren't missing any deals in our model . Chris
I made it home . The flight was OK . Shitty movies . I am very tired today . Tough getting going this morning . Better get going . Enjoy the rest of your vacation . Love , Chris
Howard , I filled the Energywest order at -0.36 for May basis . You made $0.015 us/mm Chris See me to make sure I wrote it in properly

Scott , When checking my FX new deals please make sure the following are entered in my model correctly: Settlement Date FX Rate Dollar amount ( All deals are entered from a US dollar perspective ) Direction ( buy/sell ) Chris
Good news from Toronto . Work on the documentation . Chris
No not yet . You need to really think about this because things will move very quickly . Chris
I have 2 incredible tickets for the Brooks and Dunn concert on Friday . Do you want them ? Chris

Hello , I can't imagine how dark you guys are . Hope you are soaking up your last couple of days . Have a cubra libra for me ! Love Chris
Tasha , Back from Mexico . It was a much needed rest . Saturday sounds great but I might only be able to stop by for the first part of the evening . Some friends are having a house warming and I said I would stop by there as well . Send me the details . Chris
Tasha , Sorry I missed your B-Day . I wasn't feeling too great on Saturday so I just layed low . Do you want to get together for a drink one night this week ? Chris
Have you received any messages from me today other than this one ? Chris ( I'm confused! )
Jay , Could you clear the composite pages on my EOL customer ID . I need to add some products and I am having some trouble . My ID is ADM08892 . Chris Dorland
Dale , The short description for the above product should read CAN Gas Swap Nit Daily as opposed to Can Gas Swap Nit Monthly . I don't know why the description changed from when I set it up . Would it be easier for me to set up another product and kill this one ? Let me know . Chris
We are going to have a meeting to discuss S/D in Alberta and the west Wednesday at 3:30 in the computer training room downstairs . The focus of the meeting will be to fine tune our very rough summer forecast for the "X" ( NWP Sumas to La Plata B and PGT Kingsgate to Malin) . Everyone is welcome .

Dad , I don't know if Dan wants to play on Saturday , I forgot to ask . Is there room for Brad to play ? I talked to him last night . If no , I will probably try to get a game with Brad and Darren Easy on Sunday . Talk to you soon . Chris
If there is room for Brad I won't bother calling Darren . Chris
Dan , I have 4 tickets to the Dixie Chicks for Sunday June 4 . Chris
Brad , Could you suspend my PAC payments to Mackenzie for my investment ( not RRSP account ) until I let you know to start them again . Chris

How about Thursday . Chris
We will have to do it early on Wednesday as it is the 2nd last episode of 90210 that night . Chris
Are we on for Wednesday ? Chris
Dan is seriously considering going for this job in TO . What do you think ? Let me know what would be a good time to talk . Chris
I talked to the boys and we are going to go out on Friday night . We were thinking of going to earl's and then hitting the town . What do you think ? Chris ( PS How is your day going? )
You owe me $35 for flowers . Nice day to walk to work . Chris
A RIDE WOULD BE GREAT CAN YOU PICK ME UP AT 5:30 ?
That is fine . . . I'm off to Red Deer this weekend for Mother's Day and my brother's B-Day but I'll catch you next week . Beautiful day in downtown Calgary . Chris

I will be able to attend . Chris
Sushi tonight ? Ryan Watt says high . Chris

Are you guys still looking for an analyst ? Should I send the resume to Dawn or you directly ? Chris
I haven't had a chance to send it yet . Paul is out of the office today so I haven't had a chance to talk to him . I'll send it as soon as you resond wether I should or not . Chris
The deed is done . Chris Find attached resume and cover letter . Hopefully he didn't spel anyting incorrectly . Dan is really smart and a hard worker . I think he would be a good fit . Give me a call Tuesday afternoon to discuss ( gone to Kelowna golfing for the weekend) . Cheers , Chris
Will you please run a June NX3/NX1 for our book .
I didn't get a chance to talk to Paul today . Give him a call tommorow . Chris
You should reply ASAP . Don't make Peters and Co . wait . Chris
Paul called me today . He will be in Calgary in a couple of weeks and will interview you then . Chris
Just a reminder to send me a currency report . Chris
Kathy , Don't take that deal out until I look at it . I think it is mine but I forgot to write it in the blue FX book ( I only wrote it in my red book) . Chris
Do I need to cross reference the deals in my model to the deals in the system or did you already do that ? Chris
Jai Hawker I won't forget about the $ .
Is that Microwave that you gave Dan really expensive ? All the guys at work are saying I shouldn't bother having it fixed I should just buy a new one . Chris
I told Paul that you called him yesterday so abruptly because you didn't want to waste his time while you got tests done for arthritis . I told him I told you to call him back and at least hear what he has to say . He said they are looking for people and based on what I told him an interview was a formality . Chris
Done ! Expect a call from Paul tonight . Chris
You will have to wait and see :- )
That is some good stuff . I hear you are coming our way soon . Look forward to drinking a few beers . Chris
Mom's birthday is tommorow . What are we going to get her ? Chris
I am sorry I was short with you on the phone . The gas market is a total shit show and our economics are out by $1M .  I worked until midnight last night and I am very tired . We should buy an ice cream cake from DQ and cook some steaks on Saturday after golf . Danny and I can leave after dinner or first thing in the morning on Sunday . I hope your ( and my ) work week improves . See you tommorow ! Chris
Why is the Analyst / Associate program excluded from the referral incentive program ? Chris
When are you coming ?
Dianne , Do you keep a copy of the spreadsheet you send me everyday ? I need some days in May for a new economics model that I am building . Let me know . Chris
You owe me $10 for lunch . I know where you live .
I sent it to him . Chris
You might want to watch out while you're crossing the street .
I'm done ! I have tied out positions as of June 6 trading . I have to set up the economics page but that shouldn't take long . What about reversals from our currency book ? Which way do the reversals from the other books go ? The cash deals aren't all in the model ( June 1 - June 6 ) because the physical position doesn't balance but I will talk to Mike about that . I can see a light at the end of the tunnel . Hopefully this makes things easier on you . Thanx for all your hard work ! Chris
Movie tonight ? Did you talk to MH ? Chris
WHAT'S UP ? GIVE ME A CALL . I WANT TO HOOK UP WITH JILL SOMETIME . READY FOR STAMPEDE ? ONLY A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO REST .
Dawn , I want to allocate my $1000 of flex money to my YMCA membership . I paid for the Y membership with my Visa . How do I get my $1000 back ? Chris
Saturday at 2:48 . We might have to invite Johnny . Chris
Can't get away on Monday . See you Saturday night . Chris
Kathy , Do we have any NX1 / NX3 risk for July ? Chris
Forest Green Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo Chris
I bought an MP3 player and need some songs . I understand you are the man . Hook me up ! Chris
Give me a call and give me directions to Andrew's cabin . Chris
Send me your e-mail address at home . I want to send you that fishing cartoon . Chris
Can you come and see me when you get in . We need to do more to tie out the risk in our physical book than agree on the number of molecules we are long or short . My model breaks out the positions by every type of risk profile . We need to produce a report from the Intra-month book that we can use to tie out . If that doesn't exist we should talk systems about creating it . Hopefully this will prevent any future blow ups . Chris
How goes day #1 in TO ? Did you get everything straightened out with the movers ? It is pouring rain and 9 celcius here . Keep it real . Chris
Could you teach my brother how to use his e-mail ?
Are you guys still going to desperados ( SP? ) tommorow ? I think I'm going to head there at about 3PM with Rob Laird and Blair McDermott ( you know Blair.. . the guy with the huge... ) Chris
Hope work is going well . Dusting off my cowboy hat and going stampeding tomorrow . I'll try to give you a call tonight or on the weekend . Say hi to MH and Wilson and Charlene . Chris
What is your work phone number ?
I don't know anything about any sunglasses . Just kidding , I was wearing them all weekend . Chris
NO
I'll bring them by your office this afternoon .
I was just kidding . How desperately do you need them ? Tonight I will be around in the evening . If you are lucky I might even buy you a cup of coffee .
I am 80% going to the rodeo on Thursday . It is the Enron customer party that day . As for Nashville North I don't know if we are going there or somewhere else after . I am a huge bed wetter when it comes to drinking on school nights . I likely won't be going out again until Friday or Saturday . Am I going to get an eye infection if I continue to wear your sunglasses around town ? I hope not . Chicks dig me in those glasses .
Just Laird , Blair , Perry , Tony and a couple of guys around here . Is that a problem ?
You are paranoid .
Lavorato never let his people put their titles on business cards until they became managers . It doesn't really matter . I never really understood why he cared . I think they look more professional with titles . You should ask Jan . Chris
How is your wounded eye ?
When I think of sunnies I think of those little glasses you wear in tanning beds . Your sunglasses are fine . I wore them while I was hangin' around the house last night . My neighbors think I am a total freak . Maybe it wasn't the sunglasses but the "Sweatin' to the Oldies" I was blaring on my stereo all night .  I think Richard Simmons is a totally misunderstood genius . I am so bored . I'm going to the rodeo this afternoon so that should be good . Better get back to doing NOTHING !
Perhaps.. .
I do not suck at writing e-mails . You just can't appreciate the sense of humor one develops in my line of work . It's borderline madness . I should be home all night but do call first in case I'm outside working in the garden .
Today my head hurts . I don't know where our seats at the rodeo are . Yesterday they were at the north end of the infield but I have no idea where they are for tommorow . A word to the wise , avoid the draft beer at the rodeo . I contains rat poison .
How are things going ? Learning lots ? Went to the rodeo and then to Nashville North yesterday so feeling a little fuzzy today . I'm not doing anything today but tommorow I am going to the rodeo and then to a big industry party so that should be good for a headache . Friday I'm going to the Chick Wagon party and Saturday to Nashville North with the boys . Weather has been good and looks like that will continue . Did you find a gym yet ? Chris
The have Mike's Hard and stuff like that . I generally never go out during the week . I was home by 7pm yesterday but I am an enormous baby when it comes to hangovers . I'm not going to the rodeo on Friday but I am going to the chucks that night . Tonight I rest .
That's fine . I'll be home all night .
I was wondering why I wasn't getting any mail . Could you please send me that stuff through intercompany mail . I need to pay that insurance bill soon . If they can't straighten it out I'll send you your mail a couple times a week through inter-company mail . Peace out !
I thought you would like that . We've been working the homeboy language in the broker market all week . You diss'n me ? I'll bust a cap in your ass .
And you are moching me for peace out. .
Go buy Independence Day on DVD .
How's it going ? Hear you are working pretty crazy hours . Went to NN with the boys on Saturday and played golf in Kananaskis yesterday so all in all a good weekend . I have a post stampede cold so I won't be doing much other than work and sleep for a few days . Take it easy and write back when you get a minute . Chris
How was your final stampede weekend ? I have a cold so I layed pretty low this weekend . Did your friend have a good time ?
That was not a snub . I was being sneaky.. .
I can't just sit here and write e-mails all day . I'm a busy man . I did not mean to offend you . I had smoozing to do and didn't want to neglect our customers .
Today I'm leaving by 5 . Usually by 5:30-6 . Et vous ?
Dawn , How long does it usually take Blue Cross to refund $ for the flexible spending account ? I sent in a claim form a month ago and haven't seen anything yet . The reason I'm concerned is that when my brother moved he did a change of address and my mail has been screwed up ever since . Chris
Do you have any plans for July 29th ? If not , would you like to come to Ryan's stag ? You could play golf with Darryl Brown , Ryan's dad and their friend Dave . I think those guys are going to play golf and then come to dinner afterwards . Let me know either way . Chris
Sorry I haven't responded . I left early yesterday and have been big time busy today . I am still pretty sick . I'll write back soon .
Rod , Thanx for booking those tee times . I will be playing on saturday and I am going to get either Mike or Brad to join us if that is OK . Chris ( Are you guys golfing on Sunday ? I booked a time for 11:52 )
I never get any good jokes which is why I haven't been sharing any . I am having a shitting week . Sick and tired . I can't wait for the weekend . I am going to sleep and golf . Where are you going on vacation ? There aren't many weekends left in the summer and that sucks ! Out of the weekends that are left I have two weddings and one stag , a trip to Houston and a trip to Toronto . I am never going to play any golf . gotta hop
Kathy , Could you run a NX3 position report for our book please . Chris
Jay , I can't seem to suspend my product without hitting the stop sign with the hand on it . The red stop light isn't showing up and when I right click on the product the suspend product option is faded and I can't select it . How can I fix this ? Let me know . Chris Dorland
Tasha How are you doing ? Did you have a good stampede ? I had a great stampede but got a nasty cold . Work is going good . Do you know Ryan Flemming ? He went to Riverglen and is a pretty good friend of mine . Anyway , he is getting married August 12 so I've been pretty busy organizing his stag and getting ready for his wedding . Went to Red Deer this weekend and saw my parents . Did you know my brother moved to Toronto ? I need to find a smaller place but for now I'm staying in Kensington . That is all that is new in my life . We should hit a patio and have a drink one night . Take it easy , Chris
I cannot seem to suspend my product without hitting the red hand button ( not an option when I right click on the product and not red stop light) . Chris Dorland
Pancanadian Petroleum - Wayne Harvey Transcanada Gas Services - Brian Krumpka Engage Energy Canada - Toby McKenna Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce - Alan Wright ( not too sure about this one )
Dad , What is the rule for guests on the weekend ? Chris
"Mr . Launer's tip for investors who don't have the time to do exhaustive research: Look for companies such as Enron and El Paso whose stocks are trading at price-earnings multiples that are lower than their long-term growth rates." The one thing that scares me about Enron is the P/E , regardless of earnings growth . Our earnings growth has been so strong it is like a treadmill that keeps getting faster and faster . At some point you fall on your ass . That being said , I have never sold a share of Enron stock or exercised an option . We always seem to find ways to reinvent ourselves and make money appear from nowhere . Investment in Enron should be treated with the same caution as investing in Cisco or any other new economy stock that challenges traditional valuation methods . Chris
Five years out of any particular date ?
Saturday was really fun . Golf was great . Mike and Andrew's group was by far the drunkest foursome . Dinner was good and then we went to the Sutter club to play pool . That is when things got out of hand . We got Ryan a bright yellow T-shirt with "NOBODY KNOWS I'M A LESBIAN" written in big block letters . Call me tonight and I'll give you all the gory details . My head still hurts .
I will be able to attend Milly's party .
How was your holiday ? You missed some beautiful weather . My best friend's stag was on saturday and I still feel like shit . I guess I deserve it for drinking 200 beers . From what I recall I had a good time though . Tonight I am going to bed at 8pm . I can't wait . Chris
Dianne , Do you have our index positions for September ready yet ? Chris
When you have them ready could you give me the reversals for this month please . Chris
What questions ? I accidentally deleted your e-mail from yesterday and don't remember any questions . I hadn't seen the jokes before but they were pretty funny . The sports ones were pretty good . The others were pretty tasteless , so they were my favorites . I feel much better today . I'm already getting psyched up for the weekend . I am going to play golf and not drink . I hate alcohol . I am on the wagon . For good this time . At least for a week anyway . Chris
Enron Corp . up 1 5/8
The stag was a total monkey show . We played golf and pool , ate some dinner , took in the ballet and the hit the bars . I did manage to get a couple of rounds of golf in between all the drinking . I actually played pretty good . Houseboating sounds like fun . I've never done that . I am so on the wagon . I can't express to you how little I'm going to drink this weekend . Lots of golf .
Jay , I can't seem to add any new products to my customer page . Mike Cowan said to drop you a line and have you clear the pages . Chris Dorland
Chris
I don't suspose you are working on the beautiful holiday monday but I just thought I would say hi . I am so bored ! As soon as the Nymex settles I am getting out of here . Chris
I have to run a bunch of errands today and pick up some decorations for my buddy's wedding this weekend so I can't go golfing . That sucks . It is so nice outside . Maybe I'll work up the energy to go for a run later . Probably not . I am such a lazy piece of shit lately . I am definately going to go running now . Self depreciation has motivated me . I need to buy some rollerblades . Where did you get yours ? Cowan says that K2 are really good and relatively inexpensive . Any thoughts ? Maybe I'll look for rollerblades when I'm out this afternoon . You should be proud of me . I was able to stay out of the bottle all weekend . Quite an accomplishment don't you think . One hour to go . Someone shoot me ! Chris
Kelly , I got you address from an e-mail from Meg and thought I would say hi . How is work going ? Still in boston ? I'm still plugging away at ENE . Buy the stock . It's the next CSCO . Gotta hop ! Chris
I want to go see the klumps . How is tonight ? I don't go to movies on tuesdays . You are going out wednesday and I leave for Ft . Mac on thursday .
Have you ever been to a movie on a Tuesday ? I can afford the extra $4 to sit in a theater that isn't totally packed with 14 year old kids . The Klumps starts at 7:15 at Eau Claire . How does that sound ? My friend's wedding is in Ft . Mac . That is why I'm going there on thursday .
I only like the movies that all the 14 year old kids like . I don't have my drivers license yet . I start driver's training next week .
That was very nice . Where do you get this stuff ? Chris
What is your hotmail nickname ?
Got some great news today ! I'll call you tonight .
I got rewarded for hard work . No I'm sure it was well within the boundaries of our tolerance policy .
Meg , Can't wait for the cabin party . Taking my lampshade to the cleaners after work . Chris
Happy belated B-Day ! How was the party ? I am so tired today . Too much driving . I think I set a land speed from Ft . Mac to Calgary yesterday . Chris
The wedding was great ! Too much fun . Once again I'm hung over on a monday . No great stories except that I nearly wiped out while walking down the aisle . I tripped on a cord to a video camera . Mildly embarrassing . My friend was a rock . I think I was more nervous than him . Ft . Mac is a total shit hole . On my tombstone it wil read " He went to Ft . MacMurray , once." No Houston for me . Thank god . I have to go to a party at my boss's on Saturday . I think I might try to play golf as well . I will be taking it very easy . No more booze . My liver hurts . Chris

Sorry , it has been a gong show around here . I'll write back soon . Chris
Meg , Jill is having a birthday barbeque at her house August 27 . She wanted me to let you know . Chris
I told her about it but I don't think she can make it . She called me when she was in Calgary yesterday . Call me when you get home . Chris
Are you working this fine Sunday . I am . It has been crazy around here . Mike has been out so I've been going 90 mph with my hair on fire . This week should be better . I still haven't bought any rollerblades . I've been playing lots of squash . How was your week ? Gotta watch Tiger now . Chris
We should grab some sushi and talk . Call me at work . Chris
I was not hung over yesterday . I had 3 beers and went home . How about that for self control ? I watched women's gymnastics olympic trials on saturday night and did some laundry . What a loser I am . I am going to Sylvan this weekend . My friend Meghan is moving to Sydney Australia and Saturday is her going away party . Meg's cabin parties are generally epic gong shows . I need to rest up this week . I bought in-line pants at the Gap yesterday . Now if I get some rollerblades I'll have the official pants . I don't think you need to take your rollerblades in to get the wheels rotated every week . Can't you do it yourself ? I could probably even do it and I'm the most mechanically inept person in the world . Chris
Tricia , I want to exercise some Enron stock options but don't know who I should call . Do you have a name and/or phone number of someone ? I also don't know what information I need to have in order to exercise . Could you give me a call ( x6910 ) and help me out . Chris Dorland
I would like to golf both days this weekend . Do we have times ? Let me know I can try to book some if Rod hasn't .
I talked to Rod he got me a time at 1:21 for Saturday . I'll play with my buddies on Saturday . I would like to play with you and mom in Sunday . I'll book a tee time if that is OK . Chris
Looks like what I thought was happening is happening . Give me a call . Chris
I'll be home Friday at 6pm . Dinner sounds great . Chris
Writing to confirm your receipt of my account information forms sent by fax . I wanted to make sure you had all the information you needed to set up the account . Please call me at 403-974-6910 when you have the account number . Thank you , Chris Dorland Enron
I got a tee time for 12:24 on Sunday . Chris
Where do you get this stuff ? Sorry I haven't written back but my world is being turned upside down . It is amazing how much your life can change in a day . more to follow.. .
It doesn't really matter if you don't like the new Janet song . I'm so funny . My life is being turned upside down by work but I can't be much more specific than that .
Dad , When are you buying mom a new Jeep ? I need to sell my truck and do it fast . I was thinking I could trade it in towards mom's new one and that might be the best way to get at least decent money for it . Just a thought . Chris
I'm not on either . It is good upside down . I am crazy busy . Did you get the "Doesn't really matter.." bit . I am so funny .
It is a 1997 Grand Cherokee Laredo , 55 000 km's , V8 loaded . I think it is worth about $25 Grand . Chris
In response to this e-mail . The guy who had the party is Rob Milnthorp . He is the Pres . and CEO of Enron Canada . John Disturnall is our option trader . Jon Mckay runs Canadian trading and is my immediate boss . I must have missed this one .
John , I am planning to come to Houston Wednesday and Thursday to sit with the East desk . Unless that is going to create problems , would you mind letting them know that I'm coming . Chris
Brad , I don't know if you've heard but I am moving to Houston at the end of September . I need to know how much I have contributed to my RRSP through you this year so I can maximize my annual contributions before I go . Can you figure this out and let me know . Chris
I went to Kelly Blue Book on the internet and they provide 2 values for used vehicles , a trade in value ( what you might expect to get for a vehicle from a dealer on trade in ) and a retail value ( what you might expect to pay for a vehicle from a dealer) . The following were the values it came up with for a Jeep exactly like mine in Montana ( closest state) . Trade In - $15330 USD ( $22750 CND ) Retail - $20945 USD ( $31061 CND ) The retail number seems way too high . I think something like $23 000 to $25000 would be fair . Let me know what you think . Chris
Are you coming over on Saturday night ? We can talk then . Chris
How's it going . I've been in Houston all week . When are you going houseboating ? Must be soon . I'll write more later . Chris
Tricia , I am moving to our Houston office and have some questions regarding my RRSP and Pension with Clarica . Can you give me a call when you have a minute on Tuesday afternoon ( after 1pm when trading is done ) and I will come by and see you . Chris
Brad , I have contributed $3000 this year to my RRSP through you and $3300 through Enron . What is my maximum contribution for 2000 $13500 ? Is 3pm a good time for me to call you ? If not , when is ? Chris
What do I have with you in non-registered accounts ? Chris
Ryan , Good to hear things are going well . I am still with Enron but I am in the process of moving to Houston . I'm going down there to trade electricity so that should be interesting change from nat gas . No wife . No house . No liver . That's about it . Hope India was a good time . Keep in touch ! Chris ( ps Any idea where Nav is? )
It has to be more than that . I had a $500/month PAC set up that I just cancelled in April .
I have never done a houseboating trip but they sound like a lot of fun . Was the weather good ? Houston was hot . Very hot . I better get used to it though because I'm moving there . That is why I have been so crazy lately . I am going down there to trade power in the North East . Pretty crazy shit . I gotta hop but I'll write more later . Chris
Brad , I'm on dope . I was looking at the wrong bank statement . The $700 number sounds correct . Can you sell that stuff for me please . I'll give you a cheque this weekend to top up my RRSP . Chris
How are you doing ? What are you doing ? I am still working for Enron . I have been trading nat gas for about 3 years . I am moving to Houston at the end of the month . In my next life I am going to be trading electricity in the NE US . Should be interesting . Crazy volatility . I will probably have a heart attack at 26 but that's life . Hope things are going well for you . Chris Dorland
Thanx for Nav's address . Congrats on the CFA . Cowan just finished level 2 . I don't think I'm going to take it after watching the hell he went through . Chris
My pension and group RRSP is with Clarica . Can I transfer those assets to you ? Chris
I finally found Nav . I am moving to Houston to trade power in the Northeastern US . Gotta hop , Chris
What do I have to give you in order to transfer this stuff ?
I am leaving in a 2-3 weeks . Pretty much as soon as I can get all my shit together . Nice timing on my part . No winter for Chris . I'll think of you in the snow when I'm on the golf course .
I will be moving to Houston by the end of the month . I am actually going to be trading electricity so that should be an interesting change from nat gas . We will have to hook up once I get settled . How much longer are you going to be in Boston ? How far is Dallas from Houston ? Keep in touch ! Chris
Kevin , October 2 sounds fine . I am going to try to be there earlier than that but I am sure I will be in and out of the office taking care of bullshit . Will the package they are sending include info . on movers ? I want to book them as soon as possible .
Got my number from Lavo today . $80k USD / year and a promo in Feb . See you Saturday . Chris
What do you need from me to transfer my RRSP and Penson . I want to take care of it weekend . Chris
I am wondering if you know which moving company Enron uses to move people to Houston . Despite the fact that I haven't seen the formal offer I think I should book a mover so I don't get stuck . Let me know if you know or if there is someone in Houston I should talk to ( Jennifer?) . Chris
Dawn got my apartment # wrong in her e-mail . This is my correct address . Calgary , AB Chris
Dad , US Thanksgiving is November 23/24 . I will be coming home the night of Nov.22 and leaving on Sunday Nov . 26 . Chris
Carol , Fed Ex missed me on Saturday but are going to deliver it to the office today ( hopefully) . Chris
I got the package from Fed Ex . Thought I would let you know . Chris
Did you contact Clarica ? Do I need to do anything ? Chris
Brad The lady in our HR department told me Charlotte is out on maternity leave . Do you want me to find out who else we can call ? Chris
Brad Could you cancel my PAC plan after the September contribution . I have thought more about the leverage idea you suggested and want to talk to you . Can I give you a call later this afternoon ? What time are you going to be in the office until ? What is you home phone number . I will be at the office late tonight working on move shit . Chris
Kim , Could you please explain ( pretent you are talking to a 4 year old ) the details of the following . a ) Health care coverage provided by Enron and any costs associated with that coverage including: - Medical - Dental - Vision Is this enough coverage ? Is there supplemental coverage available ? What is / is not covered ? b ) Life / Accidental Death and Dismemberment / Disability Insurance - What ( if any ) is provided coverage ? c ) What programs concerning retirement saving ( company matched savings , pension benefits ect... ) will I participate in ? - What are these programs ? - How do I sign up ? d ) I am told I should opt out of social security . How does that work ? e ) What is my vacation allocation ? How do unused vacation day work in the US ? f ) In Canada , we have a "Health Spending Account" of $1000 / year that we can allocate towards eye glasses , health club memberships ect.. . - Does a similar program exist in the US ? g ) I will be required to file 2 tax returns ( Canada and US ) in 2000 . Will Enron cover the cost of having those returns prepared ? h ) Is parking at the Allen Center covered in the offer ? If not , could it be ? Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you . Chris Dorland
Don't forget to cancel that PAC for me ? Talk to you later . Chris
I do have one running for my RRSP account . $500 per month . I was wrong about my unregistered account . Chris
Margaret , I have completed all of the information and am awaiting my University transcripts . The copy in my HR file is missing and I have ordered some but this may take 2-3 days . Should I send the other info . and forward the transcripts when I receive them or wait and send it all together ? Let me know , Chris
Things are crazy . I still don't have a moving date or work visa but every one assures me I have lots of time . I would go to a store like future shop or look on the internet at chapters.ca . All electronics / stereo shops have them now . Make sure you get one with lots of memory . Take it easy . Chris
Dad , I booked a tee time for Saturday at 1:44pm . Chris
Kim , I received the benefit book and will look through it tonight . Do you know the name of the lady I am susposed to be in contact with at Enron relocation services ? She called me yesterday but I have forgotten her name . I am wondering if I need to have my visa done before she will book the movers . In regards to my visa , I have gathered pretty much all the info . that Margaret needs with the exception of University transcripts . I had to order those and probably won't get them untill early next week . Thank you for all your help ! Chris
Carol , What document are you referring to in this e-mail ? I have received so much stuff lately I don't know what I have and what I don't have . Chris
I sent you a package by FEDEX today . I will fax copies of my diploma and transcripts as soon as I recieve them . Chris
Carla , Just wanted to confirm that you sent the package I left on your desk . Let me know . Chris
What is this stuff ? Chris
Mine has 32 MB . You need way more that that . You can buy memory cards for most players . Check out Chris
When you download MP3 files you should download them in 128 kps format . That is CD quality sound and you can get about 30 minutes of music on 32MB of memory on an MP3 player . You can sort by that format on Napster . Chris
Kim , I sent all of my Visa application information to Margaret by FedEx today . Just thought I would keep you in the loop ! Chris
I am starting to wade through it . The US health care system is very different from the Canadian but the Enron coverage seems quite comprehensive . Chris
Margaret , Just wanted to make sure you got the info . I sent on Thursday . How is the visa coming ? Let me know . Chris Dorland
Margaret , I received my transcripts from University today . I will send them by FedEx . Chris
Could you please send the documents to our office in Calgary . Chris Dorland Enron Canada Corp . Calgary , AB Canada Chris
Kim , Should I be worried that I haven't book movers yet ? Chris
Dad , Did you get my message about my parking tag ? Chris
Ricardo , I will be joining the East power desk at the beginning of October and I am trying to get up to speed on the PJM market . Kevin Prestor thought you would be able to help me find some data . I am looking for the following historics in excel format ( send as much data as you have and feel free to include anything else that you think might be relevant): - HDD's and CDD's for Philedelphia , Allentown Washington DC , Baltimore , Pittsburg , Newark , New York City , Cinncinati and any other cities that are relevant ?  - Supply outage data for PJM - Daily Import / Exprot data for PJM - Historic daily nat gas prices Transco Zone 6 (  NY and Non-NY) , Chicago , . . . Again , please feel free to make any suggestions . I am very new to the world of power and it is likely that I have overlooked something very obvious . Chris Dorland
How's it going ? Did you have a good time in Victoria ? I have been running around like a chicken with my head cut off trying to get ready to move . Went to Red Deer this weekend and played a little golf . Pretty relaxing . I have so much shit to do . I better hop . Chris
I talked to Keith Holst who went through this process a couple of years ago and he said that a lady named Janice Priddy in Houston set up the paperwork for him . Chris
Margaret , Just wondering how my Visa was coming along ? I had a confusing conversation with Jeanne in relocation services this morning . The way I understand the moving process is that my household goods have to leave Canada at the same time or after I leave the country . She seemed to think that I had to go to the US and then return to Canada before my goods could leave Canada . Can you shed some light on this ? Chris Dorland
Margaret , Could you send the Visa documents to my office: Enron Canada Corp . Calgary , AB T2P 4H2 Chris Dorland
Everything seems OK . Hopefully I will hear from the mover's this afternoon . Chris
Margaret , I was wondering if you sent my visa documents yesterday or today . I will be out of the office this afternoon but I would come back if my visa documents are going to me here . Chris
Thank you !
Margaret , Please send them to the Calgary office to my attention: Enron Canada Corp . Calgary , AB Thank you , Chris Dorland

What parts of the puzzle am I missing? ) Demand ( Load ) - Historic load information for PJM Interchanges - What are the historic imports and exports in and out of PJM - What are the costs associated with wheeling power in and out of PJM ?  Thank you for all your help and please include any other info . you think may be relevant . Chris Dorland

Kim , Can you contact Mikie Rath regarding my 401K plan . I haven't received anything from Northern Trust and would like to get set up . I would like begin contributing as soon as possible .

If you didn't get the e-mail I just sent you with a link in it check out the latest www.theonion.com
Just a little something to brighten up your weekend !
I'm glad you had a good time . I know about 2 DM songs so I don't think I would have had as much fun in the rain .
Did you get her address ?
That guy has a huge pussy !
I think that you should make her something . Perhaps you could draw a picture or make something out of paper mache . I'll stop by Tiffany's and see if they have anything to go with her bracelet and earings ( from x-mas) . Later skater.. .
Rod , What do you think of the Canadian bank stocks ? Relative to their US counterparts they seem cheap . I know that the discount is due regulation ( no take overs or mergers ) but in a 4% interest rate environment a 4% dividend yield looks pretty attractive . Not to mention they continue to crank out earnings quarter after quarter . Chris
Did you send Amanda a card ?
Hey , What's up ? Dave is in Mexico but I will call Scott and see if he has plans . We might be having a trading group bonding session ( dinner and intense drunkeness ) on Friday at my boss's hoose but if not I'd love to check out the game . Can I let you know tommorow ? Let me know.. . Chris

I'm looking for 4 tickets for Friday's Astros game . If you stumble upon any let me know . Chris
Stock market is exploding . Dow 11133 ( up 260) . Nasdaq 2150 ( up 60) . It has to be higher than where you bought now ? Chris
You de man !
I have 4 tickets for Friday . I don't know if they are good , bad or what but they are free . Talk to you later . Chris

How was the Polo match ? Did you catch the Sopranos season finale ? A little disappointing if you ask me . I worked out yesterday and I can't straighten my arms . A little uncomfortable . Bring on the Advil . Talk to you later.. . Chris
You not working today ? I called like 3 times . Did you hear about Jaimie Hawley's litttle brother ? She must be a mess . I haven't got anything for Mom's b-day yet . Any great ideas ?

Any interest in playing golf Sunday with Ryan , my Dad and I ?  Chris
Dad , Please don't forget to make tee times for Saturday and Sunday . I was thinking around noon Saturday and around 4pm on Sunday ( Ryan can't make it untill then) . Chris
I think Rob and I might try to golf ( or just hit some balls ) after work . If we do we will probably go to Tradition ( way North) . I'll let you know . If I'm not going to be home I could leave your Amex in an envelope at the office of my apartment or you could grab it when I get back . Let me know.. . Chris
I replied to this message earlier that I would like to move to the Enron Center garage but have not received a reply . Can I just go to the parking desk on level 3 and change my 1600 Smith card ? Chris Dorland
Do I just come down and change my card ?  Chris Dorland
Isn't it June 17 . I got him a card but not a present yet . I got the card when I was home and put both our names on it . What do you want to do about a gift ?
Good idea . I'll e-mail Rod and see if he has any other suggestions . Chris
I would e-mail rod but fucking outlook lost my address book . Do you have his e-mail .
Pls migrate and notify of any help needed . Daniel ( 281-541-6203 )
Rod , I was thinking of buying my dad some cd's for father's day . Any suggestions ? Be sure let Christina know I hope that she is feeling better . Chris
You are in charge . I think some DVD's is a super plan . I was also thinking that a really nice hammock would be a great gift but I have no idea where to get one . I will talk to mom and see if she knows where we could get one . Chris
No problem .
John , Rob and I are both in for golf on Sunday . Chris
You can send it at any time during the day . Chris Dorland
What's up ? I nearly drowned on the way home the other day . Beautiful weather we're having . Are you feeling better ? I got a cold but I feel better today . The trick is getting 10 hours of sleep a night . Tonight is the MTV movie awards . I really need to get a life . I mentioned the party to Rob but he forgot to ask Darlene . I'll let you know if they are coming tommorow . Talk to you later . Chris
I slept ( was passed out ) through the whole thing . My car is on the 4th floor of the parkade so luckily it was fine . I love the MTV movie awards . Shannon Elizabeth rules . Halle Berry naked in Swordfish . Can't wait . What's new with you ?
I had to put the cougar to sleep . Too annoying for words . What happened to the hot from the picture ?
I'll be there for the wedding . No stag for me though .
No chance of me getting back on the cougar trail . I have devoted myself to scouting out dumb blondes under the age of 25 . Ideally I will find some 22 year old Britney Spears look alike . Wish me well . Chris
I'll keep those suggestions on file . I got him a pretty cool hammock from this Sharper Image type place . Hopefully it will help him relax a little . Chris
Have you made a packing list yet ? I would have . Getting excited I bet . Better get back to work . Talk to you later.. . Chris
How about TD bank . The gift that keeps on giving . Power still weak .
The girl of my dreams .
Would you like to buy some $84 ENE Calls ? How is you day going ? Did you come to an agreement regarding your trip ? Let me know what time you are going to be home tonight and I'll give you shout . Chris

What's going on . When I moved to Houston my e-mail address book got toasted so I am glad you sent your address . What's new ? Where are you working now ? I am in Houston trading electricity now . I like the job but the city is a dump . Take it easy Chris
Crystal , How was your trip ? I was in Lake Conroe last weekend for a work retreat . We had a great time but I think Austin would have been a better destination . Susposed to be 95-100 next week but feel like 110 with the humidity . Can't wait . Take it easy . Chris
Crystal Sorry it took so long to get back to you . My boss has been out this week and I am doing both our jobs . Lots of fun . I'm glad you had a good time on your trip.I need a vacation . Are you over your cold yet ? It is funny how many people I know have colds in the middle of July . I didn't do anything exciting of the 4th . I watched the NY fireworks on TV . We were on a big gong show weekend the weekend before in Conroe so I needed rest . Better get back but I'll write back later . Chris
What is this thing ? Mo got into the MBA program at the Rotterdam School of Management . How perfect is that ? Going to do his MBA in Holland . You should call and congratulate him . It is actually a really good school . I am definately going to visit . Chris

I am thinking about 17th ave . and Kensington but I am open to other ideas . I will be in Calgary a couple of times in the next few months and would be interested in getting together to look at properties . If you could send me an e-mail with your contact info . I will call you to arrange an appointment . Thanx for the time . Chris Dorland Enron North America 1400 Smith Street Houston , Texas 77002
Thanx for getting back to me so quickly . I am looking for something about 1300-1500 sq . feet with one bedroom plus den or 2 bedrooms . The price range I was thinking was $225-250 K . Hope that helps . I will give you a call later in the week .  Chris Dorland
Do you have Ryan's e-mail address ?
Bastard
Ryan , What's up ? I don't know if you heard yet but it looks like I am moving back to Calgary in mid September . I will see you August 17 . I'm coming home for Matt and Jen's wedding . Take it easy . Chris
The guy who ran our trading operation in Calgary really wanted to move back to Houston because his girlfriend lives hear so that left a hole in our Calgary trading operation so they asked me to come back . See you in a couple of weeks . Chris
Nov-Mar Sumas has moved about 0.20 since I started watching it . I guess that's enough vol . for me . Chris
I think a mid sept tee time will work . I want to try to be there for the off site with the west guys . Tell John Z I'll call him this afternoon . Chris
John , I talked to Fletch yesterday and I think I am going to come back to Calgary . I'll give you a call this afternoon or Monday to talk about details but I just thought I would drop you a note so you could get the ball rolling with HR on your end . Talk to you soon . Chris
Want to hear about a bad day . Down $2 million USD today . Temps came in 10 degress hotter than we thought in the Northeast this week and blew up ! Chris
I am long the Sept-Oct NX1 spread about 250 times . I love that trade . Rack up another half million for me today . Fuck !
The range on my next day power was 110 to 260 .
Not good . Listen to this . At the end of the day dailies traded down to 85 bucks . Check that range 85-275 . I need a vacation .
I want stag details . Chris
Actually lots . Keep this on the QT for now but this kid is moving back to cow town . I'll be in town next week shopping for somewhere to live . Just in time for ski season . Later Chris
I really want to live in Altadore . I hear that is where all the fly bitches hang . I don't know to be honest Killarney / Altadore / West Hillhurst ?  Close to downtown . I am thinking infill / townhouse . My mom has a friend who says there are nice brownstone townhomes in Altadore . I am thinking of checking those out . I am looking for minimal maintenance . Do you have any ideas ? Seen Kerri Murray lately ? CD
Lee Clarke.. . Sounds like a fag . Garrison woods that is the place my mom was talking about . Do you live near there ?
Done . I'm moving in ! Can I borrow your lawn mower ? I need to decide what I am going to do with my ride . I think I am going to bring it with me and buy a set of winter wheels and some killer winter tires . Don't you have a tire guy ?
I already have a minature goat . I am a little concerned about making a housing decision in one day but what the fuck .
I looked at the MLS listings and there is some stuff on there . I have a realtor who seems to have her act together . Don't worry about it . How long would it take me to get to work from there ?
3 songs . I can deal with that .
Now that I have a place to live all I need is a chica . I am going to a wedding in Red Deer next weekend and there should be plenty of available young ladies there . How is Mike McD ? Are you married yet ? Any kids on the way ?
Thanx . I haven't done a trade in over an hour .
I still see her now and then but she lives a rock star life and I don't have the stamina to go out 4 nights a week and get up at 4:30 for work . A little old for my taste as well . She is hot though . She looks exactly like Mariah Carey . It is great hanging out with her . It is amazing how much more interested other chicks are in a guy who hanging out with a bunch if hotties . Her best friend does the social "buzz" show in Houston's NBC station so she gets ticket and invites to every thing cool around town .
So much for being bullish .
Congrats on the CFA . I am actually fighting back today . How much time a week would you say you spend on yard work ? I am thinking that I will go with a place more like yours . Let me know what you think . I am going to have to get Monica back .
Congrats on the CFA ! Maybe one day I'll get off my lazy ass and give it a shot . Chris
Linda , I found your email address on the internet so disregard the message I left on your cell . The following properties are the type of place I have in mind . I thought that these would give you a better idea the general concept I am looking for . I am starting to think that a townhouse / infill is a better way to go as opposed to an apartement style condo . I look forward to meeting you on Friday . Below are some MLS #'s of properties that interested me and my contact # in Red Deer / Calary . Chris Dorland Cell 713-416-6694 Red Deer home 403-343-7086 I have also heard a lot of good things about Garrison Woods and would like to check that development out .
Mikey , I am thinking of going with a townhouse / infill as opposed to an apartement style condo . I am going to look mostly in the Altadore / Killarney area . I think you get more house for your $ there as opposed to West Hillhurst . A couple of people have told me to check out Garrison Woods . Have you heard of it ? What is the plan for the weekend . You should come down to Red Deer on Friday and have Earl's with the Dorlands . Maybe we could track down Johnny after . Are you taking a chica to the wedding ? I am so looking forward to coming home . I got my face ripped off last week . Talk to you later.. . Chris
Things are look up on the Sept/Oct . Spread I think I am going to add to my position . Cash going out week . Chris
Hopefully I will be able to make it by then . I have to talk to Fletch and Presto but it makes sense for me to be there by then . I am coming to town on Thursday . I'll probably drop by the office on Friday . Chris
I am moving to Calgary from Houston and am wondering if Lexus has a winter wheel/tire package for the 2001 IS 300 . If not could you recommend a wheel / tire dealer in Calgary who could help me find something that would work . Thanx for your time . Chris Dorland
Tamara , Thanx for the info . I have 17" wheels on it now so I guess I will have to get wheels and tires . Do you know what the 16" wheels look like ? Is there somewhere on the net I can see an example . Also I will need to have my car winterized ( install a blockheater ect... ) when I move back so I will give you a call then . Chris Dorland
Thank you . Chris Dorland Houston , TX
Coming to town Thursday for the weekend and hopefully moving by the middle of September . Spending Friday house shopping . I think I am going to end up in your neck of the woods . Seems like the best values are in that area . Are we going to get some snow this winter ? We need to find Dorland a date . I am going to a wedding this weekend and there should be lots of single chicas there . I am really looking forward to being back in Cow town . Houston is painfull . Later
Fuck you . That's how we spell it in Belgium .
I was confused by your use of 2 spellings . Did you like my Austin Power's reference ? "I know . That's how we do it in Belgium . It's called a Belgium dip" You are back in my good graces . Try not to confuse the dumb fat kid .
Have you guys moved over to the wonderful world of boxes with Enron Canada yet ?
If you are bored try to find out what your tire guy thinks of Dunlop Winter Sport M2 tires . Is you tire guy also a wheel guy ? I need some winter wheels as well .
Lexus IS 300 . Not sure if I am going to buy 17" or 16" wheels for the winter . Jackass .
I was thinking of converting it to a hover vehicle . I might just sell the car and get you to drive me around all winter .
For me it isn't about fulfillment or finding my life's purpose in my work . It's all about the $$$ . Work hard and retire early . Cheers Chris P.S . I am moving back to Calgary in about a month . Enron continues to feel free to move me around at will . I am actually really looking forward to it .
Glad to hear all is well . I meant to comment that I thought the people profiled in the article should pull their heads out of their self important asses . It isn't about finding the meaning of life at work . It is all about the $$$ . Work hard . Make $$$ . Retire young . Things with me are great . Moving back to Calgary in about a month which is a little sooner than I thought I would be going back but when opportunity knocks you gotta go . Take care .
I just heard from a mutual friend that Kerrie Murray got engaged recently . Scratch that one off the list of possibles .
Jill , Sorry about the brief first reply things have been a little busy . What is with people ( that article ) ?  Working long hours just for the sake of working long hours . I am pushing for a 4 day work week . Why Calgary ? Why not ? I love Calgary . Actually the guy that ran our trading operation in Calgary is getting married to an American who works in Houston so he is moving to accommodate her career . This has left a hole in our Canadian operation and my boss felt that I was just the cork to fill that hole . I think it is a promotion . Besides , Houston in the arm pit of the world . This city has few redeeming features . What it lacks in culture and sophistication it makes up for by its lack of clean air and any form of natural beauty . Actually , it isn't that bad . Houston has good restaurants , decent night life and the people are really friendly but given the choice I would much rather live in Calgary . In this business odds are that I will find myself back here sooner than later so might as well enjoy Canada while I can . Kerrie got engaged . Good for her . I have a cactus in my bathroom that is dying from lack of attention . I am not engaged . I was seeing someone for a while but she took a work assignment in Venezuela . No big loss . Too old for me anyway ( 31) . Glad to hear that you are enjoying you time in NY . I am going to have to visit some time . I know I say that every time we chat but I really would like to try to get down there before you move on to your next destination . Or is NY home for a while ? No Vacation plans other than that I am going to Matt and Jen's wedding this weekend . Should be a good party and I hung out with those guys quite a bit when I was living in Calgary . Also I am going to look for a place to live in Calgary in Friday . My friend Mohammed from TO is moving to Rotterdam to do his MBA so I might try to visit him in the spring . Do a little Amsterdam , Paris , London whirlwind tour . My family is doing great . My dad sold Titan to a Comglomerate from the US and is retiring in January and my mom is up to the same stuff . Dancing and buying shit for their house . Both of their health is great . My dad has been playing lots of golf and feeling great . How is Meg doing ? Is she in Australia now ? I should get in touch with her . I saw Reagan Neiss in commercial for her TV show last night . Good for her . I hope all goes well for her . Dan did go to D's wedding . Said it was really nice . Still don't get that one ? I have to stop writing now my fingers hurt . Keep in touch . Chris ( this e-mail is record length for me )
Phil is marrying that chick huh . She is pretty hot from what I recall . I am definately into doing something on Sunday . Give me a call . Have fun this weekend say hi to Darren and Rich and send my congrats ( and a shot of tequila ) to phil . Chris

Kim , I am going to be moving back to the Calgary office in about a month and I wanted to touch base with you so we can organize any HR issues before I go . In particular I was wondering what happens to my Enron savings plan ( 401k ) when I go back . Let me know if there is anything you need me to do for you . Chris

A lucent phone will be fine . I will only be on the desk for about 7-8 days so don't go to too much trouble . Do you have Keith and Frank's flight info for their trip to Calgary on Sept . 7 ?  I will be there that weekend as well and want to coordinate my return with theirs . Chris Dorland
Nathan / Judy PWC prepared my Canadian and US tax returns for 2000 . I was expecting approx . a $1800 return on my US federal income tax that I haven't received yet . Do you have a number / contact that I can direct my inquiry to ? Chris Dorland Enron North America
Dad , Just though I would let you know I talked to a Royal Bank credit specialist this morning and he will get back to me this afternoon . I also talked to Jordan and he is going to take call Linda and get going on the paper work . I think I am going to come back to Calgary September 6-7 to finalize everything . There is an Enron Canada offsite in Banff that weekend ( Sept 7-9 ) that I should go to . Thanx again for all your help this weekend . Chris
Laura , I don't know if you have heard but I am moving back to Calgary to trade gas . I am coming back in mid-september . Would you do a USD/CND currency swap for me when I get back ? I would like to avoid the Royal Bank's huge bid / offer spread . Let me know . Chris
Where is you place ? It is pretty close to there isn't it .
Purchase . No financing necessary . Chris
Dawn , I got your package yesterday and I signed the offer letter and will return it today . I wasn't sure what to do about the employment agreement because I signed a 2 year contract in April that is a little more detailed and restrictive that the one you sent . The main differences are with regards to the non-compete agreement ( 3.4 ) and termination before end of term ( 2.1) . If you want I can include a copy of that contract with the offer letter . Let me know what you want me to do . Chris
I get possesion Sept.20
Got the pictures . Thank you very much . Do you stock those wheels and tires or would I have to order them ? Chris Dorland
I didn't know Blair lived up there . Do you think it's too late to flake on the deal ?
Kim , Any word on what happens to my 401k and/or savings plan when I transfer back to Calgary ? Let me know . Chris
Tricia , I think I gave you the wrong fax number for Terri O'Laughlin at the Royal Bank . The correct number is 403-292-2182 . Chris

How was cottage country ?
I am in town next Thursday/Friday . We should do a Thursday night playstation session with Johnny . Chris
Finally got it . Thanx .
I think we should get him a card and tell him his present will be there when my furniture gets there .
The colors that interest me most are black , silver , white , burgundy and champagne . I will be in Calgary on Sept . 6/7 and I will give you a call . Are you going to be in the office on those days ? Chris Dorland
Yeh ! Sept.6-7 Try to find a sub . This is Johnny we're talking about .
Do you have a black one in stock ? If so , what color interior ? Chris
Picture didn't come through . Sounds nice . Is there somewhere on the web I can see it . Chris
Nice looking truck . Is this one the same price ? About $45,000 ? I will be working out of my Calgary office on Sept.6/7 . Could you bring it downtown to take me for a ride on the afternoon of the 6th ? Chris
Captain America What are you driving these days ? I'm selling my car cheap because it will cost me a fortune to take it back to Canada . 2001 Lexus IS 300 Silver with Black leather interior . Totally loaded with 3800 miles on it . Let me know if you or any of your buddies want to check it out . Chris
How about TD Bank ? Benson and I own some wood . Chris
Basis snapping in . Wow . Long Oct . Aeco Basis works again . Nov-Mar is like 5 cents tighter today . You guys making some $ ? 
Bean , Did you guys get another car yet ? I am selling mine cheap before I move .
Do you guys have a good map of Alberta and BC that includes Alliance . If so please send it to me . Chris
Carmax showed me a $29000 bid . I'll sell it to you for $29500 .
On the base model . Mine has 6K in options . It is totally loaded . Silver/Black with 3800 miles .
No tax either .
Mine has leather , limited slip differential and special window tinting that reflects heat . Plus no tax .
And half the miles this one has .
She should beaten in the streets .
Silver with Black interior .
I'll probably have a little room but below 28K I'll probably just move it back to Calgary . Let me know if you want to see it . I car pool with Benson so I only have it here every other day .
Great . I will call you on Sept . 6th when I get to town . Chris
Martin , I left early yesterday . Does tonight work for you ? No spoiler and the car was high and dry during Allison . Chris
After the pain in the ass selling my current car is giving me I am thinking about leasing . Can you work up some lease rates for 24 and 36 months . Chris
MTV music awards Thursday September 6th - Hopefully we get another Britney strip tease this year .
Listen to this shit . If I want to move my car back to Canada I ( Enron ) would have to pay $2000 USD to move it plus 6.1% of KBB value in import duty plus 7% GST plus $200 excise tax plus about $400 in permits . Looks like I am looking for a new car as well .
We were talking about getting matching PT cruisers with CRUISR1 and CRUISR2 personalized plates .
Don't forget pink fuzzy dice and chain steering wheel and red interior lights . Chicks are going to love it . I'm going to get a chick with a python wrapped around her painted on the side and get those tires that stick out 6 inches from the wheel wells with gold plated rims . SWEET ! The funny thing is that in some neighborhoods in Houston ( predominately latin ) that would be a killer ride .
Lady with python on one side ,  Star wars on the other.. .
When I am back in Calgary your whole desk is going to have listen to this shit all day over the box.. .
I am going to go home an watch the Austin Power's movies over and over tonight.. .
What does the Kergan think of his Jeep ? I think I am going to get one of those . Unless you have forgotten the Kergan's where an acient people from the steps of Russia who ,  for entertainment , tossed children in pits with wild dogs to fight for food .
What doesn't he like about it ?
John , Here is what I think my out of pocket costs of this move will be: Movers - $7500 CND Flight - $1500 CND October Rent - $1500 CND I am already at $12000 CND and I haven't even got to the car or any incidental costs yet . Chris
I'm not very excited to hang out with Mikey all the time . See what Johnny is up to and hit the Benson and Hedges menthol's .
Tricia , I have already spoken to the RIV and Canada Customs . My car was manufactured in Japan and thus would be subject to an import duty of 6.1% , the GST and excise and import costs . Purchase price = 35000 USD = 54000 CND Duty on this amount = 3300 GST on this amount = 3800 Excise tax = 180 Plus costs to convert the speedometer and odometer to the metric system and label all safety systems with french language instructions ( from RIV ) = approx . 500 That brings us to $8200 CND plus the cost to actually transport it from Houston to Calgary ( at least $2000) . Total approximately $10000 CND . Hardly seems like the best option . Also , I called Williams moving to find out what the cost was to move me down here last year . And the invoice just for the move of my household goods from Calgary to Houston was $4700 USD . Just off the top of my head my out of pocket costs will be: Movers = $7300 CND ( 4700 USD ) Flight = $1500 CND Hotel = $1500 CND October Rent = $1500 ( I have a 1 year lease in Houston that expires at the end of October ) The total of the above is $11 800 .
No luck getting your lease calculator to work ? Actually , don't worry about it I have change my mind back to buying .
Do you have a number for MSN customer service ? I want to cancel my MSN account but have no idea how to get in touch with them . Chris
What if any changes were made to the Grand Cherokee Limited for 2002 ?
That is great . We were just having a discussion about going to other floors to take a shit because our bathroom is such a dump .
I think I'm going to buy a Grand Cherokee Limited instead of the X5 and save myself 30K . Are we on with Johnny next week ?
I am going to Banff for an off site . I will be back in town the following Friday and we'll do it up that night . Late night Johnny is OK . We'll take it easy as it is a school night .
Glad you like the place . Missed the PS on the first message .
I sold my car . $28000 USD but Enron is going to pay me $3000 USD for not having to move it and get it licensed in Canada . So it cost me $5000 to drive that car for a year . Not bad I guess . Have you and mom had any problems with her jeep ? Chris
My one year closed interest rate on my mortgage is 5.2% . Not bad !
Kim , Any luck getting this info . for me ? Chris
When I was 26 I was looking for an 18 year old girlfriend who looks exactly like Britney Spears . Keep your eyes open . 2 Weeks till I am back in Calgary . I can't wait . Sold my car yesterday to a buddy of mine down here . I'm going to buy an Grand Cherokee Limited like my mom's . Black I think . What's new ? I can't wait to get this move over and get settled in Calgary . I am really excited to move into my new place . It is going to be sweet . I think I can accomodate your request for a synthetic pillow . Are we going to be able to get some golf in before the snow comes ? Talk to you soon . Chris
Kim , I am sitting on the West desk on 32 . Chris
Next to Keith Holst if that helps . Chris
This didn't work for some reason . Can you try to send it again and just copy and paste all the values . Chris
I just want to print this off .
Russell , Can you e-mail me the "model" spread sheet . I want the eol technology . Chris
Kim , Got the envelope yesterday . Thank you very much . Chris
Anna , I am moving back to Canada to trade gas but I would really like to get your daily technical sheet . Could you e-mail it to me or perhaps start posting it on the commodity fundy's site ? Thanx Chris
So much for keeping it quiet . Dorland the loudmouth is back in town .
Looks OK except that it doesn't include the reimbursement for my car . Chris
Judi , Did you receive a quote for Williams yet ? When I spoke with Terri she said that $5000 USD was a pretty good estimate for my move . Chris
Thanx looks good . What I was really looking for was the relationship between Sumas and each of those points for the N-M and A-O strips . Can you put these graphs together for me . Sumas vs . Rockies Sumas vs . San Juan Sumas vs . Rockies Sumas vs . San Juan Chris 713-853-1663
Kim , I just wanted to touch base with you and let you know my schedule . I am in the Houston office this week from Monday to Thursday but I will be in and out quite a bit meeting with movers and clearing up loose ends . If we need to get together before I go we should probably plan to do so Monday or Tuesday as I will be packing and moving much of Wednesday and Thursday . Let me know when you would like to get together . I am sitting at 3208b . Chris
How is that ops package coming ?
Carlos Thanx for the pos report . Would you mind sending it to me each morning ? Also , can you make sure that they have all of the deals ( other than the few I have done ) transferred out of my book by the end of the week . I talked to Brian ? and he said he would look after it but can you make sure it happens . Chris
A couple of other quick things . My October Sumas position doesn't look correct . I am short 45000 mm/d and the report shows 50000 mm/d . I will list my oct sumas trades below if you can check on it for me . Also can you make sure my gas daily book is set up and include the change in position report in your daily e-mail . Chris
Oct Sumas trades I also bought 15000 mm/d from Chad today on EOL . Chris
Getting closer . I want a graph of the spread not of the 2 fixed prices . Chris
Kim , I will be on 32 all morning . Come down whenever you get a minute . Chris
When I said spread I didn't mean graph the basis as opposed to the fixed price ( these graphs are essentially identical to the first ones you did ) I want a graph of the relationship ( spread ) between the 2 points . i.e . if Nov-Mar Sumas was marked at 0.20 and Nov-Mar Aeco was marked at ( 0.45 ) the Nov-Mar Sumas Aeco spread would be 0.65 . Sorry if I wasn't clear . Call me with any ? s . Chris
I didn't get yesterday's ops package . Can you make sure I get it today . Chris
Carlos , Could you run a report that shows all the deals in my books ( Financial and Gas Daily ) as of close of business on Friday ( Sept.14) . I doubt I will do any trading over the next couple of days but you should probably wait until tommorow afternoon to run it . Chris
No luck graphing those spreads ? Chris
Kim , I will be on 32 all day . Give me a call or stop by . Chris
Forget that last message . Apparently my e-mail just updated . Chris
I would like an indoor stall in Ernst and Young . Non-reserved . Chris
Glad to hear that everything is OK . I will give you a call in a couple of days when things settle down . Hopefully air traffic will resume soon because I am stuck living in the Hyatt in Houston . Chris
Wayne , I was talking to Kevin Presto and he mentioned that you have a plane going to Portland . I need to get to Calgary and Kevin suggested I look into catching a ride with you and getting them to swing north and drop me off on their way back . Can you let me know when you plan to leave and if it isn't an inconvience I will talk to Lavo and see if he is OK with it . Chris Dorland
Carlos , If he is in Houston don't count on him doing it . I won't be getting out of here untill tommorow at the earliest and I am thinking it is going to be Friday or Saturday . Chris
Dwayne , As you can Imagine things in the US have been a little crazy which is why I haven't gotten back to you untill now . I will hopefully be in Calgary on Monday and will give you a call then . My office number in Calgary is 974-6910 . Are the windows on that truck tinted ?
How about 2002's ? I was just thinking there would be incentives on 2001's . Chris
Kim I briefly scanned the contract you delivered this morning and it appears fine except for the salary listed in exhibit A ( US salary but in CND dollars ) which is incorrect . As I will be in Calgary in Monday the corrected version should probably just be sent to Dawn . Chris
Carlos These are the trades I did today . Sold 5000 Oct Rocks ( 0.485 ) EOL and Cowan is working an order to buy 20000 mm/d of Oct Aeco basis vs . DI in us/mm at ( 0.54 ) Chris
That's fine . Thanx for trying . Chris
Willis , Can you do me a favor and get my name taken off the Brad Galante e-mail list for plant outages ? Chris
Hopefully I can get there sometime before the snow falls . Chris
One more trade . Sold 1000 gj/d Aeco DI c/gj to Cowan at 3.175 ( EOL ) Just to balance .
Chris

Please contact me if you need any further info . or with any questions . Thank you , Chris Dorland

Grigs , I talked to Lambie ( our resident produciton and reserve expert ) about this and he thought it was highly unlikely that producers would shut in eastern rocks production for a couple of reasons . Apparently , if you shut in coal bed methane production there is a serious risk that the well will "water out" either ruining the well or causing 6 months to a year of production delays . Also , it seem logistically unlikely due to the small production volumes associated with each individual well ( 100-500 mm/d) . In Chris's opinion coal bed methane would be some of the last production we would ever see shut in . Hope this helps . Let me know if you learn anything further . Chris
Did you receive the POA ? Chris
I'm in and hopefully I can even find a date . Chris
They are wrong . Chris
Nice Are you going to TO ?
Just wondering if you guys have talked to any storage guys in the PNW about storage deals for this Nov to next summer ect . The market is essentially saying that JP storage is worthless for this winter ( Nov-Dec ) and I don't think that should be the case . I think there is free money on the table for someone like Puget or Avista to roll their scheduled storage withdrawls to next summer . Let me know if you have any thoughts . Chris
Maria , That is pretty close but we don't even have real guns.. . just snowballs... . How are things going down there ? I am pretty much settled now but still waiting for a bunch of furniture so my house is pretty empty . Hope all is well . Chris

Thanx for only sending the bullish reports . They helped me come in from off the ledge .
Dave , I just wanted to touch base with you on the cash trade that you intermediated between Stephane and Cascade this morning . I don't really feel that it is Stephane's responsibility to manage Cascades price risk and I think that you are out of line for accusing him of running over your customer . If you would like we could look at doing an MSA with Cascade where by we could sell them gas at Sumas DI . Chris
John , How is Dina doing ? Be sure to let us know when she has the baby/ Chris

Did I send you this ?
What press ? All the news I've read is great . You're on crack .
Sorry to freak on you . I'm a little stressed . Do what you think is right but never use market orders on option . It is a free option for the market maker to fuck you .
Last trade 0.70 . Success has worked for me so far .
Judy That is what I thought . Have you heard anything regarding my refund ? Did they trace the check ? Let me know . Chris Dorland

As far a snowboarding I'm not sure if I am going to be able to get out before christmas . I am coming to Red Deer on Saturday for the night and will pick up my board but the girl I am seeing is going home for XMas on the 20th and I think it would be bad if I made plans to going skiing next weekend .

Graduated in 1997 with an HBA from The Richard Ivey School of Business ( University of Western Ontario ) Started at Enron in may 97 as an analyst in the trading group working for Lavorato doing fundament analysis and acting as Lavo's trading assistant ( slave ) Started out trading BC Cash desk in June of 98 . Moved over to trade short term Aeco in Sept 99 . Did that for a year . Mike McDermott and Laird can let you know if I was any good . Went to Houston in Sept 2000 to trade east power . Traded Cinergy cash desk and worked next to Fletch Sturm ( Cinergy Term Trader ) for a year . Learned a little bit about trading from him . You know the rest . What are her measurements again . 26 36 26 Can that be right ?
Too bad . Going back to calgary on the 26th .
try to watch what you say over the shout box .
I actually invited him thinking there was no way he would come . Damn
I don't need to ask . Every party Dave has is BYOC
Are we going at 6 or 6:30 . I don't care .
I can't bomard you with witty remarks if you aren't on IM
Hi everyone ! Once again I find myself being tasked by Geof Storey . Houston has requested that we make lists of all applications that we use and also that we consolidate all of the files ( models and data ) that are critical to our business ( I don't think MP3's count ) into one directory on the network . This is so that these items can be included in the proposed deal with newco . The Calgary Trading group has set up a directory on I:/trading/newco and I think if each group did the same that would be great . Each group should probably have one person in charge of the directory so there isn't any overlap . Call me with any ? 's/ Chris
Did big brother kick you off IM ?

Mike I provided that level of detail for calgary trading and marketing . I haven't seen the file Richard Mckeel created so I wouldn't know what is in it . Seems like we have about 3 different people working on the same project . So my answer is I don't know . Chris

Berkeley , California bans U.S . Flags from being displayed on city fire trucks because they didn't want to offend anyone in the community . In an "act of tolerance" the head of the public library at Florida Gulf Coast University ordered all "Proud to be an American" signs removed so as to not offend international students . I , for one , am quite disturbed by these actions of so-called American citizens; and I am tired of this nation worrying about whether or not we are offending some individual or their culture . Since the terrorist attacks on September 11 , we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of Americans . However , the dust from the attacks had barely settled in New York and Washington D.C . when the "politically correct" crowd began complaining about the possibility that our patriotism was offending others . I am not against immigration , nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is seeking a better life by coming to America . In fact , our country's population is almost entirely comprised of descendants of immigrants; however , there are a few things that those who have recently come to our country , and apparently some native Americans , need to understand . First of all , it is not our responsibility to continually try not to offend you in any way . This idea of America being a multi-cultural community has served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity . As Americans , we have our own culture , our own society , our own language , and our own lifestyle . This culture , called the "American Way" has been developed over centuries of struggles , trials , and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom . Our forefathers fought , bled , and died at places such as Bunker Hill , Antietam , San Juan , Iwo Jima , Normandy , Korea , Vietnam . We speak English , not Spanish , Arabic , Chinese , Japanese , Russian , or any other language . Therefore , if you wish to become part of our society -- learn our language ! "In God We Trust" is our national motto . This is not some off-the-wall , Christian , Right Wing , political slogan -- it is our national motto . It is engraved in stone in the House of Representatives in our Capitol and it is printed on our currency . We adopted this motto because Christian men and women , on Christian principles , founded this nation; and this is clearly documented throughout our history . If it is appropriate for our motto to be inscribed in the halls of our highest level of Government , then it is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools . God is in our pledge , our National Anthem , nearly every patriotic song , and in our founding documents . We honor His birth , death , and resurrection as holidays , and we turn to Him in prayer in times of crisis . If God offends you , then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home , because God is part of our culture and we are proud to have Him . We are proud of our heritage and those who have so honorably defended our freedoms . We celebrate Independence Day , Memorial Day , Veterans Day , and Flag Day . We have parades , picnics , and barbecues where we proudly wave our flag . As an American , I have the right to wave my flag , sing my national anthem , quote my national motto , and cite my pledge whenever and wherever I choose . If the Stars and Stripes offend you , or you don't like Uncle Sam , then you should seriously consider a move to another part of this planet . The American culture is our way of life , our heritage , and we are proud of it . We are happy with our culture and have no desire to change , and we really don't care how you did things where you came from . We are Americans , like it or not , this is our country , our land , and our lifestyle . Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his opinion about our government , culture , or society , and we will allow you every opportunity to do so . But once you are done complaining , whining , and griping about our flag , our pledge , our national motto , or our way of life , I highly encourage you take advantage of one other great American freedom , the right to leave . Barry Loudermilk If you agree , pass this onto other Americans! ! It is time to take a stand! !

Thanks , Don An extension of the Services contract with Manitoba ( MHEB ) has been signed and begins tomorrow , November 1st . In addition to purchasing from MHEB , we need to focus heavily on selling to MHEB . With the change of season , MHEB may frequently be short .

Frank was excited about his new rifle . So , he went bear hunting . He spotted a small brown bear and shot it . There was then a tap on his shoulder , and he turned around to see a big black bear . The black bear said: "You've got two choices . I either maul you to death or we have rough sex." Frank decided to bend over . Even though he felt sore for two weeks , Frank soon recovered and vowed revenge . He headed out on another trip where he found the black bear and shot it . There was another tap on his shoulder . This time a huge grizzly bear stood right next to him . The grizzly said: "That was a huge mistake , Frank . You've got two choices . Either I maul you to death or we have REALLY rough sex."Again , Frank thought it was better to comply . Although he survived , it would take several months before Frankfinally recovered . Outraged he headed back to the woods , managed totrack down the grizzly and shot it . He felt sweet revenge , but then there was a tap on his shoulder . He turned around to find a giant polar bear standing there . The polar bear said: "Admit it , Frank , you don't come here for the hunting , do you?"

I got your e-mail address from Andrea Korth Walters the other day . I tried to get a hold of you earlier in the year , to no avail . Just wanted to catch up , and go drink a beer and eat a cheeseburger . Doing fine down here in Houston . I bought a house in League City . In addition , I asked Shannon to marry me but that fell through during the summer . We are trying to see if we can salvage any of the relationship . I am doing well at Enron , managing the real-time power trading desk and trading . Enron , as you have seen in the paper , is experiencing some trouble . We are reasonably sure we will merge with Dynegy in mid to late 2002 . Family is doing well; my sister is about to have her second baby . Travis is back from his year and a half tour in Europe , and took a position with Cemex as an account manager . Dad is about 3/4 retired and he and mom are doing a fair amount of hunting & fishing . Travis & I are gonna spend Thanksgiving in West Texas , deer hunting . How's life in Hooterville ? I heard that you are full on retired ! FANTASTIC ! What are you doing these days to keep yourself busy ? Hopefully consuming large quantities of beer & tequila and blowing you eardrums out with Jimmy Buffett !

Hey , I just figures something out . The only email messages that you are getting , from me , are the ones where I am replying to you .

So what's been goin' on ? You never returned my call last week . How's the B&B project ? I heard supper with R & S & R & M went well , except for you having some G.I . problems . Drop me a line or call if you want to catch a movie or grab supper some time . Take care , Don

Brookhaven Energy Project Permit Application Ruled Complete by New York State Regulators ( London - 17 August 2001 ) International Power plc , one of the world's leading independent power producers , today announces that the New York State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment has accepted as complete its application to build the Brookhaven Energy Project on Long Island . The Siting Board's decision marks the beginning of the State's formal review process , and is a key regulatory milestone for the 580- megawatt natural gas fired electric generating facility . The ruling kicks- off a yearlong review process that will involve public hearings . International Power submitted the application for their proposed energy facility with the Siting Board , as required under Article X of the State of New York Public Service Law , on June 25 , 2001 . This application , which the State ruled as meeting the minimum requirements for compliance , addresses all of the pertinent environmental and siting issues of the project , including its design , location , fuel use , and air and water quality . "The New York Siting Board's ruling puts us a step closer to providing Long Island with a clean and affordable new source of electric power," said Peter Giller , International Power's Chief Executive Officer . "We are planning to begin construction of Brookhaven in the third quarter of next year and expect to have the plant in service by the end of 2004," he added . For additional information , please contact: Media contact: ( Europe ) Media & Investor contact: ( United States ) Paul Parshley Notes to Editors- The Brookhaven Energy project is proposed for development on 28 acres of industrially zoned land just south of the Long Island Expressway at exit 66 and along the southeast corner of Sills Road in the Town of Brookhaven . When completed , the plant will provide enough energy to power over half a million homes . The project will also result in additional significant benefits to the region , including job creation and substantial tax benefits . International Power plc is one of the world's leading independent electric generating companies with over 8,850 MW ( net ) in operation , 2,350 MW ( net ) under construction and approximately 8,000 MW ( net ) in advanced development . Among the countries where International Power has operating facilities are Australia , the United States , the United Kingdom , the Czech Republic , Portugal , Turkey , Malaysia , Pakistan , and Thailand . International Power was created from the demerger of National Power , and its shares began trading independently on the London Stock Exchange and as ADRs on the New York Stock Exchange on 2 October 2000 . The ticker symbol on both stock exchanges is "IPR" . To unsubscribe please go to

Right now they are using the delta @ Zone K x 14 days of exposure . Thanks Tom

While trading on EOL or moving physical power you should not have a position larger than 100 MW . If you find yourself at these positions while trading EOL you should then widen your market so that you do not take on a larger position . If you have any questions please let me know . I would recommend that you put EOL product properties on manage stack.. . then you will be able to widen your market easily when your position reaches the 100 MW limit . Paul

Gary , We spoke last week about opportunities that your company currently has open . Currently , I am making markets on Enron Online for the PJM cash and term off peak market . In addition , I still manage the Northeast Physical book for the Northeast ( PJM , NYISO , and NEPOOL ) and manage the Northeast real time trading desk . I also have participated in the PJM FTR and NYISO TCC market in my tenure here at Enron . The opportunities that I would most be interested are those located here in the Houston area . My second choice would then be those positions located in Florida . I look forward to talking to you soon . Paul D . Thomas East Power Trading

David , Diana Allen and the IT team are currently working on resovling the bad Zone P day ahead and real time data . Diana told me that it was pulling the PJM data . As far as the shift notes go: I talked to Rob Benson about the shift notes and he said that they have improved greatly . The PJM summary page is pretty accurate ( usually w/in 50 cents of the actual number) . The link for the spreadsheet is: .  . you might have been using an old version . I will continue to manage the Northeast physical book . It allows me to effectively hedge my long or short position in the off peak market . Paul . While writing the e-mail Diana said that she fixed the Zone P problem .

Sorry for saying that. . did not mean to upset my honey . I am tired . Love ME : (
Rebecca , Let me know if you see any differences . Paul
Well Aaron , It is great to hear that you are doing well . Yes , Raquel and I (  the same gal I was dating at Genesis ) ended up tying the knot in late April in Rio . We got married in small church on the Lagoa , quite a beautiful place to get married . Above the church sat the giant statue of Christ the Redeemer looking down on us . My parents , family and friends attended and I know what you mean by fish out of the water ! We bought a house over off of Buffalo and Braeswood . I too have learned a lot about fixing up homes , it is something that I have actually begun to enjoy . The house is great except for the mortgage that we owe to the bank . We are now considering paying it off , however I am not sure for how much longer we will live there . Therefore , not sure if we really want to pay it off . As far as children go , we are still waiting for the right time . I imagine we will have one in a year or so.. . right now we are enjoying taking vacations on a whim . Went to Rio in early Sept and got stuck there for week and 1/2 due to the terrorist attacks . Not such a bad place to be stuck . I definitely would encourage you to take a trip there . It is different from most great cities in the world . For example Paris , Rome , London , NYC are all famous for the great buildings , etc.. . however , Rio is one of the most naturally beautiful places you will ever see ( as far as a city settings go) . The huge majestic tropical mountains merging with the white sand beaches and blue sea . It is the cidade maravillosa!! ! Take care and have a great Christmas . Paul
Aaron , The house we live in is about 1700 Sq foot. . older home that needed some fixing up . At the time I thought we paid too much , however prices in the neighborhood skyrocketed just after we bought the home . The Houston Texans ( a very original name ) have developed the new stadium and have torn down some of the seedier hotels in the area in their wake . Also , they have totally redone South Main Blvd creating a nice thoroughfare . The area is experincing a lot of renovation which is adding value to the neighborhood ! However , home values go up and down just like the stock market . Most important thing is that we like the home and are very comfortable there . When we had the house remodeled it was a nightmare , I think the guy was an alcoholic and he did a half ass job . I prefer to do it myself , I like the way it looks when I do it and it is whole lot cheaper . One day the contractor almost died in the house.. . he lost his tooth and proceeded to take a bunch of Advil to ease the pain; however he did this on an empty stomach . He had to be rushed to the hospital and was there for a week ! He ended up returning and finishing the job?!? ! Anyways , I have to say that it was a good learning experience and next time I will have a better idea on how to get things done . It was hard to organize and quality assure the job since I had just started a demanding job here at Enron . All in all , I think France or US you run into the same types of problems with contractors . Talking about wild flowers and plants. . the same is true for Costa Rica . Plants that only grow indoors with great care in Houston grow like weeds in Costa Rica . I recommend that on your places to go list . Merry Christmas , Feliz Natal , and Feliz Navidad Later Paul
This is good hoon.. . look

Below are the assumptions agreed for booking the New Albany spread option: EPMI East Power Book pays New Albany a fixed demand charge for the next 5 years as follows: As consideration for the demand charge , EPMI has the right to "toll" gas through the facility and receive power in return at a fixed heat rate conversion factor of 12.5 MMBtu/Mwh . In addition EPMI will pay New Albany $1000 per start ( for maintenance reserve fund ) and $1.00/Mwh for variable operating costs . The New Albany , LLC will receive an 8% return on capital . Book value will be depreciated from $409/kW basis on 1/1/2001 to $336/kW on 12/31/2005 . The facility output assumption is 360 MW with a 95% availability in the summer and 75% availability in the winter . Jenny - Please revise the booking of New Albany in Rogers book effective tonight .
Below are the EPMI proposed bid/offer spreads for EES . These are very aggressive markets given the liquidity issues and regulatory uncertainty that still exist in the Eastern Interconnect . There are no other counterparties in the market that will consistently make the proposed 2-ways .
The following is the understanding I have with Chris Calger regarding Scott Healy's involvement in East Power initiatives: Since Auburndale is effectively dead , Scott will no longer be involved on this project . Scott will support the Haywood , Georgia , & Calvert City development site sales through Q1 2001 , with East Power getting 100% of the P&L value and Scott Healy getting personal performance credit . If Ben elects to continue to use Scott's services beyond Q1 2001 , a value sharing agreement between Ben , Calger and myself will have to be agreed upon . Jeff Ader will make a decision ( after consultation with me ) as to Scott's continued involvement on the fuel cell tax monetization and Dighton restructuring project . If Jeff makes the decision that Scott needs to remain actively involved in order to close the transaction , a value sharing agreement will be made between Jeff , Calger , and myself . The value allocation % will be agreed upon upfront within the next week . If a fair value sharing agreement cannot be reached , Jeff will transition responsibility to another member of his origination team . Chris - Do you agree with the above description ?
New Albany will accept proposal assuming my deductible is limited to $1 million per occurence and my BI deductible is limited to 30 days and includes full replacement revenue ( less marginal fuel costs ) after the 30 day period .
John Dorbone ( sp?) . You can get his phone # on Gleannochfarms.com web site . They have 4 custom builders ( Tom Bailey , Pine Oak , Country Village , and Tom Hale) . They recently fired Coventry and Frederick Harris . I have not made a decision yet , but I am considering Gleannloch as an alternative . It would be a big positive for me if you could build the house .
I would recommend sitting with the real-time traders ( they trade , reserve transmission and schedule the power in real-time) . You can coordinate with me .
FYI - Please follow-up .

No I'm not OK with this . We have never paid in the past . Is it different if we request 02 only ?
Willis is an Manager candidate
I tore the Agreement up because he would not sign it .
The first report looked good , however , I would like to see the owner name , and technical configuration . In addition , I would like pictures of each facility .
As I told John this morning , we have similar issues with Var in the East . The correlations between gas & power for the entire curve are based on the front month and the correlations between regions are also based on the front month . I have requested changes to the Var calc several months back and have been assured it will be completed by the research group soon .
Can you send me another copy of the pros/cons matrix and the function descriptions . Thanks .
I gave you his resume 3 months ago . I am sending another copy upstairs today . He would be a manager level hire . No , he is not the ex-metals trader . I would like to hire this guy ASAP .
Are you OK with this ?
FYI - Another opportunity for mid-market to extract value from the market .
Please print and put in binder for me ( 4 tabs for Q1 , Q2 , Q3 , Q4) . Thanks .
What is this ?
What is their proposal ?
Doug Gilbert-Smith , fletch sturm , rogers herndon , rob benson , and mark dana davis .
Can I get the interview package ( including resume ) Thanks .
I need a summary on this issue . Thanks .
A written summary is fine .
The genco room needs to be with power and the size needs to be increased as requested by Lloyd Will .
Joe is set to rotate to real-time MW on June 1 and Bill Rust is taking his scheduling place . I have no problem with Joe going with you . With respect to Narsima , timing may be an issue ( transition) , however , I should be able to make that happen as well . With Busby , Bernie , Joe and Narsima ( timing an issue) , you have some competent support at the outset In addition , there is almost certainly some capable people within the 200 person existing organization that have had no management direction and no discipline . Hopefully , the dust settles and the transition can start next Monday . We also need to figure out what we do with your existing positions .
No electronic copy - Evelyn saved a hard copy . The quote was related to Enron's activity with TVA .
Let's discuss this at our 3:00 pm meeting today . Please put on agenda . Thanks .
I will do the interview . Please schedule with my asst . ( TJ Black at 3-5800 )
Tuesday April 17th .
I would like to acknowledge David Portz for his hard work and diligence in drafting and actively supporting the negotiation of the Green Mountain Power all-requirements transaction in ERCOT . David worked long hours ensuring all tight timelines were met and facilitated quick contract turnarounds on numerous occasions . In addition to Green Mountain , David has exhibited the same hard work and diligence on other Texas transactions ( San Antonio , misc . QSE contracts , etc. )
I'm not in the business of providing firm pricing via e-mail . As always , all prices from the desk are indicative until customer is ready to pull the trigger . As a rule of thumb , prices are good for about 15 minutes . Therefore , let's be clear with the counterparty that we are in a volatile energy market with pricing moving 5-10% on some days . For example , summer power is down $20.00/Mwh over the past week and June is down $10/Mwh . Summer 02 and summer 03 are down $7-8/Mwh over the past 3 days . Thanks .
I forgot to mention that today's curves will be down another 5% , therefore , the prices in the spreadsheet are too high .
Thanks for the hard copies . Can you please send me an e-mail with an electronic copy .
I received them . Thanks .
No , I have sent 3 copies to Lavo .
No development is easy . I see nothing on your list that cannot be overcome . Please develop a plan to have a 150 MW on-line my May 02 with rented diesel equipment . We would install the diesels at OPPD distribution substations . We may have to do 15 different installations to acheive the desired result . Last year Com-Ed and IPL completed an installation with CATs in 3 months . The key is to get OPPD to cooperate with interconnections at the distribution substations and we will get credit for losses . Please work with Terri and Ed . If you need any additional info after working through a plan with Terri and Ed , please let me know .
Agreed . Thanks . FYI - Can you help Ron sort through these issues . With OPPD's cooperation , we can easily overcome these issues and make May 02 in-service for 150 MW of rented diesel generation installed at OPPD distribution substations .
500k right now . I am prepared to pay a $1 million development fee as well .
Highly Confidential
My candidates are already through their rotations and are essentially finished with what we have defined as the trading track .
White water rafting in Colorado .
I submitted my request to Kim Melodick approx . 1 week ago . Kim - Please make sure Lavo and Louise have my wish list for Analyst and Associate candidates .
Ground pictures from various angles will do . My expectation is that I will continue to get weekly updates and the booklet I described will contain the info I requested in an organized manner . Thanks .
Yes it is irrelevant . Now that we have competent risk managers making the decision , they will know how to effectively hedge these deals . Furthermore , pricing is always available on demand . When each trader has 30-40 products to manage in a volatile market , they are not necessarily going to put 03-10 for peak and off-peak in every region . It becomes very cumbersome to manage the year over year spreads when the front is moving so violently .
As you probably know , Rogers ( in the East ) and Don ( in the West ) will be working directly with the wholesale desk . Tim and I will ensure a fair balance is achieved between retail and wholesale . As an Enron shareholder , I fully appreciate that we need explosive growth and profitability out of EES , particularly with reduced volatility in gas and power markets over the next several years . I am commited to ensuring that the retail risk management organization is offered all the tools , information , systems , competitive pricing , etc . to allow EES to offer fully bundled competitively priced products to retail customers . I look forward to working with you and Dave in continuing to grow this business .
Willis should be an Associate trading track position . I forgot to clarify with Kim on original offer . Remember , we have to go through Paul Johnson at Austin Energy . I would like to get the offer letter out today .
I would like 6 Analysts and 4 Associates . I provided my top 20 wish list to Lavo last week . Thanks .
Plant development should focus on sites in NY City . You assumptions are correct related to NE .
Thanks for the update John . I have a great personal relationship with Paul Posoli ( run there whole shop) , so if you need anything let me know .
Great trading asset , but fixed costs are enormous . The entire value proposition is based upon $15/Mwh spread between peak and off-peak ( which is clearly there today) . My view is this spread collapses over time due to DSM/DG/real-time pricing and true hourly price signals in pool based markets . We should look at the asset , but recognize the fixed costs are huge .
In the interim , Fletch and I will assume responsibility . Obviously , we will be trying to identify a replacement over the next couple of months . We will be doing some position re-alignment today - transferring some of Rogers positions to Fletch and/or myself at tonight's mids . I will then re-sell/re-buy some positions back to Rogers which cancel out opposite positions in the retail book . I will give you the specifics before we mark .
We should be pursuing the buyout and asset development simultaneously and the most economic alternative will prevail .
Sounds good . I think we will significant synergy benefits immediately . The cultural barriers will be broken down and information will flow from wholesale to retail and vice versa .
If I can find it .
I'm sure Vlady can get it to you . In general , I don't save my e-mails .
I would like another 15" monitor mounted on my trading desk . When can I get this done .
I did look and couldn't find it .
Thanks Charles and I agree with your conclusion - a competitive market will not exist unless the tools create a clear price signal for all congestion .
I need prudency C summaries ASAP . Thanks .
I talked with Gary Hickerson and I am OK with granting Michelle Cisneros access for her specific valuation purpose ( pricing access is for 2 years only) .
Fletch and I are dividing up Rogers postions ( Fletch taking Peak , I'm taking Off-Peak) . To make it fair on everyone , I am allowing Rogers to take $4 million from Prudency C attached to JEA . ( Rogers has created this positive balance himself over the past 12 months with deals he has done in FL & SOCO) . In addition , I will be assuming all customer deals ( VEPCO , JEA , Associated , MPMUC) . We will mark the curves in Entergy and TVA where Fletch is comfortable taking the position ( off-peak also needs to be marked down) . The $4 million from prudency will absorb most of the curve shift . All of Rogers postions will stay in Wholesale . All parties come out with a fair solution .
Lloyd Will , Juan Hernandez and Don Baughman ( plus Kayne Coulter ) should be the East Power reps at this meeting .
Please begin working on filling our Associated short position in 02 . I would like to take this risk off the books . In addition , please find out what a buy-out of VEPCO would cost us . With Rogers transitioning to run our retail risk management , I would like to clean up our customer positions . We also need to continue to explore a JEA buy-out . Thanks .
His resume looked good . I'm OK with the hire .
Fine . Use the same charge code you have been using .
If it becomes an asset management deal , we need to involve the services desk ( Tom May and Jeff Miller) . The trading & marketing outsourcing deal is the most appealing to me .
No development as of yet .
Next week is better . Please schedule an afternoon appt . with my asst . ( Tamara Black 3-5800 )
If you don't get a response from Elizabeth , just call her or walk up to the legal floor . On something as important as this , I would go directly to Elizabeth's office .
For 01 and 02 , congestion/energy uplift/transmission uplift is $3.50 to $4.50/Mwh . Current EES curves are light in this area . For 03 & beyond when LMP is adopted in NE ISO and socialized allocation is eliminated , the congestion component alone in the Boston area will be well over $10/Mwh ( based on actual congestion $'s from May 99 to date in the Boston area) . Much like the Dallas situation , these locational congestion charges can be significant and Rogers and Don will begin immediately developing delivered energy pricing curves for specific locations that go well beyond the wholesale pricing points we mark right now . I hope this helps .
I think there a great DG opportunities in both Boston and Manhattan . We will be working hard over the next several weeks to get proper city-gate curves in place to reflect true location marginal pricing , particularly in areas where we have exposure and new deal activity . thanks .
Kim , Add another 8-10 for retail risk management . You can take from the same list I have already provided to you and Lavo .
I need project names next to these que spots , including the project sponsor . I can't make a determination unless I know the specific project and the project owner .
I still need the info I requested to comment intelligently .
Attend .
ICAP exposure needs to be capped at the default price ( currently 8.75/kW/mo) . Because Zone J is deficient capacity , the market is actually trading higher than the default rate . In addition , we need to scrub the ancillary components .
We need to add Jay Lewis and 4-5 people with T&D tariff knowledge to the curve team as well . This process will entail specific wholesale curves plus a complete review of the T&D tariff curves . These teams need to work together to ensure the sum of the parts equal the whole . I am assuming everyone on the team agrees .
We have a # of counterparties whom credit will allow daily trading and/or balance of month trading ( with no forward trading) . It would be much more efficient for the trading organization and the counterparties to have functionality within EOL that allowed for better credit screening . We have moved away from the broker markets , and the current screening mechanism forces us to trade in the broker market with credit limited counterparties . I would like to get this changed ASAP , if possible . Thanks .
Friday is a terrible day for tours in power . My entire desk leaves at 2:00 pm on Friday . I would suggest the gas floor for this tour . The customer will be very unimpressed if we have limited staff here in the middle of the day .
Remember our deal . After trading day is over ( for next 2 months) , you stay until the risk calcs are done and help in whatever manner is necessary to improve the process . In addition , you should take responsibility for calcing the ERCOT books ( term and cash) .
Can we make 02 . FPL needs 02 start dates .
Is JEA deal booked against FL/GA curve or SERC curve ?
Sounds like you are on the team . I am assuming you will start full-time on Monday . Whalley has already assured me you will be part of this re-build process which obviously requires full-time focus . Please confirm .
Thanks . It never hurts to ask .
Your perception is correct . Remember 4 years of culture is at work here . I told Rogers this morning , we have to move to 35 , clearly define the process for pricing deals , and begin changing the mindset of the marketing organization with respect to value . The whole situation on 6 is considerably worse than I originally thought .
Have you spoke to Greg Whalley about Kristen Albrecht , Dierdra McCaffery , Jim Brysch , and Heather Kendall . We need to move forward on putting these teams together , and the above individuals were key candidates indentified to re-build the retail risk management organization over the next 6-9 months . I would like to hear back today on how we plan on proceeding with these individuals . Thanks .
Thanks .
East Power is flat .
Yes , you are correct . Todd is making the changes I requested and we probably have at least another 2 weeks before I get a final plan . With respect to your latest Contract , I have 2 minor changes . The only one with any significance is the counterparty name . I expect Mitchell-Carroll Custom Homes to be the signator to this Agreement . Having a "shell" LLC entiity sign the Contract would be like me having my step-son sign the Contract . I want the "real" balance sheet to be on the hook for meeting the contractual obligations , much like you want my personal balance sheet/income statement to be the responsible financial counterparty . The other change was wording and does not effect the contract intent . Talk to you soon .
I am interested in single family residences at Deering Bay , specifically lots .
What free money . If you are referring to the contract , it was not enough free money .
Yes , I agree . Remember , John has asked to go through a deal and this is a significant transaction . I suggest going through the deal over lunch .
The only way the coal deal will go forward is if you prove you can get long term supply ( pet coke , PRB , other , etc. ) for $1.00-1.15/MMBtu delivered to the site . The economics need to show a 8-10% IRR in order to justify the commodity risk . In addition , we should explore IGCC in Florida . The gas/coal spread is much larger in this market and the proforma economics would be much better .
Definitely attend .
He's solid .
We'll discuss when you get back .
Thanks Michelle . Good job .
Why not use the actual correlations we have observed over the past 18 months . Simply calculate forward gas price movement to forward power price movement ( Bal 01 , 02 , 03 , etc.)on a curve by curve basis , and you will find gas/power correlations on a forward basis are very high ( 80+%) , at least in the Eastern markets .
I will only be attending the first 90 minutes of this meeting , so adjust the emission meeting to reflect that . Thanks .
This is a classic . I want to bring this guy in for an interview . If he is as good as he says he is , we have to hire the guy . You will get some good laughs .
No trading . It's a NERC holiday .
This will be done by early next week at the the latest .
Another addition to the team . Sounds good . I talk to Tim about twice a week .
Add $0.50/Mwh to the off-peak component of the 7x24 price and everything else looks fine .
After talking with Rogers , it sounds like a conference call at 1:00 pm tommorow would be more productive . Rogers and Don are still working through logistics of the move to the 6th floor and solidifying some of personnel issues . Does 1:00 pm tommorow work for you ? We can call you from my office .
We have this already by comparing daily reports . I simply look at the change in daily postions . Both Lavo and I are OK with the current reports .
Done .
I already read this article . Price action is wicked bearish on our stock right now . Fortunately , I have been doing a good bit of hedging my long Enron position .
Is this going to get done ? My sense is this would reduces energy uplift charges and reduce energy clearing prices . Do you agree ?
Did Rogers sign his contract or is he still holding out ?
I think I could make a case for decreasing ECP , because some of the uplift actually sneaks into the ECP ( must run units for 6 hours etc.) . I would argue that the pool will dispatch more competitively when generators know that a peaker can run for 30 minutes at $100/Mwh . This forces baseload units to offer very competitive pricing for all hours to ensure dispatch . We have seen what the additional peakers in the East does to volatility and energy clearing prices , in general . What are your thoughts ?
Rogers will do a fine job with this group presentation . I think it is important that Rogers builds credibility with the marketing organization . I'm sure you are OK with this .
I confirmed he signed a couple weeks ago .
Done . I'll come him today .
Sounds interesting . Clearly , we would pay a some premium on the front end for the Boston location . Work directly with Dana on the specifics .
I didn't receive any home information . I'm interested in resale homes , new homes and lots . Thanks .
What is the 11:00 deadline for ? I should be able to sign on my timeline .
If they are still available , I'll take them .
I was looking for tommorow . I'll pass on tonight . Thanks .
I agree .
The MTM amount needs to be gross margin , not revenues . What deal was done for summer Cinergy on Friday ? Did Rogers sign off on all of the BECO deals ?
We have approx 120 total seats for retail risk management on the 5th floor . I think its important to put all power related retail functions ( risk management , tariffs , structuring , risk reporting , etc. ) on the 5th floor . If you do this , then there will not be room for the retail gas group , which means you need to work with Tammy Shephard and Wes Colwell to get room on the 6th floor for retail gas .
Happy to do it .
Approved .
Any news on the diesel units installed at OPPD substations ?
I think we should install 15 minute metering capability and start serving these customers physically . In order to grow this business , we need to find out if we can serve retail load directly in an efficient and cost-effective manner . The quicker we can achieve physical delivery capability , the quicker we can define our true cost of serving these customers .
Good info on new plants . Lloyd - Can we get this spreadsheet on our website under fundies tab . Thanks .
I do not use .
I would say 2,000,000 for Lavo approval . Whether than signature , I would go through deal specifics and get verbal approval .
Sounds good . We may want to consider diesel installation for Lincoln Electric as well . I am beginning to think that diesel installations is our primary solution to cover OPPD short for May-Oct 02 .
Fine .
This is the spread option which I am able to reconcile . The big P&L discrepancy is on the pure TVE fixed price positions which are off by $1 million+ . Please continue to reconcile with Grace Kim . Thanks .
Yes .
Please schedule a meeting with TJ Black ( 3-5800 )
Please handle . Thanks
Approved
I talked to Julie Havilend about Paine Webber keeping my on-line portfolio manager updated with all of my Enron options . Entering options is tricky and I was hoping you can provide that service for me . Let me know .
Myself and all of my desk heads will be interviewing candidates Wednesday from 1:00 to 5:00 pm .
Quarterly .
Rogers can be reached by e-mail at drherndon@aol.com . He would like updates on activities everyday if possible . Thanks .
I need approval for this ERCOT Schedule C . The e-mail from Stacey outlines the details . Thanks .
Keep it up . Our markets are getting even tighter .
Deny the request and the requester needs to send a formal request directly to me with solid justification .
Because we have lost several people to retail risk management ( Rogers Herndon , Narsima Misra , Jim Homco , etc. ) and John Forney has moved to ERCOT hourly , I have been forced to manage an EOL stack for multiple markets . Therefore , all tours during trading hours ( 6:30 am to 3:30 pm ) will have to be provided by non-trading personnel . Sorry , but we are in our busiest season and I cannot afford to have my traders away from the desk for even 10 minutes .
Looks great .
Green Mountain prudency has been approved by Lavo .
Yes we are aware . thanks .
Edison International purchased all of Com-Ed's gas and coal plants approx . 2 years ago and now sells the output of these plants back to Com-Ed through 2004 . The operators of the plant are threatening a strike and it could have huge implications with plant availability until replacement operators could be found . I would like your group to closely monitor this situation and provide me daily feedback .
I don't agree with either 7 or 8 . The 0.1 LOLP generally results in 20-25% reserve margins which are excessive . Reserve margin is a meaningless measure in an efficient commodity market because supply and demand adjust to price signals to keep the market in balance . My view is that ICAP should be eliminated completely and , if utilized , transitional only for a 1-2 year period . The other alternative is the ISO to have a reliability auction whereby quick-start units contract directly with an ISO for meeting reliability reserve reqs .
Several names in my Lotus Address Book that did not transfer to the new Outlook platform . The names that did not transfer have text next to them . For exampe , Todd Rice did not transfer and his name on Lotus Notes has "Office Number" next to it . There are several other examples of this . thanks .
Send to Lloyd Will for his review . Thanks .
Doesn't OATI already do this ?
I would like a consolidated report on all generation projects monitored to date . My recollection was we had identified approx . 50-75 projects to monitor . thanks .
How come you never show EOL #'s for East Power . I would like to see East Power included in the e-mail report . thanks .
Please handle . Thanks .
Looks great . Thanks .
I have not hired a replacement yet . No meeting required until I find a replacement . Thanks .
The highlights I would focus on are: 1 ) East Power has traded over 600 million MWh's YTD 2001 ( compared to 450 million MWh's for all of 2000 ) 2 ) Averaging 350 trades per day on EOL for 2001 YTD ( compared to 100 in 2000) . In the last two weeks , EOL daily transactions have averaged nearly 500 . 3 ) Significant improvement in liquidity in all markets - EPMI now trades actively through 2005 in nearly every eastern market . 4 ) Positive P&L in every Eastern region 5 ) Outstanding return on VAR .
thanks Vince . I read about this in MW Daily and on Bloomberg . I think it will be a good project .
Will do . Thanks .
Please put on my calender and create interview package .
Wow .
Let's bring him in for an interview . Have Johnny Palmer set up .
As soon as I get access to crude , resid , & coal curves , I will grant access to power curves . Thanks .
Looks fine .
Please have Grace ( or her replacement begin including NYMEX coal , PRB 8800 Coal , Resid 1% and Resid 3% in the curve handout everyday . Thanks .
Please provide power curve access to Jen Fraser in EGM .
Please place on drive that the traders can access .
Good to hear from you and thanks again for the baby gift - much appreciated . The family is great - Caitlin just turned 3 and Dane is now 4 months old . I hope Fran and the kids are doing great - how's your new addition ? We will be going to Miami Sept 13-16 ( Miami revenge on Washington ) and hopefully we can hook up for a beer . As far as the guy from Citizens - we really don't know that much about him . Where is Tony Altman - under a bus somewhere ?
Portfolio looks good . Is it valuing options properly ? Can you rename the portfolio "Enron" Thanks .
I am trying to change name to "Presto - Enron" and it won't let me . How do I change name ?
Please grant Steve access
Thanks
The options are not valued properly . The market value is calculated based upon the value of the underlying , which grossly overstates the market value of the portfolio . The restricted stock ( basis of $0 ) is valued OK , but the options are not . In addition , the year restricted stock and option grant is not yet in the portfolio .
It would help me if the grant dates were listed in the Portfolio details . This will help me determine if we are missing anything . Thanks .
Did you get my message on option valuation in the portfolio ?
Except it can't be negative because they were grants at no cost to me . The problem is the combination of restricted stock which is total market value and options which is gain/loss need to be added together to get total portfolio value . I was hoping you could trick the system so portfolio value was accurate .
Thanks .
I think you forgot the cash postion . I would rather have on-line valuation , even if the $'s aren't perfect . I like to look at my personal equity portfolio ( includes Enron hedging ) separate from Enron granted stock and option value . One portfolio is liquid and the other is not and I monitor differently .
I already signed something on this . Unless I hear otherwise , I am going to ignore this e-mail .
Thanks .
We just successfully bought out of the 02 OPPD capacity and energy obligation . Therefore , we don't need to proceed with the diesel installation . I have instructed Terri to make your group whole on any costs incurred pursuing the diesel development in Nebraska . In addition , I would like to pursue an 02 LM6000 project inside Ameren ( approx . 100-150 MW) . This would be a strategic asset to create a control area around and utilize the flexible interconnections Ameren has with multiple systems . We also have significant retail load obligations behind IP and Ameren in Illinois . thanks .
750k is BS . Ron has only been working on this for 3-4 weeks . He has made one trip to Nebraska . I expect more like 50-100k in costs incurred . This is precisely why I told Ron to work directly with Terri on this project . With respect to Ameren , Ron should work directly with me and Lloyd Will . thanks .
It needs to look like our wholesale reports ( postions shown behind each utility) . In addition , peak and off-peak should be on separate pages . We should have two views: 1 ) By utility 2 ) By counterparty
Are you a mind reader . I set up a once a week meeting every Monday at 4:00pm ( EB641 ) to go through East Positions ( wholesale & T&D ) and discuss process , deal review , big risk items , new deals , etc . In attendance will be: Busby Don Black Rogers Herndon Jay Lewis Joe Wagner I recommend a bi-weekly meeting with the group of 6 ( Belden , Presto , Lavo , Richter , Black , Herndon) . I will assume Kim will coordinate with the asst's to schedule time and location .
Make sure TJ puts on my calender .
Wednesday doesn't work for me .
OK . I will have to move my weekly meeting to Tuesday .
Not yet .
Please respond to request below . Thanks .
I understand all of those comparisons , however , the reality is if we lose Dean ( which we will if we don't pay 65k + 10k) , we will end up hiring a replacement at 75-80k . This is pretty easy math for me . I know it seems like a stretch , but the market for hourly traders is very strong right now . I would like to get this done ASAP . Thanks .
Thanks .
Please adjust calender . Thanks .
thanks for the invite , but I won't be able to make it .
Do you have a list of people for the special trip ? What do you think ? Vegas We need to get the list of names to aviation ASAP .
I would support 90 MW at Homestead .
Could you take a crack at a draft for the Skilling/Lay presentation . The presentation should focus on supply/demand ( 97-02) , RTO progess in each region , and the progression of heat rate curves ( expanded last year and compressing this year) , pricing history , volatility graphs , etc . Thanks .
I agree . We don't know the base value of the current deal , so how can we make an incremental value decision on a restructuring .
Mine . Looks good . We should get one suite as well that we can use as a beer drinking hospitality room . I'll confirm dates with you later today or tommorow . thanks .
Please put together package . What is this interview for ?
This is fine . However , the Genco related info should be screened .
I understand and agree with everything , except 8% was the agreed upon interest rate as noted on the economic runs which establised the demand payment between my book and New Albany , LLC . It is clear that 8% was the agreed upon rate and the true-up needs to be from 9% to 8% .
Please make a recommendation that keeps this individual . I have given my views , and they are falling on deaf ears . Please give me a solution that keeps the employee and saves the company money by avoiding replacement cost at 75-80k . This seems like a real simple business decision and we are making it difficult .
Calpine is in complete disarray right now , and the entire future of their company hinges on CA honoring their long term above market contracts . Calpine's non-CA portfolio is getting killed and I don't think they have hedged effectively in the non-CA locations . Given these circumstances , the word "below market" is an "f" word , particulary with the legal concerns they also have . I would place a low probability on getting to a value proposition that makes sense for both parties at Dighton , particularly with the legal issues .
Looks like Enpower is "on the side of the road" with respect to capturing and valuing retail deals . As we discussed in yesterday's meeting , Plan B is a more robust spreadsheet that unbundles the components and values them separately and creates postions by risk component . I know this is easier said than done , but we need a tactical solution that gives the group confidence that value and positions are correct , rather than a bundled black box batch value with hard coded assumptions .
I think so . To top things off , there building downtown flooded and the traders are working out of there house . They have no idea what there positions are , and they are trading almost exclusively on EOL from their home comWhat a joke , huh .
Please work with Stacey and Donny Vinson to credit New Albany LLC with the 492k .
I talked with Lavo and we agreed Herndon and Black should go as well . I think Zufferli would make 14 , but we should be able to squeeze . I am calling aviation today and I plan on arranging the following: 1 ) Plane goes to Portland and picks up your guys at 9:00 am on Friday 6/21 ( or 6/28 if more notice is required ) 2 ) Plane picks up Houston guys at approx . 3:30-4:00 pm ( Houston time ) 3 ) We arrive in Cabo around 7:00 pm . 4 ) Plane returns to Houston 6:00 pm Sunday 5 ) Plane continues to Portland and arrives around 8:00 pm ( Portland time ) Let me know if this works for you guys .
Didn't we already hang Richter with this at the Monday mtg . By the way , Lavo has indicated he will just attend our Monday meetings every couple of weeks instead of having a separate meeting .
No , I won't be using .
You caught that . I guess that's fair . We would likely leave around 1:00 pm CPT which would put us in Portland at 2:30 ( West time) . Does this work ?
We need to send someone . Thanks .
You are 100% correct . That is my impression as well , and that is why I set up the Monday meeting . Going forward , the format of those meetings should be: 1 ) Richter presents his area of accountability ( West wholesale prosition , risk systems , deal capture system , status of projects , schedule , etc. ) 2 ) Black presents his area of accountability ( deal review , west tariff , and gas ) 3 ) Herndon presents his area of accountability ( East wholesale & East tariffs ) 4 ) Bernie presents his area of accountability ( deal structuring , deal valuation , new model construction ) 5 ) Busby presents his area of accountability ( risk systems and portfolio valuation - works with Richter ) 6 ) You and I find the holes and provide direction . Your thoughts ?
Sounds OK for now . Long term , your portfolio manager should know how to value options .
The following people will be making the trip: Portland Houston Tim Belden Kevin Presto Mike Swerbzin Fletch Sturm Bob Badeer Dana Davis Jeff Richter Rob Benson Tom Alonzo Rogers Herndon Matt Motley Don Black Mark Fisher John Zufferli Could you please coordinate with aviation to arrange the Falcon 900 to pick up the Portland crew Friday morning with and then confirm flight details with myself and Tim Belden . We may have to arrange for Don Black and Rogers Herndon to fly on commercial flight due to space limitations on the Falcon . Let me know if 14 is over the limit so I can let Rogers and Don know . Thanks .
50k . Thanks .
Thanks .
A group of 14 people ( West and East Power ) will be taking an off-site to Cabo June 22-24 . We would like for you guys to join the group for a wild weekend in Mexico . That's the good news . Due to space limitations , we need you guys to fly commercial from Houston to Cabo ( on company $'s , of course) . On the way back , you would fly on the company plane , and Zufferli would fly commercial directly to Calgary . We plan on departing Houston on Friday 6/22 at 3:00 pm and return Sunday at approx . 6:00 pm . Are you guys in ? We will have a blast .
You will probably be glad you didn't go . If the boys are in jail in Mexico , you may have to run the desk the next week .
Rogers can't attend due to family conflict , therefore , you will be on the corporate jet . You should be getting a copy of the flight schedule from Kim Hillis via e-mail .
Please make sure the meetings I need to attend are on my calender . thanks .
No chance . He gets nothing other than the pricing model through structuring .
Means broken and needs fixed - like your Mercedes .
I bet your insurance is a 3 times higher than Calgary .
Could I please get an updated valuation summary on the sale of New Albany . Do not include the $10 million capacity unwind in the economics . I want only the MTM effects ( the accrual benefits are gravy) . Thanks .
done .
Your welcome .
He was under Ed Baughman until approx . 1 month ago . He is now the Entergy/SOCO scheduler .
The way you set up the portfolio is very confusing . Why not have two portfolios: 1 ) Enron - Restricted ( all stock with a $0 basis in this portfolio - should be $400k+ ) 2 ) Enron - Options ( all ENE stock options - gain/loss column will show intrinsic value ) Thanks .
After setting up the portfolio , please customize the view to show the most relevant data . Thanks .
Yes , I think we should make a formal break . We have separate accountability for retail gen ( wholesale plus ancillaries) , and I think reg gen plus T&D should have separate accountability as well .
We have made great returns on the front of the curve and the back of the curve . We have significant Cal 02 through Cal 05 positions , that have provided solid profitability . It is completely inaccurate to say we have made all of our money on the front of the curve .
In addition , make sure we understand the steam obligation and it's effect on dispatch flexibity and heat rate . It appears the 8000 Heat Rate is assuming above market steam sales are buying down the heat rate . Solar turbines in combined cycle ( without a steam sale credit ) would usually have a heat rate around 10,000 Btu/kwh . The lower heat rate is probably predicated on providing 24 hour steam , which means less dispatch flexibility and producing off-peak energy at a loss . Make sure we are modeling these dynamics properly .
I am trying to customize the view and I keep getting an error . Can you check into this problem . I want the view for both portfolios to be: Open Date Quantity Purchase Price Last Price Cost Basis Market Value Can you make this the default view setting . thanks .
You got it . I'm learning . I hope this translates in P instead of L .
Thanks .
The $5 million is strictly an internal trading # , and is irrelevant from an acct . standpoint . We can ignore it for the DASH .
Do I need to attend . If so , please put on my calender .
Approved .
You have the latitude to put your key people under contract . Edith was very clear when I talked to her that she wanted to transition into a marketing role where she would interact directly with customers .
I concur . You know we are likely selling New Albany this week and I am assuming ENA's premium obligation can be terminated in the event of the sale of the asset .
Your kidding right ? What's the term ? Remember , I only agreed to the terms for 2001 only .
With respect to the flight to Ft . Lauderdale on 9/13 , can you see if Steve or Continental can improve our row 25 seats to a bulkhead row for both the outgoing and return flights . Let me know . Thanks .
Agreed .
This was not clear and the only thing I agreed to was a premium for 2001 .
You got it . I will be in Cabo this weekend with Wolfe's boss ( tim belden - my counterpart in the West ) and I will talk with him about their real-time trading needs and timing .
EPMI purchased 225 MW of Calender 03 NEPOOL ICAP ( Installed Capability ) from Calpine at $1.35/kW/Mo . The parties agreed via a recorded phone conversation ( Paul Posoli and Kevin Presto ) that the LCRA lawsuit would be dropped and neither party would have any further obligations with respect to that lawsuit . The parties attorneys have 48 hours to agree on lawsuit termination language , at which time the ICAP transaction becomes a binding obligation on both parties . Let me know if you need anything else .
You didn't attach anything .
Joe will get promoted at year-end . Associates are not eligible until 18 months of service . We placed Joe in Superior .
Has East Power recognized the 750k refund ?
Yes , I am very busy today . I will get back with you tommorow or Friday .
I'm not doing this interview . I told Dave Duran we have no interest , and I'm not going to waste my time on this individual .
Short and sweet . I like it . You will have to sell your competitiveness and work ethic , because you bring zero experience and your resume reflects that .
I will talk with Belden this weekend and I'll get back with you on next step .
Can you show me on an Ameren transmission map exactly where this project is .
Greg works for Enron North America Wholesale Services ( he is Vice President in West Power over hourly trading , middle marketing , and services business) . You got em .
We don't need a floor talk . I asked Tom to set up a meeting in 30C1 with origination , mid-marketing , and services . This is not going to be a floor talk .
I would like to be able to select days , months , years , etc . for historical liquidation . Somehow , we need to make the cubes or Metastock more user friendly so the traders will actually use them . I have tried to use the cubes and , although the data is extremely powerful , scrolling through all the years and months is quite cumbersome and drilling down is a pain . Can we somehow improve the user friendliness of these tools . Thanks .
Find out if owners of current season tickets get grandfathered for equivalent seats in the new arena . If so , I would be interested . If not , I would say no .
I like our traditional measurment better . This is good data , but is more relevant for cash traders than term traders .
Please coordinate with Kim Melodick to make this happen .
Harry is getting with Kim Melodick ( HR for wholesale trading ) to coordinate the transfer .
Doug Gilbert-Smith runs our Texas power group .
Yes , I will call you tonight or tomorrow to give you an update .
Let's bring him in for an interview .
Access approved .
Please put on calender
Per Lavo , he would like to see ASAP the break-even price on the reg-switch options where length was booked and when wholesale goes below tariff , we can cover and re-create free option . When can we have summary valuation of this done for East positions ?
Doesn't it become a free option if you can serve physically or reg-gen via utility tariff . For example in Illinois and Ohio , wouldn't these markets create free options if the wholesale price goes below reg gen ?
Are drinks on the house ?
Before we book the New Albany sale , Lavo would like to have a final meeting with myself , Lavo , Louise , Stuart , and Don to go through final economics and determine appropriate booking . Stuart & Don - Can you set up meeting ?
We will pass .
thanks .
A former FPL employee ( Ken Olan ) will be calling you regarding a potential alternative to Orimulsion . The fuel is sourced from US refinery and can be burned in the same manner as Orimulsion , creating two fuel sources . Let me know .
Agreed .
I slept great .
Please call me as soon as we find out about the Duke board mtg results . I need to know ASAP .
Greg , My brother is looking to make a career change from teaching ( currently a biology teacher at Richland High School ) into something where performance is rewarded . He is an extremely hard worker who is ultra competitive . Do you have any needs for entry level hourly guys ? I think he could learn the business quick and do well in our industry . I know there is a ton of market uncertainty in the West right now with the California debacle , so I'm not sure if you need people or not . Let me know if there is any chance for an interview and I can have my brother send a resume . Hope everything is going well for you and your family . Thanks .
Is the deal done .
I received an e-mail from Greg Wolfe . They do have needs for entry level people . For whatever reason , he did not receive the attached resume in my previous e-mail . Please send me a final version of your resume so I can forward to Greg . thanks .
What advantages does this bring for East and/or West Power ( other than less mid-yr reviews to do) ?
Lloyd Will is my fundies interface , and , in general , we have received very good support from Research .
Wow - imcompetence at its best .
Please give the names of the plants effected ASAP .
Sounds fine to me .
No trading on the 4th
Please summarize and hand out to traders . In addition , create a section on our web site for enviornmental related matters .
As you can see , I was copied on the original e-mail .
Please handle .
My recommendation is that Berney's retail structuring group value the generation deals that are intended to serve retail load .
Can you believe Duke paid book value . Wow ! They even accepted all the risk associated with the Power Systems BS .
Cover letter and resume from my brother are attached .
I think they are low in FRCC by $1.00-1.50 , and I will fix tonight . The GTC and FL/GA marks are good . On-Peak in FRCC , however , I will be moving down some , particularly in the shoulder months starting in 03 as alot of combined cycles are added in Florida by both utilities and merchant players .
No problem . $0.50/Mwh is enough for this service . You don't need to pay a $1.00/Mwh . I would say anytime she gets more that $75/Mwh , she gets a $1.00/Mwh to keep her motivated to sell at the highest price . Sound OK ?
It was actually Stuart Zisman .
I can speak with Chris Ahn when he gets back from his honeymoon .
Terry , Please set aside 30 minutes on my calender sometime next week to talk to Suzette . I don't know her so your help in setting up the meeting would be appreciated . Please coordinate with TJ Black ( 3-5800) .
Isn't this an EOL cost ?
Thanks for all the hard work and your efforts are greatly appreciated by the power desk . Is there any chance I can talk you out of your resignation . I would like you to come work for Lloyd Will and help with our services business and RTO interface initiatives . We are in the process of completely revamping our systems , and your knowledge would be a huge help in pushing this initiative . Your thoughts ?
Yes . His phone number is 503-464-8481 . I forwarded the resume and cover letter this morning , so I would wait at least one day .
Absolutely . I may have to smooth over the Jim Mehn issue ( Chris committed to go to wholesale structuring )
Please coordinate with my asst . ( TJ Black @3-5800 ) to set up an afternoon meeting next week .
Duke has indicated that the cannot complete the proposed commodity/loan transaction with my proposed collateral threshold exemption . They have indicated that creates "accounting issues" for there accrual book . Therefore , I need to know the cost of credit to assign to the proposed cash flows . In rough numbers , we receive $200 million in the first two years and return $250 million in the last two years . Because of this , in years 03 and 04 , our collateral posting will be significant . Let me know your thoughts ASAP on Monday morning .
Who is Guy ? I agree Rogers , however , you need to help me finesse the situation . The "just say no" approach will go nowhere with Delainey . Let's talk about a workable approach . Hang in there .
Can we make sure this goes on the Web site .
Thanks Joe . I will have Tom and/or John follow up with Rob .
Thanks .
FYI .
We can honor the original ticket grants .
Please get a $ amount from Deffner's group on the collateral cost issue . Given the shape of the loan , Enron will have to post significant collateral on the 03 & 04 positions , and I need a PV cost associated with collateral requirements of this loan package . Please talk with Bradford with respect to credit $'s .
Please assign an analyst to show all generation in the Com-Ed control area . The primary owners are: 1 ) Edison International ( former Com-Ed coal plants ) 2 ) Com-Ed ( nuclear and some GT's ) 3 ) People's ( Elwood and one other merchant plant ) 4 ) 5-6 miscellanious merchant plants ( includes Allegheny's Lincoln Center facility )
Thanks and good luck .
Who called it a new business ?
Did you use Florida curves from Friday ? The curves are much lower Friday vs . Thursday .
Agreed . Actually , I think you are being too aggressive .
I need the reg gen postion , transmission position , distribution position , and ancillary position . If you have to bundle the T&D and ancillary into one position , that is fine . However , I want the pricing assumptions for the individual pieces and our best guess for the MWh position . Thanks .
Based on the # of EES people attending a meeting that is about tariff prices ( ie . EWS ,  I would hate to see the expense side of the EES ledger .
Ridiculous . I have been forwarding all of your e-mails today to Lavo and Louise . I am trying to build a case to get Ader and Bernstien ( Bert and Ernie are my new nicknames ) re-assigned and away from our supply business .
Sounds good .
Looks good .
Thanks .
Good info . Thanks .
No more e-mails . I still don't have the forward FPC tariff curve . How is this so complicated .
Good info . Thanks .
When is the MISO set to go commercial ?
What are the biggest needs in fundies right now ? I would like a fundies rotation , risk books , and real-time . Risk books or fundies should be the 1st rotation and real-time should be the last .
Wes Colwell needs to create a new cost center for the new retail risk management organization . My understanding is that Delainey has agreed to pay the costs for this year . Please confirm with Wes .
You are still missing a significant grant of restricted stock in 2000 and 2001 . Can you please include these grants in the portfolio manager . I have requested this several times now . thanks .
No problem .
Lloyd and I will be assembling a team soon . All discussion should go through Lloyd .
Yes .
I am still not pleased with the information display on the cubes . It is way too difficult to view daily information and move from month to month to observe historical heat rate liquidations and $/Mwh price liquidations . The tables on the top need to have dates and summary info . Please assemble a project team to make the data more user friendly . thanks .
We should value the project . A combined cycle in Eastern NY may make sense .
Stuart Zisman will be your contact .
Yes , that's correct . Sorry , but with Matthew coming back that same weekend , it just isn't going to work . Have fun .
I need a presentation prepared for this meeting with Lay and Skilling . It should be very straight forward with a demand picture by region and supply picture by region . Maps with the regional reliability councils noted and overall supply/demand from 96 to 2000 should be the basis for the presentation . Maps and graphs are very useful . The presentation should be very macro in scope . I would work with Gasill's group to make the presentations for gas and power somewhat similar .
The date works fine .
For the 25th presentation , I need the following: A pictorial description of power generation sources: 1 ) Nuclear 2 ) Coal 3 ) Resid Steam Unit 3 ) Gas Combined Cycle 4 ) Gas Simple Cycle 5 ) Hydro I would like to show annual demand by customer segment ( residential , commercial , industrial ) for the East , West , and ERCOT and supply by generation type for the same major areas . A table which shows Mwh consumption by demand segment and generation supply by source would be useful . In addition , total capability by supply source Some of this same info can be used for the 30th presentaiton .
As I discussed with Joe Deffner , the Duke transaction we recently completed ( loan in a commodity deal) , we were unable to get the "exception language" for collateral . We did the transaction at LIBOR - 10bp and even when we add 65-75 bp for the cost of an LC , the transaction still provided a competitive source of cash . The confirms we sent incorrectly placed the "exception language" and I am correcting that today .
I would like to discuss SE desk head opportunity with you . I have spoken with Jim and he has given me clearance to talk with you . I would like to meet this afternoon if possible .
Sounds good . I'll see ya at 4:30 .
I would like to discuss a term trading job in East Power . I have talked with Fallon he is OK with me talking to you . Do you have time to meet later today ( 5:30 pm ) or tommorow .
What do you expect . Enron is one of the top 25 companies in the world .
I am not interested . Dave Duran may have interest and I will forward this e-mail to him .
On the new phone card ( some later date) , please include Rogers Herndon , Jeff Richter , Tim Belden and Anthony Dayou under retail risk management ( new category on the card) . Thanks .
Please drop by to give me an update . Remember we need positions broken down by component ( retail gen , reg gen , ancillaries , tariff , etc. ) and positions by customer . We also need P&L by component and by customer . Thanks .
I am not aware of the is RFP at all . Our orig group provides zero info . I will forward to Ed Baughman .
Who is working on this ?
FYI .
I used to get an e-mail every day with the component var . I would like to start receiving this again .
I would like hard copy executive summaries of all of the RTO orders
I do not agree with this approach . We are so busy managing stacks which could lead to someone forgetting to inform settlements to send a termination letter which would then kill the trade . I strongly object to your recommended approach .
The curve sheet is fine , but I totally diagree with the morning report and demand forecast . I would not give these to the risk group .
Let's discuss this in our Monday meeting . In general , though , your approach seems reasonable to me .
I'm good for $50 . You can collect next time you are in Houston .
I like your approach . Would the Norfolk location fill the UI short as well so we could potentially get a double benefit ?
Your welcome . My wife's uncle died of Luekemia approx 2 months ago .
How are we precluded from extending our current contract . I never agreed to that . That's BS .
No problem . I need to know by mid-week , if possible . Thanks .
Fine .
None that I am aware of . We need to take positions that support our long term view of competitive energy markets for all consumers .
You need to go through Don Black and Anthony Dayou .
4:30 is good . Should I expect good news ?
I'm meeting with Suarez at 4:30 . I can meet with you at around 5:00 . Sound OK .
Thanks for the update . You are doing a great job and I appreciate you all your hard work . I don't have to worry about any of the administrative issues , and that makes my job much easier . Have fun on the trips and make sure you and Amy get well . Thanks again .
Right now , all of our trades are fixed price at a specific hub . We will be moving to basis markets in some locations in the very near future .
No problem . He can expense it .
I need 2 additional tickets for the Washington game that are next to my 4 season tickets . I will call you later today to give you my AMEX to get the parking pass and confirm the specific seat location . Patrick never called me to confirm the seats in the front row of the upper section , therefore , your message is the first confirmation I have received . Thanks .
Please put the Kinch Kato e-mail address in my address book . Thanks
I agree with Dick .
Please review resume . She comes highly recommended by Paul Racicot . She is part of the EBS redeployment .
The pricing information on the website is fine .
No cash , but yes to the confidentiality agreement .
Does 5:00 work ?
Please put on my calender .
Can you please add Rogers to the interview list . I like Dale as a candidate to run the URM desk . Given that Jay Lewis has expressed interest in moving into a marketing role under Dave & Janet , we very much need a solid sr . person to run this group . I understand the West is trying to get one of Jay's people to come to Portland . Is Dale a candidate to run both groups ? If Jay leaves , we are big time short .
Agreed .
Louise indicated that credit has agreed to allow credit-worthy counterparties to trade through 2004 . The following are the counterparties East Power would like to have 04 access on EOL . Duke BP Energy Morgan Stanley El Paso Williams Reliant Constellation Merrill Lynch Allegheny Please let me know ASAP who gets approved and when EOL will grant trading rights . Thanks .
That is very possible because Calpine was selling 02 and 03 natty early yesterday .
Can you make sure and attend . Thanks .
I have been assuming around 10k . Talk to you later .
Stuart Zisman can answer this question .
Congrats .
Please approve access .
They have agreed to grant us access . I granted access to power curves based on the understanding they would grant full access to all coal curves .
Per Gary Hickerson & Kevin McGowan , EGM agreed to make all coal curves ( including PRB ) available to power desk if we provided the power curves to the equity group . Therefore , please ensure we receive this info in a timely manner . Thanks .
I want our VAR to be accurate on all accounts and I will settle for nothing less .
Please send me the CD . Thanks .
What is this ?
I need until Friday to get this done . This has been the busiest trading week of the year . Thanks .
I will have TJ set up and Lloyd attend . thanks .
Please place on calender .
Yes I would like to attend meeting regarding NRG deal and let's have a position meeting this afternoon at 4:00 . Does that work ? I will keep my ears open for Zone J and G markets . PJM East markets are rarely shown except for summer spreads which are now $18-25/Mwh ( approx. ) for 02 and 03 .
I have a fundies mtg . with Skilling at 3:00 and I should be done by 4:00 . Let's plan on 4:00 for NRG in my office and positions meeting after at whatever location works for you .
Sounds good . If you need anything from me , let me know .
Who does Janel work for now ?
That's fine .
Yes we need PRB 8400 and PRB 8800 curves . My agreement with EGM was coal curves in exchange for power curves . Heather - If I don't get the PRB coal curves by the end of this week , I will have to remove access to our power curves .
Please print the agenda for myself and fax copy to Evelyn . Thanks .
Thanks for the note and good luck .
I was told 2:00 pm .
Thanks .
No problem .
Yes , my brother .
I'm sure there will be a long line of requests . If we have any extras , I will throw them your way .
I am locking up all of the hourly leads and having a discussion with them regarding there top performers and contract status this week . It is becoming increasingly difficult to put non-managers under contract , so that is my challenge for the hourly group . Having said that , I concur with your suggestions . I am assuming you are presenting Narsima and Edith there promotion and contract packages . Please confirm .
Glad to hear it .
FYI .
We would prefer physical rights that we can take day-ahead and/or real-time ( 5 minutes ahead , if possible) . Rather than an obligation ( like FTR's) , we prefer an option ( spread on pricing that can only be positive when exercised) . I would want to condition the transaction on having one RTO in the NE with LMP pricing in effect for the entirie NE market on or before 1/1/2003 . Assuming we get over those hurdles , this would likely be viewed as a capital project internally ( fixed cost structure) , therefore , we need to earn a minimum of 25% expected return ( after credit) . Obviously , there is a huge unknown on the CT vs . Long Island forward curve with the changing market conditions . This makes pricing this deal extremely difficult , particulary with the returns we would need to show . Call me with any additional questions .
Only if nuclear fuel storage problems persist . The nuclear fleet , if unencumbered by NRC or spent fuel storage problems , will operate at 90-95% ( 95% during non-refueling years and 90% during re-fueling years) . Remember re-fuelings are now on a 24 month cycle and the next big cycle is spring and fall of 2003 . The 2002 re-fueling outages are actually less than normal .
I hear you on the liquidity Rogers . With Rob making those markets effective next Monday ( he is on vacation) , we will find out if term liquidity is possible . Please trust me on this issue . You will see a significant difference within weeks , not months . At a minimum , you will at least have price discovery through 2003 on calenders ( they may be $3 wide in New York , but that is better than no market) . Keep pushing on this issue . With the volatility in the NE over the past two weeks , I'm sure you understand our reluctance on term markets in these illiquid areas . As far as 02 or 03 quotes for E PJM and/or NY , I have heard no markets today and neither has Dana . The pool is blowing up as we speak .
I would pick the one with the highest return and put 100% in ( most likely Stable Asset Fund )
They mitigated the shit out of prices ( our Pepperhill project was dispatched at $300/Mwh the whole day) .
Please review . Is there a value proposition for us ?
Rogers is meeting with Janet to sell this concept . If necessary , I will follow-up .
If they are all in the coal group and we get all of the coal curves and transport curves , then the answer is yes .
Make sure we get something in writing . What is the appropriation risk ?
We still need something in writing from Janet .
With your retail short position in PJM , I assume we are short ICAP as well . We should have your guys or Ader & Company follow-up on the 42 MW that is available . Hopefully , it is in E PJM .
Yes , I think so . He works for Duran . Do you need to me to do something ?
We liked Alton . He was a very hard worker . We ranked him 2 or 3 .
Do I need to attend ? We should not have Fairley at this meeting .
Good luck John . I appreciate your praise and wish you success in your future professional endeavors .
I think we finally have everthing . Thanks .
How's everything going ? Give me a call when you get a chance .
Good info . Thanks Billy .
Yes .
Absolutely . Please call Lloyd Will to get access to our new intranet site which has an unbelievable amount of data on historical prices , loads , new gen , HDD's , CDD's , outages , etc . Our new fundies group is 100% better in terms of data quality and presentation .
Are we using this load now ?
Could you please enter the following Paine Webber Account Reps into my address book ( include phone & e-mail ) Thanks .
I have book positions in the NE market and am very comfortable with our curves through 2004 in all of these markets . NEPOOL came off very hard today ( $2.00/Mwh through 2006 ) while the NY markets were off only $0.50 - $1.00/Mwh . I am paying close attention to these markets given the corporate risk and I don't see any marks unreasonable given where 02 and 03 are actually trading . Again - I will continue to monitor as we work toward integrating the positions . Thanks .
Please send me a resume before I agree to any meeting .
I keep the curves very tightly controlled due to proprietary reasons . I lose control of who has access outside my group , therefore , I have chosen to not make it available . EOL has prices in all markets through 2003 which should be all you need to perform your analysis .
That's fine . I thought we already did this .
Yes - Power Risk Management is more appropriate ( trading is the closest to risk management )
We are in jail in off-peak as well and are trying to buy . Most regions have markets on-line through 2003 ( TVA , Ent , Cinergy , Com-ed) . In NY , there is zero liqidity for off-peak . PJM West has pretty decent liquidity through 03 . I hope this helps .
Our marks are fine ( at least through 04 where we occasionally see #'s) . I don't think it's appropriate to shut down anything . We need to price the product properly and off-peak needs just as much margin as on-peak given the increase in coal prices and the effects of load growth . Rather than shut down products , increase the price to reflect the current risk in the market . We are chipping away at our off-peak position day by day and we have bought some NYMEX coal . Am I making sense ? In addition , I am working with Doug to buy 7x24 from FPL in North Texas ( for both desks) . We will probably have to pay $3.50-4.00 spread to get 3-5 year 7x24 deal done . With respect to NE , the outright prices are much higher and resid is the marginal unit for off-peak , therefore , in some ways the risk is easier to manage .
I just told Dana to get NE off-peak on-line for 02 and 03 .
Good question . We need to shift as of a specific date with fixed load obligations in the EWS retail books .
Could you please take care of this for me today . Thanks .
Agreed .
Please handle for me ASAP . Thanks .
Good info . Consistent with reports from McGowan . I am now short 02 at $39/ton and long 03-04 at $32.50/ton . Love the spread given my view of natty . Since the report is almost identical to info I have received from McGowan , I don't see any pressing need to call Alan . You are certainly free to call him if you want .
I lost $2 million in new deal P&L putting the spread on because they have their curves so srewed up . With respect to your question , I think the answer is yes because I can sell 02 on-line by controlling the stack ( limit orders ) and the coal group will sell 03-04 at $35/ton . I now own this at $32 because they mis-mark their curve in 04 by $4.00/ton ( ie negative $2 million in new deal P&L. ) The bottom line is it was painful putting that spread on .
Totally agreed . It is an absolute joke down there .
Having any luck . Look at my coal markets .
I defer to Dana on this issue .
Should be Dana Davis
No problem . I can't think of any of their employees I would want .
Did you check with Liz ?
I will do Carson and Juan . I am having Juan do all of his SE hourly group . With respect to Forney , I will either do myself or have Doug do it .
Let's try the alternative . Thanks .
By Friday , we should be above 75% .
Thanks alot for the info .
Look forward to hearing from you . Thanks .
Williams will have weather model and research material several minutes before the general market . Universities receive the data before the market and this alliance will get the weather data to Williams as if they were part of the university . Any thoughts ?
Please put in my address book .
Yes , Lavo and Louise are both aware . This is a lateral transfer . Eric will be working directly for Fletch .
You have the right Kevin Presto . I have been employed at Enron now for almost 7 years . I currently oversee the company's power trading and marketing business in the Eastern US . Unfortunately , I spend entirely too much time at work , but I love the job and Enron's culture in general . How are you doing ? I have not seen any of my Tri-City classmates in many years . I think the last time I saw you was at Mark Bayless' wedding ( 85-86? ) if my memory is correct . Where is your job located and what work have you done with Enron ?
Canes play Penn State at College Station and the natty market made a new low today . Give me a call this weekend . I'm taking the fellas out for drinks this afternoon .
Let's try to get 8 playoff tickets for the desk .
Please print and save for our Lake McQueeney trip . We should plan a mid-September trip to New Braunfels .
Check to see if King or Herndon know him from their days at Dynegy .
I am not going to make an into-GTC market . I'm going to make an on the GTC market which is significantly different . I do not want to educate the market on the difference .
How is Brian Butler a "5" if all you have received is positive feedback ?
Thanks .
With respect to Narsima , I agree with Rogers . With respect to Steve Wang and Guatum Gupta , please work directly with Harry and Dana . I am continuing to push responsibility down to the desk heads and that includes personnel issues . Thanks .
I am interested in lakefront property on Lake Travis which is within 3 hour drive of Houston . Given the technology sector meltdown , I am looking to "bottom fish" for lakefront property that provides great long term real estate value . Please feel free to e-mail me with "value" opportunities that come up . I did not find your CD-ROM user friendly and I prefer e-mails with attached property listings that meet my requirements . I am looking to spend 200-250k for lakefront property that has previously sold in the 275-325k range . thanks .
Rogers , Are we are discussing the Phoenix project at this Wednesday's meeting ? Is Terry going to be there ?
Sounds like you are as busy as I am . Yes , my parents still live in the same house in Kennewick . My Dad retired from teaching in WA ( collecting WA retirement ) and has been teaching in Hermiston , OR for the last 7 years . Just to clarify , Enron's international business model and North American business model are quite different . I work in the Enron North American business unit which has been extremely profitable and has pioneered the deregulation of the natural gas and electricity markets in the US . Enron NA's focus has been on creating efficient wholesale markets in gas , power , crude , pulp & paper , metals , etc and then providing the market with a logistical delivery and price risk management intermediation function . We are very cost effective in this function because we achieve huge scale and scope in the market with minimal fixed costs . Enron's international business model , on the other hand , entailed constructing capital intensive infrastructure power and gas projects with leveraged project financing ( with project financing supported by long term sales to government utilities) . This model is OK provided the business risk , currency risk , international risk , change in law risk , legal risk , etc . is priced properly by the debt and equity providers . I will let you conclude which business model is better . I think you will see Enron applying our successful NA model into the international markets that have an economy and regulatory environment that supports a "free-market" model . Later .
I have both days on my calender . I'll get TJ to resolve . Thanks .
Thanks Jay .
As usual , your position is way too logical . Do I need to attend this meeting ?
My understanding is that Shell can put them back to Calpine . Remember , the deal was an all-requirements supply deal for all of Shell's retail obligations in ERCOT which are now zero .
I will handle the non-TVA SERC deals until John Suarez joins the group .
Are we sure we can live with everything else in the PJM Single RTO proposal ?
Any interest in attending ?
I read the proposal last night , and although it is not perfect , it is a big improvement over what we have today . Therefore , I ( and my team ) support Enron's endorsement of the PJM Proposal ( with your timeline condition) . Thanks for all your good work .
You should attend if you think you will get value from it .
What is the exact delivery point ? Does it include capacity ? Is it a daily call ? monthly call ? All options are quoted by Harry Arora .
I want only firm delivered LD offers for this position . Please make this clear in our proposal and make sure the volume shape is exactly the same as our JEA obligation . Thanks .
You've got that right . I'm am short all of the power and am getting frustrated . I am breaking all of the trading rules by ignoring the price action which continues to be somewhat bullish in power . There seems to be very solid fixed price support at these lower levels . In particular , the NE markets refuse to go down despite the fact that Benson has been a fairly aggessive seller the past two days in the 02 and 03 period . For the 1st time in a couple of weeks , however , the cash market is showing signs of weakness . Overall , I am very bearish and my position reflects that . Like you , I have worn some curveshift the past month .
The source sink issue continues to be a huge thorn in our side and costs my group significant $'s every year . I estimate $10-15 million per year is lost by our cash traders every year due to the inflexibility in the daily and weekly market . Therefore , we should continue to fight this issue hard to rectify as soon as possible . Thanks .
No .
I generally agree with your approach . We may be able to assign our contracts to a competitor and actually get paid ( because of margin in contract vs . current market) , particularly if competition is not pricing this risk or choosing to ignore it . Potential candidates are Green Mountain , New Power Co , TXU , etc . Any thoughts ?
Fine . I don't need to attend .
Thanks . Any assignment would have to be confidential . I don't view an assignment any different than the unwinds that we are currently doing directly with the customer . If there is a positive NPV trade , we should do it . "Assignment" maybe the wrong word . Maybe we can transfer the ERCOT switching risk to another supplier or back to the customer .
Can you please make sure Kim Melodick attends my meeting with Jim Homco that I believe is scheduled for tommorow afternoon at 5:00 pm . If Kim cannot attend , I need to move the meeting to a time when she can be there . Thanks .
Yes , we probably can because ESCA is the vendor and we have a great relationship with them . I will ask Doug and/or Forney to follow-up .
Please follow-up with ERCOT ISO and/or ESCA to find out if there is a technical limitation with the software . Can we please get an inside opinion on the "real" issue and the "real date" so we can properly assess wholesale and retail risk as a company . Doug and Rogers - Please work together on who is going to take the lead so don't have two different Enron people inquiring . We may also want to consider using Tholan's intelligence group .
Please call me and I will give you the real story . I don't want to put it in an e-mail .
We need to make it our responsibility so we have consistent tools applied in all of the markets .
This transaction was never in the trading books and all P&L and decision-making was within the origination group . I may have recommended that Ozzie buy the balance of year coal , however , all $ impacts and decisions were within the control of orig/corp development . Therefore , Heather , Ozzie and Don Miller are the parties that must deal with any of the contractual issues and intra-company monetary issues .
Sounds good .
Is this relevant information .
The average guy has no idea what is coming . T&D costs are going to explode and so is wholesale power ( increased O&M , security , employees , capital improvements , risk premium , etc. )
I'm fine with this approach .
Thanks . Sounds like a solid no .
I am missing an Enron 10,000 share sale from Monday of last week . The sale has not shown up in my on-line "holdings" report as it normally does . I am assuming this will be corrected today . Thanks .
Does it retain my custom profile ?
Does this mean yes ?
What is Zydeco ? No to Chinese .
I say we don't make any changes until we get in the new building and we will have a better feel for the vendors .
Please get info from Lloyd .
I did a spread today with Arnold: Sold 10,000 MMbtu/day of Cal 03 Bought 10,000/MMBtu/day of Cal 05 Paid $0.12/MMBtu for the spread
Let's discuss tommorow .
I talked with John today and he wanted me to remind you about the e-mail you voluntered to write regarding the transition of site profile accountability back to EES . If you recall , we decided on a 2-3 month transition with some sort of drop dead accountability for all P&L risks associated with the site profile/DSM positions . Do you remember this ? If so , John and I did not receive the e-mail .
What time are we meeting ?
For files/calender .
Not at all . Please attend . However , we will need a bigger room . Can you coordinate with TJ to make this happen . Thanks .
With respect to East Power markets , I would like a fixed monthly premium in addition to the wider bid/offer in return for Refco's access to our markets .
thanks for the heads up . I will forward this e-mail to EOL and Legal . I understand his point .
FYI . Looks like PIRA will be releasing a bearish material balance and 02 gas price outlook soon .
Any recommendations to correct this ?
Please attend meetings 1 and 3 and provide meeting summaries directly to Rika for internal distribution . Thanks .
FYI .
Thank you . See you this Saturday at 10:00 am .
Christi is leading the SE RTO initiative . As far as meeting , tommorow at 3:30 works for me . Please confirm with TJ at 3-5800 . Thanks .
Can you please coordinate this meeting to ensure it is productive . We may need an initial screening mtg . to assess whether the tool can help us from a fundamental/trading standpoint . Thanks .
I will pay $500k over the mid-curve . Morgan and JEA will be your best counterparties . I would proceed by showing them a bid for the shaped obligation that is flat to our mid , thus leaving you with 500k of orig value . Before we show a written or verbal bid , please get approval from me . Thanks .
Have they started construction ? Is the plant a peaker or combined cycle ?
I think they are probably pricing calls vs . cancelling the project .
After reviewing our position in more detail , we are quite long MWH's in the NE market , therefore the 5 year 7x24 PJM East bid ( 100-125 MW ) would be closer to $4-5/Mwh below the current mid . Additional purchases above 125 MW would be discounted further for VAR and liquidity reasons . With respect to Florida , I would still pay the mid for Cal 02 ( shaped like JEA short ) and mid minus $2.00/Mwh for 50 MW of Calender 04-05 . As I mentioned in the meeting , EES/EWS would also provide a bid for ICAP/ancillary services in PJM and NEPOOL where the company has existing short positions .
I suggest setting up a meeting with all of my desk heads after your meeting with REFCO . At that point in time , you can provide an overview of the deal structure and we can talk about East Power requirements .
No , my understanding was we were going to give them curve access . I never agreed to give them the fundies data .
Let's go ahead and release .
Please provide an analyst to support this effort . This information will benefit both EWS and EES as we move toward combining the genco/control area/unit dispatch function in the new building . You may want to request additional support from Jim Meyn's group , as this will ultimately effect structuring valuation .
How exactly are we exposed ?
As most of you know , NRG's proposed purchase of two coal plants in Conneticut ( UI's territory ) was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at FERC . The purchase and sale transaction between Wisvest and NRG was originally entered into almost two years ago . The proposed purchase price of $350 million for 1000 MW of coal was a "bargain price" at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of CT . Over the past 2-3 years , the State of Conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and Wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they "puked" the plants to NRG for $350/kW in early 2000 . At a minimum , it is expected that $100-150/kW of SCR and/or scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the CT regulatory bodies . My strong view is that , as a practical matter , the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in CT . The area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire Eastern Interconnect . The load pocket is significantly short MW and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area . In a true "locational marginal price" environment , the prices would likely be similar to Zone J in New York Currently , pricing in NEPOOL is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads , regardless of who causes the congestion . In the recently proposed "single NE RTO" model , it is about 80% certain that the PJM "locational marginal price" market model will be implemented sometime between mid-2003 and mid-2004 . At that point in time , consumers in the congested areas of NEPOOL ( in-city Boston and CT ) will be exposed to higher energy prices , while consumers in Maine , New Hampshire , and Rhode Island should see lower prices . Given the facts above , coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets , I think EWS should pursue discussions with Wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in NEPOOL and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset "node" . If we could buy these plants for approx $250/kW with $150/kW of environmental upgrades , the resulting "all-in" ( depr , fixed & variable O&M , fuel costs , NOx , SO2 , capital reserve , interest ) 7x24 plant cost would be approx . $34-36/Mwh . This is lower than our energy only socialized NEPOOL curve . Additional upside is derived from positive basis , ICAP , ancillary services , emissions allowances , and long term requirements sales to LSE's . Lavo and Louise - This could be the "Alberta PPA" for 2002 . Lots of "hair" but lots of upside . Any thoughts ?
They are pursuing because I requested to pursue . The reason for the e-mail is to place management emphasis on this opportunity .
Could you please make sure this is on my calender and ensure that Jeff Keenan and Dave Duran are also aware of this meeting . Thanks .
Thanks for the info Mike . Our real-time market is a complete piece everywhere ( $10-18/Mwh) . Generators are beginning to puke MW again .
My management book is going to take this $1.45 million hit
The loss is part of the $1.45 million . The loss occurred due to generator repairs .
FYI .
I talked to him this morning and feels comfortable with his marks . He is long , so he better . Like I told you yesterday , I wouldn't hesitate to to be more aggressive on the front in ERCOT , particularly in the North where Doug is long . I'll keep you posted .
Looks like Ader & Co . at work in ERCOT . I view this as a big problem . These customers need to be covered by wholesale . Both of you should take this as a slap in the face .
We are losing lots of deals in ERCOT on price . This is part of the reason they are being so aggressive with customers and alternative suppliers . I have received this feedback directly from Rogers and Janet .
Make sure Rogers is at this meeting .
Full access of the complete portal should be limited to core contract employees only . We have a scaled down version that we have made available to the marketing group .
I bought 10,000 MMbtu/day of Cal 04 NYMEX NG at 3.315 and 3.32 from Arnold this afternoon .
Excellent update Mike . We have good momentum with some key "players" on the ropes . I view the next two months as critical in moving the Midwest to one functional market .
I am getting more like you every day . Given what's going on in EES right now , I don't trust anyone . Therefore , I am going to allow access to the portal to only EWS employees that you are comfortable with . Obviously , this includes Dale . With respect to the rest of the EES group , I am not going to grant access until the entire organization is doing the right thing for Enron's shareholders .
Please grant full access to Dale Furrow in retail risk management . Dale is a VP under contract and is a key member of the retail risk management staff . With respect to the URM employees under Dale , please grant them the more limited access . With respect to the EES employees ( Ozzie , Beth , Greg Woulfe) , I do not want any access granted at all .
No interest .
How many days do I have left ?
Please follow-up with this guy . Looks like a retail load aggregator looking for wholesale supply .
Please send an e-mail to "Experience Enron" and let them know the tours need to be conducted as far away from the trading floor as possible and limited to no longer than 5 minutes . I don't want any of our screens visible to the customers , not matter who they are . Thanks .
I have been getting lots of requests from our friends . I'm just giving you a heads up . I have no problem with the URM group , unless , of course , they become part of EES .
You are right . They are on crack . This would be at least $3.50/Mwh over Cin . They have gas deliverability issues in the winter and there alternative fuel is No . 2 oil . Therefore , CPL East is a big premium Nov-Mar . The bid/offer for this location is large due to transmission risk .
I will attend only if the whole group is represented ( gas , oil , west power , and east power) . Once we have confirmation for all relevant parties , please let me know .
You can count me in . We can have 3 hours of EES bashing . Thanks .
Please provide my asst . ( TJ Black @ 3-5800 ) with meeting time and location .
Your thoughts on this guy for SE cash and/or term spread trader ?
John , What about Eric Benke ? Did you review his resume ?
Late afternoon . Have Fletch and myself interview . He has already been in here for one interview .
Do these look reasonable . What are the costs charged to fundies ? The allocations are confusing to me .
I am having Lloyd Will review .
Sold 150 contracts per month of Feb-Mar 02 at 2.81 Sold 50 contracts per month of Nov-Dec 02 at 3.24 . Bought Cal 06 at 3.60 .
Please coordinate with Kay to set up a time that works for both of us . 5:00 pm tomorrow is good .
I told TJ to coordinate with you . 5:00 pm is fine tommorow . Please confirm with TJ .
I have a conflict on my calender . I can meet at 3:00 only on Thursday and will be out on Friday .
We'll see .
Lakes on Eldridge subdivision: 5410 Morning Breeze
As a follow-up to our meeting on Saturday , I talked with the designer of my house ( Todd Rice with Rice Residential Design ) and the electrical plan is not on a CAD system . The electrical plan was hand drawn . If you need a copy of the plan , my preference is that you deal directly with Todd and his staff as I am very busy during the week . Todd Rice Rice Residential Design 11111 Katy Freeway
I don't like the 2nd bullet - not positive enough . We are the dominant player in the power market . With respect to volumes for term trades , the risk group will have to provide that to you . I can tell you that the volumes have increased in the term market by a significant factor ( at least 10 times relative to last year) .
This has not been booked . I was told Q4 . What is this ?
Sounds like he might fit in the LMP/transmission/congestion management group . As I mentioned , we are attempting to create an Eastern Interconnect LMP model to model congestion in every region . This will lead to the creation of hubs and basis markets . Ravi might be a good fit for this group .
We are already completely full . In fact , we are already 2 seats short for my own group .
Thanks for the info Heather . In terms of forward curve , Entergy is the worst place to be long assets right now . The equipment is probably of more interest as it relates to a packaged development for the Midway project in Florida .
Please provide me with the latest hard copy so I can have one final meeting with my direct reports to get final confirmation for East Power seating . Thanks .
Please make the following revisions to the peak and off-peak position reports: Remove ERCOT wind position completely from the report ( PPA has been terminated ) Add ERCOT north zone positions Add ERCOT south zone positions Show separate positions for FL/GA border and FPL/FRCC Add PJM-East positions ( show separate from PJM-West ) Off-Peak position still shows SERC-FL ( this location no longer exists ) - Florida positions are either FL/GA or FPL/FRCC . Thanks .
Let's sit down and talk . I think we should fill from within our current desk . I have some ideas .
roundtable meeting .
Do we have 4 or 8 ?
Ask him if Scherer 1,2,3 and/or 4 would work ? Let him know that an odd lot would command a $2.50-3.00/Mwh premium on top In addition , even if we used Scherer , it would be from any one of the facilities therefore the transmission would need to be able to use any of the Scherer units as a source .
There should be no credit on a TVA/Cin spread . The correlation between the 2 markets is 95% plus .
Will he let us go hourly at least 5 times per month and change the source if we go hourly . This essentially would require they provide parking and lending for up 20 MW in the Cal and 40 MW in the June-Sept . Can we at least get a 50 MW block in the June-Sept period ?
Please put on my calender .
He is a definite hire . I thought I communicated that last week .
I did not realize we were going to reserve on spreads which create zero net position and almost zero credit risk . The new forward correlations are 90+% per the var model and it looks like your credit model is still using the old correlations .
I would like ASAP ( by new building ) a huge wall map with the logical RTO boundaries that has all of the large generators and substations ( nodes in LMP ) and LSE's territory color coded . This will become the tour location with a description of the regional markets and the energy hubs within those super regions . It will also help our traders get accustomed to electrically significant areas whether than NERC regions .
Good luck .
We need the hourly option to allow for non-GTC sources , but we will deliver into-GTC border hourly .
We don't need gas at this point , but we should be planning to add this .
Notice on the tags when we go hourly could be 30 minutes or less . Additionally , if we use them as sink when we go hourly , they will have to be part of the day-ahead tag . If these issues are not crystal clear with them , I have no interest in even showing an offer .
Are all of these units in our database ?
Please follow-up with this gentleman . Never know .
I need to leave at 3:30 today to go to my stepson's football game . Unfortunately , I have a 2:00 and 3:00 meeting already . Is this just a general catch-up discussion ?
What time works for you guys ?
Florida might be a better location than New Jersey . Can you say sunshine ?
OK .
He's making his rounds . I believe he is talking with Corp Risk and Reck . I get the impression he doen't want to be anywhere near an energy commodity that has a relationship with power ( which , of course , is all of them )
No .
Please participate and give group overview . Thanks .
I'm $2 bid for this spread in Cal 02 .
Thanks .
From East Power's perspective , the East PJM development site is the only site/turbine of interest and we should pursue pending transmission analysis to ensure the site is within the congested area of East PJM .
Outstanding . As usual , you are the king .
What other offer ?
I would support this 100% . It is consistent with the direction that Whalley , Lavo , and Delainey are headed with the retail risk management group .
Do you know this gentleman . Suarez is high on him .
Resume looks impressive . We should definitely interview him . I forwarded e-mail to Louise to see if she knows the guy from her London gas trading days .
I give bankruptcy 50/50 .
We'll go after him .
TJ has my calender . Just about any afternoon will work with this group .
I'll pay the extra $'s . I would like No . 480 in the new garage .
We need an immediate legal review to see what are on-going $ risks are in ERCOT . The deficiency of $6500 is no big deal when they allocate to all of the QSE's on a pro-rata basis , however what if the deficiency is $100 million and we our pro-rata share is $3 million ? Do we have any legal recourse ? Do they suspend the deficient QSE immediat|
Why can't we use AEP's position against them in their own backyard ( Ohio) . AEP's position is that you can't have effective retail markets without real-time energy markets ( which I agree with) , yet there is no real-time energy market with ancillary clearing prices in AEP's service territory in OhioCan we use their own testimony against them ?
Rika and Lloyd . This is work in progress with a realistic completion date of May 2002 .
I don't understand this e-mail .
Can you please set up a meeting and we can discuss .
PM call with the whole group , including Suarez . Can you find a date that works for everyone .
Looks fine .
Ader has managed to get cross-wise with another good employee . Ader's "supply group" has essentially stolen Roger's approved ERCOT LSE accounts . Rogers needs these LSE accounts to serve load in ERCOT and now he has none . This is BS and should not be tolerated .
I talked to Giffels today and he mentioned that SONGS units are under serious security scrutiny given its location . He gave us a 50/50 probability that Indian Pt 1&2 ( 30 minutes north of NY City ) and Pilgrim ( 15 minutes north of Boston ) would be shut down in the near term for security reasons . He mentioned that SONGS was also a candidate . I personally don't think the probability is that high , nonetheless , the rumors seem to be in the market .
Thank you very much for the nice gift ( and , of course , the $1) . I appreciate you girls putting up with me and doing a great job for the whole floor . Thanks again .
I told TJ the phone interview needs to be in the afternoon . No way will 11:45 work . We need a 4 or 5:00 pm phone interview , preferably tommorow . Can you please coordinate with TJ . 58 SOCO trades yesterday . 5 already this morning .
They have over 2500 MW at Wansley over 2 coal plants and 4 gas turbines ( in CC) . They can offer LD at this location
I am interested in firm LD fixed price energy delivered at the Gannon bus-bar . I have no appetite for unit contingent in the current market . TECO has an entire system they can lean on . I would consider bringing the gas , but you would have to involve Scott Neal's desk for transport and valuation becomes complicated . With respect to volume , I would not want any more than 100 MW . My strong preference is fixed price energy - no toll . Volatility is getting smashed and it doesn't make sense to pay for vol in a spread option . We are a much better bid for 5x16 or 7x24 energy .
My phone interviews are complete . Please send someone to pick up my forms .
Garret Tripp would be better able to answer your questions for the Canada nuclear facilities . With respect to forward hedging in the US , we have never seen British Energy hedge anything . I believe they have transition contracts with the utilities they purchased the plants from .
The meeting has been moved to tommorow at 11:00 am . We can discuss these issues before the meeting .
I will show him a 50 MW block .
I want to make sure the info is protected and if legal and regulatory are comfortable , then I am .
Probably Andy Fastow . His personal hurdle rate is 29%
No .
No problem . The only problem right now is ENE's stock price . Wow - you get em .
We have some serious issues . Downgrade , collateral called , liquidity crisis , issue more equity . I can see $12 pretty easy . I think both Lay and Fastow are gone .
Do you know this guy ?
Have HGP attend .
Get him in the door . Work with Kim Melodick in HR to make it happen .
Looks fine . You need to start learning . Work with Kim .
I have sent the message again to make curves as accurate as possible through 2015 . We are doing are best . The Entergy situation was simply a back office mistake . The NY off-peak is a work in progress and will get better every day . The legs never trade , only the cals , therefore , we have to use common sense for month values . Thanks for the info . In most cases , Narsima is exactly right .
I agree with this approach and I'm fine with this allocation . My objective is to get everything as accurate as possible so the proper price signal is being sent to retail and wholesale origination . I caught the scalar issue when we were looking at 4 hour tolls vs . 8 hour tolls vs . 16 hour and I could tell there was a disconnect . thanks .
Are we making sure everything is done on our end to liquidate and manage the EES retail positions effective 1/1/02 .
Probably Wayne Herndon . We need to lock him down ASAP . You and I need to have a beer this week to discuss ENE in general and what you want to do next .
Let's go tonight . I have a staff mtg . at 4:00 pm and we can go after that . Does this work for you ?
Please proceed with Stacey on taking the prudency you are comfortable with . Stacey will have to get approval from Louise and/or Lavo . Thanks .
No need to copy trading . Thanks .
We can't make a daily capacity market in the current environment .
As of 11:15 am , East Power has sold approx . 600-700 gas contracts and bought approx . 3 million Mwh's .
Just Morgan Stanley requiring tighter credit terms so far .
Jeff Shorter ( your counterpart at TXU ) just called me to inform me they will not be trading with Enron until further notice . They are evalutating their net exposure with us , including London . His number is 214-875-9632 .
I would have interest if you package together 50-100 MW of these small units to create a more liquid block of power .
I would not pay alot for this given the transmission issue . The best place for park and lend is JEA .
We need to do what the contract says . No one knows what the real intent was .
See you Monday .
Please attend .
We are not to discuss credit issues with any counterparties .
I'll defer to you and Lloyd on this one .
It's the trader's option . Most will probably not attend .
The time is right in the middle of trading on an AGA day . Therefore , it is unlikely that anyone managing a stack will be able to attend . I would suggest having Tom May and/or Lloyd attend .
Agreed . As far as I'm concerned , we are arbing the market .
No . We buy and sell where we see value . We don't even look at the other exchanges .
I would treat it as business as usual . If we are still having Associate/Analyst Super Saturday , we certainly can attend an energy panel discussion .
Can I get a deal like that for my house . Wow ! I'll be here until about 2:30 today .
Wednesday is the worst day due to AGA . We normally trade until 4:00 pm on AGA days . Therefore , I would suggest Tuesday or Thursday .
Please have Mark call me at work today . My phone # is 713-853-5035 .
Thank you . Is the black cover going to be removed so other employees know the spot is reserved ?
We have a meeting with Evans Automation next Saturday 11/10 at 10:30 am ( near Kemah) . Please mark the calender . Thanks .
Posoli Work Phone: 713-830-8663
Very efficient CC gas units in Entergy and ERCOT are setting price . Midwest and Plains has gas setting price 4-6 hours per day and coal the remaining 10 hours . The NE markets ( NY and NEPOOL ) are the only markets with 10,000 HR gas units setting price across the entire peak . Keep in mind that current temps are truly "no load" temps for East power ( no heating or cooling demand) . The addition of new combined cycle units in our market have been destructive to forward heat rates . Later .
I'm fine with it . They will only see through Cal 03 though .
Please set up a time with my asst . to discuss job opportunities in East Power . Bring a hard copy of your resume .
Make sure we are crystal clear on being able to fill this position physically at any VEPCO interface ( hourly or day-ahead) , and the PJM/VEPCO PJM LMP index is for pricing only .
The LD should be the hourly index .
The LD calc should be the hourly index and we need to eliminate the Peak Day designation damages .
Dana is interested in talking to JT about a scheduling and/or hourly job .
I will buy 5x16 unit contingent power $3.50/Mwh below my curve for 02 only for into JEA delivery . I will buy firm LD at my mid for into JEA delivery
My preference is normal energy only LD language . If we agree to use an index pricing point ( like PJM/VEPCO interface) , then a fair trade-off is to eliminate the capacity ratchet .
None of the meetings
No interest .
Please e-mail me the latest East Power Org Chart ( including services and Genco) . Thanks .
We plan to be done trading at 1:00 pm on Friday .
Thanks Joe . It was a pleasure having you as part of the team . I respect you as a person and a professional and I wish you nothing but the best in your future career . Please stay in touch with the team . Good luck Joe .
I apologize for my earlier comments . Everyone is having a rough time with the current meltdown of the company . I have been here 7 years and I am seeing everything I worked for coming to an end . It's not your fault and I do apologize .
Agreed .
I sold 5,000 MMBtu/day of Cal 04 NYMEX at 3.79/MMBtu .
The hourly index is a must for me ( the day-ahead index is unhedgable for us and we would give them free money for the next 10 years) . It is important to understand that under the new proposed structure , VEPCO will call on this energy many more days than they do now and it is very important that we create an index that we can hedge . I will not due this deal based on a day-ahead index - it must be hourly at the interface we defined . Please clarify your call option vs . firm delivery comment .
We will not be trading on Thanksgiving . However , we will have a skeleton crew in here on Friday . I proposed calcing P&L on Wednesday and not on Friday .
What do you mean only the left side .
What a piece of shit this whole BTU market is . Your mid-offer spreads look very reasonable to me .
Yes .
Fine .
Agreed . I think Bradford already blew up the Constellation deal .
Thanks . Sounds like you are having a blast . See ya on Sunday . How about them Canes .
The old lady says no . So far , there is 5 power guys that will play if the game is on .
No interest in pursuing this business .
Any value in this ?
I'm supposed to be in Disneyworld with the family for my first vacation in two years . Sorry , but I can't swing it .
I usually do , but she's been holding out .
Please attend .
I have received
Yes , authorized . Thanks .
I am not approving any new Kobra applications .
This is a test .
This is the retail book , not the wholesale book . You can get confirmation on this issue from Bill Bradford or Elizabeth Sager .
Enjoy your holiday . Hopefully , we will be up and running by the New Year .
Could you please create an org chart by function ( retained employees ) and org chart by function ( severed employees ) so we can reconcile to make sure we have not missed anyone . Once we have done this , we can create a seating plan that is optimal . Please e-mail me the org . charts so I have an electronic version . Thanks .
Please kill this request . I get 4 everyday .
Thanks . That will work fine with me .
The only issue I have is everytime I login I have some Windows Installer program I have to kill and it takes me an extra 2-3 minutes to keep closing files before I can get into my desktop . I don't know what caused this , but I am assuming some file you installed is still trying to run . In addition , the dial-up through Citrix is very very slow . Is this normal ? Any thoughts ? Thanks for all your work - the printer works just fine
Your thoughts on this guy ?
Please stop sending me this report .
OK - Tim did say he blew up trading options in the West . Played the "premium is profit" game selling summer calls at Palo Verde and we all know what happened . Bye Bye Ricky .
You are very welcome . You have been a fantastic asst for me and could not have achieved what we have as a group without you . Thanks again for all of your hard work and have a Very Happy Holidays !
I cancelled this over 4 months ago . Someone might have assumed by terminal .
Please send me a summary . Thanks .
Olgethorpe has officially terminated as of Dec . 20 , 2001 . Please see attached .
Wisconsin's offer is a joke . Carl - This is is clearly a two-way termination or they would have no offer at all ( I'm assuming you understand the difference) . We can buy Cal-02 Com-Ed under $30/Mwh all day long . This is a position we will deliver on to preserve the in-the money value . I would make it clear to Wisconsin that we intend on delivering in January and every single month thereafter because it creates positive cash flow for the estate . We also have broker quotes that show the market is 28 at 29 for Cal 02 . I would accept nothing less than $1.2 million . Thanks .
175k/yr . Wow - you get em .
Don , This looks good . You have my blessing to proceed with approval from the cash committee . You can reach me at home ( 713-856-7483 ) if you have any additional questions . Thanks .
Obviously , we will not deliver ( or receive if we are long ) if the transaction would result in negative cash flow for the estate on a "net counterparty" basis . Therefore , FE and TXU obligations would not be met for the 1st week of January because they result in negative cash flow . Cory , Please make sure going forward that we only include positive cash flow counterparties in the weekly projections . Please exclude the TXU and FE positions from the net position report as well . We will likely begin filling the non-pool positions starting next Wednesday . Jason - Please send to Cory ( I was unable to from home )
See note below . Upon confirmation from Portz , please remove Wabash from the non-termination counterparty list .
I believe Wabash has also terminated . Don , As you know , we had a meeting like this the week prior to Christmas and had an accurate list at that time . Our group can do nothing about delays between actual termination notification by the counterparty and communication to trading that termination has occurred . I think the meeting is warranted , however , we are not going to completely eliminate the timing issues . I will see you on Wednesday at 2:00 pm .
Please keep Rogers contact info for his vacation . Thanks .
The attached document should complement the documents sent earlier by Chris Calger . Hopefully , the combination of the two will provide some organization and focus at our 9:30 am meeting on Wednesday morning to discuss the "NETCO" Start-up initiatives .
The same attachment was sent again in case you had trouble opening the previous file . I am sending from home via the network and have been having some problems . Sorry to e-mail you to death .
Please put on my calender and remind everyone on Wednesday . Thanks .
FYI .
Attached is the spreadsheet version of the template we discussed this morning . I have added the additional columns everyone requested . I would now like the business unit leads to fill in the blanks such that we have an initial Power Implementation Plan that can be delivered to Louise on Friday . With respect to East Power ( I am out Thursday and Friday) , I am delegating to all of my desk heads the responsibility the following: 1 ) Have all of the forms attached spreadsheet forms complete 2 ) A product offering sheet is added to the template . Fletch & Dana - Please take the lead on creating the product offering list ( physical and financial) . My recommendation is we put products out through 03 for all regions ( financial and physical) . Obviously , the physical products will be contingent on receiving a power marketing license . Cory and Don Baughman - Please take a crack at identifying all of the transmission service agreements we need for the East ( Christi has started a list already) . Please call me on my cell ( 713-856-3923 ) with any questions .
FYI - trumped already .
Please send this attachment to the same list I just provided . thanks .
Please get final version to Tammie by COB tommorow . thanks .
Maybe . If we truly believe this is a credit starved industry with huge liquidity problems , then we should be able to dictate the terms for dealing with a AA entity....... . end of story . We should send this message early and often . If we don't , the market will percieve that negotiating "one-off" terms for trading docs is acceptable . I disagree with this approach from a long term philosophical standpoint . We either believe our bullshit or we don't .
Attached are Dana's additions .
Please print a copy of each for me .
Yes .
Please incorporate Dana's changes into the Master .
Do you already have this list . Please send all templates to Chris Calger , Elizabeth Sager , and Mitch Robinson . thanks .
All East Traders will have East only trading rights except for me . With respect to regions , assume the same organization as we ended with in early November . The one change is Rogers in the SE along with Suarez , and Carson . MW - Fletch , Russell , and Jason SE - Rogers , Suarez , Carson NE - Dana , Benson , Gupta , Broderick , Thomas ( off-peak) , Misra , Rogers , Makkai , Step , Schneider Remember , all of the desk heads will have gas trading authority as well . None of the prompt month cash traders will be trading gas .
I want to make sure we get the hardware and software ( I agree that this is already the property of ENA ) into Netco like we have the rest of the software/hardware critical to the trading organization . The payable is sunk and should be left with the estate .
Whoever has the latest aggregated Implementation Template , please forward copy ( copies ) to TJ so I can review the consolidated lists for: Regulatory Trading Agreements Transmission Service Agreements EOL Products TJ - Please follow-up to make sure I get the latest version . Thanks .
Please save and print for me .
Please print and save file for me .
Christi Nicolay and Sarah Novosel are the two best regulatory people . In terms of pushing the timing , political clout is going to be more important which in the past would have come from Kean and Lay . Obviously , that will not work anymore . I have a good relationship with Larcamp ( FERC head of Staff ) and might be able to help with the politics . I think FERC is going to want to hear directly from the new owner . If we want speed , I recommend we use the expertise of Christi and Sarah combined with the overall political clout of the new owner . You are not off base with Steffes at all .
shapiro is a lazier version of Steffes .
I concur with Jim on approach with one clarification . Transmission providers discussions should include both a trading rep and marketing rep .
Same as Chris .
Do you want me to put docs in front of Harry , Rogers , and/or Doug ?
Thanks Chris . I agree with the approach . It would be nice to handout a bound copy to all of the East and West trading/marketing desk heads for a thorough review to make sure we have not missed anything . See you tommorow .
Please cancel out the short and long KM position in the Holdings section . thanks .
Please begin scrubbing the 02 and 03 new gen book again given the current situation in the energy market . I would like a new forecast in 30 days if possible . In addition , I would like begin running the unit commitment model ( dispatch ) and "knock" the cob webs off everyone . Let's plan on having a meeting to go over what the new daily reports were going to look like - wasn't Gus working on this ? What is the status of the transmission modeling ? Can we integrate the system dispatch and LMP simulation models ?
Thanks .
Yes , that would be fine . I would also like to talk about my fixed annual fee . Based on the way I trade , and the amount of asset accumulaton , I think my fee is too high . Please call me about this issue so we can discuss .
OK .
Joe Holmes from IdaCorp ( 208-318-2100 ) called and expressed interest in Enron's services deals in the NA , presumably in the West . Don - can you have someone follow-up . thanks .
Can I hire Martin Lin back into Netco from the estate . He has provided valuable transmission & dispatch modeling expertise to our fundies group ( he worked for Vince in Research) . We have lost Anna Santucci to CMS and this would not change our headcount in the fundies group . Additionally , if I was forced to cut additional bodies , most of the cuts would likely come from real-time ( 3) , options ( 2) , regional trading ( 2) , logiFor Martin's planning purposes , I need to know something ASAP . Thanks .
Don't worry christi - I recognize what a great job your group did this year . It was by far the best regulatory effort ( from a power perspective ) with more results than any of the previous 7 years I was at Enron . You and your team deserve a great deal of credit and if we can keep this team together , we will reap the benefits for years to come .
The ESCA energy management system ( EMS ) in an industry standard software package to provide control area services and energy accounting in compliance with NERC standards . We used the software and hardware for remotely controlling/operating/dispatching our peaker plants and also used the software in 3rd party "outsourcing/services" deals in ERCOT and SPP . I hope this helps .
See changes attached with one subtraction ( Joe Step ) and one addition ( Doug Gilbert-Smith) .
I just sent you the promotion justifications . After further thought , Maria Valdez should be promoted to CS Manager , not Commercial manager .
Does Nat's organization look OK . Looks OK to me .
I have done multiple trades today and I also did several last week . Please clean up my Holdings page to net longs and shorts . How is your office reacting to the news about UBS acquiring our energy trading operation ? thanks .
I run the power group . Your question should be directed to Lavo .
This is crazy . We should not be giving the fundy web data to the estate .
Please use the next week to clean up our database of delivery locations and regions currently still in Enpower . I would like to start the database clean with only the key hubs listed: NY Zone J NY Zone G NY Zone A Ontario PJM East Hub PJM West Hub PJM West ERCOT South ( FP ) ERCOT North ( Basis ) Let's use this opportunity to clean up Enpower and start with a truly clean set of books . Team - Am I missing anthing ?
King , Carson , Suarez , Gupta , Broderick , Schiavone , Misra , Wang , and Ballato also need to be able to trade gas ( or there equivalent trading books need to be able to trade gas if the above names change) .
The UBSW Energy on-line products should be limited to the locations below through 2003 only . Off-Peak markets will be only in NY , PJM , NEPOOL , and ERCOT . NY Zone J ( FP and Basis ) NY Zone G NY Zone A Ontario ( FP and Basis ) PJM East Hub ( FP and Basis ) PJM West Hub PJM West ( Basis ) Com-Ed ( FP and Basis ) TVA ( FP and Basis ) Entergy ( FP and Basis ) ERCOT South ( FP ) ERCOT North ( Basis ) Casey - Please see above the markets that will be Fixed Price ( 1-30 day market ) and Basis/Spread ( forwards) .
I view the sharing of the fundies databases and associated web sites ( gas and power ) with the Estate as a serious commercial issue that we should not ignore . The estate can not only use the proprietary information as a competitor in the trading business , but they could potentially sell the data to multiple competitors . I can't imagine that this data was agreed to be shared by UBS and the Estate . I am not planning on giving any of the data to the Estate . I feel very strongly about this issue and the rest of the commercial organization does as well . One of the keys to maintaining a competitive edge in this business is our huge headstart in this area .
I would like to recommend to following allocations of retention $'s - THIS CREATES NO NET IMPACT ON TOTAL $'S ON THE SPREADSHEET Gain 575 cash 450 equity ( Rogers Herndon , John Forney , Joe Wagner , Tom May ) Re-allocate in the following manner: Cash Equity Steffes +50k +50k ( we will lose key reg people if we don't pay ) Please call with any questions . I feel very good about keeping nearly all of these people at the levels above and we could lose some key ones if we don't do this . Again , I am not spending any additional $'s - I am simply taking from other people who will not be part of UBS .
See request below .
I think I can get Jeff King done with a simple title change from Associate Director to Director with no salary change . His current salary is already Director level type comp . I potentially may need another 25k , but the title is a "feel good" issue that is important to Jeff . Please talk to Doug directly on the justification .
My Holdings page is still not netting . I just purchased 5000 DYN shares - please make sure the netting works .
thanks for the heads up .
This is Mirant's argument . Don't think it will hold water , but you never know .
I support this . This wan an oversight on our part .
Remove .
I understand . If I have too , I will dip into my money . I think the requests are reasonable and fair with respect to individual's peer group .
Carson is done and I just talked with Suarez . I told John he needs to make his decision based on the economics in his package . 150/150 is a great package for Suarez . I would be uncomfortable increasing based on other areas where we may be short . Good news on Craw .
Thanks Rogers . I think Steve would fit in with our group well . I probably need to wait at least a week to let the dust settle on our own people issues . My guess is we will end up losing 2-3 people and outside candidates then become viable .
Please put Allan Stewart Contact information ( get from Rogers ) in My Outlook contacts - home , cell , work , address , etc . and put a reminder on my calender to call him to re-establish contract relationship . Also , please put a reminder to call Fred Giffels regarding consulting agreement and FPL .
Are we going to attend ?
Fine with me if Hunter and Lavo can support it .
I want to make sure that we are adopting a policy whereby any material changes to employment agreements for individual employees are adopted across the board so we are creating consistency for all employees with respect to contract terms and conditions . I think this is very important from an execution and timing standpoint . I want to be able to represent to employees that "lawyering" the docs to death is not necessary , because we are going to maintain consistency for all employees . I would like an affirmative yes on this question by Tuesday am . Does everyone agree ?
Agreed .
please put on my calender .
Please put Steve Marland's Cell number in my Address Book .
Come see me tommorow morning .
Please put on calender and remind all desk heads to invite people who have signed up . This includes you , Tina , and Claudia .
I don't have this finalized yet until final personnel decisions are done .
I vote No . 1 . I think the necessary synergies between gas and power marketing in TX can be accomplished at you and Milly's level .
test
Ryan is waffling . I talked to him this weekend and he said his wife wants to move back north . These weather guys need physcology treatement . Dave now thinks this UBS deal is full of risk . I think the Friday event has everyone freaked out . Sorry to ruin your Sunday evening . With respect to fundies , I already have my guys working on this .
Please call me when you get in to discuss hole in SE . thanks .
Ron Green is the President of FPL Energy and Mark Maisto is the President of FPL Energy Trading ( sub of FPL Energy) . I have Mark's contact info at home . Send me an e-mail at kmpresto@hotmail.com and I can reply at home with his contact info . You would be a great fit for their shop .
Don't know his capabilities well enough to make an accurate assessment .
Please send the updated org list to Calger . thanks .
Lloyd Will will send to you today .
Please net longs and shorts for DIA and DYN . I will do almost all trades on-line , therefore , I would like some mechanism to make all trades net on the Holdings page .
I'm fine with it .
FYI . Please coordinate with Hunter and Belden on what we need .
Fletch Sturm ( works for me and runs the MW power group ) will be following up with you or Allen . We need to make sure we coordinate with gas and west power so no duplication is occurring . We need to also make sure that UBS is not already a client who receives PIRA materials .
Can we enter a retainer agreement with Sarah at Bracewell and have her attend this meeting on our behalf . Jim - What is your budget for this year on outside services ?
1 . Lloyd can trade any region with 30 day limit and total position limit of 100 MW . Lloyd will do mostly spread trades . 2 . Per our earlier discussion 3 . Ontario is part of the NE and we plan on having an Ontario market maker . I have to sort this out with Milly . Please stay silent on this one until we get the deal closed .
Please print and put in green binder . Thanks .
Harry is out . We are not extending an employment at will offer . Please destroy the contract offer and "drafted" employee at will offer .
Casey Evans has all of this .
One group needs to mark curves . I personally think it is easier for us to mark curves because we have traders in every region . I simply need to make it a priority again . I can go either way , though . We definitely don't want two sets of curves . Let me know .
I think you are probably correct . Upon closure , you will probably be marking your own curves . Having said that , you should probably begin now .
Make sure this gets all of your attention and is done right . I think we also need retail capability in ERCOT .
We need all historical data preserved in all markets ( price , vol , trades by counterparty , volume by counterparty , broker vs . EOL , broker prices , EOL prices , etc. )
We need it w/in the first 30 days .
Please complete Hayden's form for your respective regions . Keep in mind that this could act as potential position limit set forth by UBS so be careful in completing this form . In addition , UBS has a liquidity reserve used to adjust curves when marking P&L . The "liquidity reserve" accounts for the fact you can't liquidate at the mid and with big positions you probably can't even liquidate at the bid ( offer) . Thanks .
OK - Doug can have Smith Day and Jeff Miller work to get the retail certification .
I think this guy should be independent from the fundies . There may be special projects that are "highly confidential" in nature that should be directed by you , Hunter , Tim and myself . I think Robert would be more successful in a freelance role . Other input ?
Through separate desktop .
Yes - coordinate time with TJ Black .
Please remind me to file expense report from CT trip . In addition , please block my calender from Feb 6th to 10th for Florida ( Miami ) vacation . Please also change the March vacation to March 9-13 ( Disneyworld) .
I agree with Rogers . Because only one entity can mark curves and I have once again made this a requirement for all traders to get re-acquainted with value in the market , it makes sense for Netco/UBS to mark curves until the cutover occurs . At that point , both entities will assume separate responsibility .
Still no fix .
This is all wrong - Amy has latest list .
This list is wrong . Can you reconcile our headcount by functional group with this "incorrect" headcount .
Please put in contact book .
Based on what Fletch and Doug are doing , I would increase your #'s significantly . Your liquidity data is very conservative compared to Fletch and Doug . Your forward volumes are approx . 20% of Doug and Fletch and your ST data is about 50% . I would complete the form based on the liquidity we saw in Aug and Sept .
Yes , Wang and Stalford picked this back up yesterday .
I agree with the delegation except for Chris Dorland . Tim Belden needs to determine who validates the West Power curves . With respect to vol curves , Steve Wang and Rob Stalford need to validate . What time period are we validating ?
There is one left - Net 10000 DYN short with 10000 DYN long .
My guys are telling me that all of the broker sheets we collected are now in your hands . The validation for East Power should be very easy because we collected broker quotes almost every day and marked curves nearly every day . If there are gaps , please let me know . With respect to vol curves , I am having Wang and Stalford go back and validate .
Gas or Power ? Gas is Scott Neal and Power is Doug Gilbert-Smith for ERCOT ( TX ) and Fletch Sturm for LA/AL ( Gulf Coast) . The Williams energy traders know these folks so these questions must be coming from non-commodity people at Williams .
Please put Russell's info in my contacts .
Pushkar and Ellen Su are not SE Power offers . They are offers for our interest rate books/FX books . They should not fall under Power headcount .
Casey has a list of all the East Power curves . Frank - Stop re-inventing the wheel . This stuff has been done already .
I will be in town Monday and Tuesday . Out Wed-Fri in Florida . I will definitely help on Monday and/or Tuesday . I can make arrangements for backups later in the week if necessary . Let me know .
When will we close ?
Did UBS waive the employee CP ?
I have already moved someone from ERCOT to SE Power . We are set .
Please print and put in green folder ( ignore redlined version )
Chemistry is very important to me and I am rewarding Carson for his loyalty and "low maintenance" . In addition , he demonstrated much improved risk management skills that last 6 months of last year . Mike ( working for Fletch ) is very capable and will do a great job for us in the SE . Eric Saibi will come over from ERCOT and run the cash books in the SE . I will be happy to talk Marcello to see if there is another fit . With respect to the NE , I also want to move some of the young guys up - they have worked hard for the past 12-18 months in real-time and fundies roles and deserve a chance before an outside person .
Obviously , coordination with gas and power fundies ( rika imai and chris gaskill ) is important for almost all projects unless confidentiality is necessary given the nature of the project scope . My view is No . 1 is part of Rika's core day to day world . No . 2 and No . 4 are more special project in nature and this is a gap you could help fill . I will be out Wednesday through Friday so we should sit down tomorrow .
I sit at 06543 ( will be moving Wednesday/Thursday) . I can meet mid-morning tommorow . Get on my calender with TJ at 35800 . thanks .
Please ensure that real-time prices for ERCOT , PJM , NY , and NEPOOL are added to the cube database . I have been analyzing the data today and the real-time clearing prices are not there . Thanks .
What about DIS
What do you need from me ? Do you want me to meet with him ? talk to him on the phone ? go to lunch ? is he looking for a job ? As you can see , I don't have much information of the objective here .
These are not good fills . When I gave the order DIS was trading at 21.87 ( 21.86 at 21.88) . I can understand 2-3 cents but not 9 cents .
Lloyd - Don't worry about the formatting . After playing around some more , I have a new way that works fine for me . The main issue is keeping the database live with all of the historical information . We can figure out how to format . thanks .
I received your voice mail and I'm OK with electronic signatures . However , for the 1st 60 days , I still want to review . thanks .
Go ahead and run with it .
Go ahead and cancel .
I believe he has signed . Confirm with Dana Davis .
Please print and put in binder for me . Please combine the document from yesterday in the same binder so I can read the whole package while I'm on vacation . Thanks .
Can he come over to our trading floor around 11:00 am ? I can give him a quick tour and then give him a macro overview of the NA energy markets . Please confirm via e-mail and directly with my asst . ( TJ Black at 713-853-5800) . Thanks .
Please arrange a room for an East Power Mtg at 10:00 am this morning . Agenda: UBS Warburg Energy Closing/Implementation On-line products ( which products and when ) Power documents ( EEI and ISDA )
The whole group . Please type the short agenda I have prepared . Thanks .
I won't be in until about 9:30 because I have to get my drug test done .
Did this meeting get confirmed ?
Did you submit my expenses from the CT trip ?
Andy can trade all regions and all commodities ( just like a desk head) . He is replacing Harry .
Can we update the laminated card with the most recent headcount and phone #'s. ?
Is this the office I selected ? Please confirm .
I will be out Wednesday through Friday on vacation . Please have Dana Davis , Fletch Sturm , Rob Benson , Andy Zipper , and Doug Gilbert-Smith represent East Power in my absense . Thanks .
Jim , Please provide a quick update . I was unable to participate in your call today because of a market risk mtg . with UBS . I will be out Wednesday through Friday so I would like to hear directly from you what FERC's state of mind was .
Filing looks good . My vote is go forward with a clean 205 filing as attached . If we file the 203 as well , FERC will gravitate directly toward that . I think we retain more flexibility if we stick with the 205 approach . Other thoughts ? I will be in Florida ( vacation ) Wednesday through Friday . I can be reached via cell and TJ will have my hotel phone # . In addition , I will check e-mails at least once per day at the hotel business center .
I can be reached on my cell in Florida . In addition , you can leave messages with the hotel voice mail ( I am staying at Ritz Carlton on Key Biscayne) . I will also be checking e-mail at least once per day .
Please increase my H:/drive limit . As Managing Director for East Power I require the ability to retain more than 500MB . Please contact Lloyd WIll at 713-853-3383 if you require any additional information . Thanks .
Your thoughts ?
If I picked 6102 , why am I getting 6103 ?
Please make copies for me and put in a folder . thanks .
Can you figure out a way to get my new card without be being there .
I received zero .
6103 is on the original e-mail from tammy shephard .
I'll get back with you on this within a couple of days . Do you want an indicative bid for 7x24 bus-bar energy ( 2 , 5 and 10 years) . We would not bid on the entire 1000 MW - maybe 150-200 MW . thanks for the info . Kevin Presto UBS Warburg Energy Phone: 713-853-5035 Fax: 713-646-8272

Greg , Below are the following names of some potential reviewers for this period . I am also meeting with John Thompsen who was my analyst pool representative last review period for lunch on Thursday . Phil Platter Jeff Richter Chris Stokely Heather Dunton Les Rawson Mark Fischer Holden Salisbury Sean Crandall Chris Foster Stewart Rosman I assume you will be reviewing me as well . If you have any questions , please let me know . Thanks , Bill
I do not believe I should be on this list . Please remove me . Thanks , Bill
Greg , Sorry for the delay in getting you my accomplishments . I filled out the self-evaluation portion of the PRC back in May . I have attached my responses to the self-evaluation form . My accomplishments and more long-winded descriptions of what I do are in the attachment , by comparison my near-term goals for the next 6 months are pretty concise . 1 . Continue to maximize the abilities of the group , and try to leave nothing on the table . 2 . Minimize our settlements and disputes over Enpower mistakes , or other avoidable actions . 3 . Continue to provide those in the group opportunities to improve themselves and get where they want to go in Enron . 4 . Stay ahead of California with regards to political , legal and credit risk . 5 . Work with middle-marketing and services groups to develop new opportunities . 6 . Improve my education through SQL training and more advanced Derivatives training to better allow me to understand the fundamentals of the market and the movements of spreads relative to market fundamentals . I greatly enjoy my current position and look forward to the next 6 months . If you have any questions just let me know . Thanks , Bill
Jim , Harbor and Martel were declined with the CISO for 06/08/01 HE 1 and HE 2 . The reasons: for Harbor the CISO inc'd them to 10 , and ignored their operating limits as entered at 60 and 80 . Martel was inc'd but could not ramp up . Both bids were properly entered by were ignored by the CISO . Delano was incd'd and dec'd several times in the morning and was able to respond . Let me know if you have any other questions . Thanks , Bill
Thank you Kysa , I appreciate the info .
We are long 25 mws in NP-15 at $54 for HE 7-22 . This is under the ST-WBOM line in CAPS . We are long at $54.00 Call me with any questions.. . Thanks , Bill
Let me know if you have any questions .
Jim , Just a quick note regarding scheduling on Saturday . There should be a 25 mw n-firm export for HE 7-10 and HE 13-22 . The schedule ID for HE 7-10 was CISO_EPMI_BUNNY . The schedule ID for HE13-22 was EPMI_CISO_BUNNY . For HE 11 and HE12 , Danielle at the CISO misentered our schedule . CAPS shows a final of 25 mws as a firm import . This should be a n-firm export . We recieved the energy as a firm export from the CISO . All schedules should be under ECTSTSW not ECTRT . If you have questions please let me know . Thanks , Bill
Jon , Thanks for the schedule . Unfortunately I won't be at tonights game or the outdoor game tomorrow . I should be at the games next week though . Bill
PORTLAND TIMBERS vs . the VANCOUVER WHITECAPS Gates Open at 5:35...Kickoff at 7:05 See me for tickets ( your ticket counts as a MAX ticket for the day ) Food and Beverages will be provided
Steve , Just want to make sure you have me as Bill Williams III . Thanks , BIll
Group , We are long for the 13th in California , 25 mws under ST-WBOM in NP-15 at $57 . We are also long 22 mws under ST-CALI in NP-15 . ST-CALI is also short in the morning in SP-15 . They are short at around $30 . ST-CALI is providing us with a sheet detailing their positions for RT , we will now be providing them with a sheet each morning detailing their sales from the previous day . Going forward , please put all the ST-CALI sales or length in the service sheet beneath our activity . We are also short 10 mws to EWEB for HE 1-12 , Willamette has a month long sale at $270 but needs to come down unexpectedly for maintenance . We will backfill this and split any profit with Services . Finally.. . We must check out with BPA each hour for Frontier and GCPUD . Please make the call right after you call EPE dispatchers ( between 25 after and 35 after) . The new service sheets have a place for initials for the call each hour , please initial after making the call to BPA ( ext . 2277) . ALSO...TIMBERS TOMORROW NIGHT !
Virginia , I have no idea . I would recommend checking with Cara...she's omniscient . Good luck .
Thanks for the work Bob . I will see you on the 27th at PDX . Bill
Thank you Jill
Group , We have 25 mws of length in the BOM book at $56 again for 06/14/01 on peak . This energy is in NP-15 . Please make deals under ST-WBOM . ST-CALI has another 5 mws each hour on peak in NP-15 . See CAPS for other information . Thanks , Bill
Brooklyn , Unfortunately the change to $290 was not the final price for deal #620476 on 05/23 . It should be $295 for HE 15-17 and $290 for HE 18-19 . I have checked Enpower and the sheet to make sure that they reflect these changes . If you have any questions , please let me know . Thanks , Bill
Thanks for the information Heather . This looks good and useful . Would you have any information on what tools we used to settle ? Or was it all a manual process ?
Rhonda , The CP "New" represents a counterparty as yet to be determined . I am working with Diana Scholtes on this . This deal is essentially a placeholder . I will give you the information as I receive it . Thanks , Bill
Chris , I attached a simple sheet outlining our basic process of decremental bidding . From a Real-Time standpoint we are ready to implement this process immediately . I believe we have the tools in place to capture the revenue on the volume management side as well . Kourtney Nelson is out of the office today but will return on Monday . I feel we should involve her in the process when she returns . Overall , this is very similar to what we did last summer and should be relatively easy to implement . Feel free to see me with questions . Thanks , Bill
Group , We are long 25 mws 7-22 on Monday in SP-15 at $65 . Deals should be under ST-WBOM . We are also long 25 mws under the ST-CALI book . Please be sure to put this in the service sheet . Other ST-CALI length or EES shorts will be on Phil Platters sheet and in CAPS . Thanks , Bill
Just wanted to congratulate you guys on the excellent work on the night of the 13th . The SAR was within $4 of risk managment's numbers on the Daily Position Report ! The night note looked very good ( great job on the services portion ) and there were ZERO problems with the shift . The hard work is much appreciated , keep it up . Bill
Anna , When you have a chance , I would like to pay you for the golf tournament and grab a receipt from you while I am at it . My impression is that the deadline is approaching and that this is something we need to get done today . Please let me know when you might be available or just grab me when you have a chance . Thanks , Bill
Dave , Good morning . Just wanted to confirm my email with you . It is Bill Williams III , not Bill Williiams . Thanks for the email . Bill
Steve , My address is Bill Williams III , Please make the correction . Thanks , Bill
Thanks Lisa.. .
Cannot wait.. .
Please add Ainsley Gaddis and remove Daniel Kang from your list when sending the spreadsheets to EES . Thanks , Bill
Kate , take a quick look at this would you ? Group , Going forward we will be transacting with Enron Canada Corp on an over-the-counter basis . We will provide them with a bid and an offer suitable for buying from or selling to them non-firm energy . Enron Canada will contact us each morning to inquire about possiblities for export and import . We should be familiar with the Alberta Power Pool forecast and be aware of the conversion from CDD to USD . The lead or NW trader will provide Enron Canada with their estimate or feel of the market . Enron Canada will be trying nearly every hour to obtain non-firm transmission . If this is an unwise practive from a risk-reward standpoint based on our understanding of the market , WE need to tell them , as they are losing $6.40 per mw CDD on unused tranny with zero chance for return . Further , Enron Canada wants the opportunity to transact with other counterparties at the BC Border . If we cannot use their energy they have asked to be able to contact WWP , IPC or TransAlta after giving us first look to attempt to recoup some of their loss . I do not see a need for this and think there is potential for embarrassment and damage to customer relations . If we are in contact with Enron Canada before hand ( start of the day , top of the hour , etc. ) we should be able to get them the best price for their energy . Be very clear in your dealings with the NW counterparty that the energy is non-firm . Determine a book-out price if necessary to solve problems with physical flow . We are basically buying a put or a call . Finally , I would like to see the communication with Enron Canada improve . Personal experience and observation has us not communicating with them as closely as possible and typically only speaking with their real-time group at the bottom . I feel we can do better . I want to prevent a repeat of this weekend ( ECC selling/buying from a counterparty in the US without our knowledge ) and do not want the NW being scoured by both Enron Canada and Enron North America . This is counterproductive for both of us for obvious reasons . Providing a bid/offer and being prepared to act on it is a change in our relationship with Enron Canada . This should force a renewed emphasis on communication and market fundamentals that should only be beneficial . If you have questions or ideas regarding the relationship with Enron Canada please let me know . To be sent to John Zufferli ( equivalent of Tim B in Canada ) and Portland Shift
These schedule changes must be called in . Just a reminder . Bill
Nikki , Thanks for the note and I hope your doing well . You're right , sometimes introductions sound more like the presentation of a resume than a letter...but I think you pulled it off . I was able to close on my condo last weekend . It was a tremendous pain with a bit of the last minute run-around , but I finally got moved in on Friday night . I don't know about my neighbors yet as I am the only one moved in on my floor so far . The seller is still finishing the renovation of the place...they are converting it from an old hotel . My condo is about 8 blocks from my office downtown , so it was great to roll out of bed this morning and be able to walk to work . Like you , I am not sure what Brendan might have told you about me...so here goes . I was born on the east coast ( Connecticut) , moved around for a while , and eventually was towed out to southwest Washington by my parents . I went to highschool in Kelso ( this is where I met and then graduated with Brendan) . Then went to college at University of Washington in Seattle . College was good , if a bit long . I received a degree in Metallurgical engineering and worked as an engineer in Portland for a year doing failure and corrosion analysis ( whoa!) . A bit less than 2 years ago I started working with Enron as a trader , trading hourly electricity in the West . I started out on shift , but now manage the group and get to work a more normal schedule ( usually 10-12 hours a day ) during the week . I enjoy the job a ton , the market changes nearly every day and it beats the hell out of staring at a scanning electron microscope for 4 hours at a pop . With regards to your visit . I've been in Portland for a few years now , so I should be able to provide a fairly good guide service around the town . Depending on when you get here and how things go , we'll have to see if we can get you outside the city to some of the Mountains and the Coast . Astoria is about 2 hours away and it's a pretty scenic drive out there ( especially if you're from New Mexico) . If the weather's nice we might be able to check out some of the resevoirs and rivers around Mt . St . Helens and the gorge...good swimming , hiking etc . It should be a blast . Have you gotten any closer to firming up when you will be in town ? I am pretty open at the start of July , and although it always rains on the 4th ( EVERY single year) , that's still a good time to be coming up . Besides , if you ever thought about moving here , you have to understand why its so green.. . It was good to hear from you , and if you have any questions you can give me a call at 503-887-3449 . Take care . Bill
Sure .
There will be a Real-Time Group Meeting on July 9th at 4:30 . We will be discussing new Ferc Rules , Dispute Management , Group Changes and Cuts . Please let me know immediately if you will be unable to attend . Thank you , Bill
Easy there.. . Everything will be okay.. .
Actually Amy , I will not be able to attend on the 5th . Is there an alternate date ?
Heather , I spoke with Chris and he is on board with the annuity of $18750 from ST-CALI to ST-WHOURLY . Thanks for the help with this . Bill
Alan , Can we meet today and discuss the pros and cons of this order . I will be available as soon as you are ready.. . Thanks , Bill
Mr . Kuehn.. . I like the BridgePort idea , unsure about the Food idea at ZOOP . What did you have in mind ? Nate Stanton gave me a call today...we could invite him and folks from work...either way I am cool...also bear in mind that my place has no furniture.. . JOY !
Looks good Ray ! Nicely summarized . Bill
John , Thanks for the timely note . PRC is today . Much appreciated .
Here it is.. .
Alan , I just received this from our client rep detailing their position . As expected they are treating the Stage 1 as ending at 11:32 rather than HE 23 as stated on May 31 in both their website and on their message net . I would like to get FERC's position on this if necessary . If it is $91.87 rather than $108.49 as indicated in the FERC order , we will use that as a cap as soon as FERC ( or you ) recommends it . Thanks , Bill
John , We have asked every single counterparty in the NW to sell us energy . We bid $300 to PowerX and were told that they were abiding by the cap . We are working hard to get them the energy that they need and will continue to do so . Bill
Group , CAPS will be down from HE 20 through HE 1 on Saturday morning . We will have to use workspace and run Enpower to CAPS after HE 1 . We may want to run Enpower to CAPs early ( or at least create finals ) so that we do not lose any data if the whole thing gets erased . Please call with questions . Good luck . Thanks , Bill
Nikki , Hello , how are things going ? Hope you've caught up on your sleep from California . That's what I am going to work on this afternoon so I can enjoy the weekend . I am so glad the week is over . I am exhausted . Nothing like if I had worked 92 hours though . Sorry to hear you only have the night of the 3rd open . Hopefully you are getting to spend more time in the city of Portland than just one afternoon . There's just too much to do here to only spend one afternoon . As for where to stay , there's a bunch of hotels out at the airport , or you can stay downtown . I can take you out to the airport in the morning if you need as I will not be working on the 4th of July . Give me a call if you have a chance and have a good weekend . Bill
Group , A reminder . My email address is bill.williams.iii@enron.com . Bill Williams III needs to appear in the outlook box , otherwise I do not receive the email . I should be copied on the EES sheets , and any cut notes to volume managament , the services desk , or other traders . Thank you for making this correction . Bill
Steve , Good looking notes this weekend . Both notes were very informative and detailed . I appreciate the good work . Bill
Chip , As we figured out a couple of weeks ago , most of our ADS cards have expired . We were then using Brett Hunsucker's card . If you remember , we were waiting on the CAISO to send us new cards and new passwords about two weeks ago . Unfortunately Brett's card appears to have expired this morning as we can no longer log in . We are consequently unable to communicate with the CAISO over the ADS . We may now be in violation of our participating generator agreement with the CAISO . Is there something that I can do to speed this process , perhaps lodge a complaint with the CAISO or our client rep ? Do you have any ETA from the CAISO on our cards and passwords ? All your help is appreciated . Thanks , Bill
Karen , You must change your e-mail list for Bill Williams . Please send this to bill.williams@enron.com . Not bill.williams.III@enron.com . Subtle difference . But if you consider your information worthy of review - please make the e-mail change . Regards Bill
John , How was Austin ? Did you get the rest and relaxation you were looking for ? How about golf ? Everyone has only ever had good things to say about Austin . Audi TT ? NICE pick . Is that a 6-speed ? Only 23,000 miles is pretty sweet and the color is right ( matches the 400E) . Next time I am down there ( ? ) you'll have to provide a demonstration . I am really getting the urge to lose my 525 ( this seems to happen about every 6 months) , I have only driven it once since I moved ( about 5 miles total) . Kind of hard to justify $+500 a month for car , insurance and parking when I drive it 20 miles in a month ( just not very cost effective) . An old 2002tii would only cost me parking and insurance ( and my pride) . Other ideas ? So I am in the new place . It's great ! Perfect location ( just no parking) , and I get way more sleep ( til 5!) . Its got a pretty solid view and feels much bigger than it is because of all the windows . Now if I could just get some furniture...maybe a table.. .
Any word ? We need those cards and passwords.. .
Group , We are long 25 mws on peak for 06/27/01 in SP-15 . This should be in CAPS under ST-WBOM , deals should be under ST-WBOM in Enpower as well . Bill
Looks great Jill ! Thanks , Bill
Nikki , Hope you're doing well and continuing to enjoy Newport...My friend lives down there in Huntington Beach ( watch out for him!) , he moved down there about 3 months ago . I have been planning on visiting him for a while . I wouldn't mind getting your perspective on the city as well when I come down . Last time I was in LA , I spent a fair amount of time on the Strip and around Hollywood before heading home . Another guy I know down there works at the House of Blues and got me tickets to Taj Mahal--Steven Segal came out and played guitar with them at the end ( the guy was NOT good)--which was nice . Also , one of my neighbors from college works on the Maury Povich show ( I think) . So , I definitely need to go down there for a visit . I will be in Sacramento towards the end of July ( 16th thru 18th ) and then am planning to get down to LA right at the start of August for work and perhaps a bit of goofing off . So whatever , if I make it down there it should be a decent time . Sorry to hear about the possible cancelation of the trip to Portland , hope you can make it ( though the deck seems stacked against you this time around) . I will plan for you to be here ( so you wouldn't be stuck in a hotel) , but don't worry if you can't get here on the 3rd . Plenty of time for that , as the sun should be out for a while ( til October anyway) . I was knocking around going snowboarding up at Timberline on Saturday ( get a few runs in before 10) , but I am leaning towards a trip around Mt . St . Helens on my bike instead . It's supposed to be around 80 and sunny here on Saturday and you can't pass such weekends up . St . Helens should be gorgeous and since we are in the middle of a drought in the Northwest I want to check out the level of the resevoirs up in the mountains . We'll see though , either way I will be getting up early to catch the sunrise in the mountains . So work was solid today , got just about everything accomplished that I wanted to . No one brought me lunch after working the night shift...but what can you do ? Anyway , hope the funeral goes well ( you know...as it can) , and keep me posted on when/if you might get up to Portland . Oh . And as for a picture , I'll see what I can do . Brendan's got a couple , but I don't have any that I can pop on the web right now and send down to you . I admit , I have been called an Ogre before ( I am a bit of a taller , bigger fellow on the soccer field--and some forwards have unresolved issues concerning it) , but...well...Brendan should be able to fill you in . Like I said I will see what I can do about a picture . Enjoy your time in LA , And take care . Bill
Enjoy .
Group , For 06/28 only: We need to send APS losses , 2 mws for HE 1 at 4C345 from EPE . Lisa Gang has put this in the sheet and made a preschedule tag . We need to make a buy from EPE under ST-Whourly in Enpower , and a sale to APS at zero in Enpower . Please make sure this schedule is in as losses . You can call me with any questions . Thanks , Bill
No There .
Cheeky ?
Yup .
Kate , Need your help with MPC
I would be TOTALLY thrilled if you could let the group know...now about those MPC numbers...we need to go through the inc sheets and service sheets from last year...and we have half an hour .
Very well done Jill .
Go ahead and order everyone in the group who wants them the new phones . Those Eriksons are constantly breaking down . Let's get ahead of this curve .
Heather , We had some double deal-entry last night under the ST-WBOM book . Consequently I zeroed the following deals out this morning after receiving the DPR and running a BOM SAR . The deals are as follows: 665907 ( buy from imbalance) , and 665913 ( sell to PowerX) . The extra sale to PowerX provided the excess $10,875 of revenue . I apologize for our mistake . Let me know if you have any questions . Thanks , Bill
I will be out of the office for 06/29/01 . I can be reached on my cell phone at 503-887-3449 if you need anything . Thanks , Bill
Nikki , Good afternoon , How are you ? Hope everything worked out in LA . I don't know if you are still coming up to Portland but I was emailed a picture at work today from opening day at PGE Park ( the minor league baseball stadium up here ) and figured I'd pass it on . The picture was taken in the Enron suite at the park , I am the one directly in front of the TV . The rest of the folks are from the Origination ( not Trading ) side of Enron , except my boss , who is on the far left of the picture as you look at it . Portland has been nice the last couple days , though its been raining like crazy . I went up on my roof last night , the sun was setting and there was a lull between the storm systems moving through . Beautiful night . The sun had already gone down below the west hills , but was still reflecting off some of the taller buildings to the east of my place . There was this slice of deep blue sky extending from the west over my head , and all around were low menacing storm clouds . A stiff breeze was blowing south to north and smelled of fresh rain . Amazing . It should be a nice weekend up here . In fact , I am taking tomorrow off and getting in a bit of golf . I am playing an hour north of Portland on a links style course . If its a clear morning , I should be able to see Mt . Rainier , Mt . St . Helens , and Mt . Adams . It is an interesting course to play . Now if I can just get the ball to go in the hole I'll be happy . Hope the pic makes it to you through our firewall .
David , Try to make sure you get these to me rather than to my Dad . I think he is starting to get annoyed . Thanks , Bill
Group , Here is the most current information regarding charges from the CAISO , the FERC Ruling and the Price Cap . 1 . The current price cap is $91.87 . We should continue our practice of not selling over the cap , however we can ( and should ) buy over the cap if necessary for the system reliability of our service customers . 2 . The FERC order specifies a penalty of $100 per mw for underscheduling load ( greater than 5% per load zone underscheduled) . Despite the CAISO's repeated protests ( and the IOU's complete disregard of this order) , WE can expect to be subject to this penalty . 3 . When a WARNING is in effect the CAISO will be making out-of -market calls . These OOM calls will not show up in the expost or beep stack . Therefore when power supplies become tight , the prices in the "expost" may actually drop . We should continue our practice of NOT leaving uninstructed energy in the CAISO whenever possible . 4 . We should continue to participate in the CAISO congestion market . The CAISO frequently has unexpected hourly path loadings , and congestion has occurred in the hour ahead market that was not present in the day ahead market . 5 . Remember to include CAISO export fees , Tie Meter Multipliers/import fees and grid management fees in your CAISO calculations of wheeling charges . We will have a real-time meeting on Monday July 9th at 4:30 PM in Mt . Hood . We will discuss other changes in the market at that time . Please make plans to attend . Thank you , Bill
This needs to go to Bill Williams , not Bill Williams III . The difference is subtle but is rather important if you want the correct person to receive your message . Please make the appropriate change in your contact lists and address book . Thanks , Bill Williams III Manager Short Term West Hourly Trading
Group , Dave Perrino will be providing us a presentation on losses during the second week of July ( tenatively scheduled for the 11th at 4PM) . There is some math/electrical engineering involved . I have attached the presentation that Dave will give . Please take about 10-15 minutes to get familiar with the presentation and prepare your questions . Thanks , Bill
Fun Transmission link...proposed oasis.. .
Please go to this site , then print the map out in color . I cannot print to Valena currently . Thanks , Bill
Group , Ryan sent this email out once already , here it is again . The oasis site map is The details of checking for ATC are as such Red=PAC(t) , Blue=IPC(t ) Leg 4 . PATHC to PACE Leg 5 . PACE to FC3 We can do a buy resell with EPE to move this to PV or can use APS tranny to move this to Mead or PV as well . When scheduling from BOBR to FC3 on PAC ( t ) be sure to just put in the POR/POD and do NOT schedule each wheel seperately . This will prevent us from being charged $5.84 each time . Total cost for this tranny should be $5.84 +$2.38 +$5.84 = $14.06 . There will also be losses . If using this wheel for a services customer , be sure to add in for losses and scheduling fees . Also , be sure to LOG OUT of the IPC website when finished , otherwise we will be locked out if we time out ! There should already be a template for a tag to move this energy from PAC system border in the NW to FC345 . This path has had approximately 400 mws of tranny availabe the last few days . Please see me with questions . Thanks , Bill
Confirmation from Keoni on an unrevised price cap...as of 15:01.. .
Virginia , I have one question on this month's PMA and some questions from last month . First , for deal #549162 , this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty TacomaSupp . This counterparty was then changed to Tacomapubuit . Why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue ? Are we being charged for each counterparty again ( like EES and ST-Cali last month) , if so , we need to fix this flawed tool . Second , for last month , we determined that the WBOM book needs a $108,000 PMA for change in price . The appropriate price is in Enpower , but the revenue has never appeared ( Deal #590753) . Remember , this deal was originally input as a buy at $320 and a sell at $30 and liquidated at these prices . The deal is now at $320 and $300 . What do we need to do to get this trued up ? Please come see me with questions . Thank you for your help . Bill
Virginia , I also had a question on a PMA from January . On TransAlta deal #509285 , your notes indicate that mw volumes for HE 23 and HE 24 were reduced by 95 mws each hour . Enpower and the inc sheet do not reflect this change . The PMA indicates a charge of $42750 for a reduction in our purchase from Transalta . Why would we receive a charge for a reduction in purchased energy ( ie . less money from us to Transalta) ? There is no indication of a reduction in volume on the other side of the trade ( sale to Sempra-Deal#509277) . Please come see me when you have a chance . I think we need to go through this . Thanks , Bill
Crystal , Good morning . Haven't heard from you in forever and unfortunately did not get a chance to respond to your last email . Just wanted to say hello and wish you a good Fourth of July !
Ticker on bottom works , nothing else really does .
Alan , According to this site the cap was around $71 for HE 15 and $72 for HE 18 . We had already traded for these hours when the "new cap" had been set . This is a retroactive cap during mitigation hours . When trading in the hour ahead market ( 1 hour before energy flows ) we cannot predict the Cap to Market ratio . For example: Expost is $18 right now , and the market is at $91.87 . Any recommendations ? Bill
Troy , The difference is subtle , but I believe you wanted this to go to Bill Williams not Bill Williams III . Please make the appropriate change to your address book . Thanks , Bill Williams III Manager Short Term West Hourly Trading
Thanks for the update .
Fran , If this deal was zeroed out ( and it has been after the fact) , then we should also have received a credit for no longer buying from MPC ( the other side of the deal , deal #549160) . We should only lose $40 ( the net difference) . Any ideas ? Thanks , Bill
Group , Two totally different issues for you . First: When scheduling transmission on Portland General Electric from John Day to Malin we MUST use deal #146517 , we MUST make the price zero . We extend this deal in scheduling and change the delivery points . We then make an annuity to ST-NW for losses . Easy . Second: For the third time in two weeks the behavior of the Real-Time Group after 6 PM has been brought up . We will talk more regarding this in our meeting next week . It is important to note that we need to remain within the bounds of professional behavior at all times . Enron has a zero tolerance policy regarding harassment ( language or behavior that offends or belittles others) . Thanks for your attention . Bill
We will pay APS losses of 1 mw for HE 1 PDT only on July 4th . Lisa has made the tag and put the losses in the preschedule sheet . Kate has made the enpower for this deal ( #672781 , and #672785) . Please put the price in for deal #672781 ( buy from EPE) . Thanks , Bill
Group , When doing swaps please use the swap function in Enpower . Do not enter annuities anymore for financial deals . Be sure to specify whether you are buying or selling index and then what index you are selling ( NP15 inc/dec...etc) . An example appears in the attachment . Swaps have caused disputes that have dragged on for months in the past , so call me with any questions . Thanks , Bill
Jim , On Tuesday we sold the CAISO replacement reserves at Malin for HE 15 and HE 16 , then HE 18 through HE 22 . We were exercised for the first 40 minutes of HE 15 ( for the last 20 minutes of HE 15 our energy was uninstructued and we received the dec price) . For HE 16 , and HE 18-22 we were awarded the capacity payment but were not exercised . The capacity payment should be at least $91.86 for each hour it was received . If you have questions , please let me know . Thanks , Bill
Count me in.. . Bill
Eric , I have forwarded this to Bill Williams . Please note that there is a subtle but important difference between the two email addresses . Please make the change in your address book . Thanks , Bill
Chip , I need to have a tape pulled for Ryan Slinger on July 3 at 14:40 and 14:45 . Let me know when you have the time and I will go up with you to pull the tape . Thanks , Bill
Fred can be reached at 1-915-543-4335 . Nice email to Fred on Tuesday by the way .
We could pull tapes ? Ask the person who did the deal ? There is nothing in notebooks . Any word on the BOM PMA ?
Good morning , Yesterday for HE 10 and HE 11 we were cut Real Time by El Paso Electric on an import ( EPMI_CISO_BLUE) . The import was cut by 30 mws and 42 mws respectively . A purchase from the imbalance has been made . Also for HE 12 , we bought back most of Harbor Cogeneration's schedule . Harbor was going to run for 20 mws but could not . We told Harbor that we would take the charge for them . Therefore , the -20 mws of generation deviation for Harbor needs to be allocated to ECTRT as Load Deviation . We put in a purchase of 20 mws from the imbalance in Enpower . Finally there is a variance for HE 17 and HE 18 possibly because of load shift from NP to SP . We are flat in CAPS position manager . And flat in Enpower . Thanks , Bill
Virginia , We have resolved almost all of the recent PMA sheet . The Tacoma/MPC deal is fine if its zeroed out for HE 3 . I just need to have the cost zeroed out as well as the revenue . Currently only the revenue has been zeroed out and if I receive the credit for buying from MPC I am satisfied . Fran is aware of this . I am still having a problem with the WBOM $108,000 as you are aware . This would be the only outstanding PMA and whatever the problem is with our tools ( if any ) likely needs to be resolved . I appreciate your hard work on tracking down this $108,000 . The risk sheet is on my desk . Thanks , Bill
Important , CAISO computers down at 2 PM . Submit HE 17 and HE 18 before 2 PM . Thanks , Bill
Thanks Chris , This sounds good .
Virginia , I have a dispute for you and Mike regarding WAPA on June 2nd . Please come see me when you have a chance . Thanks , Bill
Just come by when you have a chance or give me a call and let me know when you will be free . Thanks , Bill
Kate could you check with the trader on this . I really don't care if it is in or out . Let's try to wrap it up before or after the meeting . Thanks , Bill
Nice Job ! Looks good !
Guys , Great job on the cong last night but the EPE reconciliation sheet was not done . Even if there are no variances , please complete the July EPE Reconciliation sheet going forward . Houston will assume that no one ran the CARP if the sheet has no entries . Thanks , Bill
Per our conversation , ECTRT should receive congestion revenue for HE 2 , HE 23 and HE 24 . All congestion revenue was across Path 15 . All revenue was at $248 . Volumes were as follows: Total volume was 96 mws at $248 , revenue should be $23808 . Please see me with any questions . Thanks Bill
This is the new CAISO calculation for ancillary service charges . Please look it over and let me know if you have any questions . Thanks , Bill

Group , Volume management needs us to create customer finals by 3AM each night in CAPS or FSP . The details are below . Please see me with feedback or questions . Thanks , Bill
Thanks , I just left her another .
Sara , Check this story out , this is from a guy on our floor . He's a summer intern...and this is his Tuesday morning story . Incidentally I was standing directly in front of the old women picking out some green onions for my omelet when all hell broke loose . I took about three steps back and wandered towards the kitchen in search of a fire extinguisher . Didn't find one , and like Scott ( the intern ) was a bit disappointed in my reactions...ah well . I don't usually send out a group email , but listen to this shit . So I am sitting at work this morning minding my own business when all hell breaks loose . It is about 630am , and most of the trading has subsided for the morning . I decide to grab the first ham and cheese omelet from the women that are serving our breakfast this morning because who knows how long the food will last...today is a special day because we get a fresh cooked breakfast from a propane grill as opposed to the green eggs and ham that we are used to because no one wants to get up at 3am and cook a fresh breakfast for Enron employees , they usually cook it the night before . So , everyone on the floor is very excited and pumped up about the possibility of grabbing a nice breakfast without having the fear that later in the afternoon your ass would wreak havoc on you for eating the nasty green eggs . So , I grab the first omelet and the crowd surges toward the two 70 year-old women at the grill . Everyone is smiling , deciding whether or not they want ham or maybe they will get crazy and add salsa or something . The next thing you know , straight out of a FOX tv show or "You've Gotta See This" episode...this old woman is engulfed in flames like the great fire of Chicago . The propane tanks heating the stove exploded and the flames are high and wide , raising up to ten feet in height . The place turns into a frenzy . Nobody can move , react , or anything . Everyone is frozen watching this old woman(picture happy Gilmore's grandma ) go up like an old Christmas tree . A few seconds before this high school chemistry experiment , I was sitting on the first row right in the middle and I was staring at my two liquid display computer terminals and glancing at the sports ticker on ESPN2 on the 50inch Liquid FlatScreen TV that is directly above my desk . The old woman that went into flames is directly in front of me , about a literal three feet away and I am directly facing the inferno along with a co-worker who is catching the blunt of the heat of the flames . I don't save the old woman like most of you might have thought , I can't do anything but shout obscenities and wonder who the hell is going to jump in there and save this poor lady . The old woman is yelling , "Somebody get me outta here!"...yet we all continue to stare.....finally , someone grabs her arm and yanks her out of the blaze . Who is this masked man , I have no clue . However , I do witness Les from middle marketing doing his best Maurice Greene directly for the fire extinguisher of which he is the only one in the office that has a clue where it is . I see someone throwing a pitcher of egg yolk on the fire earlier , which is funny , if not for the fact that an old lady is missing half of her hair and her arms are about to blister up . The blaze is extinguished after taking a hell of a toll on the old woman , ruining the flat screen tv that used to sit above me , and torching a bunch of cabinets and the backs of computer screens . The alarm in our building 3 World Trade Center is screaming , and the smoke is enough to make even Polarek leave the area . So , the fire departemnt comes and the old woman is now out of the building and on her way to the hospital . Who knows what condition she is in , but all I know is I hope I am never around a bunch of vaginas(myself and the rest of us that did nothing ) when I go up in flames someday . Well , I have to get back to work because I have wasted about 20 minutes writing this drama . Take care , Scotty Pretty good story huh ? Different morning . Things are going well here in Portland other than the omelette fires . When do you get in to Seattle ? Take care and enjoy your last month in Colorado.. . Bill
Donna , This brings us back to the age-old question . During an emergency , how we can tell what the highest price paid for energy by California is ? Their market clearing price does not include all the spot market energy that they purchase . The CISO has acknowledged buying well over the artificially low federal price cap from in-state muni's ( LDWP , SMUD , etc. ) but none of this information is passed on in a timely fashion . And what qualifies one counterparty for a penalty , and another counterparty for a "do-over" ( could be assessed) ? We will continue our practice of notifying the CAISO as soon as possible regarding outages . Thank you for the information and the follow-up . Bill
Group , The baseball game will be on Thursday July 26th , NOT Monday July 16th . Gates open at 6:30 . Refreshments and pizza will be provided . Everyone should plan to attend . Please let me know if you cannot . Thanks , Bill
Sounds great .
Group , We are short 50 mws in ST-WBOM at $42.88 for HE 7-22 Friday and Saturday in SP-15 . I have picked up some shaped mws from the APX for the afternoon peak on Friday . These pieces will need to be scheduled with the APX as the counterparty for HE 12-20 . Price is $35 . ST-CALI is also 25 mws short both days on-peak . Thanks , Bill
We have also bought HE 10 and HE 11 from the APX . We bought 35 mws for HE 10 at $35 , and 31 mws for HE 11 at $35 .
One more time . We have also bought HE 21 and HE 22 from the APX . We bought 20 mws at $32 for HE 21 and 23 mws at $30 for HE 22 . No more messages .
I apologize for the "glaring" .
The CAISO has a new website . The link below should take you there . Workspace can be accessed by clicking SCW . Congestion can be found under the Transmission tab on the far right . Please take some time to become familiar with the new site .
Kristie , Hello . How are you ? What are you doing these days ? I hope you are doing well . It has been a while to say the least , but the other day Brendan and I were talking about college and your name came up ( oddly enough) . I mentioned that I hadn't talked to you for over two years , and was curious what you were up to . Brendan said he might have your old email address , so I asked for it and figured I would drop you a note . I hope you don't mind . Anyway I am still living in Portland but I am no longer practicing metallurgical engineering . I began trading power about a year and a half ago for Enron . I now manage the west hourly power trading group . The job is great , very challenging and everchanging , though I don't believe my company is too popular down your way right now ( you are in San Francisco , right?).. . My job consumes my time , but I am still playing soccer and still riding that same loud red motorcycle around when I have a chance . I just bought my first home , its a condominium downtown next to the Portland Art Museum . The place is definitely small but has a lot of character . It was an old hotel , originally built in 1926 , that has just been gutted and refurbished . It is about eight blocks from my office at the World Trade Center , so walking to work in the mornings is great . The city is still asleep and eerily quiet in the morning twilight when I walk to work . The walk helps wake me up and gets me prepared for the morning rush on the trading floor . So , if you have a chance drop me a line and let me know how you are . This email address of mine works ( though everything on it is subject to subpoena by the good state of California) , or you can give me a call at 503-887-3449 . I'd love to hear from you and catch up a bit , as I often wonder what you are up to . Take care . Bill
Kate , This is the last message from the total transfer capabilities folks . I would like you to find this information and distill the relevant information from it . We can go through what constitutes relevant information this afternoon . I am working on adding you to the market status list , this will provide you with market information regarding real-time derates or market orders . Finally , I would recommend printing the CAISO tariff off and reading it over the weekend or next few weeks . Boring , but important .
Green Room , Granted , I missed the last game and though I may not deserve to present an opinion given my lengthy stay on the reserve list , I also favor the move to D1 . I think better competition will be more fun , provided that we field a full team ( speaking mostly at myself here ) on a consistent basis . I have started playing again and am hoping to be back for the Fall season , I also know another player-Nate Stanton ( he has played with a few of us in indoor)-who is interested in playing and is a bit quicker and better than myself . So for what it's worth . D1 all the way . Thanks .
Group , A quick note regarding Pace transmission reservations on their oasis sites . We have recently paid PACE $57,000 for transmission in May that we reserved but did not flow . PACE says that their transmission is on a take or pay basis . My contention is that we may have reserved the transmission , but then attempted to remove it immediately ( wrong hour , wrong mw value on the submission etc. ) and were unable to , or were told by the dispatcher that the dispatcher would take care of it . Then nothing happens . There are two things we need to do to prevent this . One: Submit our transactions correctly the first time . Then withdraw them immediately through the Pacificorp Oasis system if there is a problem . Two: Send me an email each time the dispatchers remove requests on our behalf , or if We/PAC are/is unable to take the request out of their computer system . Hopefully , this will prevent the extra charges , or give us a means to pull tapes and contest the charges . Thanks for your help in limiting these egregious expenses Bill
I am working on getting Nate's email . I will try to get him to show up at indoor on Monday .
Group , I will be out of the office visiting CDWR , SMUD and NCPA on Monday through Wednesday . I should be back Wednesday afternoon . You can reach me on my cell phone if you need . Thanks , Bill
Group , We are long on Sunday . 15 mws for HE 12-20 at NP15 in PGE3 at $25 . I made the deals as DA schedules in CAPS . I have made the purchase from the APX and the sale to imbalance ( #685979 , #685978) . We are long on Monday . Shaped schedule . Price of $35 . I have made the purchase from APX and the sale to the imbalance in Enpower ( #685980,685981) . Schedules are in CAPS under ST-WBOM . Templates have been submitted Day ahead . Please make real-time purchases from the Calimbalance and corresponding sales under ST-WBOM in Enpower during real time . Please call me with questions . 503-887-3449 Thanks , Bill
Kate , Good morning , hope you had a good weekend . I have run the SAR for Friday's West-BOM piece . The SAR and INC sheet are matching if the 42 mw purchase from the imbalance at $44 is factored in--Remember , we were cut for HE 10 when Palo Verde 2 went down , this is a RT cut and is not in CAPS . Please make sure that the $44 is accounted for under ST-WBOM in the Volume Management flash . You may want to walk over and "remind" them of this . I am running the SAR for Saturday through Monday . Hopefully everything will work . If you need anything over the next few days , give me a call on my cell . John Anderson will be in at 8 . Could you also look into getting him set up with his access to our systems . Thanks , Bill
Kate , We are missing an ID-S from ST-WBOM to ST-CALI for Saturday . We sold 50 mws to ST-CALI at $42.89 . This should be the same as Friday's deal #683947 . We either need a new deal for Saturday or need to make Friday's on-peak deal carry over into Saturday . If you are changing the Friday deal you need to do it before the flash , otherwise if you make a new deal for Saturday you should have some time . Thanks for the help . Bill
Group , Please continue our policy of NOT buying energy from or selling energy to the California Imbalance . I do not feel comfortable with the many risks associated with these transactions at this time ( financial , physical , legal , political) . Please see me on an individual basis with questions or discussion regarding this . Thanks , Bill
Virginia , I spoke with Mike Swerzbin and Mike Driscoll this morning regarding an annuity from ST-Whourly to LT-NW to compensate LT-NW for energy at Montana that was not sold on June 4th . ST-Whourly will pay LT-NW our average hourly price per mw for that energy . That price is $23 per mw . Please revise the annuity as appropriate . If you have any questions , please come see myself or Mike . Thank you , Bill
I am available at any point this morning , including now .
Group , We will be taking over the dispatch of Enron Canada Corp.'s Sundance 3 and 4 units for the evenings of July 19-July 22 ( beginning at 18:00 PDT and ending at 6:00 PDT every day , except July 20 , where the start time will be 15:00 PDT) . Here is a note of things to remember: ?  SD3 will be coming down for maintenance July 20 at approximately 20:00 PDT . The plant will call with updates periodically . Please record this information in the dispatch log . This can be accessed through the 'Albertapower' site . Scroll down from Fundamentals to Admin , and at the bottom of the page is the dispatch log . The fundamentals site can be found at ?  SD4 has all of its power offered into the Pool at $5 . That's 353MW @ $5 . Therefore you shouldn't have to worry about dispatching the plant up and down . ?  ECC's telephone line ( 403-974-6900 ) has been forwarded to your line for the required hours . You will receive phone calls from the power pool or the plant on this line . ?  The number for the plant is 780-960-7803 and the number for the power pool is 403-233-7403 . You will have to access the power pool ETS website in case an energy restatement of our Sundance units is needed . This most likely won't happen . In case it does , the site is www.powerpool.ab.ca . [You must Login ( top right hand corner ) as John A . Zufferli-this MUST be done on my computer . Click on ETS , then Submission.] - our passwords are not currently working...so.. . you can call the Alberta powerpool for help . You can then restate the offers of SD3 and SD4 as required . Unless something changes you will need to fax the resubmission to Alberta Power Pool and have them resubmit it . ?  If you have any problems you can reach Bill Greenizan at 620-1180 or his pager at billgreenizan@epagenet.net . PLEASE CALL ME WITH QUESTIONS ! Thanks , Bill
Amy , I added a sentence describing the potential for this position to be temporary . Please see me with any questions . Thanks , Bill
Kate , I will not have time today . Perhaps it can wait till tomorrow . Thanks , Bill
Just a quick heads up for the flash . Path 26 was derated last night for HE 19 through HE 24 . For HE 24 the price for congestion revenue was $247.98 . We were awarded 218 mws of congestion relief by the CAISO . This should equal $54059.64 in congestion revenue to ECTRT . If you have any questions , please let me know . Thanks , Bill
I don't know , where you planning on going ? If you are , I may not . It depends what is on the agenda .
Traci , I manage the short term west hourly trading desk in Portland . Do you need me to come to Houston , or is there a more convenient way to convey my feedback ? I also need a performance feedback form . You can reach me at 503-464-3730 Thanks , Bill
Greg , I wanted to check with you quickly regarding taking a month-long position in August . I would like to buy a piece of NP , sell a piece of SP , and sell PV . I believe that value exists in taking these positions into the real-time market throughout August . NP and SP are currently trading near flat . I think the potential for real-time congestion revenue(RT has seen approximately $250,000 so far this month ) across constrained paths in California makes this a low risk way to generate value in a low liquidity market . I have discussed a month long short at PV with Tom Alonso . While I recognize the rest of the desk has a position , I think RT can generate good value liquidating in the shoulder hours beyond what could be generated by just filling dailies because of the current price levels . This also represents a relatively low risk trade ( under $10 downside) . I also would like to use these positions as a basis in hourly EOL trading as well . If you have concerns or questions please let me know , otherwise I will put these positions on over the next week . Thanks , Bill
If this works for you , please copy and paste it into your own email and send it on . Thanks- Group , We are lending from El Paso Electric on Monday . We have sold 15 mws for HE 7-22 to ST-SW at $62.50 . We are paying El Paso $4 for the service to lend from their system . The sell to ST-SW is under the ST-WBOM book ( #696314) , the purchase from EPE is also under the WBOM book ( deal #696315-note the price will be changed to $4 on Monday from $56) . Please buy energy to cover this 15 mw short on Monday under the ST-WBOM book and sell to EPE at $0 under the ST-WBOM book . The deal is physically prescheduled going out from EPE . We need to schedule the 15 mw going to EPE . Please do NOT buy from EPE in the morning even though they may be fat . We are hoping to do more lending with EPE going forward and therefore need to make this as easy as possible for their dispatchers ( do not bring up lending to them-it will lead to unnecessary confusion) . If you have any questions concerning this procedure please call me . 503-887-3449 ( c ) or 503-274-0502 ( h) . Thanks , Bill
Will do . Thanks
After a year in RT...yeah , you could do it.. .
Tim , Per our conversation on Friday regarding the WBOM book , I will limit spreads to 50 with a net of 25 open . If you have any questions or have further feedback , just let me know . Thanks , Bill
Kate , We need to move you more towards a trading support role and less of a settlements role . Please take some time over the weekend to consider what might be helpful for the desk ( ie . collecting pertinent weather information , transmission derates , day-ahead prices , congestion , historical spreads , etc. ) and let me know on Monday or Tuesday what we can do . Take your time but have a good weekend . Bill
Apparently not . The EPE preschedule sheet had a 25 mw lending position in.. . We'll have to work with the preschedulers to get it squared away .
Kate , EPE will be lending us a schedule for Tuesday , 25 mws at $4 at PV . The schedule will be on peak . Similar to today . Please work with the preschedulers to get the sheet correct ( Friday's sheet for Monday had a duplicate 10 mw schedule in it) . Let me know if you have questions . Thanks , Bill
Cara , We are short 14 mws at the Portland General System in position manager for Friday , July 20th . HE 5 and HE 6 . Pacificorp deal #694155 is not in for those hours . Could you look into this ? Thanks , Bill
Great . Thanks ,
Group , I have attached the following cut procedures that should be of benefit as we move into fire season . The sheet is very basic but spells out my expectations for handling a cut . The most important thing to remember is to document everything and call with questions . Thanks , Bill
Sounds good .
Kate , I think we need to enter the buy from EPE flat to our day ahead sale to STSW . Otherwise the new deal sheet shows revenue that we did no receive .
Heather , On the new deal summary for 07/23/01 , I changed the El Paso Electric deal #697528 price from $4 to $68 . I should not receive the $25524.54 as revenue shown in the new deal summary . Is there any way to recalculate this ( or simply zero it out ) prior to the morning flash ? Let me know what I can do to help . Thanks , Bill
Group , We are short 50 mws for tomorrow at PV through lending with EPE . 25 mws will be under ST-SW , 25 mws will be under ST-WBOM . We are also short 65 mws for tomorrow at SP-15 . 25 mws will be under ST-WBOM , 40 mws will be under ST-CALI . Both schedules are HE 7-22 . All deals should be under appropriate books . Please take extra time with the EPE lending . We would like to do this size throughout August and want to make sure they have no problems . Details regarding prices and deal numbers will be coming from Kate . Thanks , Bill
Are you kidding me ? This is absurd .
Group , We have purchased 50 mws from LV Cogen for HE 8 , HE 9 and HE 10 at $35 . We will need to buy transmission from NEVP from Nevada system to Mead 230 and then into the CAISO for HE 8 thru HE 10 . This energy can go towards the ST-CALI and ST-WBOM short in SP-15 . I will do enpower for these deals when I arrive in the morning . Remember to give NEVP 2 hours of notice-maybe even 2 and a half...Please call me with any questions . Thanks , Bill
Gentlemen , After discussion with Roger , the Four Corners Units 4 and 5 are NOT take or pay . This means that rather than selling from these units below the Lambda ( unit cost is approximately $13) , we should ramp them down . They should still be the last units down ( Copper off , then the steamer , then FC's) . Because of restrictions on the units you may not be able to ramp the units all the way down all the time . Also , be sure to work closely with the dispatchers to ramp the units back up in a timely fashion . I apologize for misinformation on my part regarding these units . If you have questions please see me , otherwise...spread the word . Thanks , Bill
Steve , Great email ! Arbitrary and capricious indeed . More like ridiculous .
Last time I checked , no one could tell the difference .
Group , I received a call from Warren McReynold at the BPA today . Warren was concerned with the level of service that our group is providing . Warren explained to me the necessity and importance of calling in and reporting the actual amount of energy generated by Grays Harbor and Frontier EVERY hour . The group at BPA cannot close their accounting books and meet reliability performance measures without our information . I am meeting with Warren on Tuesday . Warren is inclined to recommend to BPA that we are incapable of this service because of our inconsistent performance . Such a recommendation would severely limit Enron's ability to produce value for our service customers in the near term and would likely prevent us from attracting new customers . I believe that we can provide Warren's group with the information that it needs with minimal impact to our trading . Therefore: We must call Grays Harbor and Frontier at the top of EVERY hour . Then we need to call BPA and communicate the ACTUAL energy generated , not an estimate . Finally , sign off the hour in the services book . Les has provided us with the needed information for each day . Reserves can only be used for the hour that we are in , than we must resupply the schedule from a different source by working with the BPA marketers . If you have a question regarding reserves or pulling a schedule--please call Les or me . If this process takes more than 5 minutes , please let me know . It is each trader's responsibilty to make this work . It should be noted that we need to do this even if the generator is prescheduled , and must to continue to do this until these generators are automatically metered . And yes , we will be compensated by the Services desk for our work . This service is a priority and should be treated as such . Please see me with your comments and concerns regarding this job function . Thanks , Bill
Easy there Gentleman
Dave , Sorry it has taken so long to get back to you . First , regarding handsets . Each real-time desk needs 2 handsets . Kate Symes needs another handset under her desk as well . Also , I need to have my extension displayed on Kate Symes turret , and on each RT turret as well . Also on Stewart Rosman's , Greg Wolf's , Les Rawson's and Chris Foster's . I also need Kate Symes extension displayed on my turret ( this is an immediate concern beyond the handsets) . Her TRID is #106 ext . 3939 , my TRID is #140 ext . 3730 . I will address our treatment of handsets with the group . Feel free to grab me this afternoon before 4PM for a meeting if you still have time . Thanks for the help . Bill
I think you know .
Group , I have discussed our lack of handsets with Dave Steiner . Dave perceives an appetite for handsets in the real-time group , however , we should be getting new handsets ( two for each turret ) early next week . These handsets will be labeled Real-Time , this should prevent others from switching out our handsets . If one of these handsets stops working ( cuts out or mute doesn't work ) please let me know . Dave Steiner will be providing these handsets without charging us , but if a heightened handset consumption continues , we will have to pay for them . Dave suggested that we make sure to hang up the handsets , as they tend to get damaged quickly on the ground ( apparently it stresses the connections and leads to them cutting out) . I feel this goes without saying but maybe.. . Thanks for your help with this . Bill
That sounds good to me . I appreciate your help . Bill
Thank you Kate .
I would like to get this process going as quickly as possible . Interviews on Thursday ? Thanks , Bill
We can meet . Who else do we need ? Anyone ?
Sweet . Just grab me after lunch sometime I spose...if that works for you .
These look good from my end . Thank you for the update . Bill
Group , STWBOM is short tomorrow ( 07/31/01 ) on Peak in SP-15 . We are short 25 mws at $51.74 . STCALI is short 4 mws(? ) on peak in SP-15 at $51.74 . ST-CALI is long 24 mws off peak at a price of $25 . If you have questions , just let me know . Thanks , Bill
Leslie , This looks good to me . Thanks for the update . Bill
Group , A quick reminder . The cell phones are for group member to group member usage . As such , calling between group members , and our 1-800-684-1336 number is free . We have 200 minutes each for use in calling other members of the West Desk on work related matters . Over the past two months we have greatly exceeded our allowable minutes per month . Some members of the group have exceeded their allotment by over 200 minutes per month ! Group member to group member usage is approximately 45-90 minutes per month-and this is not calculated in the minutes used . If you want to use this phone as your only phone , let me know , and we will work out a calling and billing plan for you . Thank you ,
Group , We will have a real-time meeting on Tuesday August 7th at 4:30PM . The meeting will run till 5:30 . We will go over Hourly EOL implementation , Cuts ( yet again) , new group members , and market changes . Our baseball trip to the suite is Thursday August 16th . Food and beverages will be provided . Finally , reviews are coming . Thanks , Bill
Very GOOD !
Kate , I would be glad to look at anything you had.. .
When Colstrip goes down we will be short at Montana system and long at PGE System . We need to buy a transmission wheel from BPA ( Account#736780 ) from PGE System to the Montana System Border . If need be we can also do a Buy-Resale with WWP to move the energy from PGE Sys/Mid-C/LOLO to the Montana System Border . The method for documentation and cleaning up enpower are below . 1. ) In enpower , build an index forward buy from PGE under LTNW book for the total amount of mws cut due to colstrip going down . Use the DOW JONES MIDC index ( remember to specify in the index if it is on or off-peak) . Enter an offset of . 10 .  2. ) Enter a transmission deal from BPA . ( MIDC to MPC SYS ) The transmission fee is $2.52 3. ) Go into deal scheduling and query under the counterparty PGE . Select all 4. ) Bring up all deals of the counterparties involved at Colstrip---- specifically , Ashgrove,Conocpil , Energywesr , Louisiana Pacific , and Smurfit Stone , etc . ( these enpower deal numbers can be located under the counterparties name in lotus notes. ) 5.)Zero out the buy from PGE @MPC SYS 6. ) Finally link the deals . 7. ) Check real time postion manager , make sure you are flat . If you have questions regarding this procedure please let me know . Thanks , Bill
Here is your interview schedule for tomorrow . Geir Solberg , Mt . Rainier Conference Room - August 2 , 2001 12:00pm-12:45pm - Tom Alonso 12:45pm-1:30pm - Greg Wolfe 1:30pm-2:15pm - Matt Motley
After yesterdays cuts there have been some changes in the Colstrip Cut Procedures .
The new column on the services sheet regards energy that we may need to market but that is not prescheduled , usually in the off peak hours...Call with any questions . Home number is 503-274-0502 Thanks , Bill
Group , When doing imports and exports at tie points for other desks , be sure to put the other desk as the Customer in CAPS . This prevents inappopriate charges going against the real-time book . Import and Export fees are typically in the nature of $5 per mm on a wheel . Thanks , Bill

Chuckle , chuckle .
Elliot , I have attached the standard PEP review form . The last three categories regarding goal setting and objectives to be acheived still need to be completed . Feel free to add in any comments you might have in other sections as well . I will plan on meeting with Jesse and you early next week . If you have any questions just let me know . Thanks , Bill
Group , We will be performing a new service for EES . On Monday , August 6th the ST-CALI desk will have submitted ancillary service bids to the CAISO for EES load . LADWP will be providing the capacity ( SPIN) , we will be dispatched over the ADS system , and then need to call the amount into LADWP . We need to keep track of the amount exercised . We should do this in the Service Sheet and then record the amount dispatched on the sheet to EES on Tuesday morning as well . The tags are in the front of the services book for Monday .

Kate , Here is some new info , and some updated info for our packet . Let me know if you have questions .
Group , Please join me in a meeting Tuesday at 4:30 in Mt . Hood . We will be discussing strategy and group direction ! Pizza will also be in attendance . Thanks ,
FYI CAISO returns to Primary server .
I am not involved with communications.. . Thanks , Bill
Spin was exercised for HE 9 and HE 10 at 08:35 and 09:35 respectively .
Yeah , I am taking a look at it . How are the interviews coming ? If you want to meet me for lunch , we can grab some pens and go over the thing . I am going to need information from you , and find out what you want to show . Anything good going on this week ?
Dave , I would like to restrict access to this directory . It is P:\RealTime\ I would like only the members of the real-time group to have access . That is.. . Ryan Slinger Leaf Harasin Mark Guzman David Porter Bert Meyers Eric Linder Steve Merriss Craig Dean Kate Symes Todd Bland Casey Anderson Darrin Presto Mike Meier(sp? ) as well as.. . Greg Wolfe Mike Tully Please see me with questions . Thanks , Bill
Jim , I just wanted to bring to your attention the volume of congestion that we relieved last night . It looks like 28 mws at $198 and 75 mws at $223.00 . This should be at total revenue of $22,269.00 . Please see me with any questions . Thanks , Bill
Thanks !
Accused ? Easy there . RT is clean . Just like you said...all with the tags and the up and up !
Neil , The revenue for the sale that Phil entered to the CAISO will be captured by our volume management group . RT will have no access to this revenue . Consequently , we will not buy or sell it on your behalf to capture it . Please give me a call tomorrow for a more thorough explanation . Thanks , Bill
Jim , We have congestion revenue again for 08_07 . We moved 272 mws at $194 . Total revenue should be $52768 . Thanks , Bill
Murray , We tally up our exposure each day based on the California flash . Our monthly exposure can be found at P:\RealTime\Exposure\August Exposure . We are keeping a very close eye on it . Thanks ,
Guys , You can find out the information you need on the website . The website is www.wscc.com , click on certification and training , scroll down to the Schedulers Course manual . Print off the schedulers course manual and study it . You will be tested on the material , a pre-test and a post-test . ( note:you will need to access the site in Explorer to get the manuals) . You can call telephone# 801-582-0353 to get information on the scheduler's course ( this is the main-line to WSCC so you will have to ask around a bit) . Please arrange for those on night shift to get in about 15-25 minutes early so you can leave at 5:10 on the 13th . Thanks , Bill
WAY TO GO BIG!! ! Good job...nice accomplishment . Much props !
Lisa , Please do not charge EPE the $0.25 scheduling fee on EPE lending or parking with us or ST-SW . Questions ? Just ask . Thanks , Bill
Jessica , Please remove me from this list . I am not involved with the management of anyone in this pool . Thanks , Bill Williams III
Bert , When buying from any desk on the floor , you should have a sale from that desk ( say ST-CALI ) to either WHourly or WBOM , then do enpower as normal . The interdesk sale will not pull up in scheduling and you will have to route the sale in Enpower to the physical buy by the other desk ( another words...ST-CALI buys from imbalance , sells to WHourly/WBOM , then WHourly/WBOM sells to EPMICALPOOL , then WHourly/WBOM sells to EPE . Please let me know if you have questions . Bill
Jim , We recieved congestion relief revenue from the CAISO for Sunday and Monday , August 12th and 13th . Thanks , Bill
Kate , We are short 25 mws in SP15 at $43 for Tuesday . I am unsure if ST-CALI is doing anything . We are short 25 mws at PV at @$50 with ST-SW on EPE lending for Tuesday . Let me know if you have questions , and you may want to check prices with these desks . Thanks , Bill
Avista put in the 100 mw sale at $70 for HE 1 . BPA and CAISO accepted the schedule . I have changed enpower deal #727620 ( SCL ) to a zero for HE 1 , and enpower deal #727622 ( Avista ) to 250 mws from 150 mws for HE 1 . Good work on getting this schedule taken care of . Bill
Jim and Darren , We relieved Path 15 congestion for HE 7 on Saturday morning . We flowed 10 mws from Malin to FC345 . This resulted in the 10 mw "variance" in the report . I have added deals to Enpower to flatten the report , these deals are only necessary for the sake of the report . The identical variance in the north and south indicates a wheel or load shift . I prefer to not enter these extra deals . Please see me with questions if you do not understand why the report variance exists . Thanks , Bill
Journalism ? Pretty big Enron influence in this article from what I can tell.. . What are your thoughts ?
Group , Another update on the situation with California . Check out the letter . Good questions.. .
Guys , We are missing the congestion revenue from HE 7 on Saturday morning ( 10 mws at $99.00 ) in the flash we received yesterday . Remember , the awarded congestion wheel caused the 10 mw variance we discussed on Monday . Please see me with questions . Thanks , Bill
Monika , I have attached your review , for our conference call tomorrow morning at 10 AM Houston time . Talk to you then . Bill
A quick heads up . We relieved congestion this morning ( 08/16/01) . The hours and volumes are in the inc sheet . Thanks , Bill
Heather , Count me in , I'll buy a bike . 100% here I come .
ONE MORE TIME ! DO NOT SELL BELOW $15 FOR EL PASO WITHOUT RAMPING DOWN FOUR CORNERS ! READ THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE GENERATION DISPATCH . Do NOT let this happen again . See me or another experienced member of the group with questions or concerns .
Jack , Thank you for the call . Below are the names of the folks in our real-time group , they share the same phone and fax number . You can include me on this list as well . I appreciate your help with this .

There will be a 100 mw schedule delivered at COB to NCPA going on NCPA rights into NP-15 . Phil Platter will be scheduling the purchase from NCPA in CAPS and submitting an HA 24 schedule . BE sure to watch what is in your templates in the morning . The ST-NW desk will also be short day-ahead to PGE for Friday and Saturday . Diana will be sending an email . Please call me with questions . Thanks , Bill
Kate , We will be short 50 mws off-peak Sunday and Monday(that's all day Sunday and off-peak Monday ) at @$36-check with Kysa on price . 25 mws on peak Monday at @$45 in SP-15 ( check with Kysa ) 25 mws on peak Monday at @$50 at PV with EPE ( check with Holden ) 25 mws off peak at MidC on Monday ONLY at $32 with ST-NW ( we will sell to ST-NW--check with Diana S. ) Questions ? Let me know . Word .
Per our conversation on the phone . We are getting several requests from customers to allow them to "personalize" their quotes to only include hourly EOL products . We are currently trading physical firm power at NP-15 , SP-15 , PV , and Mid-C for hours ending 12-20 . A same day filter or hourly product filter would work nicely . Please let me know what you might need from me to get this accomplished as quickly as possible . Thanks , Bill Williams Short Term West Hourly Trading
The delivery points are as follows: And , Products will currently be available for HE 12 through HE 20 Pacific Prevailing Time ( PPT) , for Monday through Friday . I appreciate the hard work . Thanks , Bill Williams Short Term West Hourly Trading
Things have definitely been difficult over here . In truth , I may have underestimated how prepared our systems and the folks in our group were to move dramatically greater volumes . We are moving through a period of adjustment and should be back on track by tomorrow . So Kate probably is not any more stressed out than anyone else . She probably just shows it a bit more . We shouldn't be holding you guys back too much longer . My apologies for the delay . Bill
You are correct , The EOL trades were not properly acccounted for . I think we have it sorted out now though . But yeah , too much stress is never healthy...I don't know exactly what the deal is . Bill
Good morning . We are off in position manager at Mid Columbia because of Enron Canada . I notified Murray at Enron Canada at approximately 6:15 this morning . Position manager is also not working properly , it is reporting a variance at Pacificorp system border ?  and at Palo Verde . However the position manager shows no variance when detail is clicked . If you have questions , let me know . Thanks , Bill
Thanks for the email , I already worked this out with Kal . Bill
Group , A quick important reminder . Recently our disputes with EPE and other SW counterparties have been growing . While I recognize that we have some newer members in the group , it is the responsibility of the senior members of the group to train and help the newer members to avoid mistakes . The EPE system is not overly complex . If you have questions during a shift call ME first . Do not wake up Roger , do not go inadvertant . Our notes on the deal sheet need to include whether the power is firm or econ ( again--you should almost never buy econ--) . The EPE lending fee was recently renegotiated down to $2 . We have to be sharp in our marketing of their system to maintain our ability to lend and to lend at $2 . Disputes with counterparties will quickly erase this opportunity . Marketing for EPE , making appropriate choices with regards to the units , checking out with dispatchers on time , and reconciling the CARP are basic expectations for this position and MUST be met . If you have questions , please see me . We will discuss EPE and EOL in our meeting at the start of September . Thanks , Bill
Group , Beginning tomorrow , August 25th , we will be scheduling for California on Saturday and Sunday . Serena has put together a training manual outlining the process . The ST-CALI group will be on call to answer any questions or to help us handle cuts . This should be a simple integration into our Saturday and Sunday shifts . Please see me with questions , and be prepared with comments and/or concerns for our meeting the first week of September . Thanks , Bill
Sweet . Thanks for the call last night...Brad should be awesome . Where is it at ? Let me know how your "evening" with Rachel goes . Bill
Dave , Good morning . When you have a chance . We need to get a third turret in the mix at RT . We should use Kate's turret if necessary . Please see me with ideas and or a timeline for getting this installed . Thanks , Bill
Group , I have copied in a note from Roger at EPE . As you can see they are placing a VERY high importance on economic dispatch of the units . Please be aware that every move with regards to marketing and running their system is under EXTREME scrutiny . Please call me before you call our customer . Thanks , Bill Correction: The burner problem is on Newman 3 . ( Thank You ! Mr Ward ) The unit will be held at 85 MW's until repairs can be made . The plan is to assess the problem Monday morning and make the necessary repairs . If prices continue to be below cost we need to purchase power and back down local units . With Copper off , the dispatch shows we need to purchase power for 5 or 6 hours through super peak . Depending on load , GT 1 and GT 2 should be put in the hole ( around 7 to 10 MW's each ) HE 1:00 through HE 9:00.. . If Market conditions are less than $14.00 BACK DOWN Four Corners.. . As load picks up be sure to pick up Four Corners first ! If there is a reason we have to dump FC power please send me a note ! If there is any confusion over whether to back down FC CALL . Any questions or comments please call at 5808 or 915-204-1202.. . Roger
Guys , Good looking discussion note last night . I appreciate the good work . Thanks , Bill
Kate , How do I get David removed from schedule crawler ? Could you help me with this . Thanks , Bill
Kate , This looks good and is well written . Send away .
Sorry to hear about Racheal...so the Bretts weren't gay ? But what about Nancy.. . I haven't been to the Breakroom . I think I will be coming up to Seattle on either Friday afternoon or Saturday morning . I haven't decided yet . I am taking Friday off from work though...my birthday is on Thursday...isn't your birthday here in the tail end of August--or am I thinking of Chuck . Erica Price ? from the dorms , rowed crew , tall , red hair , sometimes slightly neurotic?..that would be kind of fun to run into her , anyway...I'll get back to you when I figure out what the heck is going on . Later . Bill
Regarding this .
What do you mean adjust our system according to MPC's numbers until you do ? Are we correct ? If the answer is yes . Tell MPC we are correct , we have checked out with our counterparties ( thereby verifying our incredible correctness) , but..because we love them so much...we will...this time only...take it in the proverbial shorts . Next time...it will of course...be there turn.. . Good luck and thanks for your help .
Group , EOL is off to a great start and is already becoming an integral part of the real-time market ! Each person who has put in substantial extra time entering and reconciling deals deserves congratulations . I do recognize and appreciate the hard work . As always , there is more work to be done . We have had significant difficulty integrating the increased volume of EOL trades into our current business practice . Some members of the group have experienced limited success , others have experienced little to no success . A standardization in our process will benefit the entire group and will allow us to make consistent improvements as time goes on . So going forward . 1 . All deals will be done under ST-Whourly . If there is lending , parking or a cut that corresponds to another book , we will make that deal for the entire strip ( for example , W-BOM sells to EPE for HE 7-22--all one deal) . We will then sell or buy the appropriate amount of energy from Whourly to that book ( this interdesk deal will not be routed) . We will do the interdesk transaction as one deal and will enter deal strips with pricing for each hour or hours where appropriate and will include transmission charges when necessary . In Enpower , use strips wherever possible...try to avoid extending deals in scheduling . 2 . All imports and exports will be under the appropriate desk ( for example ST-SW exporting from SP-15 to FC MUST be under ST-SW in CAPS) . This will allow us to put everything under Whourly and have export/import fees paid for by the appropriate desk . Otherwise the Whourly book will be charged for wheeling and/or potentially congestion for other desks . When filling a Service customer ( such as Wheelabrator or EES ) we should pay for the import and export fees . 3 . A "skeleton" of an inc sheet should be developed as soon as possible each day . Sales/purchases to or from EES should be made for the day and immediately input into the service sheet . Likewise...Service deals/Lending/Parking should be put into the sheet for the day where possible . I would like to implement all of these practices immediately . Effective HE 1 08/29/01 , THIS is our new business practice . Spread the word . I am looking for more suggestions for improvements on our process . We will have a meeting on September 4 to discuss group direction and ideas for improvement . This will be an important meeting at 4 PM on Tuesday September 4th . Please plan to attend . See me at any time with suggestions or comments . Thanks , Bill
How are you ? Hope you are doing well . I got your message last night about leaving the NW . Where are you going ? When do you take off ? Drop me a note if you have a chance . Take care . Bill
How about this ? Evelyn , Please try to send or copy any emails to me at Williams III , Bill . NOT Williams , Bill . This email went to Bill Williams with Enron who happen to be in Sweden.. . Kate Symes will be taking care of your spreadsheet when she has an opportunity . As you may be aware we have recently brought out EnronOnLine to the hourly market . We have seen a dramatic increase in volumes , and priorities have shifted as a result . Daily deadlines must be met . We are working on our deal entry accuracy . I appreciate your patience , we will attend to this issue shortly .
There are several annuities related to the profit sharing of this deal . First-- All deals should have been made under the ST-NW desk to route with the PGE deal-buy tranny-etc . ( I recognize this did not happen but this was my intent and should or could have) . Consequently all revenue from this deal originally went into the ST-NW book . Therefore . An annuity was made from ST-NW to ST-WHOURLY . Deal #531524--$23468 . Next an annuity was made from ST-Whourly to LT-NW at $5472 to compensate LT-NW for the $48 purchase price ( deal #531546) . This left a profit of $17996 to be divided between ST-Whourly and L-Pac-30/70 . Consequently , ST-Whourly made an annuity to L-Pac for their part of the profit share , Deal #531549--$12597.73 . All this left RT with a profit of $5399 . If you place all the deals under LT-NW...it will be a large impact on ST-NW , and will result in LT-NW getting paid a couple of times . These profit share numbers are accurate . After expenses--LT-NW gets $5472 for the original deal , then ST-WH gets $5399 and L-Pac gets $12597.73 . All these annuities cannot just be killed as they liquidated on the 26th--of February . It is probably a better idea to put everything back under the ST-NW booQuestions ? Just come see me and let me know .
Virginia , All deals were originally sourced under ST-NW . Revenue was moved from ST-NW to ST-Whourly for 70/30 split between LP and ST-Whourly . Annuity to ST-Whourly from ST-NW #531524--$23468.76 Annuity from ST-Whourly to LP #531549--$12597.73 Annuity from ST-Whourly to LT-NW #531546--$5472--this compensated for original deal sold to LP ( take or pay) . ST-Whourly kept the difference between #531524 and #'s 531549 , 531546 . All deals were originally sourced under ST-NW . If you have questions , just let me know . Thanks , Bill
Darren , Per our discussion , please allocate all Hour-Ahead Congestion charges or revenues to the ECTRT group . Hopefully this will simplify the management of our books . My understanding is that Chris will tell RT if there are cuts or some other need to put in Hour Ahead ( 24 ) schedules for the Cali desk and will allow us to allocate approriate charges or revenue to him if necessary . All Congestion charges/revenue at tie points should still be allocated to the desk entered in CAPS . If you have any questions please see me . RealTime will still try to notify you of Congestion revenue or charges . Thanks , Bill
I have attached the spread sheet I created back in February . There are comments explaining the formulas . If you have questions please just give me a call and I will try to clear them up . Thanks , Bill
Group , We are continuing to refine our deal entry techniques and spreadsheet techniques . We are having great success with EOL so far . For further clarification . 1 . ALL DEALS UNDER ST-WHOURLY--except a lending/parking deal or cut . For example if we are lending with ST-SW and we buy for them in NP-15 . The buy in NP-15 is under ST-WHOURLY , the EPMICALPOOL Buy/Resale from NP-15 to FC345 is under ST-WHOURLY , the INTER-DESK sale is made under ST-WHOURLY ( at the end of the day--see #3) , and the sale to EPE is under ST-SW . The export in CAPS is also under ST-SW . 2 . ONE DEAL FOR AN ON-PEAK or OFF-PEAK PURCHASE or SALE.--For example one deal for a sale to the imbalance , one deal for a sale to EPE 3 . ONE DEAL FOR AN INTER-DESK SALE or PURCHASE--done by the NIGHT SHIFT at the weighted average price for the entire strip , transmission costs should be included . We are just averaging the purchase price or sale price for specific deals . ( see ST-WBOM SP-15 section of AUG TRADING sheet on 08/29/01 for an example ) 4 . INC SHEETS MUST BE MAINTAINED , DEALS ENTERED AND ROUTED EACH HOUR--only way to stay ahead 5 . WE ARE GENERATING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE REVENUE AND PROFIT TRADING WITH EOL ( over $130,000 in the last 5 days alone--does not include congestion revenue!)--530+ trades , 13,100 extra mws traded with EOL in 8 days . Finally , I will be out of the office for Friday and will be in Seattle through Sunday . You should be able to reach me on my cell phone ( 503 ) 887-3449 . If you can not reach me , please refer questions regarding trading to Ryan Slinger , ( 503 ) 789-1306 . Thanks for the continued hard work and attention to detail , Bill
Guys , We are short for HE 21 through HE 23 at Malin . We are short at $40 . The sale is to Pacificorp Power Marketing . 20 mws of the 50 is going to SMUD and 30 mws of the 50 is going to CERS . You can reference tag#'s 31892 and 31889 . If you have any questions just give me a call on my cell phone . Thanks , Bill
Good email Kate . Nice work . Way to get after "it" !
Dave , Thanks for the update and I appreciate the work . I understand that moving turrets , and reconfiguring desks takes time . Just let me know what I can do to help on moving turrets , or changing the RT desk configuration . Thanks , Bill
Steve , Can we contact this Steve Johnson guy and tell him he is a pawn for the state of California.. . Funny...I don't remember a "near-meltdown" , just inept purchasing and load balancing by CERS at the start of August . CERS is consistently completely out of the market . EVERY DAY ! They can't even manage to bury their bad trades in 35,000 mws of load ! Humorous article though .
Crystal , Seattle was sweet this weekend . I went and saw Brad at the Breakroom...what did you think of Husky Stadium ? Woohoo ! Man , Thursday...whoa...and think , I went out after that...whoa...but it was my birthday...sorry for calling late . Are you doing anything cool this weekend ? Motorcycle dirt track races are on Saturday night at Portland Speedway.. . I am stoked . Plus the first Husky football game is this weekend in Seattle against Michigan ! How are other things going ? Hopefully well . Later , Bill
Group , Just a quick reminder . When we are notified by the CAISO Generation desk regarding a "waiver" for an Enron managed unit in California , we should notify the services desk if it is during the day , and should email the services desk ( and me ) if it is after normal work hours . If you have questions please just let me know . Thanks , Bill
Group , A quick reminder . After reviewing this weekend , we must begin adjust bidding for congestion at ALL tie points . We should be running wheels N-S and S-N across Path 15 , the COI and NOB . We have lost significant revenue by failing to adjust bid our transactions . It is still fire season , and unit outages are resulting in unscheduled flow problems that are forcing congestion at different tie points and in different directions . Please check available ATC's on the CAISO site , and spend the time to manage our congestion risk . If you have questions , please ask . We need everyone up to speed on this quickly . Thanks , Bill
Stewart , I will be in El Paso visting EPE on the 20th . But I am very interested in discussing such an opportunity with NW service customers . Do they HAVE to come on the morning of the 20th or 21st ? Could they come the morning of the 19th ? Let's get together and talk regardless . Nice job on NCPA , I appreciate the hard work . Thanks , Bill
Holly , I think you have the wrong Bill Williams . I am in Portland and am not involved with card access . Thanks , Bill
Dave , Any word from PGE regarding a phone for Kate ? Anything I can do to help ? Just let me know . Thanks , Bill
Amy , Could you please sign up Bert Meyers , Mark Guzman , and Kate Symes for the pilot program . Thanks , Bill
You may want to take a look at this .
Sophie , I think you have the wrong Bill Williams as I do not work in Houston or know Erin Copeland . Please remove me from your distribution list . Thanks , Bill
Group , A quick reminder . The night shift will average the sales price and make one strip for the on-peak piece.(so ST-WBOM will sell to ST-Whourly at x$ for HE7-22 then ST-Whourly does whatever it needs to do) . If you have questions just let me know . Thanks , Bill
David , I have made some revisions to the budget after spending some time with Amy Fitzpatrick in our HR department . Obviously this is a loose plan ( the headcount for the RT group changes frequently)...but it should prove a bit more accurate than nothing . If you have any questions please just let me know . You can call me here at work at 503-464-3730 or on my cell phone at 503-887-3449 . Thanks , Bill
Darin , I liked the services portion of the night discussion note that you wrote on the 13th , but you need more information on sales on behalf of EPE for both HE 6 and HE 7...you need to explain any sales to marketers or utilities . I also need you to only sell to a marketer as last resort . A marketer is usually just flipping EPE's energy and is taking your spread . If you have any questions , just let me know . Otherwise keep up the good work ! Thanks , Bill
Stewart , Just a quick heads up . SMUD used enron online today and sold ust a total of 125 mws . Thanks for the good work ! Bill
Group , We have developed a process for tiering our bids and should do so going forward . Please use appropriate dollar and mw values . Below is JUST an example . When tiering , the top numbers ( mw values ) must be monotonically increasing and the last two numbers on the bottom of your tier ( $ values ) must be the same . *NOTE* If a tiered bid is entered incorrectly you will have to flow a large amount of mws for loss or no gain.*NOTE* Please see me with any questions before implementing tiered bids . Thanks , Bill
Jill , I need information regarding our monthly cell phone costs . I would like to cap per employee costs at $50 per month on the group calling plan . Effective in October , I would like employees billed for any amount they have over $50 per month on their cell phone . If an employee needs more minutes I would like to structure a plan to allow them to purchase more minutes through us--with them paying the extra per month . Thanks , Bill
Jill , Could you also cancel my monthly PalmNet service . Thanks , Bill
Absolutely , Please send an email to the group explaining to them that they will be billed if they go over $55 a month . Let them know they can set up a different plan if they need ( I would prefer they stick with the group calling plan and add minutes...but the choice is theirs) . Let's put this in effect by October . I am seeing $20000 ytd as of June in cell phone charges ( and $55 x 13 group members x 6 months should equal $4290--have we really spent $16000 on new phones ? Thanks , Bill
Jill , I was being sarcastic about the $16000 . Could you send an email to each group member giving them their average usage since you started or the last 3 months ( AT&T should have this info) . If you could send me an email breaking out the costs that would be great as well . I am not that concerned with the new phones--but would like to know what was spent . I appreciate the help . Thanks , Bill
Jill , Ryan Slinger previously had a plan set up . It looks like our AT&T rep switched him back to the group calling plan . Please check with Ryan and he will let you know what he needs . Thanks , Bill
Group , Please remember to put the Tag # in the inc sheet . Every schedule should now be tagged if it is outside of the CAISO . Please get the tag # from our counterparties to put in the inc sheet . This should greatly improve our settlements process and minimize disputes . Include a comment in the Tag # section if there is no tag . Thanks , Bill
Cindy , Please remove my name from whatever list you might have . I work in Portland and am not involved with security clearance or security access . Thanks , Bill
Dave , I have attached a revised budget forecast for 2002 . The 2002 headcount ( column D ) is now correct at the top of the budget . I do not have a number from David Steiner yet regarding technology costs ( row 107 ) but I am expecting it soon . Everything else is pretty much as you and I discussed earlier today . Please call me with any questions . Thank you for the help . Bill
Cindy , Please...remove me from your list . I am not involved with security , in Houston or otherwise , and can not help you obtain a security badge . Bill
ate , You should recieve an email from Sean Crandall detailing a short position for tomorrow ( Saturday ) and for Monday . Please give this information to the group including Enpower information...etc . Call me if you have any questions . Thanks , Bill
Group , Please take a look at the following attachment . It details how we will be entering our Enpower and CAPS 99% of the time . If you have any questions , just let me know . Thanks , Bill
And here is the attachment Bill
Group , There is a new schedule out for October . Please take a look at it . If you need to switch days , feel free . Please send Bert and I an email notifying us of the changes and be sure to write your changes on the schedule . Schedule changes need to be communicated for obvious reasons . Thanks , Bill
What do you guys think ?
Group , When tiering adjustment bids , the CAISO system will not read more than 10 bids . Also , remember to have the tier monotically increasing . Thanks , Bill
Here is the original email from Keoni , and the follow-up from Chris Foster . Just give me a call with any questions . Thanks , Bill
Group , We will be covering for Enron Canada Corp as stated below . All submissions will have to be faxed to the Power Pool as we do not have a working digital certificate . Call me with any questions . Thanks , Bill

Of course you were . Don't feel bad though , we all get confused at times . Some of us just more than others .
This is relatively irrelavent but thought you might enjoy it...of course...it is made up...just like everything else forwarded on the internet none of these people actually exist.. .
Darren , Just let me know when you have time and we will set it up .
Paul , Thanks for the invitation but I will not be able to attend on Friday . Bill
Yes...sorry about implying that you did not have approval.. .
Group , Here is some more inforation regarding taking care of Canada this weekend . Bill

NO!!! ! You must live with gross tooth decay and bleeding gums . Yellow teeth and excessive plaque build-up are expected in Real-Time.. .
Yes...that is correct .
Chip , Could you send me a list of Turret ID's for the guys in the real-time group . I would like to lead a push to have everyone in the group update their turret and customize it for their own use . Thanks , Bill
Michael , I think you intended to send this to Bill Williams in Technical Assets . Please note the difference in addresses and make the change . Thanks , Bill
I don't know.. .
Bob , We would have the following hourly physical products out until 6 PM CST ( 4 PST ) on Friday--HE 17 through HE 20 Palo Verde; HE 17 through HE 20 MID-C; HE 19 through HE 20 SP15; HE 19 through HE 20 NP15 . We can then suspend or inactivate these products at 6 PM . All other physical products will have already been suspended or inactivated before 6 PM CST ( HE 12 through HE 17 etc.) . If you have any questions , please let me know . Thank you for the help . Bill
Jeff , I will be glad to discuss this with you in the future . However , I am on my way out the door to Pullman , WA for a recruiting trip . I will be back late on Friday afternoon or we can talk on Monday . Give me a call on my cell and let me know what you would like to do . Bill

ALLEGHENY ENERGY SUPPLY Scheduling Coordinator ID-- *****New ID is APX5******
Paul could likely do this , it does require a ton of hard work and is a difficult job .
Group , Effective October 1st...BPA transmission will be the following prices.. . BPA non-firm point to point ( or network ) will be $2.92 with 1.9% losses BPA non-firm on the intertie will be $3.34 with 3% losses Losses could be expected to add up to $5 of the total price--do not put losses into the purchase from BPA Transmission in Enpower--losses for BPA will be settled at the end of the month in a single annuity . Total price for MPC to CAISO at MALIN on BPA non-firm all the way will be $6.26 Total price for MPC to CAISO at NOB on BPA NON-FIRM all the way will be $6.26--Remember to check tranny sheet for PGE-tranny availability--WE HAVE NO MORE LT FIRM FROM BIG EDDY TO NOB-- SNOPud is charging $3.25 for point to point plus 1.9% losses . Bill
Bert , I put all the names in a hat...and you are the man...please revise the schedule and redistribute it with yourself attending the trip.. . Enjoy !
I will only be in Albuquerque for like 4 hours Monday morning...so it doesn't look like I will have to much of a chance to meet up with you . Maybe an early afternoon brew.. . Emily Willis--huh--didn't you and her...oh yeah...I remember the flat tire .
That's right , I forgot about QOTSA . Did you enjoy that CD ? Your dad is coming in today to see the trading floor and then we are going to grab some lunch and talk about what we do here at the big E . I fly out at 4 on Friday afternoon.. . I guess Nikki is coming to Portland at the end of October...oh-oh .
Todd , From an information standpoint this looks good . I would recommend using an appendix for the WSCC members , the FERC ruling , the NERC glossary and any other lengthy terms or charts . You might look to organize the paper from a broad overview of the electrical market in the west ( including basic descriptions , timelines , fundamentals , etc. ) down to a specific description of what you did at Enron . The content of the paper looks good and I am comfortable with you submitting what you have . If you need any thing else regarding your paper just let me know . Thanks , Bill
What ? Is receiving an email at 1:30 too late ? Just because everything is done by 10...At least NW is on the right side of the market...oh wait...their not...doh ! And looks like today was a bad day to go short...but who's counting ?
I will be out of the office visiting El Paso Electric and PNM through Friday evening . Please see Ryan with any questions regarding trading . I can be reached on my cell phone at 503-887-3449 . Thanks , Bill
Thank you Kate , Nice work . Bill
Chip have you had a chance to work with Greg Ford on ADS ? Any ideas on the new ADS phase II ? Thanks , Bill
Darren , Could you meet with me regarding congestion revenue for 10/05 ? We had two wheels that were not in the inc sheet but were awarded by the CAISO and are in finals in CAPS . The wheels were EPMI_CISO_GREEN for HE 17 and HE 18 . We were awarded 38.96 mws for HE 17 and 31.92 mws for HE 18 . Both wheels were awarded at $54.90 . We should receive revenue of $3891.31 from these wheels . Please give me a shout with questions . Thanks , Bill
Thanks Kysa . Nice work .
John , Thank you for the letter and for the resume . I will be putting them in front of Julie Kearney in our HR department and will be getting the process started . I am still waiting to see exactly what the needs for my group will be , but should have a better idea in a few days . I will be in touch . Bill
Catherine , I believe this was meant for Bill Williams in Technical Assets . Please note the difference in email addresses . Thanks , Bill
No problem .
Actually , I think the Honda is probably the one . Much cooler...and good Honda reliability . Looks good in Silver or Red . Bill
The CBR 945 RR is a bit sweeter , cheaper , better looking and has Honda reliability.. . Oooohhh . Nice . Bill
Great to hear from you . I got a call from Scotty this weekend but have not had a chance to give him a call back yet . Enron selling PGE has had no real effect on me . It should be good for our stock price though . One can hope anyway . Glad to hear you guys are doing well . Let me know when you guys are coming down...you can definitely stay at my place--its not big but I will have a futon for a bit longer . You may prefer the Paramount hotel--its right next door . And my liver will likely always be in shape . Take care .
Sandra , Please update your email list to read Bill Williams and not Bill Williams III . Thank you ,
Thank you for the email . Bill
Here are the details on our sale to CERS for HE 14 at Palo Verde devers . I spoke with Linus at CERS at approximately 11:50--At that time I sold him 90 mws at $29 delivered at PV for HE 14 , I told him the energy was coming from the CAISO . I then called Mike at SRP marketing after speaking with Linus . For HE 13 I had sold Mike 75 mws . I told him the schedule would be going to a zero for HE 14 . I called the CAISO to notify them my export EPMI_CISO_SALSA would be going to CERS at PV devers and not SRP . I began speaking with Bhavin at the Palo Verde desk at 12:20 regarding scheduling of the energy to CERS at PV devers . I told Bhavin the export -EPMI_CISO_SALSA- would be going to CERS and that it was effectively a net schedule(90 mws out at PV devers/90 mws in at PV devers).Bhavin asked that I call a counterparty with a control area interest at PV and show the schedule going to and coming from a control area . I acknowledged this request and called El Paso Electric to attempt to show the schedule to them and from them . I was not comfortable with this step as I viewed it as unnecessary and told EPE I would call them back . I then called SRP transmission to discuss the schedule with them . At approximately 12:40 I discussed the 90 mw net schedule with SRP transmission . SRP control said a net schedule would show as zero . I then spoke with EPE and told them to forget the schedule . I called Bhavin back and told him SRP was aware of the schedule . Bhavin told me that he would make a note of the schedule and show it as net scheduled . At 13:02 Bhavin called me back and told me he was not checking out with SRP at PV devers . I called SRP transmission and went over the schedule one more time . SRP transmission still showed the 75 mw schedule from HE 13 . I told SRP transmission that the 75 mw schedule was no longer flowing to him . He told me he would call his marketer . While transacting for HE 15 , I again spoke with Mike at SRP marketing and Mike told me he had missed telling his transmission to pull out the 75 mw schedule . I believe the original problem was the net scheduling and that it was compounded by miscommunication on SRP's end . It should be noted that Bhavin was polite and professional throughout my conversations with him . I think the ability to net schedule at tie points is important . My feeling is that the CAISO schedulers should have the same scheduling capabilities at the tie points as those schedulers outside the CAISO . Please let me know what you find out regarding this practice . If you have any questions for me please let me know . Thank you for your help . Bill
John , Goodness ! Great questions!..I could answer some in 5 minutes but others would be a 2 hour discourse . First , I did get both your resume and letter and have taken it to our Human Resources department . I currently have 11 people on rotation(shift work) , and 10 is the appropriate number for me to have on shift . One of my employees is interviewing for another opening on the floor on Friday and two others are looking to move . Julie Kearney ( in our human resources department ) will be gone today through Wednesday of next week . So by Thursday of next week we should be able to set up an interview schedule and go from there . I have answered a few of your questions in your email below . We can go over the others when we speak next . Thanks for the good questions . Bill
Sean , Bobette from "Powerdex" wants to create an hourly index out west . Do you want to take a look at this and her template and give me your feedback . Would participation in this index accomplish anything for us ? Let me know , Bill
Group- WWP is good to buy and sell with us again . Have fun . Bill
Steve , Good afternoon , I have attached a draft of the Control Area Services Agreement to this email . Please take a look at it when you have a moment and let me know what you think about it . I understand we may not implement it for a while . However , I thought having an agreement in place might provide us with more flexibility and the ability to take advantage of opportunities as this month winds down . I appreciate your time and feedback . Thank you , Bill
What is this ZP-15 ?
My apologies for the public humiliation . Bill
Kate , We are short 2 pieces of BOM at SP-15 7-22 . Price of $27.20 and $28.00 . We are also short 1 daily piece in SP-15 at the ST-CALI index price . Thanks , Bill
Group , We are starting to see some market changes as we transition into the winter months . First: With EPE we will start seeing a severe morning ramp . We will have to carefully manage the units to prevent "swinging" them and increasing the chance of a unit outage . As the EPE loads plummet off-peak , we should consult the unit commitment , and depending on market conditions look to take units off-line and/ or put units on manual and buy energy back . Recently we have sold energy from EPE at a loss rather than putting costly gas turbines on manual ( Newman 1 , 2 and 3) , reducing them , and buying that energy less expensively in the market . Our relationship with EPE is at a critical stage , they have a new vice-president and will be hiring new management to lead their marketing group . We would like to be a part of EPE's marketing effort going forward , but need to continue to prove that our level of service cannot be matched either in-house or by other marketers . I look to each member of the group to be a part of this effort and to work closely to run the EPE grid as efficiently as possible . Second: The morning ramp will soon be upon us in the Northwest . It will become very difficult to get energy in the Nortwest for HE 6 through HE 10 . We should look for congestion possibly on the COI and the DC . Also , as lights and heaters come on in the evening , there should be another jump in load at HE 18 through HE 20 . Enron Calgary will also be looking for energy these hours . Be sure to take this load movement into consideration if you lock a price in with ECC . Finally: We will have a meeting on TUESDAY--November 6th at 4:30 in the afternoon--(the first Tuesday as usual ) to discuss market changes , peformance reviews and the final two months of the year . Please see me with any questions regarding the system . Thank you . Bill
Paul , Here is an updated version of the agreement I sent to Steve on Friday . Sorry I didn't cc you to start with . It's pretty much exactly as we discussed . Let me know if you have any questions . Thanks , Bill
Group , Going forward we will be delivering parking or taking lending energy at one point per schedule with Portland General . We will either deliver or take energy from them at Portland General System . OR we will deliver or take energy from them at Mid-C . PGE real-time has had difficulty with scheduling the energy in real-time to or from a point other than originally prescheduled . Therefore ONLY schedule the energy to or from the originally prescheduled delivery point . In the case below we would deliver the energy to Portland General System--NOT the MID-C . We should continue to be flexible at PGE's request . Please see me with any questions . Thanks , Bill
Kate , We are short 3 pieces tomorrow at $27.20 , $28.00 , and a piece at the ST-CALI index . We are also long HE2 through HE5 at PV , 20 mws parked with PNM at $16 . Deal #'s are-823620 , 823657--we will be out in position manager for these hours...BW
Group , David Porter will be moving to the Utility Risk Management group with Enron Energy Services beginning Tuesday October 23 . Please join me in thanking David for his effort in the real-time group over the past year ( especially the 24-hour long shift) , and wishing him good luck in his new position . Stay tuned for a "going away" party for Dave in the near future . Bill
I am not concerned with the improperly posted ATC's . I am concerned that our bids to relieve congestion were awarded but that the respective dollar value for those bids was incorrect . We have had problems in the past with misentry of our congestion management bids . However , in this case , the awarded congestion management bids look correct to me , and it appears that the CAISO published price is not appropriate for the amount of mws flowed . I would like to figure this out as soon as possible so that we can fix any problems that might exist on our end . Please give me a call when you have a chance . Thanks , Bill
Kysers and Mary- ST-WBOM is long at PV parking with PNM for HE 2 through HE 5 , 20 mws each hour--for Friday and Saturday . The price of the power after the parking fee is $15.50 . The deal number is 826094 . This deal is just hanging out there under W-BOM and should make us 80 mws long at PV on Friday and Saturday . Also--we are still short the two BOM pieces in SP-15 for a total of 50 mws each hour on peak-Friday and Saturday- average price of $27.60 . You would have the deal numbers on this one . Sweet .
Tim , Probably 3 to 5 months ago David Poston demonstrated a new position manager to work with both FSP and Enpower . David Poston showed the position manager to me , Cara Semperger , and Phil Platter . Dave suggested that the new position manager would replace the current stand-alone position managers in CAPS and Enpower . When Dave and I ran through the demonstration , I was told that the East desk had driven most of the development work to date . The functionality of the position manager in the stage Dave presented to me seemed useful , with little development needed for us to implement it . The position manager looked like it would offer several improvements over Real-Time's current position and report reconciliation methods . My impression of the application was that it would be a portion of FSP when implemented and was not a stand alone application . Within a week after demostrating the new position manager , Dave relayed to me that production of the position manager would be delayed until after FSP was in production . As a result of the FSP delay , I have heard nothing of the position manager and have had no input on it since that first meeting . I think this application ( as I saw it last ) has the potential to improve our reports and reduce our time spent running them . This application should be of benefit to preschedulers , risk and deal control . Now that the position manager is back on the table , I would like the real-time group to be involved in the implementation of this portion of FSP and work to improve its ability to act as a report reconciliation tool . If you have any questions please let me know . Thanks , Bill
Group , Our deal with EES has changed . As Ryan indicated in his email we are now charging $3 for EES up to 100 mws , above 100 mws to 200 mws we are charging $4 , above 200 mws per hour we are charging $5 . However , when we have transacted with EES for a peaker product or day-ahead schedule we will not integrate our fee into their price for that quanity of mws . I will indicate in an email to you when this occurs . This is a bit complex but if you have questions just let me know . Also , EnMax has recently been buying energy from us at the BC Border . This turned out to be a "Canadian" firm purchase on the part of Enmax . Please do not fill any sale to EnMax with MPC energy . We need to treat EnMax just like ECC . We should buy an option or a call and then exercise that option . MPC does not have this capability and should not be used in this manner . Finally , the NW evening peak has arrived . The NW has been extremely tight through morning and evening peaks , often over $30 to pick up.. . Any questions , just let me know . Thanks , Bill
Group , Here is some input from Tony at EPE regarding running their system . I think the EPE system was run very well on October 18th , but aside from that , this email shows how closely they are watching our performance and what they expect . Let's do our best to continue to provide them with good service . Thanks , Bill
St-WBOM is long again for HE 2 through HE 5 at PV from PNM at a price of $15.50 . We will be 20 mws long each hour for a day total of 80 . Same deal # as yesterday--#826094 . If you could adjust your sheets for tomorrow I would appreciate it . Remember , we are also short 50 mws for Monday in SP-15 at $27.60 Sweet .
Kathy , I will be available on Tuesday but it would have to be either earlier or later on in the day . I could meet with Britt at 3PM or at 9 AM . Any idea what this is regarding ? Thanks , Bill
What are Tracy's thoughts on this ?
Group , For those on night and day shift on Saturday/Sunday the emergency back-up generators will be tested . The testing will occur from 5 AM to 10 AM on Sunday morning . Dave Steiner has assured me that RT will be unaffected and Dave will be on hand to help if anything is needed . I think we should work to have everything submitted early to the CISO , tags made , etc . At least for HE 6 , HE 7 and HE 8 . This should give us some extra time if something goes wrong when they switch to the back-up power . Bill
Group , Also on Saturday morning...Enpower will be down from 5 AM to 7 AM . Thanks , Bill
We also received congestion for HE 5--50 mws at $74.83 . HE 5 is not in the inc sheet but will be . The CISO is again having difficulties reading our bids . They have been working on this for a week . Thanks , Bill
Group , The Enron Derivatives II will be on Wednesday and Thursday , November 14th and 15th . The class is open to those who took Derivatives I earlier this year . Please see me or send me an email if you are interested and we will make scheduling arrangements . Thanks , Bill
Cool
Julie , I received this message yesterday from a student group at the University of Washington . Do you still want some to go to Seattle and stir up interest ? Bill
When will you be starting your subscription to "Bear Magazine" ?
Definitely...to begin with he should be Michael Mier . Let me know what you need.. . Bill
Kate , It is the end of the month and just like everyone else in your group you are needed to be at work at certain times . Granted , renewed motivation can be a great thing to help you attack various job functions with vigor , and I am a big believer in it . We have in the past discussed that I would prefer that you take personal days/vacation days in the middle of the month and at the end of the week . If you would like to plan a longer vacation in advance , again like everyone else in your group , please just let me know . I appreciate your understanding . Bill
If you need tomorrow and Friday off , take it .
Take these days off too .
Alan , I have a few questions regarding the emminent implementation of the new target pricing mechanism . 1 . Does uninstructed energy still get paid ( if not , we cannot hedge financials ) 2 . The CISO Table 1 . lists an unintended consequence as " Target price may be manipulated due to no obligation to deliver" Why is there no obligation to deliver ? 3 . Is there still a load deviation penalty ? Or would that be considered seperately ? Thanks for the help . Bill
Group , We are still short 50 mws in ST-WBOM on peak Friday and Saturday at $27.60 . For Friday only ( as of right now ) I have picked up 10 mws of energy flat ( 24hr schedule) . I bought this energy from the APX-deal #840719 at $25 . We will be long 10 mws each hour in position manager in SP-15 as a result . Please sell this energy in the off-peak ( on-peak will go to fill our W-BOM short) . I have scheduled an HA 24 purchase from the APX 1 and have put the energy into the ST-WBOM load zone . Do call with questions . Cell: 503-887-3449 Home: 503-274-0502 Thanks , Bill
I still need to interview Stacy but will have feedback when I finish . Thanks , Bill
Group , As most of you are aware we changed time zones on Sunday . We are back in Pacific Standard Time . As such , we are once again in a different time zone than some of our counterparties . Please specify Pacific time zone in your summary of your deal at the end of each phone call--translate the deal to Mountain time only if necessary . We must be very clear on this going forward or disputes will be numerous and we will not be able to resolve them . See me if you have any questions regarding this expectation . Thanks , Bill
You can go ahead and talk to Fran...Also , how was you vaca ? And I have some things for you to take care of from Thursday and this weekend when you have a chance . Thanks ,
Just talked with Kochel . He was expecting a bounce in our stock on funds covering their shorts . I don't know if I agree after this . Bill
Kate , Bobette from Powerdex will want to speak to you regarding timelines , templates , etc . to set up an hourly index to be published the next day . I gave her your name because of your past experience in deal control . She will likely be calling around 9:30 or 9:45 . I am not sure where I am at on this index , your feedback will play a large role in whether we participate in this index . Sorry for the short notice . Bill
Matt , I will work on these this afternoon and give you some ideas.. . BTW-I heard from Kochel this morning , he is getting married March 2nd in Seattle--did you know his sister was already married to Steve Darue ? ( poor woman!) . The Kelso/Camas game is on Thursday--maybe I will take Friday off...what do you think ? Check your hotmail around 3 .
Kochel is supposed to get married on March 2nd . Same girl--we'll see if its the same outcome .
Matt , I like the Mcleod Resume the best . I have added some suggestions and provided a bit of feedback . Why don't you do another write-up and I'll go over it again . It looks like you have a good start . I will also proofread your cover letter or give you some ideas if you need them . Good luck . Bill
Ken , Thank you for your inquiry . I will do my best to answer your questions , but would prefer to answer your questions by phone . I feel that this will provide each of us with greater flexibility and likely will give me even more of an opportunity to answer your questions . I will usually be most available after 3 each day . You can reach me at 503-464-3730 . Thanks , Bill
Group- Brace yourselves.. . Once more we are experiencing seasonal changes . The time zone change has pushed the evening peak back to HE 18 through HE 19 . These hours are now premium , the load curve no longer resembles a rolling hill but has an extreme morning ramp and an extreme evening ramp . Both EPE and the CAISO in NP-15 will have difficulty with this evening ramp . Do not count on the EPE load forecast to accurately identify the evening ramp . We should not suck off the grid . Pay the extra $3 for firm or unit contingent power in the SW . We need to attack the evening peak early and make sure we cover it . We should be using congestion wheels as hedges . A 200 mw import requires a 200 mw wheel going in the opposite direction at $0.10--or less--we should not do 50 mws at $50 as we would still have to pay $50 on the other 150 mws if we get awarded all 50 mws of relief . We will discuss this in our meeting next Tuesday November 6th at 4:30 . Let's be sharp and not give away hard-earned revenue on congestion mis-management or poor scheduling . Any questions ? Comments ? Ideas ? Bring them to the meeting on next Tuesday . Thanks , Bill
Group , A quick reminder . All El Paso Electric Deals and related deals for El Paso Electric ( ie buying from SRP selling to EPE--anything with a group of EPEC in Enpower ) need to be in MST . These deals should be scheduled in MST on the deal scheduling portion of Enpower as well . Thanks , Bill
Josie , Sign me up . Thanks , Bill
Just need to know why there will be a BOM charge of $5331.90 ? My impression is that this was totally trued up.. . Is this some weird tranny charge ? Ideas.. . As always , if you could go through these charges that would be great , and I like the idea of showing the $96,065.15 this month . Thanks , Bill
Super . And sorry about getting you locked in the stairwell . I just
Thanks , And sorry again about the stairwell--did you actually get stuck in there ?
This is totally inappropriate and HIGHLY unprofessional . In these difficult times we need to continue to put forth and display Enron's core values: Respect , Integrity , Communication and Excellence . I look for this in each one of my coworkers and for every member of the real-time team . Please see what you can do to better respect Kate's feelings and the effort she puts in each day .
Darin , I need you to send emails regarding our disputes to myself and Kate Symes . Please do NOT send emails regarding our disputes to our customers--El Paso or others . Also , my email is bill.williams.iii@enron.com . I appreciate the email , but I had to receive it from our customer . Let's set up a time to meet and run through some things on Sunday or Monday morning . Give me a call on my cell phone on Saturday when you have a chance . Thanks , Bill
Cara , Sounds good but...we had to change the night to November 30th...I'm sorry . Hopefully it still works for you guys . Did you want to get rooms as well . If so just speak with Jill Chatterton . More to follow .
Pretty much , its turning into the only day they have available for what we need...short of Thanksgiving weekend or late December...which is getting a bit close to the Holidays.. . What do you think ? Is it a good way to end the month ?
This is at the top right after you turning the volume on your computer down . Also.. . Right after the boxes , but parallel to FSP parallel testing . Thanks , Bill
Chip , Could you help me put Enpower on my local computer ? And my monitor keeps sleeping on the job . Thanks , Bill
Guys , When you see Four Corners #5 come back tonight . Please use the fundies website to send out a message confirming it to Traders and RT . Also , you should give BPA and CERS a call tonight to see if they are selling off cheap power . Also , we are long 50mws flat at PV ( see Kate's email)...The prices are $27 and $37 . Feel free to sell off up to HE 17 at around 39...if you can get 43 bal peak--go for it!! ! We sold 50's across the peak at PV tonight . This was a result of the Four Corners 5 derate so prices may fall hard tomorrow . Please try to find some information on the status of SouthPoint and the Desert Basin unit tonight as well ( this used to be Reliant's plant --rumor has it this is now SRP's starting tomorrow) . As a bonus , CalPine scheduled off of SouthPoint for tomorrow while the plant was still down for maitenence...If you get cut--sell them the off peak at PV for $75...MAKE THEM WEAR IT ! As an added bonus don't forget LADWP and CORAL cut us off for "credit reasons"...please treat them as you would any other non-performing counterpartFinally , Services has a new deal with a cement company in NP-15 . We will liquidate the energy for the Services Desk RT at NP-15 +/- $2 . We need to make a buy/sell from imbalance under Services at $0 price . We then make a buy/sell from Services under St-Whourly at NP-15 +/- $2 . Finally we buy/sell from/to Counterparty X under the St-Whourly book . Then we need to give Services the swap deal # and the price . The mw values should be on Kysa's sheet . If this procedure works...please send out an email detailing the procedure with whatever comments are necessary when this goes physical . Have fun and good luck . Thanks , Bill
Group-- NO TRADES WITH SEMPRA UNTIL FURTHER . Do not sell to them , do not buy from them . They are in a box . You may want to let the muni's and other counterparties know . Call me with questions . Thanks , Bill
Group, . I will be out of the office on Friday November 2nd , I will return on Monday November 5th . If you have questions , please call me on my phone at 503-887-3449 . Thanks , Bill
Matt , Check this out , we got this from our managing director this morning...So is the Fremont bridge a target...how bout the I-5 ? Might want to pass this on to your mom and dad . By the way--your a wuss for skipping the high school playoff game.. . This just came to me today . This information is widely available to corporations and law enforcement around the country . It will likely hit the media in the next day or so . This is all the information that is available . Enron Corp . Business Controls/Corporate Security received the following information via the National Threat Warning system . While we do not wish to unduly alarm employees , the specificity of the information dictated immediate dissemination to our West Coast offices . THE FBI IS IN POSSESSION OF UNCORROBORATED INFORMATION INDICATING THE POSSIBILITY OF ADDITIONAL TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES , SPECIFICALLY THE WEST COAST . REPORTEDLY , UNSPECIFIED GROUPS ARE TARGETING SUSPENSION BRIDGES ON THE WEST COAST . SIX INCIDENTS ARE TO TAKE PLACE DURING RUSH HOUR BEGINNING FRIDAY , NOVEMBER 2 AND CONTINUING NO FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS ALLEGED ATTACK IS KNOWN AT THIS TIME . THE FBI IS ATTEMPTING TO VERIFY THE VALIDITY OF THIS REPORT . RECIPIENTS WILL BE UPDATED AS EVENTS WARRANT . RECIPIENTS WHO RECEIVE OR DEVELOP INFORMATION RELATED TO THIS MATTER SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THEIR LOCAL FBI OFFICE . We will keep you apprised if we receive any further information . Thank you .
Is the bet that I will reject the idea ?
Diana , Here is the message that Kate sent to Diane , and the original messages from Diane are below that . I think we will have this sorted out going forward . Let me know if you have any questions . Thanks , Bill
Traders are as follows: Bill Williams III Ryan Slinger Kate Symes Bert Meyers Leaf Harasin Mark Guzman Eric Linder Steve Merriss Craig Dean Casey Anderson Darrin Presto Mike Meier Thanks for making sure this is squared away , Bill
Murray , Thank you for your interest in our group . I will certainly keep you informed of our next available opening . We will likely have some openings in February ( it always seems to happen around that time) . As you might assume , we are interested in hiring the best person for the job , if you were that person , then we would do our best to facilitate your move . Again , thank you for your interest , and if you have further questions just give me a call . Bill
I thought your email regarding the running of CONG with a heuristic rather than optimal solution may address and solve the problem . I have not yet been able to pull up "corrected" prices but hopefully they will now reflect our bids . The problems I referred to in my phone message last week were similar to what my original email detailed . Basically , we were awarded mw's on a congestion management schedule and the published prices did not match our bids . Will the change in running the "solutions" change this ? Our volume management group will then be inputing our bid price rather than the published congestion management price--as those prices are not yet published correctly . I will be in the office this week and can be reached at your convenience . Thanks , Bill
A truly useful fount of knowledge.. .
We will not be needing any headsets in the real-time group.. . Thanks for checking . Bill
This is appropriate--do not make the Enpower till the next day if it will be under St-Whourly... .
This was meant for you .
This should go to Bill Williams . Not Bill Williams IIII .
I already do .
I am sorry to hear this Julie . I appreciate your effort and do not envy your task of informing the candidates of our change in plans . Let me know if there is anything I can help with . Bill
One more index . This is the one I would like to participate in...if it works . Bill
Group , We have returned to CAPS as of today . We will return to running the Enpower to CAPS report as usual . This will give us a chance to work the performance bugs out of FSP and improve our reconciliation methodology at the same time . Thanks , Bill
Check this sick stuff out .
ST-WBOM is importing 20 mws for HE 2 and 3 , and 10 mws for HE 4 and 5 at MEAD 230 . I have made the Enpower deals ( 868223 , 868224 , 868234 ) to buy from PinWest and sell to the imbalance in SP-15 . I have entered the schedule in CAPS and it should be good to go . ST-WBOM also purchased 10 mws from Redding in NP-15 for HE 7-22 at $25 . Chris Mallory brokered this deal . Thanks Bill
Group , We all knew it was coming . NERC Compliance surveys are continuining . Everything must be tagged both light load and heavy load . THIS INCLUDES SCHEDULES IN THE SOUTHWEST . Templates and POR/POD sheets are available . If you have any questions regarding our policy please let me know . Let's be especially sharp for HE 14 on the 17th . Thanks , Bill
Dude-- It was $5 . My total bet for the game was $40 . $5 to you , $20 to Porter , $15 to Mark Fisher . Come on...don't try to run me over . The gloating has to be worth $5 .
Of course . Deez nuts .
Group , We are long 20 mws in SDG1 for HE 2 and HE 3 . We are long 10 mws in SDG1 for HE 4 and HE 5 . This cost us $7.50 . We imported it from MEAD 230 . We are also long 10 mws in NP-15 for HE 7-22 at $25 . This is from Redding . Finally , ST-SW has extra transmission from PV to 4C and PV to Mead . You can query by Enron Power Marketing on the APS site to see what we have already purchased . If you need this transmission off-peak please use what we have already purchased . We can go over the Enpower when I get in in the morning . Thanks , Bill
Good afternoon . We have recieved significant amounts of congestion revenue on real-time for 11/13 . Please use the inc sheet or CAPS to settle in the morning . The inc sheet has correct pricing and schedule ID's . Thanks , Bill
Extra ST-SW transmission can be viewed in the Available Transmission Sheet .
I know Jim . You guys are doing well . Thanks , Bill
Amy , Hey ! Great to hear from you ! Hope you are doing well . But.. . What are you talking about ? Who's on what side ? And what are you trying to recall ? Bill
Jill , Could you look into my concur expense login/password . I am at a class today and need to approve these expense reports in the system . However,I cannot access the system . I am not sure if this is related to our floor wide network problems or what . Also , we are a go for Edgefield . You and I just need to talk about the expense report . Thanks , Bill
Jim , We also received congestion revenue for HE 10 through HE 18 . HE18-although it shows nothing from the CAISO on their site ( their server went down ) is the same as HE17-the CAISO specifically relayed this to me on a recorded line . Thanks , Bill
Jim , You can find HE 10 through 18 at the bottom of the November Service Sheet . This should be in the same location as the Trading sheet in the Inc sheet section . My understanding is that you were given a copy of the service sheet with the trading sheet yesterday morning . You should find probably another $60,000 maybe $70,000 at the bottom of the sheet . If you have any questions just let me know . Thanks , Bill
Group , We have had some issues with EpmiCalPool deals recently and I wanted to provide information for newer members of the group and a quick reminder for crusty veterans as we head into the Thanksgiving Holiday . I have also decided to change our protocol for entering multiple EpmiCalPool deals . Please pay special attention to #5 below . So , some basic rules about EpmiCalPool deals . 1 . EpmiCalPool deals are BUY-RESALE deals--(a transmission deal will work but is not the preferred method ) 2 . We only BUY from the EpmiCalPool-no exceptions- . 3 . EpmiCalPool deals have a $0 price in the buy and sell portions . Please do not enter a price on an EpmiCalPool deal . 4 . EpmiCalPool deals must have a delivery point of an CISO tie point or an CISO congestion zone . Good delivery points would be: Malin , COB N/S , COB S/N , NOB N/S , NOB S/N , Cascade , Captain Jack , Summit , Four Corners 345 , Mead 230 , Paloverde , NP-15 , ZP-26 , SP-15 . Bad delivery points would include: Mid-C , Hotsprings , Hidalgo , BC Border . 5 . IMPORTANT CHANGES TO BUSINESS PRACTICE HERE EpmiCalPool deals are used to simulate the purchase of transmission from the California ISO . a. ) If you have a wheel from tie point to tie point for example Malin to Four Corners for congestion management--than an EpmiCalPool deal from Malin to Four Corners would be appropriate . For seperate wheels from tie point to tie point we will NOT be putting in deals from Malin to NP-15 , NP-15 to SP-15 , and SP-15 to Four Corners . b.)However , from Congestion zone to congestion zone inside of California , or if you are moving tie point to a congestion zone--for example Malin to SP-15 we will need a Malin to NP-15 and NP-15 to SP-15 . This will allow us to better capture congestion across congestion zones in California , and will prepare us for the move to FSP . 6 . We will initiate this change in business practice HE 1 on Tuesday November 20th . Epmicalpool deals continue to provide problems with reports . Please see me with any questions . Thanks , Bill
Group , We will have an emergency meeting on Monday , November 26th at 4 PM . We will be going live on EOL for HE 7-22 on Monday . We will be discussing EOL trading , the new confirmation workspace in Enpower , business practice changes , and the Dynegy merger . Please make plans to attend . Contact me as soon as you can if you think you may not be able to make it . Thanks , Bill
Enpower Preschedule Workspace and Path Confirmation Please note we have two new Enpower applications currently in use by the Prescheduling Group that are also available for Real Time use . A manual has been placed in your inbox describing the process in detail . You will be using this in place of Lotus Notes to confirm and process cut power schedules going forward . You must check out with all major marketers and utilities each night . This would include but not be limited to: AEP , AES-New Energy , Aquila , Avista , Calpine , Constellation , Coral , Duke , Dynegy , El Paso Merchant , Exelon , Meico , Mirant , Morgan , NCPA , Reliant , PPLMontana , PowerX , Sempra , SMUD , TransAlta , Williams , and southwest utilities such as Pinnacle West , SRP , PNM , PSCO and Pacificorp . Northwest counterparties are checked out by BPA and do not need to be checked again by us ( this would include SCL , TCL , PSPL , BPAP , GCPUD , EWEB , IPC , MPC , SNPD , WWP) . These checkouts should be started in HE 19 and finished by HE 21 . NOTE: You must open both PSW and Path Confirmation from your local Enpower Launchpad , which can be found under the Start Menu in Programs/Business Applications/Enpower/Enpower Login . Following are a few pointers to help you get started . 1 . All prescheduled power paths will be loaded into Path Confirmation . This application must be opened from local Enpower and can be found in the menu that drops down from the hand icon at the left under "Tools." 2 . A box will appear asking you to select a default trading desk . Choose "West" and click "Okay." 3 . Supply schedules are shown in gray , transmission in yellow , and market in blue . 4 . Sort paths by clicking and dragging on the heading you'd like to sort by . Suggestion: Sort by counterparty while making confirmation calls . When all schedules with that counterparty are confirmed , highlight each schedule 5 . Highlight the path you'd like to confirm or cut by clicking in the thin box to the very left of the Path Confirmation screen . Highlight multiple rows by holding the "Control" button and while selecting multiple rows . 6 . Confirm a path by highlighting and clicking the telephone icon . A screen will come up requesting contact information from the appropriate counterparty . Because this information saves directly to Enpower , save time runs about a minute . 7 . Cut a path by highlighting and clicking the scissors icon . A screen called "Cut Information" will come up . Select the "New Path Cut" icon in the upper left-hand corner and supply the relevant information ( region , cut time , resupply path , Enpower numbers , Turret ID , etc. ) 8 . Double click anywhere in a particular row to see a detail of that schedule . This screen will show the terms and hours of the deal as well as volume , price , Enpower deal and OATI tag number . Lotus Notes is being phased out of operation , and we are working with the Enpower team in Houston to develop a discussion database similar to the one we currently use in Notes . These new applications will be a part of that , so please begin adjusting your nightly schedule checkout and/or cuts procedure accordingly ( i.e . Record cut paths in Enpower Path Confirmation , not Lotus Notes. )
Tim , I have been approached by 3 different groups regarding an HA or RT index in the West . I have decided against participating with TraderNews or PowerDex . I am considering participating with Dow Jones . I think a working index would help encourage liquidity through price discovery in real time . It should also provide an index to settle against financially for our desk and the Cash desks . I am working with Kate and our developement group upstairs to get the tools in place to participate in the Dow Jones index . I am still waiting for the confidentiality agreements from DJ and will be sending them to Steve Hall when they arrive . I have concerns that participating in this index may spread some of the value we obtain in making a market on EOL to our counterparties . I would appreciate your thoughts on this when you have an opportunity . Thanks , Bill
I appreciate the goals and accomplishments , I was looking more for a quick outline of duties . This should work though . Thanks , Bill
I like that much better...super .
Good morning , I would like to obtain Global Trader ID's for the following traders on the Short Term West Hourly desk in Portland , Oregon . They will be using EnronOnline beginning next week , Nov . 26th . Bert Meyers Mark Guzman Leaf Harasin Eric Linder Steve Merriss Craig Dean Please call me with any questions . I can be reached at 503-464-3730 or on my cell phone at 503-887-3449 . Thank you for your help . Bill Williams
Just wanted to give you a quick heads up .
Grace , What is a CPE certificate ?
Allegheny's SC is now APX 5 . Contact numbers are below . Thanks Bill
Susan , Thank you . This looks good . To answer some of your questions , price is per mw , not per deal . Transmission deals , EpmiCalPool deals , and sales or purchases from the counterparty California Imbalance in Enpower need to be excluded . Thanks , Bill
Thanks for reserving the room . I will not need any food ordered . Thanks , Bill
Group- We are currently owed money by CERS ( approximately $100,000) . We need to net this to a zero by Friday . It is very important that each of you call CERS and purchase energy from them to net this position out . Otherwise--we will see a loss of $100,000 . Let's make this problem go away . Thanks , Bill
I have also not been able to approve these . I do need those folks to have access.. .
I spoke with Jim Danielson at MWD regarding this cut on 11/26 . We did not deliver the 25 mws to MWD . Jim at MWD requested that we "book out" the cut with him at the contract price of the 25 mws . I entered a deal to buy 25 mws from MWD at the contract price ( $113.00 ) deal #882054 , and a deal to sell to Calpine to capture LD's ( $113.00 ) deal #882064 . I attempted to enter this in the cuts database but got several errors and do not have confidence that this occurred . Please let me know if you have any questions . Bill
Nope .
Group , Cuts are on the way . While most can be zeroed out in Enpower ( for LD's ) like normal , longterm contracts will require an annuity for the value of the cut on that particular day . In the interest of being uniform , the guidelines for cuts are below . We will be handling cuts in the following manner: 1 . Documentation is priority #1 . We need to fill out a cut sheet with the times , the name of the person who called , the tag number , the quantity and price . 2 . After attempting to resupply the cut or find an alternate sink we need to carefully document changes in the new enpower workspace . 3 . We need to zero out all cut deals in Enpower , we then need to calculate the value of the deals and make an annuity . The annuity must be made HE 1 on the following day of the schedule . The annuity needs to be for 1 mw for the value of the zeroed out contract . In the comment section of the annuity you must include the Enpower deal # of the cut deal and should include an indication of the number of mws each hour and the contract price--for example ( 4 hours @ 25 mws X $100 per mw = $10,000) . 4 . Please be as accurate as possible . We still need to be flat in Enpower at the end of each day . And we still need to calculate our daily position . 5 . Put all cut sheets in the accordion folder on Kate Symes' Desk . I appreciate your help and diligence . Thanks , Bill
Group , As of HE2 this morning , our contract with MPC was ended . For the time being , we will no longer be balancing MPC's load . Also , we can only purchase up to 100 mws from APS transmission . Please do not put wheels in to relieve congestion for over 100 mws . But do check the transmission availability on the website and maximize our ability to relieve congestion with APS in the Southwest . These should be the only congestion wheels that we run . Also , please use PNM not AEP for any sleeving for EPE . Thanks , Bill
Dave , I need your help with some Enpower applications . Please give me a call as soon as you have an opportunity . By the way...I sure hope your Longhorns do NOT end up matched against my Huskies...ouch ! Thanks , Bill
This is important---
For all cuts the following procedures apply.. . 1. ) Notes as usual 2. ) In the Enpower Path Confirmation , we need to make cuts as Path Confirms . Enter comments in the confirmed section . We will be zeroing Enpower deals out on Monday ( hint: NOTES are VERY important--All CUTS must be notated and the notes must be put in the accordion folders) . 3. ) Try to have the counterparties continue any paths around us . Just "bow out" gracefully if you have no other options with the words "L - D's." 4. ) If we are cut by a generator/utility going into California , we must call the HA desk at California and tell them the increment that we will be underscheduling our load by . For example , EPE will be cutting all schedules going into California on light load ( 100 mws) . If we cannot resupply the schedules we need to tell the state that we are underscheduling our load by 100 mws . THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT . We have posted an LC with Cali for this reason . Also , EPE will be long RT 100 mws off-peak as they are no longer selling to us . 25 mws should be sold to TEP to cover a forward schedule . Stacy has set this up at PV . Please do this as a direct bill with EPE . As of Jan 01 , 2002 we will no longer be marketing for EPE . Also , PV#3 will be coming off this weekend , and FC#4 will be down from HE 22 on Saturday through HE 06 on Sunday . This will probably not be a fun weekend . I appreciate your help . Bill
Group- As we have more and more cuts , we have an excellant opportunity to refine our cut technique . ( YES! ) 1. ) In path confirmation workspace-please check all cut paths as "confirmed" ( this will allow us to sort for cut or "confirmed" paths later)-and enter notes in the comment section regarding the cut . 2. ) ZERO OUT CUT SCHEDULES IN DEAL SCHEDULING . On imports to CALI , please zero out the purchase outside of CALI , zero out the EpmiCalPool , and then make a purchase under the book that had the import ( likely EPMI Short Term Cali ) from the California Imbalance ( remember no price and 24 POS on the group) . IF you have any questions , please call me . We are having a nightmare taking care of weekend cuts , particularly imports into California . Thanks , Bill
The key is to go long Heroin and Coke when you have a chance . And put extra money in the bank Bill
This can also be found at P:Realtime/Williamsonly/Dopewars in the P drive . If you have access .
What up dawg ! How are you and Meg doing ? I still have a job . It has been an extremely rocky time . However , I feel optimistic that our trading business will continue in some fashion . I believe that we will be bought out by an investment bank and that we will be able to start trading again . The chances are good that I will have to thin out my group a bit , I am hoping that attrition will take care of some of the members of the group . I think we are going to let traders out of their contract if they want to leave . Hopefully that will cut down on any direct lay-offs I will have to do . It would suck having to lay-off good people . Its worrisome but like I said , I am optimistic . Soccer was going well , but I sprained my knee pretty badly playing indoor last night , so another two-three weeks before I am out there playing again...bollocks ! Its ridiculous . How are things with you ? I have two tickets to Mark Lanegan on December 19th at Berbatis Pan . Are you going to be in town at that point ? Its gonna be sweet . Still enjoying the Audi . My address is 1005 SW Park Ave . #706 , Portland OR , 97205 . Give me a ring and let me know what the word is . 503-887-3449 . Later , Bill
Sorry to hear it man . It has not been a great last couple of months .
Bam . Let me know what you hear
Thank you .
Group , We will be meeting on Thursday at 4:30 to discuss recent changes and the company outlook with Tim on Thursday Dec . 13th at 4:30 . Please call me if you cannot make it . Thanks , Bill
Sean , Just to follow-up from yesterday . Two key real-time customers would be MPC ( load balancing agreement ) and EPE ( power "consulting" agreement) . Other customers such as LV Cogen and Valley are important , but they do not provide the market information or the opportunities of these two . As soon as we have something tangible regarding a new company ( and likely before) , I think we need to visit these customers and get them back . Ideas ? Bill
Good morning , We have had some changes in our real-time group at Enron and consequently I would like to request a password change for the following EPMI logins . Please notify me when these changes will be effective . 1. ) real_time_epmiwe-- the current password is epmishift , I would like to change it to: huskies 2. ) real_time_epmiwe2-- the current password is realtimers2 , I would like to change it to: ducks 3. ) real_time_epmiwe3-- the current password is oregon , I would like to change it to: beavers 4. ) settlements-- the current password is settlements , I would like to change it to: cougars Thank you for your help with this . Bill Williams Manager , Short Term West Hourly Trading
I'm sorry I missed your call . I know you are busy but please let me know when you have something . Leaf called yesterday looking for clarification and I would like to be able to give him an answer . Thanks , Bill
Thank you for the confirmation . That is very good news .
Alan , I just want to pass on the two names I had mentioned previously to you . Eric Linder and Steve Merriss . Their home numbers are 503-753-8716 and 503-241-3729 respectively . Both had worked for me for about 8-9 months . These are the only numbers I have for them as their cell phones have been canceled . Bill
Jason , Good afternoon . I am contacting you regarding activating a pass to the Employee Store . I did product testing for you in late spring ( for soccer) . I would like to activate the pass for tomorrow , December 14th , if possible . I recognize this is short notice but if this would be possible please give me a call back at 503-887-3449 . I would like to have my parents attend as well . Their names are Bill and Joy Williams . I appreciate your help . Thanks , Bill Williams
I can be a reference for both Eric and Steve .
Good morning ! How are you doing ? It seems like I haven't seen you or Scott forever . Things are going well here in Portland . The bankruptcy of Enron has been a bit rough , but I am optimistic that the auction on January 11th will see the trading portion of our business bought out by a credit-worthy entity . If we are bought out , we should be back up and running by early spring . Right now , I am just working on systems upgrades and trying to learn as much as I can so we are ready to rip when we have credit again . Portland has been fun the past couple weeks , there are a few new clubs and living downtown continues to be a blast . I enjoy being able to walk everywhere and being downtown has really aided the Christmas shopping . I haven't been up to Seattle in a long time but I need to get up there . I am thinking about coming up for New Year's.. . any good ideas ? Anyway , hope you are doing well and are all ready for the holidays . Take care , Bill
Stewart and Paul , I have heard that MPC has contracted with Avista to do their load balancing . Has anyone contacted MPC to discuss continuing or renewing our relationship with them in the future . MPC is likely month-to-month with Avista as they were with us . Has there been any progress with EPE ? What are your expectations for retaining them ? Of all our service customers these would be the only two I am truly concerned about getting back . I think we have seen significant revenue from both , more because of the information they provide then because of the fee structures . Please let me know if you have any questions , or if there is anything I can do to assist . Thanks , Bill

Check this out...you should read Liar's Poker by Michael Lewis , and Den of Thieves . Good stuff . He notes that Enron management lacked an 'honor among thieves,' but predicts that Enron alumni will flourish . I suspect he is working on the Enron book right now.---sch Is Enron the New Drexel ? By Michael Lewis , the author of ``Liar's Poker'' and ``The New New Thing.'' Berkeley , California , Dec . 20 ( Bloomberg ) -- Enron Corp . is rapidly expanding the American business journalists' notion of what is possible: No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true . The boss , Kenneth Lay , was a friend of the current president of these United States , an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers . The company itself was rated ``strong buy'' by analysts at almost every Wall Street firm , considered a shining example of modern accounting by reputable accounting firms , and plugged endlessly by the business press . Six years running as Fortune's most innovative company ! And all the while this same operation was , at the very top , a lie . Understandably , people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation , but really there isn't a good one . Other than failed hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management , Michael Milken's junk bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert offers the closest parallels on Wall Street , and several people have written to me over the past week to suggest it . But it really is unfair to Milken to compare him to Lay . Alumni Will Flourish True , in both cases profitable trading businesses collapsed because their creditors came to distrust the people who ran them . And in both cases the core business -- Drexel's junk bonds and Enron's energy trading -- remain viable in the hands of other companies that banks trust . Just as the Drexel junk bond traders who didn't go to jail went to other Wall Street firms and created replicas of their former business , former Enron traders will soon be making lots of money for one-time rivals such as Dynegy Inc . and Duke Energy Corp . Well before Kenneth Lay emerges from his legal hell , the energy trading business will return to normal . But the morality of the cases are entirely different . Whatever you think of Milken's junk bond department -- and I think its sins were minor beside its achievements -- you must admit the people in it exhibited a certain honor among thieves . There was never a moment when Milken betrayed the broad interests of his traders for his own narrow ones . He paid himself huge sums of money , but he also made huge sums for his firm . He was careful to watch out for the little people who worked for him , and they loved him for it . The Enron bosses , by contrast , pillaged their firm and left the little people who worked for them holding the bag . Different Motivations Enron created the illusion that it was much more profitable than it actually was . Milken created an operation which was , if anything , much more profitable than it looked . What Milken hid was the thuggish manner in which he made his profits . What Enron hid was the sneaky way it made its losses . ( This is something I still don't understand , and would love for some enterprising reporter to explain , as Enron seems intent on explaining nothing . The off-the-books partnerships that brought Enron down appear to have been a mechanism for hiding bad investments in hard assets -- Turkish gas pipelines , Indian power plants and the like . Why did Enron , which made its money as an intermediary , invest in this stuff in the first place? ) The speed with which the markets have punished Enron reflects the differences between it and Drexel . In Drexel's case , it took a multiyear investigation by the U.S . government , together with a smear campaign in the press , to bring down the business . In Enron's case , all it took was a couple of articles in the Wall Street Journal pointing out , among other things , that senior executives were profiting at the company's expense . In Drexel's case , the demise of the firm and the jailing of Milken was pretty much the end of the story . In Enron's , the fate of the company and its leaders may open up a much bigger scandal that reaches right up to the top . Anything is possible .
Good morning , Hope you had a great holiday ! Bill
Group , We have had some problems recently with the creation of HA finals , with SQL errors , and as a result we have not been able to run reports . If it is a weekend ( or holiday) , we first need to import DA finals and then create DA finals in CAPS . After this is done we can import HA finals , and create the HA report . If the boxes are not checked , the CISO may have missed publishing certain hours . Please look in the load zones to find what hour-ahead finals may not have been published , or where CAPS may have just missed pulling them in . Sometimes it helps to pull the missing hour-ahead finals in individually . Once all the finals are in the load zones and int . interchanges , you should be able to create the final report . Please give me a call if you have any questions . Thanks , Bill
**Per Tony at EPE , the following is new for 2002 . I will attempt to get more information and pass it on as I receive it.** First , TNP now has a 75 MW call on EPE . The schedule you see on the unit commitment was called in by PNM on behalf of TNP . Lets keep checking TNP schedules real-time to minimize inadverdant on this sale . Second , SPS exchange now is 130 MW light load , SPS provides EPE 130 MW at the Eddy tie and EPE returns the power 100 MW at PV and 30 at FC . Again , this schedule will have to be verified real time with SPS/PSCO . **The TNP schedule is verified with PNM and is delivered at Hidalgo . 25 is firm just like the last two years , 50 is econ . and can be varied by PNM each hour.** Please ask if you have any questions . Thanks , Bill
Good morning . Hope your new year is off to a great start !
Scotty , What's up ? Checking to see if this was your email or not ? Haven't heard from you in forever . Hope you had a good new year . Drop me a line and give me the word . Bill
Scott , I had not heard from you in a while and was wandering what you might be up to ? Still in Seattle ? Coming down to Portland anytime soon ? Let me know . word .
Alan , I think you have identified the most pressing issues . Certainly the ability to go long or short into R/T will be important and hopefully the CISO will follow through on its efforts to "strive for simplicity and transparency." Any idea what the penalties for being long or short in R/T might be ? In the CISO's proposal the first two "goals" for the real time market appear to be at odds with each other . Also , I think we should push to rid ourselves of 10-minute dispatch at tie points . I understand the CAISO keeping the ADS in-state but it has not worked at tie-points . Feel free to let me know if you have any questions . Thanks for the update . Bill
Real-Time is on board and is comfortable with this...any questions from settlements ?
You have to love the availability of beautiful lasses for viewing . Things are interesting . Enron is moving right along and we will find out about who I am working for on Friday ( our auction should be completed then) . Not too much else is new . My place continues to get better ( as I slowly furnish it) , but Portland continues to be the little sister to Seattle . A couple new bars in town suggest she might be getting closer to puberty but definitely not the woman about town that Seattle is . Morgan told me you may no longer be with Steph ? Is this true ? ( And I hope you are the only one reading this if it is not) . If that is the case , well , we can see what we can do about it . As always , I have no plans the next couple weekends , so give me a shout ( still have my cell phone at 503-887-3449 ) if you want to take a trip on down . Your always welcome to crash on my couch...(sorry its all I have , I got rid of the futon) . Hope youre doing well . Word .
Jon , Good to hear from you . Glad to hear you are healing up , as for me , I am still working on the sprained knee . Enough of this one game and out stuff . Do you know when the outdoor season starts ? I am hoping to make some indoor games , but want to concentrate on outdoor . Bill
Group , I can now be reached with email outside of work at wwilliamsiii@palm.net This should work even if my cell does not .
The BMW is of course a 1992 ! Priced at only $9900!! ! How could you not buy it .
The Short Term West Hourly presentation is now in the O drive . Thanks for the email.. .
Grace , Could you sign me up for the bus pass . I am selling my car and no longer need the parking . Thanks , Bill
Group , We will have a meeting on Thursday of next week at 4 PM ( Pizza will be provided--finally ) on JAN 24th . I hope our transition to UBS from Enron will be complete by next Wednesday . If so , we will be discussing what we hope to achieve this year and the look of the floor going forward . If not , this meeting will likely be postponed . Please call me with any questions . Thanks , Bill
It's cold , its wet , its raining . But at least in Portland we have F-15 fighter jets being scrambled over the city . Gotta love it . what's the word . Drop me a line on the cellular--(503 ) 887-3449 .
Thank you Les . Bill
Group , The meeting this afternoon will be delayed until next week . I am waiting for more information on UBS . So , next Thursday at 4 PM we will have our meeting with the pizza . Thanks , Bill
Mike , Your cell phone is not working or has been disconnected and I have no way to reach you . Please update me with your contact information as soon as possible . Thanks , Bill
I need to get a working cell phone number for you . I tried to reach you at home today regarding the postponement of our meeting . Please give me a call or send me an email with your contact info . Thanks , Bill
Please be sure to send me an email regarding changes , and write them on the schedule .
Chris , I have some information regarding our payment to MPC that you and I discussed yesterday . Apparently we cut them a check for $19,937.35 ( or thereabouts) . The check no . is 9600043219 . The check was cut on 01/15/02 . MPC does not know why they received this payment . Rich Bruegger is my contact at MPC . Please let me know what I can do to help . Thanks , Bill
Mollie , Could you resend me the original with the attachment ? Thanks , Bill
Bert , This is good to know . Thank you for the update . Well done .
Group , Please put all information from the previous day ( ie printed dispatch , EPE preschedulng sheet ) into the appropriate folder on Kate Symes' old desk . Thanks , Bill
Theresa , Could you add DL-Portland Shift to this distribution . I would like the guys in Real-Time to be able to see this information when they come in . Thanks , Bill
Sure , The other members in the real-time group are: Ryan Slinger Holden Salisbury Bert Meyers Craig Dean Casey Anderson Mike Mier Thanks , Bill
John , Here are the remaining hourly traders . Bill Williams Ryan Slinger Holden Salisbury Bert Meyers Craig Dean Casey Anderson Mike Mier Let me know if you need anything else.. . Bill
Through Terminal Server ( 1) . Bill
Amy , I am interested in either position...as I imagine each person in the real-time group will be . Let me know if I can be of help with anything . Thanks , Bill
Tim , I will be available all week . Thank you for the opportunity , Bill
I forwarded this meeting to Casey . I will be out of the office . Stacey
Just FYI - Thu Pham Arnold does our Global Counterparty requests now . Stacey
These are fine . Hope all is well . Stacey
You can put John as your primary and me as your secondary . Stacey
I don't really like what they are suggesting either . We'll talk Monday . Besides , they(we ) would have to get AA to sign off on half MTM half something else . Stacey
Wasn't sure if you had heard anything about Donnie testing for EES and EnPower . I am not sure there is anything we need to do , just wanted to keep you in the loop . Stacey
Dave , Can you please approve or reject Samantha's request . If you are not comfortable approving it , then reject it so she can resubmit . When I went into the system today , it said it had already been assigned to you . Stacey
Did you send this to Kathy reeves ? She is in charge of Calgary's power risk management . Stacey
Have them go through accounting . This is non-trading expenses . Not our area unless it runs through the DPR . Stacey
What is the latest on this ? Stacey
Sounds good , I will abide . Stacey
Wasn't sure if you had gotten this answered , but there is really no reason that should want to see this . Stacey
I understand all the following except the Index-Option . Why would it be treated as a Spread-Option ? Stacey
Where did she get this information ? Is it a below the line adjustment ( not in the DPR) ? Stacey
Thank you ! Stacey
Thanks ! Stacey
It was wonderful . Not so excited to be back - I'm sure it will get better as the week goes on . How was your flight ? Did you feel safer ? They want me to go on the London Doorstep in November , so I was just wondering . Stacey
All I ever saw was the e-mail from the Office of the Chair . Stacey
Here is Thursday's data: Broker Deal ID Enron Entity Portfolio Trader Deal Date Deal Start Date Deal End Date Total Deal Volume Chris Mallory Count 7 Diana Scholtes Count 2 Holden Salisbury Count 2 Matt Motley Count 4 Mike Swerzbin Count 1 Phil Platter Count 1 Sean Crandall Count 1 Tom Alonso Count 1 Grand Count 19
The file is in O:\_Dropbox\Stacey\Quarterly Comparison.xls Let me know when you get the file so we can make sure it will work for you . Thanks , Stacey
yes
I agree with this request . Stacey
The blending vs . non-blending can be confusing and could potentially cause problems down the road so I would first like to make some general statements regarding the history or this change and what the rules should be as I understand them . Only the curves applicable to the East NERC regions are being marked as a daily and monthly volatility; therefore , no blending is needed for daily options ( they point directly to the daily vols ) or monthly options ( they point directly to the monthly vol) . All curves applicable to the West NERC regions are still being marked as intramonth and monthly; therefore , blending is needed to provide a volatility for daily options . The best rules to be in place for the blending vs . non-blending would be based on curve . East curves do not blend . West curves do blend . Therefore , ANY daily or monthly option in the East would not have to blend . The potential problem that could be caused by making the rule apply to portfolios is that , for example , the East portfolio could potentially enter into an option at a West region ( curve ) and that transaction would need to use blended curves even though it is in the East portfolio . Options at a different expiry than daily or monthly is another problem . Are there different blending rules embedded in the code for weekly expiration ? We still need to discuss this . I would be happy to all sit down and have a meeting concerning this issue whenever everyone is comfortable enough that we know all the current rules . Let me know . Stacey
I will talk to Tim re: Jeff Richter's Schedule C reserve and get back to you . Stacey
Lavorato is asking why Jeff Richter still has $25MM of reserve associated to him since he has moved to EES ? How would you like me to handle this question ? Thanks , Stacey
What was it ?
Can you let them know you will be doing this . Stacey
We will be having a staff meeting today . If we can start at 12:15 rather than 12:00 that would be great because I have an 11:00 meeting . John , What is the phone number where we can reach you ? Sorry I do not have an itinerary . I would like to go over Doorstep findings and anything else you would like to fill me in on since we have not met in a while . Stacey
Thanks for doing all the work ! Stacey
Can you take a look at this report for the West and make sure it is correct . Thanks , Stacey
Question re: Jeff Richter Stacey
Sounds like a great idea to do follow-up reviews . I have budgeted $2000 a month for travel and lodging on the West RC . I would prefer you keep it to every six weeks in order to cover me coming up there and others coming down for training . I think it would be beneficial for you to be able to meet with groups in Houston . I also only budgeted for $100/month for Overtime/Working Meals so we may have to subsidize that with the traveling budget . I have not heard anything lately on the video conferencing . If you don't mind , ask Tim if he has made any decisions on the video conferencing . Stacey
Let's wait until we all meet so we don't piecemeal the data to you , but you are correct in your assumption about transmission for the East . Stacey
Let me know if this does not work . This is a report straight from the calculation engine so it is easy and fast to generate . Stacey
Are you still attending these meetings ? Stacey
Make sure you have my e-mail address as the full name Stacey.W.White@enron.com I don't know why they would be coming back . Hope you are doing well ! Stacey
Does this make sense to you ? Stacey
There were some conversations regarding getting the Index Option into RisktRAC . It may be that they are not there yet . Zhiyun was working with the RAC IT , she would know the latest . Stacey
When: Friday , October 19 , 2001 10:00 AM-11:00 AM ( GMT-06:00 ) Central Time ( US & Canada) . Where: EB3143B Please invite anyone I may have missed . Thanks , Stacey
Just wanted you to see this correspondence . Stacey
Can everyone please check the following files for the below requirements . Fill out anything you may know and cc: me on the response so I can figure out which ones are unaccounted for . Thanks , Stacey
I am still tracking down the Green Mountain documentation , but here is the documentation for LCRA . I'll forward the rest when I get it . Thanks , Stacey
SLACKER!! !
Who is your contact in Liquids ? Stacey
I was given your name by Kathy Reeves as a candidate who might know something about a book named C2-CAND-EGSC . See attached file below for instructions on what information is needed for the book . Thanks , Stacey White
Nick , I would like 3 red poinsettias . Thanks , Stacey
Casey should be contacting you to set up a time to talk . Thanks , Stacey
John , Are you currently preparing option sensitivity reports for Matt Motley ? If so , please put together a bullet point list of what we do on a daily basis , who the audience is , and anything else you think might be relevant to an audience of users interested in what procedures we perform for stress/ scenario testing . Thanks , Stacey
Which ancillary curves are you referring to ? Dana and Doug mark the Northeast and Ercot ancillaries and we do not have ancillaries for every curve . Stacey
I cannot think of anything that would cause this to be incorrect . Please let me know if you agree and I will bless the change . Thanks , Stacey
Do you still have a list of users who calculated their books at the end of September as 9/28 instead of 9/30 ? Stacey
Let's go ahead and make this change . We can think of no reason why this would cause a problem . If everyone could keep a close eye on this deal after the change , that will be most beneficial . Thanks , Stacey
Thank you so much for the invite . Just found this week I have to go to London for work and will be leaving on Nov . 2 . Have a wonderful time! ! Stacey
Can you send me ( or tell me where to access ) the matrix put together which defines the legal entity for each desk . Debbie Brackett informed me that the entities are not necessarily the 'legal' entity but something else and I need to help get to the bottom of this . Thanks , Stacey
Thank you !
This is exposure ( P&L and position ) by month , by region for New Power Company . Please let me know how often you need data like this . The numbers represented are as of 10/18/2001 . Thanks , Stacey
Who do you have working on this ? Stacey
Can you send me an example ? Stacey
I don't know where all those pictures are . We received them online , so I am sure they are lost . Donnie may have them . Remember , he was dressed as Austin Powers . Stacey
As long as Tim has conversations with Lavo and we get adequate documentation to share with accounting , we should be fine . Stacey
That is fine . She doesn't really care about the Schedule C stuff , she just wants to know that is going to come off of LTD . Stacey
Actually , I believe we got a hold of Kori and Erol last month before they officialized and they did it correctly . Stacey
Tanya , Kim mentioned to me that legal wanted by delivery point and financial/physical broken out , so here is an update . Numbers are still as of 10/18/2001 . Stacey
Casey , Can you remind me of all this ? Thanks , Stacey John , Good questions , when I figure it out I will add to the Month End Procedures . Stacey
Are you setting up a meeting ? Stacey
Cost Center 103823 should have 6% allocated to West Power ( not 13% ) and 94% allocated to East Power . Thanks , Stacey
Tom , Hope this helps . 1 ) Only the power positions need to be queried . Gas positions for spread options and heat rates are included in the gas bench . 2 ) Any power Exchange transactions should be included , but the gas transactions calculated in ERMT should not be included as they are on the gas bench . Thanks , Stacey
The risk group should be able to help you coordinate this request . Stacey White
What day ?
I have a meeting tomorrow from 10:30-11:30 . I do not have anything else until 2:00 . Stacey
Why would this person need Read/Write to m:\common\power I typically only grant access for Write capabilities to Risk . Stacey
Can you or someone else ask her why she requested m:\common\power Read/Write ? Stacey
Thanks !
good luck
I am sorry to be difficult and you can definitely have a meeting without me and fill me in later , but the all-employee meeting is today and I have been asked to be there by Bob . In addition , I have a work lunch headed by Sally to discuss the all-employee meeting . Sorry again , Stacey
Yes - I travel to Portland on a regular basis and access the network from the hotel . I also I am a member of the 'Emergency Weather Plan' team meaning that I have to simulate my computer at work from home in case my group ( Power Risk Management ) cannot get to the building . Stacey White
We'll take care of it . Welcome back ! Stacey
Can one of you make sure LT-SERC is still an active book ( if not , have it reactivated ) and coordinate with TJae regarding the EOL ID . John may still be set up in EnPower , I am not sure that his access was ever taken away , but we need to have his trader ID attached to LT-SERC . Let me know if you have any questions . Stacey
When: Tuesday , October 23 , 2001 12:00 PM-1:00 PM ( GMT-06:00 ) Central Time ( US & Canada) . Where: EB3143C We will begin having weekly download/discussion sessions starting the week after next . This meeting will be mandatory and you should not send a substitute unless approved by me . If the day and time do not work with your schedule please let me know so we can coordinate our calendars . Thanks , Stacey
Sorry I had to cancel , a meeting was put on my calendar that I cannot miss . Stacey
How much money are we talking ? Re: AA , they will need explanation as to the amount . Georgeanne is typically involved in all Schedule C discussion with them . Stacey
Martin , I have both a toll tag and a parking transponder . My toll tag # is 00136756 . Please let me know what else I need to do . Thanks , Stacey White
No , I just noticed that we hadn't had a staff meeting in a while and next week is month end and the next week I will not be here . Casey is out on Friday and have back to back meetings tomorrow . Make your commitment to DHA and we'll update you on the staff meeting . Stacey
There is no attachment . Stacey
Just wondered if anyone has noticed any change in EnPower performance ? See e-mail below . Stacey
Can you get with Doug and show him what documentation we do have for Green Mountain ? Also , have you requested from Anita Luong the documentation we sent them for Green Mountain's Schedule C . Thanks , Stacey
Sorry , I thought I did this yesterday . Can you give me the latest on the reconciliation ? Stacey
Can you take care of this ? Stacey
Congratulations US Citizen ! You have to set up a new book ( see the other Spreadsheet books for naming convention) . Can't wait to discuss all this . Stacey
When: Thursday , October 25 , 2001 10:30 AM-11:30 AM ( GMT-06:00 ) Central Time ( US & Canada) . Where: call-in 853-1870 I am also sending you a forward of a meeting I am supposed to have with Scotty Gilbert and Jeff Richter tomorrow - hope you can join us . Stacey
I will not be there until 4:00 . Stacey
I really am in the dark re: Hanson . If you could make the rounds then we might have a better idea if Donnie should be there . If Scotty does not know all the particulars ( and Jeff does ) I am not sure that the 9:30 PST meeting will be effective . I basically just want some answers ! Stacey
Here is an updated New Power Company exposure as of 10-24 . I have included Buy/Sell , Deal Type , and Capacity/Commodity . Please let me know if there is any other detail you need . Stacey
Jason , I am aware of the risk being taken regarding the old Sun machines moving to the new building . Specifically , they may not work once taken out of commission . I am also willing to take this risk and request that the current machines the power risk group operates on should accompany them to the new building . Thanks , Stacey
No formal agenda has been planned for our staff meeting today . Instead , I would like for each of you to think of a question(s ) or problem(s ) that you have encountered while in the group . These questions/problems can be something that you already know the answer to or have yet to receive the answer . For those areas that you already know the answer , this would be a good time to share what you have been working on with the rest of the group and maybe stop everyone else from running into the same question/problem . For those areas that you do not the answer , we will do our best to get that answered . In addition , if there is any additional detail that you would like to know regarding topics covered in the Risk Overview class , this would be a good time to ask since the class is fresh on your minds . Thanks , Stacey & Casey
Maria , What information are you trying to obtain through m:\common\power ? Sorry for all the questions , but everyone requesting this directory gets them as this directory contains extremely sensitive information . Thanks , Stacey
James , Just a quick note and request regarding our UK & Continental Power Doorstep review we will be performing . Please provide a list of books , curves and deal types used for UK & Continental Power . In addition , please send information on any large , structured , out of the norm transactions and any transactions that are calculated outside of the core trading system . Please provide this information early next week . Look forward to seeing you . Stacey
We will not be there next week so that should be fine . Are the complex derivatives group and 'structured book' run by Paul Darcy the same thing ? If yes , then we are planning on reviewing that area . Should I contact Paul Darcy directly ? If no , what is the complex derivatives group ? Thanks , Stacey
Sorry I left you off the first distribution . Stacey
Please release the new version of PL Desk to production . Thanks , Stacey
The power curves are actually located in M:\power2\region If you want access to this drive please resubmit request and make sure it is Read Only . Thanks , Stacey
I cannot view this request in eRequest . Please approve on my behalf or remedy the problem of seeing the request and I will approve myself . Stacey
Do we have any transactions with these counterparties similar to Hanson ? Stacey
Tim , I typically do not like to give access to m:\common\power\ directory as this is where all the DPR information is . A member of your fundamentals team , Maria Van Houton , would like access to the drive in order to access curve data that the risk group puts together . If this is o.k . with you I will approve , otherwise I will tell her to get the information from the curve directory m:\power2\region . Thanks , Stacey
How many times are you going to publish the P&L today ? ( just a joke - is everything o.k.? ) Stacey
I was incorrect about Alberta ENA , it should be zero but where is Alberta ? It should have a big position . Stacey
Yes . Stacey
Michael , Can you remind me who all gets these reports ? Stacey
Thanks
Keith , Here are the procedures for the East . The West is not currently running option sensitivities . Approximately every one to two weeks or as requested by the options traders an option sensitivity report is run using PortCalc . Three parameters are tested: Price ( increments from -5 to +5) , monthly Volatility ( increments from -25% to +25%) , and Time ( increments up to 90 days . ( Reminder: the increments are changeable ) The data is imported from PortCalc into an Excel pivot table . The pivot table is then used to show how the various Greeks ( delta , gamma , theta and Vega ) change for each trader's book , generally with a 3 month look ahead . The data can also be sorted by and grouped by other criteria , if requested , such as by region and delivery date These reports are given to the East option traders only . Thanks , Stacey
Sorry I haven't responded very timely . Things have been hectic at work . I am looking forward to seeing you tomorrow . Russell said you would be in around 6-7 , is this right ? What kind of food do you want to eat , Russell suggested a Mexican food place , is this o.k . with you ? Stacey
FYI
I hope all is well with you ! Kristin , Mike and I will be arriving in London Saturday , November 3 . We will be there through the next Saturday , leaving early that morning . Can't wait to see you . Any exciting news ? How's work , social life , etc . Stacey
Any calc will do . When testing , please do not write over AdHoc , I need to pull some information from there . Stacey
Just a reminder to forward Martha the cash flow request . Thanks , Stacey
Can you make sure that your group starts using the new & improved request form . See m:\common\power\riskmgmt\admin\Requests & Request Templates\Blank Book Request Enpower.xls Thanks , Stacey
I was not sure if you wanted exposure by asset , liability or absolute value so I provided the top 25 assets and top 25 liabilities . Hope this helps . Stacey
Who was your surgeon for lasik surgery ? Would you recommend ? I am planning on getting surgery next year and have to make my benefit elections to cover . Thanks , Stacey
All your suggestions sound good . Thanks for being on top of the personnel issues ! Thanks again , Stacey
Geoff , Here is all my data: Worst Case - my husband's pager - 281-264-9294 If you need anything else , please let me know . Stacey
I thought we already told them to exclude those portfolios?? ? Stacey
Yeah - are you still going on vacation ? Stacey
I was working on getting the right sign-off before I approved or denied . I should know no later than tomorrow . Stacey
You can go ahead and send it to me as I am sure I will be performing the review at some point . Thanks , Stacey
Just curious , what was Nick doing when he visited Houston the beginning of November . Just wondering , because I didn't know he was here . Stacey
OK - I believe that is when I was gone , now that you mention it . Stacey
If you get a chance , give me a call . Can't wait to hear all the London scoop ! I hope you are well despite this disaster . Stacey
I heard you got information on Monica . Could you forward it to me ? Thanks , Stacey
I'm all right . In denial a little because I really do not want to work anywhere else , but oh well ! How are you ? Did you get a chance to talk to Monica ? I hope they are o.k . Stacey
Here you go . Sorry for the delay . Please let me know what else I can do . The file is subtotaled to include Peak and Off-peak together . It includes both positions and current MTM as of last night . Stacey White
Have you turned in my expense report ? Do you need my Amex bill ? Stacey
Thanks . Stacey
I'll let you know if I hear anything . I have absolutely no idea at this point . Stacey
I have no contractors . Stacey
As of right now this is the plan for the killed transactions: Please use the attached spreadsheet that indicates the prior day changes in your rolls . Then compare these actual changes to the projected changes in the spreadsheet below . As of tonight , please top-level all prior day changes and we will tackle tomorrow . Also , remember that traditionally you would have no financial prior days on the first business day , so the financial prior days showing up in your rolls are due to killed financial transactions . These amounts should also be top-leveled . Thanks , Stacey
When does she leave ? Stacey
Please make sure you cc: me on all requests that you send out to credit , VaR , etc for the banks . If you are not sending something via e-mail and you are just giving information over the phone . Please send me the information as well . Thanks , Stacey
I was in a meeting last night to discuss who was critical . I do not know if that list has been blessed . The list we put together would definitely get us a through especially since we will not have all the old deals . Your normal contacts should be there - Norman , Zhiyun , Min , Duong Luu , Will Smith . Stacey
That is bizarre . They may have sent everyone home and called them back . I will investigate tomorrow . Stacey
Can you give me a final list of the EnPower support that still exists so that we can have a good contact list ? Thanks , Stacey
Can you look in to this for me ? Stacey
Where is the DPOS folder ? Stacey
Do you think Min would be able to help ? Stacey
Can you unarchive m:\common\power\position\dpr\1999 and as far back as there are years in this directory . Stacey
Min should be able to help you with your excel request . Stacey
Have you been in contact with him ? Stacey
He would definitely be going to clean-up if we start the new company . If we do not start the new company he would be the first person laid off . What kind of contract is he under ? Stacey
I have no idea how the contracts are being handled . If he is that unhappy he should talk to Billy Lemmons ( the associate HR rep) . Stacey
Here is my request: Can you make the system calculate a killed deal ? There were deals killed with Sempra Energy Trading on Saturday and the credit group needs to know what the value would have been had these deals been calculated against yesterday's curves . Basically , we need to calc all Sempra deals that were killed Saturday or later as of last night . Is this possible ? Thanks , Stacey
The LT-Option book should have a prior day of +226,703.43 . Please include this in the spreadsheet I sent out yesterday . It is a Constellation deal that was not killed.' Thanks , Stacey
I have Norman running a calc on the Sempra transactions . He was able to set up a special calc to calc the killed deals . When he is able to give you the values , will you call Dave Forster @ 3-1861 and let him know the values . I will be in meetings from 1:30 - 4:30 . Thanks , Stacey
Good to hear !
I had received this from Chris Abel . Maybe it will be beneficial . Stacey
Please provide access to the following individuals: Thanks , Stacey
This is the latest on our status of calculating and reporting the DPR . Rick Buy , our chief risk officer , asked that we get back to normal as soon as possible . I am currently working on termination statuses and when deals will be killed etc . I am also working on a way to get the PCS cleaned up . Continue to run the calc with the true-up flag off as this will cause more confusion than it is worth . Thanks , Stacey
No problem . Do not worry about my previous requests . Stacey
I was comparing the 'Position by Trader PRINT' tab in WestPos to the VaR report ( Nov . 26 for example) . I would hope the rules for carrying over a week will still apply , but I have not heard anything concrete . I'll see what I can find out . Stacey
Those are funny . Work is hectic , can't write much , but hope to find a time that you can come visit . Stacey
thanks
Any specific reason we need two different portfolios ? Stacey
James' birthday party is that Saturday . Before I knew that I was thinking of going home . Stacey
Please see the bottom of this e-mail for the original values given to Andrea for this exercise . At the time , we had not broken out East & West and only had a total value . My issue is that the original values do not tie to the values were are seeing today . Just to be sure , the calcs we are running should include all Sempra deals killed on or after Saturday , Dec . 1 . Can you please advise as to which numbers are correct . Thanks , Stacey
I had forwarded your message to HR and had not heard anything . However , I just went to yahoo and was reading an article that says the website is careerservices@enron.com but that it is not currently in operation . Good luck , Stacey
The LT-SW book was not officialized last night . I have officialized it this morning . We still need to be careful regarding officializations for credit purposes . Stacey
Will , If you could attempt the following report I would greatly appreciate it . I have given a best efforts try in report writer , but because I am pulling MTM value it is pulling every strip . I need all options by flowing from today forward for the East and West portfolios . I need deal date , start date , end date , premium , strike price , Monthly/Daily Option indicator , MTM value from AdHoc , Buy/Sell , Counterparty , Enron Entity , Call/Put , Deal Type , Region . Thanks so much , Stacey Call me tomorrow when I can start working - 281-894-0468 .
The option query that we ran this morning does not tie back to AdHoc . I first realized it when I was trying to clean up deals that had many strips . There were instances where the P&L and delta were not consistent for every strip so I looked in AdHoc to see which number was right and that is when I started noticing inconsistencies . Could you please query the P&L and Delta for the following deal numbers in spreadsheet . The only way I have to do this is to query each deal separately in AdHoc . Your help would be greatly appreciated . Stacey Phone numbers where I can be reached: Thanks , Stacey
I have consolidated the changes in the following file: Please change the trade date on all the newly created Bankruptcy Deals to the trade date of the original deal . Also , please cross-reference in both transactions the associated deals numbers and document that the deal numbers are due to termination . Also , check with Will Smith to make sure he has completed the Allegheny transfers ( they were missed in the initial batch run ) and then re-calc the 'Termination Test' portcalcs to ensure that the designated counterparties are not included in the old portfolios . Also , check with Norman or Zhiyun to ensure that they have attached the port-calc code to the Bankruptcy portfolios and then we need to make test runs on them as well . Thanks , Stacey
Can you please work on attaching the portcalc code to the Bankruptcy Portfolios first thing Monday morning . Please reply to this e-mail when it is complete so we can begin testing the transactions we moved . Thanks , Stacey P.S . Zhiyun , Thank you so much for the option data . Stacey
Melissa , Can you please attach the effective termination dates to your physical and financial termination lists . We have yet to touch December , and need these dates before we can start . Thanks , Stacey
The most updated termination lists are in the following files: They are saved in m:\riskmgt\stacey\special projects\ Stacey
When you are done with the script please call Casey and John . Thanks , Stacey
Could you have someone put together the trader performance spreadsheet for November ? Thanks , Stacey
have you sent it to frank ?
Thought you might need to know some of these names . Stacey
Frank , Please ensure that Israel Estrada receives his previous access for IT purposes . He was mistakenly removed on Friday . Stacey
Please split up the following list and change the deal date back to the original deal date . Thanks , Stacey
I don't . Stacey
Call me tomorrow so we can discuss the following: Employee morale Terminations with cash already paid Other terminations to ensure they are not affecting downstream systems Scheduling cuts Thanks , Stacey
Corry , I would love to start the process of cleaning up the scheduling system . We will need help from the schedulers as well so can you send Duong Luu their logins and request the 'Zero Volumes' application in EnPower . There are many people asking about what is flowing and the month is creeping by so if you could get with me tomorrow to make a game plan that would be great . I think we should have the schedulers send us their spreadsheets with an explanatory and then we , along with Unify users , will come up with a plan . I hope to use the schedulers in this process as well , let me know your thoughts . Thanks , Stacey
We are going to Cuero this weekend so will not be in for Sunday brunch . Sorry I will miss it . Stacey
Will , Please run the 2002 script for Coral Power , L.L.C . Let me know when you are done . Stacey
One question: I had Melissa Murphy put together the termination dates for each of the counterparties and was wondering if you could clarify something for me . If a termination date is 12/4/2001 , do I move 12/4 forward to the bankrupt book or do I move 12/5 forward to the bankrupt book ? Thanks , Stacey
I spoke with this recruiter on the phone and told her I would forward the information to our accounting group . I was not sure who all in your group was part of the layoffs and thought you might be able to forward them this information . Stacey
Elsie , I put the 11/30 strip back in the deal . The "884449 in bankruptcy" does refer to another deal that we created due to Aquila terminating transactions with us . The reason you cannot see it is because you probably do not have access to the new portfolio . Stacey
FYI
Wasn't sure if you had seen this website . Hope your searches are going well . Stacey
I am waiting for an answer back from Elizabeth , but was wondering if you or any of your contacts might know the answer to the following . Thanks , Stacey
Yes , you will do normal calculation tonight . In addition , either today or tomorrow , please also calculate the Bankruptcy Portfolio . Export data from both West and Bankruptcy Portfolio by Counterparty and Physical/Financial . Compare the data to the Termination Lists . All counterparties on the termination list should be included in Bankruptcy Portfolio and all other counterparties should be in the West portfolio . If you notice discrepencies , please investigate and correct . Also , Will is still changing some deals that Casey sent him an e-mail on . Do you know if this affected the West ? If so , you will need to wait until he is complete . Stacey
Due to problems with the gas curves there will be incorrect credit information for TXU , Calpine and Indeck Pepperel Power Assoc . out of EnPower ( these counterparties have spread options and/or heat rate swaps that utilize the gas curves. ) If you need these transaction re-calced in the morning please contact Andrea Dahlke and X 5-4080 . Thanks , Stacey
The gas curve problems have been solved; therefore , there will be no problems with the following counterparties . Stacey
Do your gas books have any gas deals left ? There were 23,000 deals missed in the 'kill exercise' performed by IT . If you have deals left , please re-calc tomorrow to see if they go away . If you have no deals , then you are done ! Stacey
John , This file gives you similar information to the file that Jeff sent you for gas . Frank is using it to continue investigating what went wrong with the extraction from the VaR model . If you want me to change anything , let me know . Thanks , Stacey
We technically should have no third party transactions . If we do , we need to move them to the NG-Price book . Please let me know if this is the case . Also , Casey & I will be both be out of the office tomorrow . If you need someone in Houston to help get questions answered please call Andrea . Thanks , Stacey
Here is the file I started . I know there is plenty of missing data because I did not know all the commodities involved with each counterparty . If you could fill in what you know , that would be a big head start on this heinous project . I will be out of the office tomorrow . My cell phone works again so I will be available . Have a great weekend . Thanks , Stacey
I will be out of the office tomorrow and out of town this weekend . If an emergency arises , please try the following numbers: Have a great weekend !
The bankruptcy post ids are as follows: Let me know what else I can do . Stacey
got it ! Hope everything is going well . Stacey
When you get a chance , give me an update on this . Stacey
Yes , I can get BPA volumes . What is it for ? Stacey
When: Monday , December 17 , 2001 2:30 PM-3:30 PM ( GMT-06:00 ) Central Time ( US & Canada) . Where: My desk
What did today's look like ? Do we still have the same problems in power ? Stacey
Thanks for the offer , I have a Dr's appt . Maybe later this week . Mid C is R9 , but WSCC-N is R8 . A 'B' indicates a basis curve which WSCC-N is not . Have you talked to Bruce from Chase re: these files ? Stacey
Just wanted to make sure you had the latest files of terminated counterparties .
Please split the following deals into their respective pre and post bankruptcy desks: Counterparty Name Trades Terminated Early Termination Date Thanks , Stacey
The post ids for the bankruptcy books will be: They are running right now . They take approximately 30 minutes so should be complete at 9:45 . If you are not seeing numbers , call Andrea Dahlke X5-4080 . I am running to a dentist appointment this morning , and will be back shortly . Stacey
Attached is a spreadsheet with marks as of 12/18/2001 . If you need anything else , please let me know . Stacey White
I am not sure why these did not show up yesterday , maybe my query was incorrect . However , the following spreadsheet contains terminated counterparties that still show up in the West portfolio . Let me know that you have or have not corrected it . Thanks , Stacey
We are in town so count us in . I am TOTALLY planning on getting loaded ( on munchies) . Stacey
Melissa , I was told that Grant County was also terminated and is on Kim's list , but I have not seen it on our updated master power list . Can you let me know the status of this counterparty . Thanks , Stacey
Debbie , The bankruptcy post ids for 12-18 are 15296 and 15297 . The data should be available first thing in the morning . Norman is running the calcs for me because I was receiving error messages . Stacey Norman , If the post ids change or the data is not available by morning please reply to all to let us know the status . Thanks , Stacey
In addition to running the East and West portfolio calculations we will also be running the bankruptcy books on a daily basis . These should be run as 'Official AdHoc Full Book' but NOT OFFICIALIZED . The post id numbers should be e-mailed to Debbie Brackett , Stephanie McGinnis and John Powell before you leave for the evening . Thanks , Stacey
We will be running a December MTD DPR tomorrow . Before we start this process please recalc the East , West , Eastbank , & Westbank portfolios to AdHoc . Check one more time that only terminated counterparties are in the Bank portfolios and all terminated counterparties are out of the East and West portfolios . Before kicking off the calcs , double check the specific deals that are listed on the Physical Power Terminated spreadsheet . I believe there were whole deals moved to the Bank portfolios by Will that should never have been moved , because they were already liquidated in November . Also , I have attached a new copy of the physical terminations . There is one counterparty ( TXU ) added to the list that we need to take care of before kicking off the calcs . In addition to adjusting deal entry for TXU we also need to adjust scheduling . Before recalcing the Bank portfolios , please contact Debbie Brackett or Stephanie McGinnis ( 4-2022 ) to make sure that they have extracted the data they need from the portfolios . We should still be calcing on 'No True-up' . Casey , I know you said this probably will still cause us trouble . At this point , we are going for reasonableness with numbers . All the previous top-levels in our rolls ( as of the 3rd or 4th ) will stay as top-levels until we know the exact amount of cash that is being attributed to power . The remaining prior day values will be held in Schedule E for Georgeanne to move to a balance sheet account . These top levels should match the total value of your Bankruptcy portfolios . Where I think it will get tricky is that we are calculating as of the 18th and have transactions in the Bankruptcy portfolio that are before the 18th and therefore will fall into your liquidations . These numbers will also have to moved to Schedule E . When running through liquidations in the East and West portfolios , we will not be flat . Currently , we are liquidating all non-terminated counterparties other than those specifically negotiated out of by scheduling . ( Thresa and I are working on this with Corry and Cara) . The settlements group will figure out what the counterparty agrees with through the check-out and ultimately the clean-up process . Tomorrow should be a blast - I can't wait!! ! Stacey
What are you talking about ? Stacey
Let me know if anything sticks out as peculiar . Stacey
How do we want to go about this ? Stacey
This is the latest list I have received . I will forward you any updates . Stacey
You suck !
Dana , Here are the values of the annuities in the book as of 12/18/2001 . These annuities represent amounts UI paid to Enron for the specified PPA's taken on during the transaction . Stacey Deal # Description Amount The following list represents other values associated with Resco , Derby and Shelton . Deal # Description Amount 257449.4 Receipt of capacity Shelton $ 49,488 I have also attached a file with UI current deal numbers and comments attached to those deals , thought it might help . Stacey
Good News!! ! The termination spreadsheets have been updated . There are three new counterparties for physical and one new counterparty for financial . Will Smith has moved a new version of Deal Liquidation into stage for us to use going forward . It incorporates both his script for moving deals to Bankruptcy books and splitting deals on their termination dates . Please look at this so we can use it on our updates . Stacey
I have put this file together for our investigation . Have to run to a meeting , can discuss later . Stacey
I ran deal data for the counterparties we received termination notification on today . I did not want to start moving deals while you were running calcs , so we can just do this tomorrow . The deals are on the 'East New as of 12-19' and the 'West New as of 12-19' tabs . Stacey P.S . Don't forget about Will's new application in stage . Stacey
Please forward to the following: Nick Hiemstra Ed Baughman Naveed Ahmed The request is for the East and West portfolios ( non-terminated) . Don't forget to include Capacity and show separately in queries . By Portfolio , by Counterparty , by Category Code - P&L and delta by month . Also send a P&L update to Elizabeth Sager and Don Miller . The original files are 'East by Counterparty' and 'West by Counterparty' . Stacey
This is the latest draft of pre-bankruptcy pay-outs . I have put all the information I have , please add any that you may know . Have a Merry Christmas !
I spoke to Tim today regarding the prepayment transactions with terminated counterparties . He constructed this e-mail in response . Hope this clarifies . Have a Merry Christmas , Stacey
Just wanted you to be aware of our concerns regarding Min Zheng . He is our Excel support and is called upon on a daily basis for help . Thanks , Stacey
I have another meeting at this time . Can we reschedule or can I send someone else ? Stacey
Have you seen documentation on these counterparties ? Stacey
We have many deals in the system with UI , but they are all part of one contract . To my knowledge , this is the only big contract we have with them . Just wanted to let you know because going through all the deals would be time consuming and they basically are one huge deal . Stacey
No I had another meeting at this time . Stacey
See point 2 below - just wanted you to be on the lookout for MidAmerican . Stacey
One more to look for . Stacey
Fran , Congratulations ! I can't believe you didn't call and tell me . Can't wait to see the ring . Stacey
Thank you regarding Min . He does an extreme amount of work for us and I believe going forward we will need more rather than less of Excel type reports . Stacey
Melissa , Here are some more . Just keeping you in the loop . Stacey
Min , I am so happy that you were moved to the Netco list . Thank you for all your hard work and the efforts you have put forth to learn our needs and react quickly to them . I look forward to working with you in the future . Stacey
Melissa , Can you find out if this Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement covers all our deals with TXU ? Stacey
Melissa , Here are some more to investigate ! Stacey
One more forward of terminated counterparties . Won't promise this will be the last . Stacey
Now that Will has been cleaning out scheduling tables , will you ensure that the prepays in the document below are still in the scheduling system . If they are not , we can autoschedule them . Thanks , Stacey
Thank you
Please review and let me know if I have misrepresented any counterparties . If you want me to add comments , send them to me and I will incorporate . Thanks , Stacey David , Just to make sure you know , the Power Physical Terminated Transactions spreadsheet , is put together by Melissa from information she has received from Master Log and other . This is our primary source for moving transactions into the bankruptcy book as she review to ensure that the contracts terminated cover all our trades . Thanks , Stacey
Let me know how I can help . Stacey
Here is the latest Master . It is kind of a cluster . The easiest way to pick out power is to set an AutoFilter and look at Enron Entity column . Stacey
Can one of you resend me the unarchive shortcut to 2000 data ? Stacey
As of now I should have no employees on the Estate list . Israel Estrada was on the list previously , but we have moved him to Power Global Rates in Netco . Stacey
Fine by me .
Go ahead and include counterparties on our power list even if they do not have any outstanding trades . That way , if anyone is comparing our lists later on their will be no discrepancy and they won't have to ask us again . Thanks for all the other information . Stacey
I believe two of you is fine . We have stopped our rotation in the East and will have lots of work to do re: setting up books , continuing with terminations etc . Until it becomes evident , continue on . Stacey
We have been officializing every day and the information is obviously as good as the curves . Every other Friday is just as good as any other day . Stacey
They are rotating one person out a day starting Monday . We will not be setting up the West books . I would like to meet with you and Casey Monday morning if possible . You can still be at home as long as we can call you . Stacey
Would 10:00 our time work ? Stacey
I am not personally interested in any positions currently . Thank you , Stacey White
I can meet Tuesday anywhere from 9:00 to 3:00 ( the meeting would have to end at 3:00 because I have a Dr's appt.) . Wednesday , I am totally open . Stacey
This looks good . I originally had a headcount of 11 . If you added one to my headcount , then I agree . Stacey
Wonder if he knows this ? Stacey
Please let me know your thoughts on the following correspondence . We are in the process of putting together our integration plan and the interest rate curve is one of our biggest stumbling blocks since the interest rate group will not be going to NEWCO . As you can see , your name has been volunteered and I need to know what all you will need access to in order to get this curve to the Risk Management groups on a timely ( preferably 2:00 p.m. ) basis . Thanks , Stacey
Casey and John can get back to you on your specific question re: Canada . However , I wanted to let you know that our DPR will more than likely not be final until Friday . Hopefully we can get you all reports then . We have had to leave the DPR open due to many terminations that are still funneling our way and we are getting the 12-31 data as clean as possible for the estate . Stacey
I know of nothing in stage that I use . I would like to make sure Casey and John both agree with me . Stacey
Looks good - you mention month-end deadlines . You also might want to mention the work that goes on during month-end close and how that could potentially affect trading P&L . Stacey
You can contact Leslie Reeves for this information . Stacey
Please find attached the Integration Plan for Power Risk Management . If you need this information consolidated or expanded just let me know . Thanks , Stacey
Casey , Can you have someone follow up with Hai and Harry and see how all these reports are working ? Stacey
Let me know if this is not what you need . Stacey
Why is there still a financial position in the East portfolio for UI ? Stacey
This is coming from Kathy Reeves . Give her a call . Stacey
I have already updated the Physical and Financial Terminated spreadsheets with these updates . Please have your groups start the split/clean-up scheduling process for the new counterparties . Stacey
Here is the latest results from our valuation engine . Please let me know if you see any mistakes . We will update with your newest changes tomorrow , so you can exclude those from your evaluation . I also noticed that their is a financial UI transaction . I believe this was just an oversite and have asked Casey to look into it . Thanks , Stacey
After talking to Tom I have a new plan of attack for Schedule E's . He informed me that the top-levels were typically put in at one region level per roll . I had Zhiyun re-run the killed deals calc ( post id 15667) . Everyone should go back into the rolls and put the top-levels into their correct regions also adjusting the Schedule E's . This is why the differences are so large in certain areas and the only way we can start to pinpoint the problem is to find the problem spots . I have also identified where the $4.6 MM difference for OPPD arose from . Deal # 11678.04 has not been transferred into the East Bank book . In addition , there are no volumes in this deals; however , if you look back to the official 11/30/2001 calc there are volumes for this deal . It gets more bizarre than that because there were two deals that should have been transferred for OPPD ( 11678.4 , and 564826.1) . Deal 564826.1 was transferred but the valuations are approximately $4MM different . I have printed detail for deals 11678.4 and 564826.1 ( they are in Casey's chair ) as of the 11/30/2001 official calc . I have also printed deal 564826.1 in the 11/30/2001 bankruptcy calc . I noticed that I cannot see any swap detail reports for the bankruptcy calc . Please re-calc and generate these reports as they will probably be important as we dig into details . Other than Andrea who has to perform some IT testing , no one should be working ( or playing ) on anything other than trying to get these Schedule E's and top-levels figured out . The task is actually very important as there will be many decisions made off of these numbers . Thanks , Stacey
I have two other meetings at this time . Stacey
The e-mail was sent on 1/3/2002 , but the detail states that "TXU Energy Trading Company should be considered terminated effective December 2 , 2001 by reason of an automatic termination provision in the agreement between TXU and EPMI" . The e-mail does not give any details on ENA , ECC , of EES . Stacey
Just make sure this is OK . Stacey
This is possible . Probably won't be until tomorrow . Stacey
Thanks - Merry Christmas !
Do you need any help ? Stacey
Tim , John's communication regarding not updating December was in order to complete December liquidations for accounting and settlements last week . However , we were then informed that settlements would not draft their billing until the 14th of January so we then retracted our 'hold' on updating December schedule . Any updates that can be made in order for settlements to get the most accurate data would be most appreciated . In addition , the cash flow forecast ( as indicated by Don ) will be coordinated through Kristin . I do not believe you will have to do any work for this as all the data will come from our risk calculations and true settlement information . Thanks , Stacey
The users I would start with are: Todd Warwick Frank Cernosek Stacey
Don , Could you have someone send me the newest list of counterparties ( both East & West ) that we are still performing with . Thanks , Stacey
We are through the 'As of 1-7' tabs . Stacey
When: Thursday , January 10 , 2002 2:30 PM-3:30 PM ( GMT-06:00 ) Central Time ( US & Canada) . Where: Sonia can you set up on 5 in new building Sonia , It looks like you have a meeting from 2-4 , so can you send me any documentation that you may have done re: any seating arrangements in the new building . Thanks , Stacey
login: swhite
Please don't forget to send this to us so we will have a record . Stacey
Let me know if you need anything else . Stacey
Do you know if the rest of these auto-terminations apply to all deals we have with this counterparties , or just certain deals ? Please look into them and let me know as soon as possible . Stacey
When: Thursday , January 10 , 2002 4:30 PM-5:00 PM ( GMT-06:00 ) Central Time ( US & Canada) . Where: ECS05102
As soon as we finish calcing our book on Friday , we should be good to go . We will start as soon as possible .
Each of you needs to send a book request for the East & West portfolios for the counterparties listed in the following spreadsheet . The spreadsheet identifies those counterparties which we are still performing under the contracts . Please create a East-Performance and a West-Performance book . We then need to get all deals with the following counterparties moved to those books . I would suggest you pull the values out of AdHoc as of 12/31 for the counterparties by desk before transferring them to the new desk . Obviously these transactions will create prior days and the amount will run through the P&L in the old and new books and flatten out . The remaining prior day value will need to be in Schedule E . Stacey
I have not recompared the Master Log to the 'Physical Terminated' spreadsheet . This is just an update of my initial review . Any comments would be appreciated . I have also not included the Auto Terminations that we found out about today . After tomorrow's updates , I will do these . We are planning on moving the auto-terminations identified by David and confirmed by Kimberly to the bankruptcy book tomorrow . If anyone has a problem with the counterparties identified , please let me know as soon as possible Thanks , Stacey
Please start the following task in the morning: Using the Official 11-30 calcs that you exported deal summaries from , add the following counterparty's MTM by desk: Constellation Energy Authority Sempra Energy Trading Public Service of Colorado I believe the calc that identified our top-levels had extra transactions or values that did not fall out of our books . Once you have figured out the total for the above counterparties compare them to your top-levels . Thanks , Stacey
I have to run , but call me tomorrow . I have an idea of what your difference might be caused from . Stacey
Are the numbers in Canadian $'s ? If so , can you send me conversions . Thanks , Stacey
Thanks
The orig trading books can be set up at a later date . It should be a while before we have any activity of that sort . We ran financial liquidations because we have not had any additions to the financial terminations . I am working on one more big set of counterparties who had auto-termination language in their master agreements . I vote we catch up with all the information we have as of today and then run liquidations on Monday . What do you guys think ? Stacey
Sonia , Kim may have some changes to the seating assignments . I believe these changes will also affect where Evelyn's settlements group sits . Please coordinate changes and then send me a list of desk #'s and associated names . I need to forward this information to Lloyd Will . Thanks , Stacey
John - Not even the Dec #'s are done yet ? I believe they are planning on mass drafting Monday , so whatever is in the system at this time will go to Unify . We might as well match Unify even if it is wrong , I guess . Leslie - thoughts ? Stacey
Casey , Can you please auto-schedule the following deals for December . Please let Leslie and I know when you are complete . Stacey Deal #
What is the exact name for Georgia Pacific ? We do not see any transactions with them in the system . Stacey
Steven Luong and Nick are working on a better list with more specific names . I'll keep you informed . Stacey
I heard that . How was the floor meeting ? Stacey
I didn't hear much more than that myself . Stacey
If you have not already done so , please send instructions to users ( or IT support ) to update machines in Portland . Thanks , Stacey
Thanks !
You just let me know what y'all decide .
Leslie , Here is the most updated list of pre-bankruptcy payouts . Do you think Evelyn , Bryce , etc . could put together numbers for outstanding payable/receivable ? Stacey
Whenever we asked to give terminated information for the Estate we should include the 'Alberta ENA Bankruptcy' portfolio . The transactions in this portfolio are transactions entered into by Canada using a ENA contract that has now been terminated . If you have specific questions , please contact Kathy Reeves . Stacey
Can you have someone do this ? I forgot to put it on the group's To Do list for the week . ( Besides , I thought I would do it myself , but never seem to find time) . Stacey
Was in a meeting with UBS at this time . Sorry . Stacey
Thought you would think this was funny . Stacey
What is she talking about ? Stacey
Hope this helps a little bit re: RisktRAC . After talking to Jeff , I believe the key to book codes is ensuring from IT that we can use whatever we want as the database will be entry . Andrea , I agree that you should keep a power list and Kam should keep the gas list . Also , just wondering if when we set up the gas books should we have also put in requests for gas daily , basis , index , etc . I couldn't remember how that worked . Stacey
thanks
Can you tell me what the post-id was on my original file ? Stacey
Here you go . Stacey
FYI Stacey
That's it for me . Stacey
Wasn't sure if you wanted to read the whole letter . Here it is ,  if so . Stacey
Thought you were moving this meeting to 3:00 . Jeff and I have a meeting with UBS from 1:00-2:30 . Stacey
Can you all verify that you do or do not use the applications listed below as soon as possible . We are in the process of moving or discarding applications to move to the NETCO environment and are unaware of who uses the following applications . Thanks , Stacey
Hope all is well . My new e-mail is stacey.w.white@enron.com The one you have will be decommissioned shortly . I still have a job and will more than likely go to the 'new co.' - the piece that UBS has bid for . Currently , we are extremely busy trying to close out old business at the same time as setting up details of the new business . Russell and I are both well , probably working too hard . What is new with you ? Stacey If you get a chance give me a call - would love to talk to you . 713-853-1870 ( w ) 281-382-5215 ( cell) . I tried the number listed on this e-mail for you , but it just rang and rang .
Can you update the original file you sent with Bryce's changes below . I am afraid I do not understand exactly what I should change on Sequent . Thanks , Stacey
Did y'all export , etc. ? Stacey
I totally agree! ! Stacey
Yes , thank you . How much do I owe you ? Stacey
have you forwarded to John , or do I need to ?
Have you told Kathy about this transfer ? Should it be a bankruptcy book ? Stacey
You will LOVE this ! Stacey
It looks good for me . There are a couple of applications I do not have access to . Let me know what method you would like me to take in requesting access . Stacey
Can Cecilia do what she has requested below ? Stacey
The following post-id's represent the re-calcs for 11-30: The total forward P&L for these post-id's should be $986,414,195 The following spreadsheets represents the final product from our request . Please see if you can pull by the parameters we chose from AdHoc . Stacey
Thanks
Home 281-412-9234 Cell 713-553-3641 Hope these are still the same . Stacey
So sorry to be such a bother , but I just want to make sure that you received and are frantically thinking about my message . UBS is needing names confirmed this morning so offer letters can go out today . Stacey
Thank you so much for this query . At this time , I am not sure what happened to the numbers in our spreadsheet . The data was pulled from AdHoc by calculating East , West , Eastbank , & Westbank . However , the total we retrieved from AdHoc did not match the total Portcalc value . I do not want you to spend time trying to figure out what happened to our spreadsheet because it could have been anything from using the wrong code to calc the books to simple user error . There are too many variables that are unknown . The good thing is , it works now . Thanks , Stacey
I have re-confirmed with Power Operations and there are no more spots available to make room for one more risk person . I have all of Heather's information and will be glad to communicate her offer to her , if it has not already been communicated . Also , please let me know the message you are sending to 'estate' employees in Portland . I would like to communicate the same message to Samantha . If you want to talk to me you can reach me at 281-894-0468 or send me an e-mail . Stacey
According to Tim , if we could find no other spots for her to stay in Risk , she would be designated as VM and Kit Blair would be taken off the list . Do you know what communication is being given to 'estate' employees in Portland ? Stacey
Sounds good to me . The only days I don't want to meet are the 4th and 5th . Stacey
Thanks for the update . I finally talked to him also . The message you just told me , is what I communicated to Samantha . Whenever or if ever , you find out more specifics re: Portland estate , please let me know . Stacey
Here you go . There is a chance I may have to go to a UBS dinner tonight , but it might get changed to tomorrow . If it does get changed , I will be there tonight . Stacey
Do you think we should get Sonia to update this ? Stacey
I will be out of the office for a UBS orientation . Stacey
Make sure you talk to Casey & John . Most of my Houston group has been out of the office either this morning or this afternoon for a UBS orientation . Stacey
Do you know if they got these same numbers from John ? Stacey
Please update me on the answer to the following e-mail . I am almost certain I know the answer , but would like to make sure we are all on the same page . Thanks , Stacey
Can you find out who in your HR would be a good contact for a job opening previously held by Lou Casari ? I have a friend at Enron , my first boss , who will probably be leaving the company , but does not want to leave Houston if she does not have to . She is very well qualified for a management position , her resume should speak for itself . Let me know . Stacey
Here's what he said... .
I updated the Physical Power Terminated spreadsheet with the following update . FYI - it is NSTAR ! Stacey
Thanks for the reminder . Just an FYI - it is not babysitting when it is your own kids . ( Just kidding - wanting to share a pet peeve of my sister's. ) Stacey
Will be there .
Power December books are final . This does not mean that every termination has been accounted for in the final Dec . 31 calculation . We eventually hit a stopping point for terminations and will catch up the remainder of terminations in 'after December' books . Also , power books are set up as you have defined below . Stacey
I think your resume looks good . Brad called me today and they are definitely pulling together resumes . He says send a resume , call or both . Stacey
I certainly do not anticipate that we will . I hope the Estate people are designating someone for this . I am going to look into it . Stacey
Bob , What is the plan for this going forward ? I am expecting that you will want to use my risk estate employees for this , I am correct ? Stacey
Sounds good to me . FYI - the option true-up was a different issue , related to the way options were being input into the system . They had days which would fall out of the calc , not a last day of the month problem . Stacey
Just a reminder to make sure you get Tim a list of books/regions that are currently designated to be traded . We need to change trader names etc . so make sure he gets us this information as soon as possible . Stacey
This should answer your regional trading question . Once again , there is nothing to physically stop them from trading in any region , but the management decision on regional trading for the East is as follows . I do not have this same information from the West . Stacey
You will be extremely missed ! Good luck in all your future ventures . Stacey
Also , will you get Tim to give direction on what traders will be allowed to trade what regions . Thanks , Stacey
We will be explaining the process to Tom Chapman for the East and Samantha Law for the West . Stacey
As you can see from various e-mails , Samantha will need to take responsibility for these twice weekly calcs . I talked to Bob yesterday and he is aware that she is there and needing something to do . Unofficially , he said that there should be no employee changes before the end of February , so Sam should start coming to work and taking over any specific West Estate requests . Stacey
Let me know what other detail you need . Stacey
East Delivery Points for Facilities
FYI - here is the 6th floor plan with my group attached to desk . Stacey
Yes , she is actually down here right now and I am showing it to her . Send me your names and I'll print them in color for her . Stacey
When you get around to setting up these fields for the West , please use the portfolio code 'W' for West and then use the same methodology for Book Code that Andrea did . I'll let you know the answer she gets from Andrew re: 'US Power East' because you should be using 'US Power West' . Stacey
Here you go . It is totally liquidated , so no one will have to worry about it anymore!! ! Stacey
I am attaching this again because I am not certain that I saved it before I attached it the first time . Stacey
yes
Your gas books still have Bob Badeer and Matt Motley attached to them . You need to send in a change for these books . Stacey
I just heard a rumor that the Ercot Power Trading was going to sit in the Gas ( Open ) section . Is this the case and does it change the seating for gas and power risk ? Thanks , Stacey
FYI - we will be running a live simulation on Thursday . I will give you more details when I know something . John , When you get a chance will you ask Tim if he is aware of this ? Stacey
He was not offered a job in UBS . He was told last Friday , by me , that he would remain in the Estate , so his resignation is from the Estate . Stacey
FYI - the only other temporary information I can give you is Thursday Feb 7 . is simulation date ( as per previous e-mail ) and Monday , Feb . 11 is the current 'go live' date . I'll try to keep you up to date with any changes . If there is ANYTHING we think we have not done or will not complete by next Wednesday , Feb . 5 such as desk set ups , RisktRAC set up ( including hierarchies) , individual roll set ups , testing of Min's new DPR Automation , and anything else I may not be thinking of , please let me know as soon as possible , so we can get the right resources working on it . Thanks , Stacey
Please move until later in the afternoon . I have a 9:00 and an 11:00 in the new building . Stacey
Please try contacting him at the following numbers 713-668-7572 ( home ) 832-338-6793 ( cell ) If you cannot contact him at these numbers , let me know , I have one other way of getting in touch with him . Thanks , Stacey
FYI - Tim Carter resigned effective today . Stacey
To be totally consistent from the beginning , can you rename either your long term Long Names to not include spaces between 'North' and 'West' and 'South' and 'West' . The short term books do not have spaces . Stacey
Just want to make sure that Tom and Sam will be preparing these documents . Stacey
Since we talked about a lot of different spreadsheets , can you give me some more guidance on what was included in the spreadsheet I talked about so I will send you the correct one . Stacey
Can you do mine ?
Christina , This is just a reminder that I will be out of the office on Monday . If they need me to answer any questions here are the phone numbers: 281-894-0468 ( home ) 281-382-5215 ( cell ) Stacey
No
FYI on Estate EnPower support .
I will attend . Also , is there someone who objects to sending invitations through the calendar tool ? It is a much more efficient method of getting meetings on the calendar . Thanks , Stacey
Christina , Please add the following items to our issues list . I have talked to Leslie about these and she will be able to talk through them on Monday . 1 . Determine whether or not we need to establish POA's for cash accounts . This is a Day 1 issue . Please insert after the 'Set up new cash accounts and lock box' . 2 . Determine whether or not financial commodity trading , other than power and gas , will be allowed in order to ensure that all adequate curves , indexes , etc and being established in the rate system . This is a Day 1 issue . 3 . Need to set up meeting to discuss approval processes for new curves , books , settlement indexes after Day 1 . Suggested groups to be involved: Market Risk , Credit Risk , Finance and Control , Operations . 4 . Discussion around the use of Enron's 'New Counterparty' methodology . This is a Day 1 issue . Thanks , Stacey
Who else should I send this to ? Stacey
I was out of the office yesterday when you called . It looks like you have received as much information as we have from Jeff . Thanks again for your continued help . Hope all is well . Stacey
Thank you !
Christina , Just wanted to let you know that Donnie will be joining us for the 11:30 meeting . Thanks , Stacey
Vlad , Here is the latest book list based on book requests . The one item I know has not been requested is Andy Zipper as the LT-Option trader . When we request this and it is complete , we will send you an update . Stacey
Should we request the LT-Option book to be attached to Andy Zipper ? Any other books needed for him ? Will he be allowed to trade all regions ? Thanks , Stacey
Please send a power and gas book request for Andy Zipper . Thanks , Stacey
Sally , John Postlethwaite , Donnie Vinson and Casey Evans all have the title of Associate Director . Kathy Reeves was a manager previously so I assume she is also an Associate Director . I will be out of the office the rest of this afternoon for a doctor's appointment . If you need me I will have my cell phone 281-382-5215 . Thanks , Stacey
I have an 11:00 , so I will have to leave early . Stacey
Jeremy , We will need no additional curves . Only those designated by the gas group will need to be moved . Thanks for the heads-up . Stacey
Does anyone know what the status of this change is for the West ? Stacey
This the latest on the move . Stacey
Are they working on it ?
Who do we ask to set up the m:\common ? This makes the most sense to me . Stacey
Roberto , Can you please add to the m: drive a first tier directory of common . Please let me know ASAP that this is complete . Thanks , Stacey White Director , Power Risk Management
Thank you .
Make sure that all curves are downloaded by the end of simulation , 11:00 CST , tomorrow . Ideally , the 2/7/02 curves should be marked in the morning prior to simulation . We have been instructed to kick the calculation off as close to 11:00 CST as possible . This is to ensure that ALL downstream systems are able to run through the simulation . Please forward to all applicable traders . Thanks , Stacey
In order to point to the UBS environment in EnPower you need to change your PortCalc Host to the following . This screen is reached through Tools - Option Environment . Also , copy the PortCalc Host into your FTP Host: Let me know if you have any questions . Stacey

I'll let my parents ( Dr . and Mrs . Larry ( Carole ) Goldberg ) know . Thanks very much . Jeff

I'm not sure that thor understands dollars flowing with risk . What should we do with him ?
Hey , call me on this kid . He is the next king for you . I met him at Wharton . Jeff Thanks for your interest . Of course I remember our conversation . By now I'm sure you know you are on our interview list . ( If I told you prematurely , use it to your advantage somehow with your friends. ) I've contacted one of our head broadband marketers to set up an introduction , and see where this goes . It's a great idea , and you should hear back from me shortly , when David responds to me call . Best regards , Jeff P.S . Please call me Jeff--I'm not some grey haired old dude , but I appreciated your being professional in your first email to me .
please get on calendar

I think doing a EGM only prc is probably the right way to go . We will need to do a good job ( and have the ability to cross calibrate ) understanding the other business units performance as well . Jeff Enron North America Corp .

John , he did well with the gas guys , so lets make him an offer . Get with mand we'll go over the offer . Thanks . Jeff

please print resume and cover letter Thanks for your email . Please call me when you have a chance . Jeff
Singapore is mentioned . What do you think . Jeff
As promised . Jeff
sure . Jeff
Clear it with arnold if you want dutch . Let me know as people come to you . the goal is to have people rotate into your group directly , or from the gas fundamentals group if possible , and vice versa . Keep me updated , and you , I and Lavo will work this out . Jeff

Glad to be of help . Let me know if you ever need anything from me . Regards . Jeff
Yes , absolutely . There is a ton of work in Japan , and as you know Joe Hirl runs the office , but the products in EGM are crucial to its success . I'd be happy to meet her . Let me know how I can help . Jeff
Very strong need for people in Japan next august . I'd like to get some people interested in helping start there , or get there after some enron indoctrination . Thanks . Jeff
I've already talked to Cliff B . The only thing we are precluded from is building a power plant in Singapore.. .
Have you gotten with Chris Holmes , re: the voice mail I sent you end of last week ? Thanks . Jeff
set some time up--30 minutes . Jeff
put on calendar . Thanks .
its chris holmes , not harris . is this something else ?
fine if you keep me up to speed . But I do not expect to does this for free . What do we want related to this ? Did you know Exmar exercised the options ? Apparently they want to work with us--on this ship . What do we want related to this ?

Jennifer Fraser is leading our fundamentals intranet group for all products within EGM . Please contact her so we do not duplicate efforts , as the coal , etc site will be incorporated with some uniformity into the larger EGM site . Thanks . Jeff
what time is the soiree friday eve ?
This looks like a great opportunity for us . Jeff
I will be out of the office oct 9 . Jeff
put on calendar
This is another reason why the HR and A/A program don't like each other . It's absurd that our personnell functions don't share resources . I'm almost of the opinion that these two groups should be folded together . Jeff
If you think there is value to your seeing the ship , I'm ok with your detour . Let me know before you go what you intend to find out if anything . Regards Jeff Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp . - Europe
If you'd like to get me the resumes today , I'll take a look , and pick a few out . This way we won't need to change the meeting time . Michelle was my first choice to lead the effort . OK about Suzanne . I'm serious about keeping a highly visible presence on campus , and am willing to spend some money , strategically . Keep me updated . Jeff
It's not necessarily an either/or decision . Michelle , do you think this is a good program ? Kristin , can you call Tom Piazze at Wharton , and ask him what he thinks about the importance of our participation in this ? Jeff
Thanks for the email . I'll put some thought into it . Stay in touch-- Jeff
Congratulations on the birth of your daughter ! If you want to stay active in recruiting , let me know . Also Michelle Nezi Marvin will be our shcool lead . Best Regards Jeff
Please include Jen Fraser on this distribution as well going forward . Jeff
no problem
sorry for the oversight on my part .

I'd like to talk to him , but isn't merlin's credit low ?
Draft: We are please to announce the following within Enron Global Markets: Larry Lawyer will be joining EGM effective immediately to start our new finance origination activities . In this role , he will work with all commodity products , assets , and teams and lever our existing businesses with new this new focus . ( Do you want to put in his background--which you probably now more than I? ) He will be reporting to the Office of the Chairman . Eric Gonzales will be joining the LNG team and co-head this effort with Rick Bergsieker . We believe there is significant opportunity in the worldwide LNG markets , and Eric will direct all merchant activity . ( Do you want to put in his background? ) Rick will be relocating to Dubai , and bring his martket relationships and industry knowledge to the region focussing on Project Dolphin ( do we want to say this? ) and other related Mideast projects . Eric and Rick will report to the Office of the Chairman . Jen Fraser will come over and develop our market fundamentals group for all products in EGM , much like ENA natural gas and power fudamentals and intranet pages exist today . Previously , Jen was working in the Mid Market origination group . Heather Purcell will be joining this group developing the commercial interface for our intranet page . Heather was with Azurix , where she worked on the platform interface for the ebusiness initiatives . Gary Hickerson will be chairing our Trader's Roundtable . This group will be comprised of traders across Enron's wholesale trading and risk management businesses . This forum will give traders the opportunity to discuss topics important to their individual markets , and discuss other markets in a macro sense . We will be also forming a Cross Commidity trading group . In this group , traders who have shown extremely strong and consistent profitability will have the opportunity to exploit cross commodity opportunities with a bias toward structural shifts in markets . This group will not be involved in customer activity , and will execute through our principal desks . Gary will manage this new group , as well as continuing with his current F/X , Rates , Equity , and Agriculture initiatives . ( anything else? )

Please include EGM Jeff
I be happy to fill you in
Thanks , I'll get with Mike and let you know . Jeff
Sorry I missed you before I left--my phones at the house we also having some trouble .
Preliminary-- Anything suggestions ? Jeff
Are you also coordinating this with hunter and his available analysts who you think are good ?
Michelle , If you run into problems with finding mgr or above interviewers , you should consider assoc . to interview analysts . I would also like to put Kevin McGowan ( who went to MBA but isn't on the list , as an interviewer for wharton , in Phila if possible) , I'll leave it to you for interviewers .
I'd like to have a few people meet her , but am confident in Jennifer's ability to evaluate analysts . Jeff
We had submitted a list of PRC reps already . Who is currentlyreviewing , and are you using the same format as midyear , and how many people do you need ? am i around ?
Yes , I think we will both be there . Do you have an idea of the number of attendees , ( particularly from global markets) ? Jeff
I really don't want to press release this . Is there a good reason we should ? Jeff
thanks for the update . Please keep me updated today.... . Jeff Enron North America Corp . Why am I such a worrier . It was fine..... .
Thanks for the email . You do know that Networks and our Broadband businesses are different , I trust . If you have and questions , please let me know , and I'll be happy to help you get to the next group that most interests you . Jeff
I want Platts , etc . to apologize and retract their story . Jeff
I haven't heard from either of you regarding the Wharton Analyst I mentioned . Any interest in speaking with him ? Jeff
Fine . Coordinate with Jennifer
yes , send me his resume,etc

I know we've made good progress with respect to morning reports for EGM . However , I continue to receive most reports after 9:00 a.m. , which is too late into the trading day . Please let me know if there are resources you need , so this aspect of EGM can run as smoothly as ENA gas . Thanks . Jeff
congrats on the network move !
Hi Ben , No problem if you want to invoice me . I'm not ready for you to ship the goods to me , though , and probably won't be for a few weeks , as I move into the new digs . Still thinking about the lamp and desk.... . Best , Jeff

Glad to help . Can you get me the schedule as to which schools will be here on those dates . Jeff
I'll get on it . With the Texaco Chevron merger , I'd like to get some insight into their organizations . Particularly Texaco , since they have two trading offices , one in Whit Plains , the other here . This set up for them has never worked well , and I'd like to talk to some of the better Texaco traders , if there are any . Jeff
Nov 11 is great , and I'll try to help out Dec 9 . ( I'll be out of town Nov 4) . I'd also be happy to look now at the spring schedule . Jeff
Where are the wharton analysts ?
please print yes .
please put this on the calendar
please correct
I would like to help on the Nov 18 analyst super saturday also . Jeff
also put this on the calendar
Thanks for the note . We are still looking at the value chain , but think we may have an idea . I think Mike and I learned a lot from you guys when we were in London . Nobody thinks our speculating in the grain markets does much for us , and is probably the wrong way to run that group . Interestingly , the cargill CEO hasn't met with us yet . We have been trading softs , but very small . Next time Gary Hickerson is in London , which should be soon , I'll have him give you guys the story , and ask for more of your input . Regards Jeff Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp . - Europe

proceed with your recommendation . Also , we do not need to store any data once I see report .
I'm so sorry . My cell phone died , and wouldn't work with the car for some reason . And was in the office by the time you called at 6:30 (  a little problem this morn here)--thanks for the repeated attempts..... .

Hi John , hope things are well...Hickerson and I were talking yesterday about the convert bond desk , and he mentioned to me that it make sense for it to come to his group . I understand you have had prelim discussions about this , and wanted to catch up with you on this matter . I'll give you a ring by week's end if we want to proceed . My initial reaction is that it probably makes sense... . Jeff
Mark , Thor , and Todd , Thanks for the video conference this morning . Mike and I are convinced weather can and will be an extremely profitable business . One issue I would like to address is EnergyDesk.com . It seems like an interesting idea , but I'd like to find out more about it , and in relation to the work Tom Gros in doing in NetWorks . I'd also like to understand more about the scalability of this model , and our relationship with Kiodex . To that end , I do not want any proprietary data , product interface , and or other weather related matter and material to be part of EnergyDesk.com . I will keep you updated as I learn more about these and other issues . Regards Jeff
John was not interested in Mike after I spoke with him .
For your pleasure
I have forwarded your resume to Ted Bland . He will be your contact person . Thanks for your interest .

Hi stranger ! how's the new digs ? WHEN are we going out for a little dinner ? Jeff
Hi John--hope things are well . I'd like to invite you to One Great Night , Nov 8 . if you are free . Last year was my first year , and I will admit , it is somewhat of a spectacle . Fun with the right group of people though . Let me know if you are around ! Regards , Jeff
print . yes , of course . are you seeing it ?
I know you guys have been working to secure supply for the H . Galleon . I wonder if we should do some sort of tender for fob princing , allowing us whatever freedom we want with the ship . I'm not sure we should kill ourselves for a few pennies--I'd even let the ship stay empty and maybe force some of our will on the LNG market if possible , in effect creating more of a spot market . Maybe EOL . Any thoughts ? Jeff

FYI
Do you know what this is ?
First--Ted your voicemail isn't working . I would like to get active in recruiting products traders , in a real attempt to high grade the group . Can we , and how do we make a full court press with the headhunters out there ? Also , what do you guys think of putting a big ad in the Chronicle , and the WSJ ? We could also look for originators and marketers . Thanks . Jeff
thank you . Jeff
can you send this to all the staff member participants today ? Thanks . Jeff
fyi . can you respond to this guy if need be . Jeff
I don't know why I got a new P&L DPR at 2:30 today showing a change in P&L and a big VAR violation--most likely due to shroeder's getting shorter 2186 contracts of crude and Botchlett's getting shorter 2141 heat contracts . Don's Var went up 2.8 million to 9.7 million , and Dave's Var went down only 687 thousand to 3.1 million . Where is Dave's var coming from ? We need to be under our Var tonight . Dave and Don--please take care of this . Jeff
John , you guys have to be under Var tonight before we leave for the evening . That means buying on access if necessary .
Why did I not get this until 12:41 ?
Please send this to the staff meeting distribution list . Please take a minute and fill out the Pulse , and encourage your organization to do so as well . Thanks . Mike and Jeff
please print . Thanks . This is helpful . I like all the products you've mentioned below , except for the MTBE one . Is there a real market need for this ? Please proceed and get the others on EOL asap . Also please pass the trade idea you have to Fred Lagrasta's group .
print
Explain to me why Don S . went golfing at 3 pm and you have this huge var violation in his book ? I'm not sure that was the best idea he's ever had .
FYI . I sent this monday 4pm if you hear any rumblings . Jeff It seems to me we are in the middle of no man's land with respect to the following: Opec production speculation , Mid east crisis and renewed tensions , US elections and what looks like a slowing economy ( ?) , and no real weather anywhere in the world . I think it would be most prudent to play the markets from a very flat price position and try to day trade more aggressively . I have no intentions of outguessing Mr . Greenspan , the US . electorate , the Opec ministers and their new important roles , The Israeli and Palestinian leaders , and somewhat importantly , Mother Nature . Given that , and that we cannot afford to lose any more money , and that Var seems to be a problem , let's be as flat as possible . I'm ok with spread risk ( not front to backs , but commodity spreads) . The morning meetings are not inspiring , and I don't have a real feel for everyone's passion with respect to the markets . As such , I'd like to ask John N . to run the morning meetings on Mon . and Wed . Thanks . Jeff
Hi Lea , What are you thinking about with Jeff ( Koons) ? Jeff
John Nowlan is concerned that this var number isn't right . According to john , the group significantly reduced postions ( on the whole) . What about the forward forward vol ? Have we looked at that ? My instinct is that something is not accurate with this var number today if you look at the resulting position as of Friday evening's postion report . I'd like someone to be dedicated to the crude and products group full time who can help us with "what if" scenarios throughout the trading day , and who can work with Pavel on the crude desk on the forward forward vol issue . Also , I'd like to isolate first gas holdings since that is taking up approx 2 million in var each day . Jeff
Great . Thanks . Jeff
Thanks for the clarification . Get it listed if you like . Jeff
Do you have an answer for me regarding the simulation I asked you to run ?
I'll defer to you . How does this supplement your reports now ?
Yes , there is a formalized process . After Credit and Legal , and in most cases RAC , look at transactions , a VP or higher will sign the Dash . For Doug to sign the Bahamas option contract , I need to know the premium . Please contact Brent Price for our DASH . ( Deal approval sheet ) Jeff
Is this why BP thought to squeeze the market ? Jeff
I'm looking forward to our drinks/dinner of woes . ( But not too long on woes , I don't like not being in a good mood) . When is good for you week after next ? Jeff P.S . I really don't like that expression "misery loves company" by the way..... .

FYI . I'd like to be number 2 behind ENA . And a close 2nd that is . This should be a priority for us . I'd like to set up a meeting shortly to put together a strategy on how we can get there . More to follow .
please put me on the continental flight to tokyo on sunday as well . thanks .
Thanks for the thought . We are trying to get more fund business already through Per in the NY office . Do you have any funds you'd like to sign up . In terms of products , I was thinking more depth in products we feel comfortable managing . Maybe different spreads/cracks , whatever . You can control product launch , not the funds . Can you give a some ideas of more/new products we trade or more/new products you'd like to get on eol . What more products will your customers want ? Jeff
I was planning on changing the morning meeting as you indicated . The problem with the P&L loss is one of time . We have given back 25 million this quarter , and very few traders took profits at any time . I expect traders to lose money at times , but we have other constraints . I'd be happy to have a call with you once we finish our budget process about how we will get to our numbers next year . Of course spread trading is a good idea , but when I look at the portfolio in aggregate , the position story I'm being told doesn't make sense . We'll get there .
I'll look for him on my calendar .
Looks good . Coordinate with Chris and John and let's move on this . Jeff
please print Fyi . Put this on the calendar .

( My haircut is perfect , you'll be pleased to know ) I did go out with my neighbors last night--I needed to because the guy who is buying my house on woodhead st . came over last night and backed out of his contract . Boy was I annoyed . And still am , but the good news is he loses his earnest money to me . So I'm going to take out a bunch of friends to dinner when i get back . Want to go ? I'm thinking Tony's or something else fun/festive . To be determined...but fun .
I'm out next week , but will be in touch with steve horn when i return . Jeff
thanks . sorry i missed you earlier.. .
thanks . these are great updates... . Jeff
No thoughts on Skilling's speech . He just needs to emphasize we are a great productive entrepreneurial company . Any we're are largest energy trading and risk management house in the world . It would be ok if he mentioned that I am a Wharton '89 undergrad and run a large part of our trading group . Students like to see where successful wharton alum are in the world . ( By the way , I'm the lead for wharton grad and wharton/penn undergrad) . This speech he is giving is a great opportunity for us to recruit.. . On another note , I have an idea for you . Get on my calendar for early part of week after next ( I'm going to the Japan office opening , then to sydney and will be in the office nov . 6 ) Keep a low profile on the xcelerator for a week . Later , Jeff
thanks . these updates are great . Jeff

please print have I asked you about this ? please print
Dan , set up a brief meeting with john and me on this . Jeff
how did it reduce var if we added to the underlying positions ?
Yes , I think it would be a great experience , and I'd encourage you to continue to meet as many people as possible in the organization . Jeff
I still don't understand . But we are net short crude , and Crude , companywide got longer 1000 contracts yesterday . This is counter to what you aresaying below.. . Jeff
I'd like access for me . I think the crude and products guys are looking at it , so I don't understand that we haven't signed a participant agreement . Thanks .
fyi , what is the purpose of this email.... .
Given year end issues , we really need to be trading close to the vest now . I was a little surprised how big the prompt few months position in crude was two days ago , and we need to scale them back . I need the component var for those four structural trades we have today . thanks... . Jeff
When you put a person feet first in a pail of cement to throw him off a bridge , how expensive is that type of cement ?
Thanks . Thanks . Be sure to get Larry Lawyer , Brent Price , and Eric Groves involved . This project is extremely important to Enron , and our LNG strategy . If there are any resources you need , please let me know . Jeff
set up a quick ( no more than 30 mins ) about this with me , nowlan , reck . thanks . jeff
proceed .
see if you can print this... .
I think you know about this... . On another note , I have 5 cases of Kistler in my office--should we crack a few ? Jeff
FYI . Please check into this... .
I spoke with Tom Piazze at Wharton again this morning , about a reduction in the financial commit . from us . He was not receptive , and in the past , I've suggested energy outsourcing for the University , and more recently discussing their broadband needs . Others here have thought about this at Enron ( like the California University system) . Jeremy Blachman and I are going to run with this in a more direct approach and see what happends . ( Tom P . was open to all of this , of course) . FYI , thanks . Jeff
I asked him ( and John Nowlan ) to call you about this project that looks pretty cool . I thought you could lend a hand . ( John Montcrief also does wet shipping for the crude and products group in London and works for Nowlan as well. ) It looks pretty interesting . Let me know what you think . Thanks... .
Please let Arvind I'd like to get this....Jeff Is this on the calendar . I think it is Dec . 6 ? Call vince for details... .
Please provide . Only give my new address . 1818 South Blvd . Hou 77098
Great ! Sorry YOU weren't there.. . I'm on my way out for a lunch . I'll call you later . ( I'm excited about the exec committee , but it is a little big , so I told Skilling we should rename it the exec villiage! )
Looks like there is plenty of work to do , and I continue to believe shipping , etc . has great possibility for Enron . I'd like to get a group of people to talk about plans going forward , and will fill you in shortly on time , where , etc . One point is that it is our policy not to speak to the press without it being cleared through public relations first . Your comments were interesting , but I was concerned about perception . Please coordinate public statements , interviews , and the like through the proper channels going forward . Thanks . Jeff
piano tuning ? nothing bad about last night--very tame .
print
put on calendar . Does Nicki know to email you on th is stuff
yes . print
This is helpful . Can you also distribute the DASH system , why we use it , how to use it , and approvals needed for deals ? Thanks . Jeff
Hi , hope you are doing great . I was wondering if you've met Russell Dyke , who is in Lagrasta's group , and who I told could get into the LNG before you came over . He has great international experience , and LNG experience . He might be a great match with the Jose team , since I'm uncomfortable with their understanding of MTM , and their overall appreciation of the Enron way of doing business . ( Today , Russel ( assoc/mgr at year end ) closed a deal with CSFB worth 19 million to us. ) Overall a solid guy . Let me know what you think . ( Merritt and Russell know each other well , and have worked on projects together ) Also , I mentioned to Merritt that I was excited about her opportunity to trade dutch power , but was very interested in staying in touch with her , possibly to trade freight , etc . Jeff
thanks
thought you'd like this.....Jeff
You , as well . Jeff
OK , so I didn't really think you'd be at the office at 9:30 pm when I left you a message last night , buy my day turned into a freak show . Later Jeff
Everything was ok , just busy . Good book ? I just started "When the sons of heaven meet the daughters of earth" have you heard of it ? I'd absolutely love to go the the Anne Frank thing , but I can't get back from the management conference . I'm on a panel ( with Jeremy ) early Friday a.m .
Please select your reviewers for year end PRC . If you have any questions call Shanna . thanks . Jeff
Great news . Please stay in touch so I can help with your next rotation... . Best regards Jeff
Super Saturday is super early---7:15 sat . morn . and I'm at my desk . Sounds like all your events will be fun . I'm counting on your helping me with my parties , too ! Sounds like this week is busy , but I'm around next weekend . We'll figure it out this week . No message yesterday , so I rescheduled it for late afternoon today , can wait .
You got it . Jeff
Please expect a phone call from Andrew Makk , currently in the Mid East group , who is interested in exploring opportunities in each of your areas . He is a very qualified individual who would be a tremendous resource in any of your groups . Thanks . Jeff
As I was packing some books this weekend , I stumbled across an old copy of The Story of O , and almost fell over . I knew I had heard of that book--I must have read it some time ago--I think it was orig published in 1954 or 1965 . Now I remember how much I didn't like it ! Hope you've recovered from all your parties . How was the book dinner . Did I mention I had a spur of the moment party last night ? Jeff
I'd like to know how we purchased the Katz . Was that outside our budget , and in Ken's dining room budget ? Mike and I will get together and address the points you bring up below . Looking forward to our meeting .
As we move forward with our global LNG strategy , it is obvious that the best way to capture value for Enron is to bring the same merchant activity to this business unit . This merchant philosophy allows aggressive book and position management from a worldwide perspective . Our ability to gather data and to show only one Enron face in the market is crucial to our success . As important is one pricing desk . Many of you know , Eric Groves in Houston is running our pricing desk , Larry Lawyer is working on all finance type business for us , and Jen Fraser is running our fundamentals group . To bring full merchant capabilities to our worldwide LNG business , Mike and I wanted to clearly outline a point that seems to need attention . ALL LNG contacts , negotiations , and contracts , ( physical , financial , buys , sales , etc.) , with external counterparties must and will be managed through our commercial LNG group headed by Eric Gonzales , and Rick Bergsieker . It is crucial to manage market perspective , appearance , and informantion . We all know how important each project ( Metgas , and other initiatives in India ) could be , but a coordinated front will help us better grow all of our businesses . Regards Jeff
Absolutely I will call him . Let's talk about a coordinated strategy with him . Come up today when you get a minute....Jeff
Details to work out with HR . Of course you will have significant input and presence . Jeff
Speak with Nowlan . Thanks...Jeff print
Come by . I'll shed some light....also I'd like to talk to you about opportunities within EGM . Jeff
FYI . Jeff schedule some time . Jeff

Wow . Jeff
Great . I'll have Jennifer set up a phone meeting .
Without knowing what subcommittees you are going to set up for the exec . committee members , I'll take the Analyst/Associate program . We've been incredibly successful with Wharton/Penn ,  and I'd like to replicate our approach company wide . I'm convinced with my help , we can do a world class job . I'd be happy to give my thoughts on off cycle hiring , and other ways to improve the entire process ( internal and external ) around Enron . Thanks . Jeff
please take car of .
please get on calendar
Great . Thanks . So what do you think of Crude for tomorrow ? Jeff
fyi . print
Hi John Things are heating up for year end keeping us all pretty busy . As we go forward in many of our businesses , it's clear several need fine tuning . One of which is weather worldwide . Mark Tawney and I have spent quite a bit of time during the last several weeks working on a plan for next year and forward . We've come to the conclusion that it will be most effective to add a London operation that will allow for quick and beneficial marketer interaction , immediate scalability , and more portfolio diversification . I would structure the business around the continent with someone managing that portion of the operation , and continue to have Thor manage Scandinavia . Mark and I will get together to structure the London based group and keep you advised . Mark has some great ideas , and I'd like to talk to you about this rather than go on in an email . I'll give you a ring first thing in the morning . Best-- Jeff
Of course I want to get together next ( this? ) weekend . In fact , the house should be almost done , and I'd love to show it to you , too . I'm pretty open also , but am doing super saturday again , and am not sure what my deal is friday evening ( if anything , and will know by tomorrow) . Last night on A&E was a special about Palm Beach , and the good life , charity balls , social scene , etc . So I had a Palm Beach Party--bought caviar , fruit tarts , champagne and sat around watching the show . I made everyone wear Lacoste shirts , loafters ( no socks ) and not put down their glass full of champagne ( as much as possible! ) Fun , casual , and last minute . For not being in your biz , I liked the idea and we had fun . Went to my first exec committee meeting . Pretty interesting . But can't wait to hear about your parties for Vicki and Dan... .
Funny....How's your day going ? Put me down for freak show .
George , I just saw the updated 4Q earnings outlook , and saw Jupiter , and British energy off the sheet . Is Jupiter off because of the Massey problems you mentioned today . What about British energy... . Jeff
The reason for the memo before was because the India guys still don't understand . Hopefully this clears up their ideas about a separate marketing and trading shop in India . Have you had time to think about Russell Dyke ? Jeff
Any updates on the Gdansk refinery , or should I assume that the deal is dead ? Jeff
Thanks for the update .
Thor , I'm getting stuck in a meeting at that time and will follow up . Thanks . Jeff
Please set up a phone call . thanks . Jeff
what do I need to do with this ?
Saturday is looking better right now . I hope that is still ok . Let me know.......The assoc/analyst dept is trying to kill me . More later
will do....Jeff
Thanks for the clarifications .

To be clear , those employees in Oslo and elsewhere that spend 100% of their time in our businesses will be part of our PRC process . Thanks .
I've taken a look at Bobby Brown's resume and would like some additional info . What does he want to do ? What does he know about us ? etc . Thanks . Jeff
Great . Probably Mike , me , Rick Bergsieker and a few others . Thanks . Jeff Enron North America Corp .
We would be happy to explore the full range of products we offer , including Jere's insurance products . I suspect you and Mark can begin the process with great capability . If you'd like my help , please let me know as you develop this relationship . Thanks for the update . Jeff
Thanks for the update . Andy Zipper is working on a structure that will allow the brokers to access our site as you've pointed out . I'll have Andy contact you and John on this topic . Jeff
Thank you for your note . It is always appreciated . I'm sure you will find your career here very exciting , and Dan is a leader in our company and I know he is excited to have you as part of his team . If you are running into some employee issues , I'd ask you to get Shanna Funkhouser involved as well . A good work environment is crucial to everyone's success . Welcome . Jeff
FYI . FYI . I suspect her issues are with Angie . I'll let you manage this one . Thanks .

Get with me on tuesday . we'll address then , but I'm ok with this in general .

I'll check with HR next week . I forgot what joke ? Jeff
Please get in touch with each other and see if this works . Thanks . Jeff
Hey , I understand the trading rotation program is underway . I'd like an update next week so we can participate as well . Happy Thanksgiving , or the Canadian equivalent . Jeff
yes . promote brad . also , I believe sara mulholland ( analyst ) is eligible , and I would like to promote her to associate . ( when she started at enron , the time requirement was 18 months for promotion ) Please get back to me . Jeff
I'm not sure it is a good idea to go . can we talk about this monday am ? Jeff
tried , but no can do . call me , though .
Good afternoon Ida ( better name for you than me) . EC was uneventful , given that I wore no crazy hat . At the right time though . I know the party will be great--try not to stress too much , besides your plans sounded great and I'm sure everyone will have a great time . I'm leaving in a little while to go to the closing (  and collect some cash!) , and am out the rest of the afternoon--cruising in the ida-mobile ! In case you were wondering , I used almost a half mile of bubble wrap yesterday moving my art to the new house and will recycle it if there are some cool kid things to do with it . Ideas ? Later .
Thanks for the update . I think it shows how starved for new products these exchanges are . I'm not a fan of teaming up with these kinds of entities . It's unclear what they bring , and how does this help us ? what do you think ? Jeff

How's it going ?
I'm not happy today . Going back to last night , I got home , fell asleep on the couch in the new house , went upstairs at 4 , and slept til 830 . Late all day , and just had a pretty crappy meeting with one of my direct reports and Jeff Skilling . I can't describe the weight of the world feeling I have , and I'm not good at not being in control . I wish I had the answers . How are you ?
I had so much fun last night ! WHEN can we do it again ?
Thanks for the email . I'm not in love with this deal , and Nowlan is not inclined to do it , but we will have Pierre look at it . By the way , it was 72 and sunny at my new house . That is the forecast forever there .
please print
PLEASE call me Jeff . When I'm old , grey , and heavier , then you call use a more formal salutation . Great to meet you too , and I'll be in touch shortly . Jeff
Boy did I unpack last night . I couldn't go to sleep so I went a little crazy . Tuesday is good . we could have a frasier marathon . Which one of us is cooking at my house ? Would it be crazy if I asked you to be my guest at the wholesale christmas party next sat ? ( Nothing like email to ask that sort of question , and I certainly don't mean to be impersonal about it ) I have to head home to work out for a few hours... .
Thanks for the reminder . Yes I'd like to be included in your jan 1 , 2001 contribution . I will attend to this with the necessary paperwork in mid Regards , Jeff

Hey , I'll be around this weekend , trying to get myself together . I can't tell you how overwhelmed I've felt recently , and I think our conversation while I was awol ( in NY for the day last weekend ) really got to me . I'll tell you this weekend about my meeting with my the shrink the other day . ( The part where I'm NOT good at compartmentalizing) . I think that threw me for a loop too . Oh , your message got to me this morn . Please don't ever think you are bothering me . I guess I'm a little less mature about my emotions than I thought . ( I know this is all personal , but email seems to be a little easier for me to communicate this to you right now) . I'm not sure that my home number is on yet , so the cell phone is where I'll be .

Gary , That was a great presentation . Thanks for the update .
Thanks . Will do . Did you need something the other day ? Jeff
Thanks for the email . Actually , you are completely wrong about my view of Joe . He has tremedous integrity , and is a very strong team builder , and has added much value to our organization . I was however a little surprised by your move to go from a trading position to an analysis position . I would have been thrilled to have you help me design a position for you in that kind of capacity here , or in london , or elsewhere if you liked . In addition , I could have talked to you about a junior trading spot in crude and products . ( Which I will remind you about frequently ) I'm sure your decision will prove valuable to Joe , and hopefully to you as well . Mike and I would like to see you back on the A-team though--we both respect your business sense . As far as the guilt thing goes , I can't help you . I'm Jewish and our people have suffered much longer than everyone else combined . Jeff
I will be in Phila . Please grab materials for me .
Sorry it's been so hard . Nothing meant by it . To where are you moving ?
Yes .
No issues , and this will benefit Enron company wide . It will come out of either Kristie Patrick's ( in Mark Palmer's office ) or my budget . Jeff

Your call on the bet . I talked to my friend at Sat . Night Live , and she said no problem about being extras . I'll get a list of scheduled hosts/bands--you pick ! ( If that is still ok )
No , he cannot come to the crude meeting , but I'd be happy for him to have a tour of the gas and crude floors and introduce him to some traders .

Please print following on letterhead: Larry Kellner Chief Financial Officer ( put rest here ) Dear Larry , Thanks for the opportunity to discuss your risk management needs yesterday . Continental has been very successful in hedging fuel , and I think we can add even more value as we explore your basis risks . I've asked Mark Tawney , Director of Weather Risk Management , to come up with some ideas possibly linking weather to fuel , and explore our insurance and tax opportunities . His organization is the best in the industry , and is doing cutting edge research .

got here around 9 , hopefully leaving at 11 . I only did 8 abs last night . I'm going to get to 20 though....How was the play ? Haven't be to Zula... .
I saw you called on the cell this a.m . Sorry I missed you . ( I was in the shower) . I have had a shitty week--I suspect my silence ( not only to you , but others ) after our phone call is a result of the week . I'm seeing Glen at 11:15....talk to you
Macy Gray was just on CNN singing--she is great !
Since only I know I'm not trying to offend you , that's all I can say . I'm not sure I'm worthy of your being concerned either ( I don't deserve it--I'd guess ) You know , after we talked the other day , I felt better for a while . I don't know what to say , and I'm sure I'm embarrassed by this whole thing--most particularly how I've handled our relationship . I really want to see you , but I need some time to myself I guess . I do know glen doesn't have all the answers , but I find him to be impartial and helpful--really the only one these days . My mother suggested a trip home this weekend , and i may go . I wish this were easy.....I think part of my issue is I've always felt our friendship is one I wanted to keep always , and I feel I tend to jeopardize friendships... .
I'm still here--they're trying to kill me .
Hi Hillary , hope you are well . Unfortunately , I won't be able to make it tomorrow . I just couldn't work out the schedule , but it was extremely thoughtful of you to invite me . I hope you have a great time.....(I'll send something to Ben in the gallery tomorrow).. . Best , Jeff
No problem ! In fact , it is likely I'll be in NY wed-sat next week--I'm sure I'll stop by the gallery . Hope to see you.. . Jeff

Hopefully it will work out . My first party--first week in Feb--Ali's planning it . Aren't I cooler than Kenneth's brother Mark ? Just checking . Later Jeff

Please take me off the distribution for this report . It is hard to read , and not terribly useful to me . Do we need this report at all ? Jeff
Candidly , Mark wanted to leave it open as to whom it would report . He wantto have control in it's growth and staffing , although it would be coordinatwith Thor . Mark ( and I ) talked to Thor about this a while ago , and will begin weekly video calls in the new year about strategy , updates , new products , and growing this business continentally . ( Mark was still concernabout the members of the Oslo weather group that Thor managed poorly--in Mark's mind) . I'm sure we will get to a point that works best organizationally with Thor having a role . However , when you look at the P&of the business , is doesn't illustrate his support of the business , which ware addressing . Hope this helps , and you are relaxing a little... . Jeff
I know him from the gas market , and am not in love .
I'm going to try to go to 50....day is packed , and still haven't decided when to go to NY.....How's your day ?

I have a book you should read--How to Raise a Puppy--by the Monks of New Skete . These Monks have perfected the art of raising a dog--so they think--but the book is helpful . I'm leaving at 1 ish .
How was the trip ? NY was great , but I got back so late , you wouldn't believe , I missed my flight to Jackson . I was pissed .
will do . What's the pups name ?
again
I was just thinking about API on eol . Let's look into it Jeff
I'm out of here . Have a nice afternoon .
Do you guys get this ?
Let's get together on this and have a conference call . Thanks .
I have the book for you . What is your location ? Are you crate training the pup?--I did and it is a great idea . I have an extra crate if you need...they are pretty expensive so if you want you can have this one.... .
send to lavorato for gas .
Should I send the book to your location ?
sure--it's on its way.. .
I've known her for some time , and interviewed her on the gas floor , and we didn't really have a fit . I'm not sure what I'd do with her

What do you think ?
Great .
Sorry , you know how I like one word answers...When are you back ? There is a lot of info of the gas floor--ie handouts , that I'm not getting . Your work is invaluable , and it is getting a lot of notice internally . Good job .

What is the opportunity to look at Elba Island space in conjunction with the Dhabol supply contract ? That is , could we go to our LNG suppliers for India , and regotiate that contract and provide space for diverted cargoes if necessary . Jim Hughes is spending his time figuring out what to do with Dhabol and any suggestions we have may be helpful . Thanks .
If he is interested in gas trading , send his info to lavorato Enron North America Corp .
I'm around
Let's send our a memo to deal makers , book admins , and business heads to remind everyone what the process should be regarding desk notification of big transactions/cash flows . Why don't you take a stab at writing a memo , send it back to me , and I'll review . Let's try to get it out this week . Thanks .
What's up with the ads for the NY times , WSJ , and FT ? ( Crude and product traders ) Jeff
The US/UK Arbitrage book , the Finland Arbitrage book , and the Products Arbitrage book in Singapore have been shut down , and no positions are authorized to go into those books going forward . In addition , all positions in those books must be pulled out as of today , and I want them removed from the P&L reports I get . Also , we need to set up a separate book for the 24 hour , 4 cent wide EOL crude market . Thanks . Jeff
Starting tomorrow , Jan 3 , the London Distillates book run by Ross Koller will have a max var position of $1 million . Chris , please take care of this with Ross . Thanks Jeff
Niamh Clarke , Chris Mahoney , and Per Sekse are in Enron Global Markets . You have them in the wrong business units . Thanks for correcting . Jeff
Unfortunately I cannot be there . What about Grey Whalley ? ( Even though he is Stanford )
I understand , however , each book you assign to a trader will have a line so you and I can follow the performance of each book/trader . Ok if you want to take over arb books , but they ( positions and p&l will be your responsibility and will be judged by performance--like any other book/trader ) must be managed without the team approach of books prior . The 1 million Var applies to the line next to Ross's name on the p&l sheets . I don't know how many people trade that book , but I assume it is only ross . If ross get's bulled up at every sign of snow in london , all the more reason to get a weather guy hired asap . Small positions , and taking profit frequently is the key to turning this boat around . Later , Jeff
Soon , soon , soon . Last minute changes to the house . I'll probably have a big open house within a couple of months , but I'll have you over sooner . My dogs are moving to Connecticut Friday , so after then . Congrats on a great year . Jeff

Please make sure there there is no P&L or position effect in the crude books with the new 24 hour EOL product . Thanks .
As we begin our summer recruitment process , it is crucial that we continue to be aggressive in hiring all the best candidates . As you know , Enron has committed over $1million during the next four years to University of Pennsylvania , and Wharton. . I want to make sure we don't limit ourselves in getting the Enron message out at Penn and Wharton by restriciting the number of summer employees . I do not want to limit the number of people we hire for the summer . In fact , I'd like to be as aggressive as possible . I am operating under the notion that if we find 10 good people for which we have positions , we will offer all of them summer jobs . I will not accept the notion of only 1 summer associate , and 1 or 2 summer ananlysts . In addition , I'm concerned that the idea of giving associates $200 gift certificates is viewed as good one . I'm not sure that is a good use of Enron's dollars , and would like to know what other events we are planning for the sell weekends . Jeff
sure . is there anything specfic you'd like me to address . what about a slide presentation--which I generally don't love , but we have some good ones around .
Thanks for all your help with Sempra . Hard work , but certainly worth it . On another note , Mike and I have discussed this $2 million issue with American Coal , and the interest rate hedge in the MPR . Bottom line , we are not taking this hit .

I believe Greg W . is coming to talk to you today about this new business . Further to this , I'd like to ask again how I can get access to VAR ( I believe Lavorato and Sherriff have $5 million they each keep upstairs and allocate to their businesses as needed temporarily) . Is this a Board question , or do you have the authority to allocate this VAR to me ? On another note , I've been helping Bill Bradford with PGE exposure issues . If you too need my help , let me know . Thanks for your help.. . Jeff
fine . thanks . Do you have copies of les annees 30 or 70 ?

so i had dinner with a college student . could you break up with mark and date me ? that would be very helpful . I really don't want to hear about someone's major for god sakes . should i put myself on ebay ?
was that last email the rudest thing i've ever said ? so sorry..... .
oh , i forgot to point out one more thing . aren't you a dragon and mark a dog ? should i call the ghostbusters ?
i'm ready to go . however , will this new system give a slower connect to eol , etc ?
hmmm . hadn't crossed my mind........my dinner tonight just got cancelled ! how about a walk/run/abroller marathon tonight ? drinks after .
I'm an 8 of clubs , and a gemini; checking on the chinese animal sign
i do not manage an eol stack .
you are a june birthday right ? i'm may , and i don't think i'm a dragon--it's done by birth year , no relation to zodiac . still checking.. .
ok , i'm laughing , thanks . but NOW you get it !
I saw him this morn , and asked if he called you . call him tomorrow or thurs , and i'll follow up..... .
Let's make sure she gets an offer . Thanks . Jeff
Howdy...How long has it been ? When are we going out ? How's everything up there ?
What a fun weekend ! Mine was a little boring . Did you dance at the club before or after you ate all those burgers ? How's the pooch ?
Did you see the second austin powers movie ? I just had lunch and I feel like Fat Bastard .
Thanks for the update on the sell weekend . It certainly sounds like there were positives and negatives . Going forward , I would like the commercial team under my direction to plan all future sell weekends , and similar recruiting functions . I did not get Skilling to agree to a $1,000,000 contribution to Wharton/Penn for us to not have a perfectly seamless weekend . We all agree to the strategic importance of Univ of Penn , and we are not going to blow it , or appear to blow it . I would like the Recruiting function and Commercial function to coordinate all logistics , etc. , however , given this was one of the worst sell weekends I have seen Enron put together , we all need to get together and come up with specific plans on who will be accountable for specific parts of the weekend . If anyone was hanging out in their hotel rooms , we were not doing our jobs , and I will take all responsibility going forward . I appreciate everyone's support and cooperation . Jeff
In town , most of the time . Is she ok ? ( I didn't know about the Lara Liebman part , though )
I'm free until 4-- come up with my new CD ! I'm off to Phila tomorrow morn , and ny thurs morn and will be back thurs night .
very interesting--did not know . when should you and I go out ?
great , whatever you like . what dates are good ?
can you tell i need to relax ?
FYI .
bingo . probably a little lounging as well
I'll get with mike m .
I knew you could . I knew you could . I knew you could .
Congrats! . Will get you involved . Jeff
Thanks for the email . Can you fax or email a resume to me . After I review , I'll reply with more info . Regards , Jeff

brignt and early--before 7 . NY was awsome . and your weekend ?
when we diverted the eco cargo , I saw we booked about $250k , and that eco made well over a million . how come we are not getting any ( much ) of that value ?
I need a report that shows new products and when they were added , in addition to this summary . thanks .
Both Stuart Staley,and Dan Reck are being moved to $175k base each . In looking across our vp . list , Mike and I felt like these are two of our top vp's , and we wanted to make an equity adjustment . They are low at the vp level within ews . Thanks . Jeff
Let's get together on this in the next couple of days . Thanks . Jeff
FYI . What do you think ?
How was the weekend ? Mine was good--I met Dennis Hopper , the actor . He is one cool dude . I'm thinking about taking a long weekend vacation . Where sounds fun ?

WHAT is this ?
Just to put me over the edge , I got a phone call last week from one of the gas trading h.r . people with respect to robin menear . she was listed as commercial support ( still ) and when I hired her last year , it was as a commercial manager . Your boy Brad McSherry didn't fix her class , even though this was a problem at mid year as well . Of course he told me it had been taken care of , but Hunter Shively showed up in my office last week to go over her history , and what my intent was when i hired her . he too was involved in the hiring decision . Shall i do brad's termination , or will you .
this was the guy that hired fred d'ambrosia back to enron after he was terminated for cause . a.g . is an ok guy but i'm not in love . i would however put him through the interview process . i'll follow up .
sorry for the confusion . my asst . printed it out and didn't print the orig email . can you resend it . thanks .
Come on . You should come to the tuesday traders' meeting . they've been really good . In 3321 4-5 each tuesday . I'll bring over a copy of the current book we are reading as enticement . It's not a corvette , but it's a good book .

Jeff , I understand you've been getting pricing from our crude/diesel traders for some of your transportation work . Please do not go directly to the traders , rather the structuring desk . Also , please coordinate your activites with Dan Reck who is running Enron Freight , dealing with all trucking and rail issues . We are acquiring a company that has relationships with many of the customers you've pitched . In most cases , we have been covering many of these customers from the energy side already . Thanks for your cooperation Jeff He's in London , by the way . Jeff
Hi Thor , Sorry you won't make our offsite , but a little vacation every so often is never a bad thing . I do have a question about Bjarne's promotion to director . When I look at the P&L for Oslo weather trading , you showed a loss of about $1 million , and I don't think that deserves this promotion . What else does he do ? I'm also concerned that neither Mark ( nor I ) had any notice of this . His promotion has caused some difficulty over here and I'd like to get this cleared up . Jeff
here is the note I sent to Thor . I'll wait for his response . Jeff
Thanks for the invite . I'd love to go with you guys . Jeff
his response . Jeff
put this on the calendar . Jeff

I'd like to leave out mention of our equity participation in the first and third paragraphs , and reword the second paragraph to state that envera's customers will have access to enron's products . ( leave out the qualifier "many" which I read as "partial" )
Have our PR people seen this ?
Another article from the competitive intelligence group . Jeff
Thanks for the clarification . Jeff
Hi Dave . As a follow up to out conversation , I found out Robert Rauschenburg will be here April 5 or 6 and the weekend ( April 7-8) . See how that looks on the calendar for y'all yankees to visit down here in rodeoland . ( I did go to the rodeo last night--hosted a big party--and wore my boots , and a cowboy hat my group gave me--pictures to follow ) Can you believe I went to the Rodeo ?
don't be surprised if i ask you guys to take off that friday , too , so that we can be a little flexible with Bob . R .
this is only one of the ads , right ?
Looks good . But should out first ad be one of the more aggressive ones ? Jeff
Jennifer B . please print , Jen F . please get this on the fundy's page....Jeff
an update for both Mike and I would be great . thanks . Jeff
As Mike and I look across all of our business units , we continue to look for optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to achieve it's targets for 2001 and beyond . In our weather business , there appears to be a lack of seamlessness . Reporting relationships , P&L , and vision for this business are not best aligned as this business exists today . Mike and I would like to address this as follows: we need 100% full time dedication from each and any employee that is dedicated to the weather business . All identified employees in the weather business will now become full time employees of EGM and report to Mark Tawney . Accordingly Mark and I will be looking at , with each of you , the employees that may be affected by this transition and the need to hire additional employees . It is important that both business units work together to determine which individuals will be in Weather , or will be in EEL . Once done , Mark will begin adding to the weather team in each of your regions . It is obvious that the organizations and product lines can lever each other and the synergy's will provide powerful results in our regional gas and power businesses in particular . If you look at coal , lng , equities , etc , we have employees based in each of your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM . This restructure will similarly align weather . Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues surrounding this new structure .
I'm still getting all the reports too late . I'd like a night clerk to put together the reports so that I have them by 7:30 am . Thanks . Jeff
Hi , hope things are well . I'd like to talk about LNG trading vessels ( merchant) . Have you been talking with Pierre about all of this activity . George Mclellan is concerned about the exmar contract , and wants Pierre more involved with the business . What do you think of this idea ? What are some of your thoughts regarding this business . Jeff
thanks for the update . I'll be here all day today and tomorrow . Jeff
I'm writing from houston ( TX ) and I cannot find anyone here who shows your furniture . Can you direct me to some one in this part of the country ? I have large outdoor spaces that I'd like to furnish with Brown Jordan . Thanks for your help . Jeff
I've asked craig breslau on the gas floor--a senior marketer ( VP ) who is well versed in this to give the lunch . Pete De Leeuw was happy a senior Enron person could get there on short notice . Regards Jeff
yes , eric can get on the trader track . put some numbers together for these guys , and get back to me...Jeff
please get on distribution and put on web site . thanks . Jeff
I did receive an envelope from you last evening . No problem to postpone our meeting . However , when should I pick up the car ? Best , Jeff
tomorrow afternoon would be best . thanks . Jeff
I'd love to fly dan down ( at our expense ) to have him meet some appropriate people . Let him know he should call me to figure out the best time to get him down here....have to go now though.......hugs Jeff
I'm not sure our plan is to collapse the LNG shipping group into coal ( I presume you mean under Pierre) . However , we have to look at our internal and external options . If you look at the structure of the exmar vessell it is certainly far from ideal for enron . In fact it appears to be quite one-sided . First we must look at what we want this group to be , and examine what skills each of the internal players can bring to the table--(including Pierre and Wayne) . Second estabish internal procedure , and trading capabilities . Third , execute . I would agree that LNG shipping is a unique animal , but before we hire anyone externally , I'd like to get everyone together to discuss the most appropriate way forward . Thanks . Jeff
Great to hear from you . Office number 713 853 1761 . Home 713 523 5077 . Give a ring when you can , and I'll get you set up for the summer . Jeff
Your thoughts are dead on . Russel would be a great guy to cover those guys for EGM for crude and products . Please mention to Caroline we are not trying to crowd her out , just get more depth on funds coverage . Also , when we talk about other GRM products , it will help to have more fund coverage . ( We can also address her issue later--I agree with you on that. ) Proceed , but I'm not sure about the JV with ENA issue . Let's not go down that road "officially" . By the way , rough is spelled roof . Later.... . Jeff
Thanks for the email . You make some good points . I'm still working with HR to address your bonus . Thanks for your patience , but we'll get there . Jeff
Any time you'd like to get here . I'll be happy to set you up with a strong schedule . I'm glad you finally met Per . He's been a little busy since I reorg'd the group and put him in charge . Thanks for your patience , however . Jeff

Very different hotels . It is one of Paris' palace hotels right in the middle of of the city .

Cool . They sell their music CD's at the front desk . They may even have two out . Would you mind picking them up for me ? I'll pay you back , I promise . If you have time , check out the gym/pool/message in the basement of the hotel--it's great . Also try to get a room overlooking the interior courtyard , and don't change money at the hotel--they'll bend you as only the french can . Have a great time.....and definitely hang out in the lounge of the hotel . Jeff . PS , would you mind swinging over to the Hermes and pick me up a briefcase?--they're about $5,000 or so . Great , thanks .

Hi guys . I wanted to let you know that I am extremely concerned about the Associate/Analyst program , so much so that I feel all the work I have done , and all the time I have spent on the program has had little impact outside Wharton/Penn recruiting . In fact we won't get more than 1 associate from Wharton this year for a variety of internal and external reasons . This program has brought incredible talent into the organization , but we have lost a lot of momentum over the last two years . In as much as I would like to continue to support the program , I can't in its current form , and don't have time to fix what I thought we had been addressing . The entire program is disfunctional , and the commercial teams are not lending support to the program . I'd be very happy to spend a few minutes of your time ( rather than blather on in an email ) to give you both my overview of the program , and suggest changes and improvements . You know you have my support , but the current state of affairs down there has gotten me to my rope's end with the program .
Any pumping you can do would be appreciated . Thanks . Jeff
Is this something you or Doug F. , or someone should attend ? Jeff
thanks for the note , as I did not know there was a meeting tonight . I saw the show this passed weekend , and will try to make it tonight . Jeff

The remaining $209,784 will be relesed by the end of the week . We are awaiting word on whether or not this value will be needed for credit reserve . Thanks , Errol McLaughlin , X5-8274

Hey ! I hope you are having a good day . I hate that I missed you last night . We had a good time at the game . The seats we had were on the floor behind the basket on the visiting team's side of the court . We were all drinking and acting a fool so the cameraman put us up on the big screen . A few of us went out after the game , so I am pretty tired today . Being the alcoholic that I am , you know I couldn't just have one drink ( ha ha) . I didn't want anything special . I just wanted to catch you before you left Be careful , and I'll talk to you tonite . See you soon ,
I'm there .

How are you doing ? I hope your day is going well . Let me apologize for anything I said last night , because I don't remember anything . We went out for a COUPLE of drinks with a recruit , and I forgot that I only got 2 hours of sleepTuesday night . I had 2 beers and 2 shots and was at home by 10 PM , but Tuesday nite took its toll . I sat down for 5 minutes and only woke up when I heard the cell phone ring . I only remember picking the phone up to call you , but I don't remember anything I said ( I'm so sorry!) . Have a good rest of the day and call me when you get home . ELM

I've been here for a little over a year now . It's a great job and company , but the hours are unbelievable!! ! The family's good . How are Janna , Gina , ( sp ) and your mom .

Call me when you get a minute! ! Errol L . McLaughlin Lead - Financial Trading Risk Mgmt Enron North America Voice: 713-345-8274

This morning it was discovered that a portion of John Arnold's Gas Daily position was being captured incorrectly as a February fixed price position instead of a February Index position . I am currently working on the problem and the positions will be captured correctly tonight . John is aware of the situation and has stated that V@R does not need to be re-run . Thanks , Errol L . McLaughlin
Let me know as soon as possible when you can do Sherry's review and the others as well , so I can get with Liz to schedule something that works for everyone . They want the regular ones to be done by the end of next week , and Sherry's has to be done by Jan 19 , 2001 . Thanks -- I know it's a pain , Errol
Frank , After looking the packet over in detail , I found the questions to be a great tool , especially the ones aimed at the 'soft skills' . Previously when interviewing people I always struggled for a way to ask these type of questions legally and ethically . I think the packet also will aid in my organization and will keep the interview moving at an efficient pace . Thanks , Errol McLaughlin
Jeff , For a long time John and Mike have been letting counterparties who accidentally click on the Gas Daily stack change the deals to NYMEX swaps . The counterparty would let John/Mike know and then they would tell us . In addition , at the end of the month , we would get calls from settlements and credit telling us ( per the counterparty ) that there were more deals that needed to be changed from GD to Nymex than we had changed . John would let them change those deals too . On Friday we changed some Jan . `01deals with Utilicorp that had been done in late November to NYMEX swaps . Because of the timing there was a P/L impact of -$1.3MM . When John saw this today he asked me what it was , I explained , and he stated that what they click on is what they get . I relayed this to settlements and credit and that is why Kim is calling you b/c Reliant and Utilicorp are 'upset' . They claim that they have John and Mike on tape letting them out of the GD deals and into NYMEX swaps . We do not change the actual deals booked by EOL . We book two new legs that create a NYMEX swap and flip out the GD deal . Errol
Yes this is correct . This is the reason Sherry and Amy have to flip out deals everyday . EOL is only booking them to one leg . Thanks , Errol
The deals below were changed tonight per John Arnold . Thanks , Errol McLaughlin
Greg , Deal QD 8473 is not a Reliant deal , nor is it an EOL Gas Daily swap . Deal QE 7484 was changed to a NYMEX swap today and QE 9432 was changed on 01/04/2001 . Errol McLaughlin
Done .
Sharon , How do I call you ? Each time I call you back , the phone goes to cover and there is no message , so I can't leave you a message . Thanks , Errol
Maurice and Demetrius are doing great , and they just found out that they're pregnant ! My dad is still working --- I think they are going to have to drag him out kicking and screaming .

Mark , Deals NZ9791 and NZ9950 were done between John Arnold ( gas floor ) and Fletch Sturm ( power desk) . Deals done between desks inside Enron do not have deal tickets , nor do they get confirmed . The details for these deals were included in the information picked up Friday . I apologize for not relaying this sooner , but all question regarding the Management book ( P&L , etc. ) need to be directed to Georganne Hodges at Attached below is the forwards detail that you requested for the LTX GD book for 12/7/01 and for the NG Price book for 12/19/2001 . I am getting confirms on the deals in the table below and will call you as soon as I get them . Please be advised that these deals are in the forwards details that I have already given you . Also , deals QE6558 & QF4044 will not have confirms b/c they are intra-desk deals within Enron .
Bianca , Could you please fax up to me confirms for the following deals: I'm gathering these for Arthur Andersen auditing purposes , so it would be a great help if I could get this pretty quickly . The fax # is 646-2496 . Thanks , Errol
I had the same problems with this that you all do . That is why I told Gossett that if this is something that has to happen , then only people like Joe Hunter and 1or 2 others should be allowed to change the c/p names ONLY . Errol Enron Capital Management

The file consists of a summary worksheet for each month and a detail worksheet for each month . Please feel free to call , or have Homer call , with any questions that you have .

The previous two nights I have attempted to split out the Positions and P&L as we discussed . I now feel confident in the Positions part of this process ( Mike's swaps in the Exotic book , new blotters , etc.) .

John , In the Position folder . I saved a file called 'GammaFile' . The worksheet we looked at is called "calculator" . The password is: price . Thanks , Errol

Deal NN6788.1 with Citibank has been killed . This was an EOL deal that Citibank and John Arnold agreed to cut in half . Deal QF9221.1 was booked in Dec . for half the volume of the original deal . Unfortunately , deal NN6788.1 was not killed when we booked the new deal . Please call me with any questions . Thanks , Errol , X5-8274
It looks like the unwind was booked incorrectly . Instead of deal QF9221.1 netting out the original deal , it was adding to it . I have killed deal NN6788.1 for 5000/day , so that all that is left is the deal for 2500/day . Errol

Irena , The team provides us with great service currently . The only area of improvement I can think of regards new-hires . I need to give you and your team a better heads-up when I have new someone coming on . If we could come up with a checklist of everything they need ( computers , phones , basic supllies , etc. ) and have them already at there desk when they start , that would help . I know that the last few people that have come on were last minute additions , so there is not much we could have done . Hopefully , we won't have as many space issues in the future . I really appreciate the work the team is doing currently . I will work hard to give you more lead time when I am adding someone to the group . Thanks , Errol
Jeremy , John and I really need to meet Tuesday for about 30min-1hr with you Dave and Sanjeev , so that we can better understand how the options are being calc'd in the system . We thought we had a pretty good idea after talking on Friday , but tonight we see that we don't . John is about one half million dollars off every night in his prediction of the P/L for Mike's book , and we're afraid our position might not be correct as well . Please give me a call . Thanks , Errol , X5-8274
Irena , Thanks , Errol

Sue , I am sending you this e-mail because I received your voice message well after you left it today . I reviewed the text files that are sent out by the book administrators on my desks and none of them contain any deals booked to the counterparty El Paso Gas Marketing . All of the deals from people on my desk are booked to the valid El Paso counterparty per our conversations . I will be out of the office tomorrow , but I will be checking my voicemail frequently and communicating with my group . If the same problem arises tomorrow , please call me at 713-305-1502 so that we can discuss , because there has to be some other explanation for the erroneous counterparty showing up on your report . Thank you , Errol McLaughlin , X5-8274
Jeff , The spa at the MET has gift certicates for manicures , pedicures , massages , etc . Errol
I looked at the Gas Daily swaps and they look good . QV0345 booked as a June deal instead of May 01 . The NYMEX swap booked with NXB2 as the expiration . If I'm not mistaken , the swaps should be NX1 . Thanks , Errol

Frank , Attached is a forwards detail of a Sithe deal from 1993 . It is an annuity totalling $234MM . Let me know if this is the deal you were looking for . Thanks , Errol , X5-8274
Frank , I'm sorry , but disregard the first message I sent . The $234MM value I alluded to is not the value for the one deal booked with a 1993 deal date . This value represents the MTM value for all active deals w/ Sithe . I'm still working to find a deal like your requested . I'll let you know . Thanks , Errol

Don't know what time on Monday .
Jeff , The day after Thanksgiving is NXB4 . We ( Price-Desk ) have some special procedures we have to follow regarding swaption expiration . Other than that , it should not be that different from a non-bidweeek day . I apologize , I thought the 23rd was going to be NXB3 . In December , the day after Christmas ( Wednesday ) is NXB2 and the Friday before that is NXB3 . Monday and Tuesday are exchange holidays . Thanks , Errol

I don't know anything about CES trades being sold to New Power Co . I looked in TAGG at the trades in the spreadsheet , and they look like normal swaps . No one has called before this to say confirms were not signed or anything of that nature , so I can't see any reason they have not to pay . Let me know how I can help . Errol
Done . Thanks , Errol

John , After we spoke tonite , I found an error on a Bravo Natural Resources deal we put in last week . This is the deal where we spaced out the premium over Cal`02 & `03 . A premium was inadvertantly added on the sale leg of the deal . Taking off this premium resulted in a $448,773 loss . I apologize for the error . We just found it today , when Derek was catching up from being out on Th & Fri . Thanks , Errol
I will be there .
Heather , Can you do me a favor . The Reward Bucks application I filled out , was for Michelle Nelson . I will be out all of next week . If you get it next week can you have it sent to her . She sits behind me at 3249B . Her extension is X5-8091 . Thanks , Errol , X5-8274

John , Are the 24 hr gas stacks going to be running on Thanksgiving and the Friday after ( 11/22 , 11/23)? . EOL is asking . Thanks , Errol
hilarious
I am sorry . I wasn't trying to push Meliza into our lunch . That's why I was asking how much 'shop' you wanted to talk . I feel awful now . I thought it would be fun . We can grab a conference after we get back ( or tommorow ) and talk if you'd like . Unfortunately , we have been put on a hiring freeze b/c of everything that is going on . We brought on three new people on Monday , but they were interviewed and hired about 1 month ago . We've lost three people since the merger announcement , but we cant fill their spots w/ new people . Your resume looks good . You're correct , these jobs are demanding on your personal time . This is especially true when you first start . This is something you would have to talk over w/ the manager that you interviewed with to see how demanding the book is that they wanted to put you on . We can talk more later . Thanks , Errol
Francis , Could you do this again for me please . The post i.d . is 1403067 . The month is February 2003 . Thanks , Errol

Hi Melinda , Is there a catalog that we may look at ? Thanks
on the 32nd floor . come through the wooden doors and make a left and you'll see me !
This transation is for delivery on ANR Pipeline Company's Mainline 7 Segment , and as such , all deliveries shall be made utilizing firm transportation to a designated secondary delivery point ( Buyer's choice" ) on ANR's system . In the event that Enron is unable to deliver to the designated secondary delivery point ,  Buyer shall be responsible for designating an alternate delivery point .
Girl , so now you see ! Karen just has issues ! So how are you doing ? I was on vacation on Friday and didn't get a chance to respond until today . We were in Chicago this weekend for my husband's family reunion . The weather was great compared to Texas . Texas is so hot! ! How's Christian doing ? My boys are doing pretty good , just growing so fast . Tell me more about Karen whenever you get a chance . See ya !
Nothing has happened , it seems like he's trying to stick close to home . I came in on Monday night and went upstairs , because I frankly , did not want to talk and did not want to get mad in front of Jordan . I was furious and I still am furious . Last night we had choir rehearsal , so he was in bed when i came back . I really don't want to talk to him right now . I'll keep you posted , because I will be doing it hopefully , tonight ! See you later .
Hi Calvin I spoke with Rickey ( boy , is he long-winded!!) . Gave him the name of our credit guy , Russell Diamond . Thank for your help !
Hi , How's it going ? You realize we missed our PLAYDAY for the kids this week . We need to make sure we get on schedule for next week . Sometimes the Tuesday night choir rehearsal takes so much out of me and the boys , that sometimes we spend Wednesday recuperating ( i.e . getting the boys and myself to bed early) . It's always so much better when Todd is not working and he can keep them . Girl , what did you think of that Jon P . Kee song that Joe and that girl were singing on Tuesday . The choir really wasn't into that one . We just could not muster up a good sound ! Are you going to the groundbreaking ceremony ? If so , let's see if some of us want to have lunch together before we head to the tent ! I'm 75% sure that I will be attending . Talk to you later .
I spoke with Carol on Friday and supposdly their wedding coordinator found a room at Embassy Suites for $39 per night . It's supposed to be at I-17 and Greenway , wherever that is . I'll belive that when I see it . I probably will not bring the kids , it just seems like such a hassle . I can understand Mom not wanting to miss work , so it seems like it will be a girls weekend . I have not checked on flight arrangements yet , but I'll let you know . I still want to leave on Thursdat night , so we have time for site seeing . How much was the ticket ?
I think we should all stay in the same room , especially if we get a suite at embassset suites , with a pull-out bed . We checked it out and I can get there are 7:30 p.m . on America West on Thursday . The rate is $305.00 , a little pricey . Did I tell you that Shawna wants us to come to the rehearsal dinner ? I'm trying to figure out when we're going to site see .
Give me another couple of days , we're still checking . Did I tell you that Carol told me she was waiting on a $1.5 million loan to come through so she could pay for Shawna's wedding , as well as take care of her business . So you know we may get down there and there may not be a big wedding , ( girl , you know how that goes , now who in the hell is going to lend her that kind of money? ) You know Carol and Shawna are doing some type of financing of real estate , or something like that . Ralph West came to our groundbreaking ceremony we had on Sunday and delivered a sermonette . He is awesome . I told him I enjoyed his sermon , and he mentioned that he was leaving for Omaha the next day . Do you have acrobat on your computer ? I'll try to send you picture to see if it comes out . Talk with you later .
Hi Dexter ! Here you are !
So nice to hear from you . Everything here is hot , hot , hot , 107 degrees today . Nothing new going on here , the boys are doing great , just getting really big . I'm taking Kendall to the Dr . today to see if he has an ear infection , he was up most of the night last night ( rats!) . Jordan is so cool , he taking gynmastics again and loving it . Kendall is my little roughneck! , he reminds me of myself , he's hysterical . I am so glad I have them!!! ! The wedding in Phoenix should be alot of fun , I think it's just going to be Mom , Me and Nelle I think . I'm leaving the kids with Todd . Todd has a new job where he works 12 hour shifts . In fact , he's working with Ken Cowan , but anyway it could be from 6 am to 6 pm or 6 pm to 6am , It sucks when he's working nights , but he really likes it . Anyway , we're supposed to be leaving early today and believe me I am ready to roll . Anyway take care , talk with you soon !
I have booked my flights , I leave on Thursday , November 2nd at 5:45 p.m . and arrive in Phoenix at 7:31 p.m . on Continental . I leave on Sunday at 11:27 a.m . and arrive in Houston at 3:00 p.m . How was the picnic ? We finally got some decent weather yesterday and its supposed to continue through the weekend . See you later .

Hi Rev . Jackson How's it going ? I'm sure I'll be seeing you tonight at choir rehearsal , but I was curious if anything new happened on the choir director front ? Let me know if you get this e-mail in time to respond . I'll be leaving at 5:00 directly . See you tonight !
Good afternoon Rev . Jackson . So nice to hear from you , I'm glad we';ve got this e-mail business figured out . Hope your day is going well . Sometime , please tell me what "A Day in the Life of Rev . Jackson" is like at SWCBC . Do you see alot of people all day long ( during the day) ? So often , it's hard to picture the church as being active all day long . It just seems like people attend meetings and services about twice a week in the evenings . Funny , how we get perceptions in our heads . My day is going pretty good so far , I'm back to making money in my "book" here at work and it sure feels good . I've always remembered what you told me during my "crisis period" and always keep those things in mind . The one that I like the best is "Just keep your mind stayed on him , He'll keep you in perfect peace" . I take that with me everywhere I go . Well , anyway , thanks for the words of encouragement . Appreciate it !
Hi Jewel , Sorry , I was not available to visit with you when you called the other day , but things have been extremely busy around here , and plus , there is very little room for privacy . In answer to your question , there are no special requirements . Back in the day , they would have been looking for actual pipeline scheduling experience , but anymore , the liquidity for gas schedulers is so low , that they will consider most people , with an analytical or coordinative type background . I think it's one of those things that once you "get your foot in the door" , you can move on from there . Just be aware , that if you were to become a gas scheduler , it may require working on weekends , and late nights from time to time . As far as the next step , I would suggest that you just simply send an e-mail to George Smith , Manager of Logistics on the Central Desk , and ask him if he has time to visit with you . I think that by simply expressing an interest , and learning what his expectations are of a scheduler , and also , learning what you can expect to learn from him , should serve as the first step . Also , if he is interested , and does not have a position currently open , then he will pass on your name to some of the other managers . They're actually pretty good about that ! I'll mention to George that you may give him a call . Let me know if you have any further questions , or want to visit some more ! Take care !
Judy , I thought I was through , but I'm not.....Can you please send up the the following contracts: Wisconsin Power & Light 96045691 Also , if someone in my group has already checked it out and returned to you , just tell me who had it and I'll copy off of them ( smile!!) . Also , do you have a copy of the GTC . We have no idea what it is , and we're looking for the non-performance language associated with it . Thanks !
Here are the rates that Midwestern and NGPl gave to me about a week ago . I'll double-check the rates this afternoon . Talk with you later
Just tried to call you . Please call me before you leave , and yes , you probably need to leave , but where will you go ? If you go straight hme , emotions are running too high for it to be a safe environment right now . I'm not trusting his reactions or your own right now . You are hurting and sometimes that will cause us to do things that we normally would not do . Please do not put yourself in that position!!! ! Please call me !
Hey Home , Just a note to tell you thanks again for being my "roaddog" . It really helped me out ! You're the "bomb" !
Hey baby , Getting back to the Alliance issue , what is happening . I know I have my nerve because I was supposed to provide a list . Sorry , I forgot , but anyway.....................here's a list: PGLC Dave Wear 312-240-4554 Duke John Alrich 713-260-8578 You know the rest . Call me when you get a chance
Girl , you know he's lying . He's a trip , but it was a good sermon .
Thanks for the note . Will you work tomorrow and the weekend ?
Where are you going ?
I just sent you along e-mail , let me know if it came over , I hope so , it took me 20 minutes to type it !
Thanks for the note , that was very sweet of you . I always believe in helping wherever I can , b/c the next day it'll be me !
How are you ? Hope everything is going well . Did you receive my response to your last e-mail ? I wasn't sure if it transmitted or not . Nothing new going on here . I have a week of vacation scheduled for the week of October 16th . I really haven't made any plans , but maybe we'll go visit my family in Omaha . It's really hard for me to plan , b/c I may have to work some of the week . I'm not sure yet , so I hate to plan a vacation that may have to be interrupted . Church services were really good this past sunday , Pastor preached a good sermon . Talk with you later
Girl , you are good , how much do I owe ?
Hi Nellie , What's happening ? I sent you and Momma some new pictures of the boys , if you have not received yet , you should receive either today or Tuesday . I made the hotel reservations for Phoenix at the Embassey Suites , the rate is $159.00 per night , pretty expensive , but the Nascar is in town , and we can split it three ways . Hopefully , there is a sofa sleeper in the room , although I did not ask , I asked for two queen beds , in case there is not . Now I just need to get the car reserved and we're all set . I spoke with Shawna on Friday and asked her to check with her wedding coordinator to see if she could improve that rate , so far I have not heard anything back from her yet , nor am I holding my breath . She said her colors are burgundy and gold , if I remember correctly . Jordan is still taking gymnastics and his coach came over and told me that Jordan was so good , that he would like Jordan to be in an accelerated class for his age group . This class is called the "Hope Team" and it gets the kids ready for competition . I did not realize he was that good , although I could clearly see that he was the best in his class ( proud Mom) . I called to inquire about the cost , and the receptionist quickly told me" Ma'm you have to be invited to be in that class , you just can't enroll , and I said , yes , ma'm we have been invited to enroll , thank you very much!" Well , anyway , we'll see b/c the class is from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m . each day . We'll see , I know he would really enjoy it . Kendall is enrolled for his first gynmastics class beginning October 23rd . I was thinking he would really enjoy it , but the more I think about it , he'll probably want to be in Jordan's class ( oh boy!!) . I spoke with Daddy last week , and he's supposed to be checking into possibly getting tickets to come down for Thanksgiving . Let me know what you're hearing ? Talk to you later .
Hi , Welcome back , I trust you had a good vacation.Nothing much going on here , just huge price moves . Anyway , everything we well , for the most part . As far as Alliance gas is concerned , the only new information is that the Aux Sable commissioning process will not start until Wednesday ( last estimate ) per Anne Buschal . So make sure to mention to Hunter on Monday , as everyone else should already know about it . Anne's number is 403-517-6270 . She will be calling each Morning . My logon and password is: pmims and louise8mom . Please look at the Nigas Troy Grove Sheet that I have on my computer . My position should be around 15 long , just enough to cover rolloff for 2 days . If its not , please buy/sell to get me close to that number ( or whatever is best depending on which way the market is going) . P.S . I'm selling to Clark Refining at the Illini Point , 4,000/day @ Sitara # 436296 . He wants us to keep them on until he calls to tell us otherwise . His number is 314-854-9644 Dteve Brown . I'll be back on Wednesday .
When I remember to put a new book oif checks in my purse , do you want me to make it out to you or give you cash !
Okay , I'll send it via the mail . I like your new hair style , it looks good !
Can we make sure we set up that appointment today ? Let me know .
yes , cool !
Chicago is $0.125 an Dawn is $.245 .
That's so sweet of you to let me know , but we will not be there this weekend , we just went about two weekends ago . I'm thinking about taking the kids to this farm out in my part of town . My understanding is that it is open to the public , but I'm trying to get the name of the place . Diane Cook has taken her kids there , so I'll let you know more about it when I receive the info . Jordan has decided that he wants to help feed the farm animals!!! ! ( He'll probably be scared to death once we get there! ) I noticed Kreme had their Halloween party at school yesterday . What costumes did the kids where ?
Yes , that's fine ! --- Is it inside the terminal or do I have to drag around on a bus to find it . You know the cheap ones are like that !
Here is a copy of my itinerary . Please forward acopy of yours so that we may coordinate . Thanks
Hey baby!! ! Here you go!! !
Sorry , forgot the attachment !
November , 2000 prices
Sorry , I arrive on Continental 1505 at 7:31 p.m . and I leave on Sunday at 11:30 p.m . on Continental .
Hey girl , I know you've been busy and I can certainly understand that ! It's been up and down over here , but I'm hanging ! Hope everything is going well with you . Did the kids enjoy Halloween ? My kids sure did . I did not realize that we did not have rehearsal last Tuesday because of Halloween . I wasn't going anyway ! Don't forget I leave for Phoenix tonight for my cousin's wedding , so I'll be back on Sunday afternoon . Talk with you later .
Girl , I'm on my way to the airport in about 15 minutes ! I'll leave the phone on !
Hey Girl , I'm back and I had a wonderful time . Phoenix is a nice city and very easy to get around in . The weather was a little chillier than Houston , and as a result I have a little cold and sore throat . The wedding was very nice . The wedding itself was in a small church , but somewhat elegant . The reception was "the bomb" . It was in a real nice resort and it was money , money , money . I was really wondering where my cousin got all of the money . She had a reception for around 150 to 250 people . I'm not good at looking at a crowd and judging , but I bet it was around that many folks there . She had a buffet dinner ( mainly sandwiches , but they were good) , all kind of party favors , beautiful cake , 5 layers and each layer was something different , a band , a dj and a comedian that had been on BET that they flew in from Dallas . It was really nice . Again , I hope she did not go into too much debt , but it was nice . She had a really wonderful time and she was a nice-looking bride . We went shopping and sight-seeing . We even went to go find the grade school that we attended and the house that we lived in when we lived in Phoenix many , many years ago . It was alot of fun actually remincescing ( you know what word I'm trying to say) . Did you go to church Sunday ? If so , how was it ? I really did miss not going to church . How was the rest of your weekend ? Kids and Steve doing okay ? I can't wait to see you tomorrow night , it seems likes it been a long time . Talk to you later . I will be home tonight , so I'll call you or you call me when we get the kids wound down !
Boy , it looks like this is really going to be a tight , tight , race . As far as your other issue , I would just say very professionally , that "there are 3 subjects that you are uncomfortable talking about , and they are voting , religion and salaries." and just keep it at that . You also might want to add" I hope you can respect my stand on these subjects." That way , you've communicated your desires in a concise , professional manner . Talk to you later !
Girl , isn't that sad about the election results and the recount . It's really terrible . Everybody over here is watching it very , very closely . They really want Bush to win in a bad way . I'm tired of hearing about it ! How are things over your way . My day yesterday was okay , Todd cooked us dinner before he went to work , I was shocked , but appreciative . I think I might go car shopping this weekend if the weather is nice . Speaking of church , do you know that Robin told m that Greg lives in million dollar house ? Remember when Hope said that his light bill was super high , it probably was correct ! We'll need to do a "drive-by" one of these days . I want to see this house ! Talk to you later .
Hi Mark , I would like to creat a product for Enron Online for trades on Alliance Pipeline . As you probably know , Alliance is a new pipeline scheduled to start commercial service effective November 13 , 2000 . As with any new pipeline , this date may or may not be pushed back to a later date . I would like to create a product that has a description that addresses the uncertainty of the start-up date of Alliance Pipeline and simply states that gas will commence flowing when the pipeline goes commecial . Please let me know if you have language that addresses this situation . I would like to get this product set up as soon as possible . Thank you
When you here from Hope , please let me know what she says about Greg's house and get the address and I'll print out the MapQuest .
Girl , did you see Jesse Jackson on TV . You know how they have the news on around here , and Jesse came on and said , "In order to have a RECOUNT , you have to have the FIRST COUNT , and it's not a black and white issue , its a wrong or right issue" . Always trying to rhyme ! Can you believe that idiot . I was too embarassed and kind of acted like I wasn't paying attention . I understand that Jesse is "down for the cause" , but his credibility is suffering , because he's involved in every DAMN thing . If you're an authority on everything , you cannot be passionate about much at all . He's something else . He needs to pick his campaigns to bolster up his credibility!!! !
What's up with this guy . I guess he called Mr . Palmer . How did that come about ! He really feels as though he's been mistreated . I don't understand him !
Hey girl , What's happening ? Girl , remind me , just in case I have a memory lapse , that I will never , ever go back over to that church again . It's a nice , small church , but those folks crack me up . Last time I went , Sharon Mahon , sat next to me and just really acted a fool and had me roaring . This time , those fools sitting by me ( audrey and Doren ) had me laughing , especially Audrey . They're fools ! I was so embarassed that my chuckle came out ! So , just remind me , I will never go back over there . I sure hate that you missed seeing the baptismal pool ! Boy , what a difference a day makes in the weather . Last night , Todd cleaned out the closet , because of the potential tornado threat . I was a little unnerved , especially with the kids . I had the kids put on their shoes and socks and whatnot , just in case something happened . I was a praying sister . That really scared me . Then , to top it off , the weather got really cold this morning ! Oh well , talk with you later !
Hey Rev . Jackson , Hello sir , how are you ? Well , I tell you Pastor really outdid himself yesterday . I really enjoyed his sermon . He really has a knack for weaving a story and making it applicable to today's events , etc . Tasha and I got so tickled , watching you sing that song . You did very well . We said , "Look at Rev . Jackson , he's jammin" . Well , anyway , talk to you later !
So hello , What happened at rehearsal last night ? I did not make it , partly because I was tired and I had several errands to take care of . I needed to stop by K-Mart and the grocery store last night to get things I really needed , and just did not want to be out late . Let me know!! ! Talk to you later . P.S . is everthing else going okay ?
Yes , Sorry , forgot to mention it to you , but nothing was set in stone . In fact , I initiated the invitation on behalf of me and you . Are you free? , are they free? , I don't even know if I'm free . What did they say ?
That's news to me ! I don't think I like Razoo's . I'll have to see if I'm available .
So , I'm glad we see "eye-to-eye" on that one regarding Razoo's !  Robin and Anna have the strangest way of doing things . I asked Robin at least two weeks ago , and she said she had to get with Anna , and now she's telling you that they're ready and haven't said anything in the way of confirmation to me . Let me see if I can get ahold of her and then we'll talk again , because at this point , I'll need a sitter b/c Todd has the work Friday night , and he'll be tired on Saturday ( although that's no problem) . But , like last time , I don't want to go if you can't go . Let me try and call her and we'll talk later . So are you free on Saturday ? Also , everything is going okay over here , the market is down severely this morning , so we'll see !
Hey thanks for the info . Ann , from Alliance , said that 160,000 MMBtu/d went to Peoples , so , it's all making sense . Thanks again !
I can't do anything on Tuesday nights , but let me know about Monday . I just need a couple of days notice .
Hey guys , Here is the activity sheet for November . All activity is for the Balancing Agreement only!!!! ! I am planning to inject approximately 15,000 MMBtu per day for the rest of the month and that should put me in a pretty good position . Please respond when you have a minute . Thanks
Sorry , it took so long ! It's kind of hard to say , but just say that during an altercation . ..... , but you do not have to say with who , I really don't know , but let me know what you come up with . How much detail are they looking for with the Police report !
This is super fantastic!! ! See , it all pays off ! I can't wait to talk with you and find out more about it ! Let me know if you are rolling tonight !
We sold Steve a package of 10,000 at the Nipsco city gate . Thanks for your help !
It's about time , but well worth the wait . He's is soooooo cute !
Bobbi , Attached are the final numbers for the interruptible balancing for November , 2000 . I have also attached a tentative schedule for December , 2000 for both the firm and interruptible . Those schedules will probably be revised once we get through December 1st nominations and "boo-boos" . Thanks
Attached are the Chicago prices . The Michcon and Consumers are coming later .
No , but let me see what I can come up with . It's early now , so it will be about another hour before they start to show up here in the office . I'll let you know .
Greg set me up a nice little sheet . So here is the updated version with new volumes !
Please see attached !
Girl , you cracked me up talking about the "holler" .  Now you know I don't know . It was raggedy because we did not sing it with the lead . He probably won't spring it on you Sunday , because we did not do that good without you there . I am so tired from last night . Everything is so rushed , and I did not get the kids in bed until 10:35 and then I had to get them up at 6:00 a.m . I'm tired , so I know they are . On top of all of that , the market is up another $1.00 today ( yeah!!) , but we have to stay late tonight to go over our positions as a group . My boss said that we will all stay until it's done , so make arrangements . Naturally , Todd is working the evening shift , so I'm trying to work something out with my girlfriend and her daughter . They just live right down the street . So we'll see ! Talk with you later !
Hi Melba , While we're in the midst of creating new products , will you please set up a new product called: NGPL North Shore Gas Company . The description should be: The interconnection between Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America and North Shore Gas Company .  It should be mapped to Chicago . I would like to use this product tomorrow as well . Thanks for your help ! P.S . Also , you may just use North Shore Gas for the decriptor . Thanks
Please attached !
What's happening ? I know you've been busy , I remembered that Thursday night is Ciera's ( spelling? ) review night . Everything is well here at work and at home . I 'm leaving early today , probably , around 3:00 p.m . We've had a pretty good week and we're ready to go home and start over next week. . Next week is really supposed to be cold here and in the Midwest , so it will really be a busy work week . I think I might try to stop at the mall sometime today , whether it be late tonight ( you know they're open until 11:00 p.m . I think ) or right after work . I will pick up a gift certificate from Victoria's Secret for Samantha if I make it out . Do you want to go in on it , I was going to spend about $25 ( believe me , she is looking for a gift!) . Have you made a decision on the Christmas Party ? We're still going to mine , but girl , we have to take the kids over to Todd's mother and she lives in Bear Creek and then drive all the way back to Enron Field . My regular babysitter could not do it . Anyway , holler at me !

How are you doing today ? Boy , isn't it cold!!!!! ! I don't think I will be at choir rehearsal tonight because of work . Isn't the Christmas program Sunday ? I can't believe we are so ill-prepared . We've only had two non-dedicated practices for the program . We are required to spend the night downtown tonight ( I'll be at the Double Tree Allen Center ) because of the impending icy streets and the fear of not being able to get in tomorrow morning . It's supposed to rain or lightly mist tonight between 11:00 p.m . and 8:00 a.m . The streets are supposed to be treacherous if this thing materializes , so be very careful , in fact , you might want to talk with your supervisor to come up with a contingency plan for the weather . Anyway , that's all for now , talk with you later !
Hey Daddy , What a very pleasant surprise to hear from you in the middle of the day!! ! Things here are a little exciting , they are asking us to spend the night in one of the hotels downtown , as the streets are supposed to ice over tonight . So quite naturally , nobody's mind is on work , it's on the weather . So needless to say , I have a little bit of time on my hands . The boys are going over to Grandma Springer's house tonight to spend the night and Todd and I will just stay downtown . I understand that you guys had some bad weather as well , I know Mom was out of school . I will definitely go and get the Tekno dog for the kids , they will enjoy it so much . Kendall celebrated his 2nd birthday yesterday and had fun . Todd bought him a mini basketball goal and he really thinks he's a big boy now . It's really cute . On the other hand , Jordan was feeling a little neglected because of Kendall's cake and presents , but he's okay . It was just a new experience , him not getting anything while his brother gets new toys . Anyway , I'll send your tape . See you later and I hope you're still taking your medicine on a timely basis Love Bernie
Scott , Finally , here's the resolution on the Coenergy invoice for April , 1999 . Coenergy is telling me that the we need to pay the difference $2.90 vs . $2.74 on 10,000 MMBtu per day . If this is true , please pay the difference of $0.155 to Coenergy on a volume of 10,000 MMBtu per day for April , 1999 . If your understanding is different , please let me know , but otherwise please pay the difference . Thank you for your patience , and sorry it took so long to resolve .
Hi Darla , Could you please help me out ? Someone from Nicor called me last week and said we had a discrepancy for September business . All he said was that there is a difference of $176,836 that we owe them . Can you give me a general idea of what the discrepancy is ? Thanks for your help .
I really don't remember the name , but it was a man . He specifically quoted dollar amounts of $9,475.808.18 vs . $9,298,971.71 . Hope this helps ! Thank you very much1
The lady's name is Charlene Jackson . I don't know here , but give her a call and check it out . See you Sunday !
I heard they closed the schools because of too much snow ! What's it look like ?
What's happening ? How's your day going so far ? Mine is pretty good so far , we'll see at 2:10 p.m . when the Nymex closes . Are you doing rehearsal tonight ? I still need to get me a good black dress , I really liked your red dress . I need something on that order .  See you later!!! !
Yes , I'll see you there !
Call id you have any discrepancies . Thanks
Oh Hope , So nice to hear from you ! I think about you all the time . I miss not seeing you every Tuesday ! Are you considering coming back any time soon ? If not , I certainly understand , we are so "messy" . We just finished "Take it to the Bridge" and I can say that it was certainly more organized than last year . We performed at 4:00 for about 1 hour and we were free the rest of the day . A big improvement over last year , although they wanted us there at 11:00 that morning . I just bought a new truck for me and the kids , a 2001 Chevy Tahoe . I really like it , but I'm still trying to get used to driving something that big , and it sits so high , whoa! ! I certainly am praying , just as you are , that the kids are doing great and everything is going great for you . We'll have to get together and do a "afternoon at the park" with the kids . Take care . Love ya ! P.S . Now that I have your e-mail address , I'll e-mail more often !
Hi Dan This memo shall confirm our agreement to deliver 3,000 MMBtu's per day to National Steel for the above referenced time period . Deliveries will be at the NGPL Nipsco City Gate . Call if you have further questions . Thanks
You go girl , you're in my prayers !
Hi Monique , We have a mutual friend , Natasha Sims . Natasha and I attend the same church and sing in the choir together , and we were talking yesterday about Mary Kay products and she told me that you are her rep and that we work at the same place . What a coincidence ! To top it all off , I received an e-mail from Angie Collins and your name was also on the e-mail , so I said , "I have got to send her an e-mail" . Well , anyway , I would like to order some products . I would like the cleanser for normal skin , a concealer in the ebony bronze , and a black liquid eyeliner . Please let me know if you have these items in stock and what the charge is an when we can hook up ! Thank you so much . Patrice
sounds perfect , -- do you need cash or is a check okay ?
Thank you , my boss had me on a rush project and he was stressing me out . Thanks again !
Hey , I was just getting ready to send you an e-mail and I opened my mail and there you were . Things are going okay , the market is down 14 cents so we'll see where it ends up . Yes , good news , my dad got out of the hospital yesterday and they called just as I was leaving for rehearsal and he's doing pretty well . He still is extremely tired and has not regained his strength , but Praise God , at least he's out of the hospital and in good spirits . I suspect that there is alot that goes on that they don't tell me , so I really don't know everything . But I made them promise to give me things , as they happen . I'm going down there next month . We get President's Day off and I'll be on my way . Todd wants to drive , but I don't see the point , when the weather may turn on you in a heartbeat , and especially with Kendall . He's drive us crazy ! Anyway , we have a three day weekend this week , with Dr.King's birthday , are you off ? I spoke with Robin last night and she was mainly complaining about her job , but she's hanging in there . See you later !
Hey Greg , Please forward to Ms . Bobbi . Thank you
I already purchased the vehicle . Thank you
Hi Melba , Will you please create a new product that reads as follows: The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Vector Pipeline Company located in Will County , Illinois . I also would like a NGPL Nicor product set up that uses the Gas Daily Posting for "Chicago LDC-Large end-users" midpoint . I will need to have the Vector Alliance set up for tomorrow if possible . Thanks Melba !
Oh I'm glad you sent me an e-mail because there is no rehearsal tonight!!!! ! Tasha said she saw Taylor in the children's church , and I looked for you in the audience , but did not see you . After church let out , I was gone , I was home by 1:15 p.m . That never happens ! I looked for you guys and I said , oh well , I'll catch them later . By the way , I'm having Jordan's B-Day party on Monday evening , January 22 , 2000 at the Chuckie Cheese on the Southwest Freeway , Yes I'm having it on a Monday night after work ( 6:30 p.m. ) because I can't stand that place , and Jordan has his heart set on it . It's always too crowded and it drives me crazy ! So I figure , we'll meet between 6:30 and 7:00 p.m . and be out of there by 8:30 p.m . It's not the best plan , but it beats a Friday , Saturday or a Sunday . I'm just inviting about 6 people . so it'll definitely be small Let me know if you're interested . See you soon! .
Thank you . You may call the other product NGPL Nicor GDD . Thanks again !
Just wanted to confirm that you guys are available on Friday night for Jordan's party . You never did call me back !
It will be at 6:45 p.m . Todd had such a fit because it was on a Monday , which I prefer !
Hey lady , Just in case you are interested , I changed Jordan's party to this Friday night at 6:45 p.m . same place . Love ya !
Cool girl , that'll work out fine . It sounds like Hope will be attending also . Kenny can't come , so that was disappointing , but I'll see him on Saturday for his daughter's party . Talk with you later . We need to talk!!! !
Hope , You're the Best!!!!! !
Oh no , nothing urgent , I just feel like i take one step forward and two steps backward , you know the drill !
Hi Priscilla , These deals are a mess , I remember issues with the deals , but unfortunately , can't remember all the details . I will speak with our Calgary office , as well as , our Operations Manager , George Smith , and provide details to you ASAP . Unfortunately , I think the ASAP won't be until Monday , as George Smith is out of the office until Monday . Thanks ,
Well , go with Startech's invoice . Thanks
Hey Gang , I've called the trader at Sempra and she is researching and will let us know something , hopefully , this afternoon . Thanks
I'm thinking that I have probably missed you , but anyway , it was so nice to hear from you . We're haviing Jordan's birthday party tonight . So thwat's what we'll be doing this weekend ! Talk to you soon ! Love Bernie
Grant , Please review and let' discuss how to resolve . Thanks
Hey girl , You didn't tell me that Jennifer changed her name . I called her cell phone and left a message and it gave her real name , not her slave name . I cracked up ! Seems like the older people get , the crazier they get . That reminds me when my mother called herself changing her name from Louise to Louisa . I answered the telephone at her house and they said "Is Louisa there , and She said , oh that's for me" . I cracked up ! Anyway , funny thing happened on the way to the forum , no seriously I was standing the lobby on Friday , and a young man asked me if my name was Patrice . Turned out he was Birdell's son , Dupree , remember him ? He's back down here working for Prostaff delivering boxes . He's turned into a nice looking young man . I called Dale and spoke with her for a few minutes . She seems to be doing fine , only spoke for a few minutes though . I'll call her back one of these days when I have more time . Missed you at Jordan's party . Silly me , I didn't figure it out until Saturday that you had Shayla drop off the gift . I initially thought it was from Shayla . Well anyway , you rolling ?
Hey Kenny . Thanks for checking on me . My trip to Omaha was okay . On one hand , it gave me a real good idea of what type of shape Daddy really is in . It's not real good , but he feels optimistic . You know he has prostate cancer and I believe it has started spreading into the bones . He's very , very weak , can't walk more than 10 to 20 steps without becoming physically worn out . Mom has to drive him everywhere he goes , ( he doesn't go that many places) . He's definitely has his good days and his bad days . He is taking regular pain pills constantly and has morphine tablets for extreme pain , which he's in half the time . It's really sad . He's lost alot of weight , but he's in good spirits I guess . To talk to him over the phone or hear him over tje radio , you would swear he's in great health . It's was really hard for me to get a true perspective because I know he was trying to put on his best act , so that I would not worry . It's extremely hard to see your parents going through this kind of suffering . He says he going to beat this thing , so alot of times , it's mind over matter , along with lots of prayer . Mom is wanting to quit her job , ( she's a teachers aide) , but Daddy doesn't want her to do it . Daddy says he's going back to work . Please pray for Mom as well , I know she's scared to death , and doesn't know what to really do . Talk to you later !
How did it go with Lil' Steve . Were you able to get his fever reduced ? Poor thing , I hope he's feeling better . How Siera ? Well , anyway , just was thinking about the kids and thought I'd drop you a line . Are you rehearsing tonight ?
Sorry , I got a little trigger happy !
P.S . Kelli is going to send the Midcontinent volumes & prices .
I plan to withdraw 500,000 for the month , I will revise sheet as we revise the volumes , but the plan is to withdraw 500,000 . Thanks
I bought a car , please do not e-mail me anymore !
Hey girl , Where are the pictures , they were not attached . I'll call you this afternoon . Patrice
Hi Daddy , I was thinking about you earlier this morning . Glad to hear that you are not in any pain right now . We just need to keep pressing to find the right combination of medicine . My experience has been to be very persistent with the doctors and don't let up on them for re-evaluation . I've learned alot with the boys , especially when they were very young and could not communicate . I was kust extremely persistent , because there is no need for pain and discomfort when , most times , there is so combination of medicines that will get the job done . I was telling Momma I was cracking up when you were talking about your "breakthrough" on the radio . I told her , if only the audience knew what you were talking about ! I still haven't had a chance to check into those houses in Virginina Beach for our vacation , I called yesterday afternoon around 4:30 and they were closed,I forgot about the time difference . I 'm probably hesitating because I know everyone wants to go to Washington , and I;'m not quite sure that this is the right place . What are your thoughts ? Well anyway , good luck on the "butt procedure" , boy you and your butt" . Hope it's not too painful . Keep taking the medicine and I'll talk with you this evening . Is this your home e-mail or your office ?
Hey girl , How's it going ? Haven't had a chance to talk with you over the last two days . I went to get me hair done on Wednesday night and did not get home until 11:00 p.m . By the time I got the kids to bed , it was almost midnight and I was sick about keeping them up that late . Last night , I went to the grocery store , came home and cooked my boys a good meal of ham , macaroni and cheese and green beans . After we relaxed for a while , we started getting ready for their baths and we all went to bed around 8:30 p.m . I was exhausted from being out late Tuesday and Wednesday night . I woke up around 1:00 a.m . and watched TV for a few minutes and went back to bed . I was tired . This evening I made a nail appointment . My nails look like "do-do" . I would like to get a new set tonight , but we'll see if we get off early enough for that . Daddy sent me a e-mail today , he had two really bad days on Wednesday and Friday , but he's scheduled to go in for more tests today . Talk with you later !
Alright , I'll check into both places . I thought you were going to the Dr . today ? After I typed this , I said to myself , I guess I could have re--read your original memo . Anyway , how often do you check your e-mail at home , because I can start using this to talk to you ?
Do you all have any rodeo tickets ? I'm thinking about going to stand in line ? I want to see Destiny's Child , what about you ?
Just checking up on you to see how you're feeling . Are you feeling alright ? How did the last test go ?
Did you check with Steve about the rodeo on February 18th ? I want to try to get tickets this evening . Talk to you later .
That is WONDERFUL!!!!! !
Hi Shielah , I agree with changing the deal to reflect a Chicago Gas Daily-Daily Flat for the December 22-26 time period . Please ask Julie to change the ticket , I always get confused . Thanks
I don't know where that came from , it's old , but it reminds me of that song , "Hey Little Walter!" My dad called last night and he had a terrific day on Sunday . GOD is good !
Hi I'm reponding on behalf of myself and Hunter Shively . Hunter will be out of the office on Tuesday , and I will have a visitor in the office from Nicor on that same afternoon . Thank you for the invitation !
Hi there ! Just checking on you . Did you make it to practice last night and did Lucretia's husband keep the kids ? ( smile) . If so , what time did you get back home , I know it was late . I went to Auchan's last night to try to see what they had in the way of western attire for the kids . They did not have much , and the hats for $2.99 were on back order . I was looking for western shirts for the kids , but they did not have a good selection , so I went to a Western store on Gessner . Boy , what a mistake , they were so darn high . Regular shirts for kids cost $25 and they were ugly . I walked out saying that these people are serious about their western wear . I brought in some gospel cds to work today and I've been listening to them on my headphones . It sure helps alot . I can get away with it , because we have certain weather reports that are produced by Enron , that you have to wear headphones to hear , so it looks good . Plus , the boss doesn't mind . We listen to music just about all day anyway . Have you heard the Chester D.T . Baldwin tape . I think it's one of my favorites . Speaking of gospel , is your family still planning on doing a concert at Southwest when they come in for the family reunion ? I was wondering about that ! Have you talked to Sharon and offered her your congrats yet , I want to call her , but I don't want to make it seem like Hope is telling all of her business . Talk with you later !
Just in case , I have not made it real PLAIN , you deliver an AWESOME Video , It is extremely professional , easy to follow , and concise ! Keep up the GOOD WORK ! Thanks again!! !
Hey , how did the appointment go yesterday ? Were you trying to e-mail me yesterday ? I received a message regarding returned mail , did you get one as well ? I spoke with Val the other day and also said hi to Aunt Ethel . They seem to be fine . Val and I had been playing telephone tag (  really did not want to talk with her because she ticked me off , but I'm over it now ) for about the last two months , so she finally caught me on my cell phone . You know I always keep my cell phone on when I'm away from the house and office . The number is 713-851-6240 . When I'm at church , the phone is off as well , but anyother time , it's most always on . And of course , my pager number is on my business card . Anyway , please e-mail me back , if you're up an about . Talk with you soon .
So nice to hear from , it is indeed always a pleasure . I can't wait until we can get together and have a chance to really chit chat . We're always so busy , "A woman's work is never done" . I did not go to rehearsal the other night myself , I had a customer in town and had to take him out to dinner , since he's one of my biggest customers . I'm looking forward to my 3 day weekend , are you guys working on Monday , President's Day ? I'm off and can't wait . I will certainly keep you in prayer , my child . Love you! !
As far as vacation , I think we are thinking of going to Virginia Beach , VA . and just renting a house on the beach . I've never been there , but have heard a few good things about it . I'm trying to get more information before I go ahead and book a house . Also , with my dad being sick , I've been somewhat reluctant to do it , because we always take a family trip each year . God is good , so he'll probably get a chance to go . Have you made any plans yet ? If you do , make sure and plan something leisurely . Also , yes , we need to institute the park days and let these kids go CRAZY . They all seem to get along real well . So my girl , has good taste . I knew she had it in her . I really , really like my Tahoe . I wish I had bought it sooner . It took me about a month to get used to it , but now I'm rolling . Tell your sister I said hi , and let me know when she's in town again and when ever you guys have some time . I would love to get together again .
Yes , it is working , you're up early this morning , it's not even noon yet . You must be feeling good today !
In addition , to learning about the $0.15 default allowance for buyback volumes , I have also discovered that we need to deduct another $0.15 to $0.18 per MMBtu to cover firm transportation costs that we incur as a result of this transaction . The cost will vary depending on the fuel costs . The transport cost is made up of $0.0103 commodity fee , $0.07 demand fee and fuel of 1% . Please provide some direction on this , as I will need to adjust the pricing in sitara , but would like to make sure that I'm performing the correct procedure . Thanks for your help . P.S . I do agree with your last e-mail . 
Hey , How's it going today ? I've been thinking about you and Siera . Did things go alright last night . Have you heard any more back from the principals yet , or are you not going to know anything until tomorrow ? I know tonight is study night for her spelling test , so I probably won't talk to you tonight . Rev . Jackson called me yesterday . I thought that was funny , he said they had told him that I was upset about my contribution statement , and he thought he would give me a call to apologize and see if he could do anything . He then went on to say that he didn't want any problems or misunderstandings , because I was a generous contributor . I then proceeded to give him a piece of my mind , because they need to get serious about the business end of the church . By the way , I was talking to Kent the other day , and he mentioned that Carolyn Jenkins was no longer at the church . That's interesting . I can only imagine what happened there ! Anyway , do you have your African attire yet ? I have some , but it's old , and I had been thinking about buying something new . I might go to Sharpstown and have a look , but that is not set in stone . It depends on what type of time I have and what type of mood I'm in . You know we're supposed to wear our African attire on Sunday . You know we have an outing to First Metropolitan Church on Sunday at 3:00 p.m . I'm pretty sure I won't be attending . I'm tired of going to the same places . We need some variety . Gregg needs to get some new "hook-ups" if he wants people to keep supporting them on the outings . And another thing , I am so sick of singing the same songs . If we have to sing "In the Sanctuary" one more time , I'm going to throw up . I received an e-mail from Lane Bryant with some coupons for 15 or 20% off . It said you could only print the coupon once , but I printed it several times , and it kept printing , so remind me to give you a coupon . See you later!!!! !
Sorry , it took so long to respond to the e-mail . Hope , you guys are doing well ! Yes , I'm interested in receiving the address list for the attendees ! We really need to get something out pretty soon to the people . Grandpa says people are calling , ( I wonder if its just one or two people) , but nevertheless , we still need to get something out . Talk with you soon !
Hi Jeannie , Several months ago I met with Jennifer Milligan regarding part-time employment . I still have an interest in this area , and thought I would drop you a note to see if you know of any upcoming opportunities/positions within the company . I have no definite time frame , but I do know that I do have a strong interest in part-time employment . Please let me know if anything comes up , and also if we need to meet . I would appreciate discretion regarding my search for part-time employment (  please do not discuss with Hunter ) as I do not want to jeopardize my position on the desk or have him thinking that I'm not giving 100% because I'm interested in part-time employment . I've casually mentioned this to him in the past , so he's somewhat aware , but probably did not take me very seriously . Thanks for your help !
Thanks for the "words of encouragement" . I just sent an e-mail to my Human Resources Rep and will wait to get a response . I am so READY!! . I've set up a meeting with my financial advisor for tomorrow to go over things again since I really have made up my mind . Talk with you tonight !
Hi Jeanie , What is your schedule looking like for this week or next in the late afternoon ?
Sorry , can't do it on Thursday , but what about Friday sometime ?
Thanks for the schedule . If the game with Seattle is still available on Thursday , April 5 , I would love to use the seats . Thanks for your help!! !
So nice to hear from you . I miss not being able to see you and talk with you on a regular basis . I hope the kids are dong fine . Jordan went to children's church this Sunday and he definitely asked about Taylor . He just starts smiling when I mention her name . That little mannish boy already likes girls , I think . Anyway , things are going okay , I'm still leaning toward trying to find a part-time position next year . This job is so very hard ! Take care !
Hey Sugar Bear ! I was just thinking about you and was hoping that everything is going okay for you . I constantly keep you in prayer regarding your situation . How's Erika doing ? You missed church Sunday when they forceably removed one of the guys ( aaron Burr ) from the church . You remember he was the one that used to sit on the front row and get happy alllllllllll the time . You remember him , anyway they hauled his tail out of there . It was terrible to see someone hauled from the church , not matter what the situation is . Oh well , take care , and call me if we need to talk!!! !
Hi Marlo , This deal was done on Enron Online , so do we need to get further information from Enron Online ? Please let me know ?
I'm sorry , I came looking for you on Friday at 3:00 p.m . I thought I had responded to you and indicated that Friday at 3:00 was okay , but I checked my e-mails and discovered that I did not respond . Anyway , my fault , what's good for you next week ? (  I promise I'll respond when you e-mail me back , instead of just putting it on my calendar. ) Thanks
Hi Roni Charnella had asked that I send you information regarding scooters . The outfit is called Scoot Around North America . They have a web site at www.scootaround.com . Their phone number is 1-888-441-7575 . Hope this works out for you . Take Care !
Hey Bobbi , Here is a revised nomination sheet for March , and also , I know you'll be shocked , but I sent the contract to the lawyers for approval , so we should get it back shortly ! See ya
Test message , I wrote up a whole e-mail and lost it , my e-mail is acting up , so before I re-type this , I want to see if you get this !
Hey Girl , Sorry about last night , remember I told you I was looking for my NyQuil , well I found it and took a couple of swigs and went straight to sleep . I really meant to call you back , but could not wake up . I finally woke up around 11:30 and got up and got a drink of water . By the way , the latest , unconfirmed rumor , is that Samatha and Anessa Hall Joseph are supposed to be pregnant ! See you !
No , I don't know her number . but Anessa is ,  huh ! Just call up to the church and give them your count for dinner for the kids .
Yes , I'll ask her , but I also know someone else that sings at weddings professionally ! Do you know what song ?
Daddy , I hope I'm not overstepping my boundaries , if I am , so sorry , but....I wanted to find out from you if everything is okay financially with you and Mom . I need to know now , rather than later , if we need to set up a game plan for you guys . Also , you don 't have to be emotional about borrowing money from me , nobody else is ( smile) . After all , I owe you one! ! Love Bernie !
That's funny , that they still had the same outfit you looked at back in the fall . If I'm not mistaken , the "O" magazine , the one that Oprah Winfrey publlishes had a coupon for August Max stores . I'm not sure iif it was this issue or last month , but call the store and see , and it may be worth buying a magazine for the coupon . I'm not surprised about Hope , it was such a late night . See you later
Yolanda gave me the name of the songs--they are "I Believe in You and Me" by Whitney Houston and "Kissing You" by Faith Evans
Hey Girl , Yes , we had our concert , it was real good , had a very poor turnout , but he choir really enjoyed themselves . Rickey Dillard is a fool ! He's alot of fun , and I didn't realize he was gay , but he is . Everyone says he used to be gay , and not he's changed , but..... . I spoke with Daddy on Friday , and he asked me where was his e-mail . I haven't heard anything from him as of yet , but I did send him a e-mail asking the question . Did he do his radio program yesterday ? Yesterday , we went to the beach and rented some horses and went horseback riding , Kendall loved it , Jordan was a little skeptical at first , but soon got used to the idea . I myself was a little skeptical , because I had ol' Kendall on my horse , and wanted to hold on to the little know on the saddle , instead of me , all I had was the reins , at first I said "the hell with this" , but it was fun , we'll definitely do it again . Talk with you later !
I just called my other friend , her name is Renee Lewis and her home number is 281-484-2380 . She has sang the I Believe in You and Me song mnay times before at weddings and she is familar with Kissing You , but said its a really sexy song , Have Barbara call her because she has alot of ideas . She's a professional now and she can suggest all kinds of songs . Take care !
Yes , she'snot familiar with the music , but said she would listen to the music and see what she thought , but I have put in a call to my other friend , but I know she would do it if her schedule was open , but she does is professionally , and I know there would be a charge , I should hear something today from my other friend .
I spoke with Robin last night for a minute . You didn't tell me how good church was on Sunday . She said Kathy Florence really preached and encouraged me to buy the tape ! It must have been awesome ! Anyway , are you going to rehearsal tonight ? How are things going with Steve's party and have you set a time yet ? What does he want/need for his birthday ? I know he loves Power Rangers , but is there anything else , maybe something you had been planning to buy , ( pajamas , underwear , shirt , pants , socks , etc. ) Talk to ya !
Phillip . The following four deals are the only ones that need to new mid for NBPL: The rest of that list is misleading , etc . etc . etc. !
Hey Nella , When I got in this morning , I had received an e-mail from Daddy on last Friday . He said that everything was okay financially for the future , and they only had an immediate need for the tax money . He sounded okay with me asking about it . He even said "You are so sweet with words" . He just doesn't realize , but we get that ability from him . How was your weekend , mine was good , we spent alot of time outside . We went to the B-Day party and the kids bowled and boy did Kendall love bowling . In fact Jordan , ny athletic one , bowled a strike . They call it bumper bowling because they put up little bumpers . All the kids enjoyed it so much , Natasha and I are going to take the kids back in a couple of weeks and let them bowl one day after we get off work . Bowling alleys notoriously have good food . Yesterday , we went to the park and spent several hours outside , it was like in the low 80's yesterday . I'm glad daylight savings time is here , its so nice to be able to get home and get things taken care of before it gets dark . This morning , I went to drop the kids off at the daycare at 6:30 a.m . ( mind you , I'm running about 10 minutes late ) and the daycare teacher ( the wife of one of Todd's good friends ) that opens up the facility ( she's the only one with a key ) was late again . Now the heffa was late one day last week and I didn't say anything , beccause everyone is late every once in awhile , but she made me late for work last week . So...I blew up this morning and had to leave the kids standing in the parking lot with about 3 other teachers and 6 other parents with their kids . I want to call up their and complain , but I think I'll talk with her first ( maybe! ) She needs to get her stuff together , because first thing in the morning is not a time to play with folks . Talk with you later
Please sign me up .

Jesus , Please show me a bid for this Cargill Deal . It is 25 MMBtu/d day , May-October , 2001 with balancing and anything else that typically goes along with it . I think the best option at this time is just ot get a bid from you . Also there is a piece at Nicor that goes along with it , but it is a monthly volume commitment , and does not include balancing . I don't plan to give you that portion , but it may be that the customer does not want it broken up . The volume is roughly 33,000 for the month . Thanks
Please let me know why my VAR is $2.2 million . My position is 108.3 short , so I need to know why the VAR is so large .  Hunter would like an answer as soon as psossible . Thanks
What's Happening ? How's it going ? I will not be at rehearsal tonight because I'm going to get my hair done . I figured that you all will be practicing ( is that how you spell practice ) your Easter songs and I will be in Omaha for Easter so I don't need to learn the songs , as we only sing them on Easter anyway . Besides , just in case you didn't hear , we don't sing this Sunday ( We switch with the kids) , since you all will sing on Easter for all 4 services . This daylight savings time is nice . It's so nice to be able to get home and still habe daylight instead of feeling like you whole day is shot once it gets dark . Did you find any houses that you liked ? How long were you out ? Talk with you later !
Val , What is this e-mail about , did you mean to send it to me ? Send me some of those funny jokes that are going around . Talk to ya later !
Bobbi , Here is the final for March , 2001 , I'm preparing the April , 2001 sheet as well !
Well , hell , I forgot the attachment ! Here it is....... .

I want to make sure we're on the same page concerning the Asset Management Deal . Please review and let me know what you think !
Yes , you are absolutely correct , I can never get ahold of you . I know you're very busy . Our plane get in at 12:00 on Friday , so we'll hail a cab over to Mom's house . Everything here is going okay . I hope Tina has had the baby by the time I get there this weekend . I sure don't want her to have to spend Easter in the hospital . As far as dinner is concerned , we'll have the regular , roast , ham , macaroni and cheese , greens yams , etc . Mom said something about getting a turkey , if so , we'll have to have dressing . Anyway , I think I am going to choir rehearsal tonight , so I'll try to call you on the way home . See ya !
Hey Lizzie Nicor is correct , Sitara #664380 s/b changed to reflect a Chicago Gas Daily Price flat , while Sitara #664363 s/b reflect a Chicago Gas Daily Price plus $0.01 . I have revised both tickets . Thanks for your help , and also thank Darla .
Yes , We're going home to Omaha tomorrow morning , we'll be back on Monday . Take care and Happy Easter !
I certainly will , I know you can't wait to go home and begin your life!!! !
Hey Robert, , Sorry I was out on vacation , and I did not think to ask Todd the name of his headhunter , but I will and try to get back to you with some names this week . Take care !
Girl , so very sorry to hear about your relatives . That is awful , such young people . I will keep them and all of their their families in prayer . If there is anything I can do to help , please let me know . If you need help with the kids or anything . Also , sorry about the choir , what's wrong with Doren , he's seems to be sick alot . Greg will probably "fire his ass" this week for messing up his "Big Day" on Easter . That's a shame ! You mean to tell me you wore the new dress without the blouse/jacket . That is wonderful , I told you not to worry about your arms . You did look real good in the dress , the colors were beautiful . We need to shop together more often . Yes , I will be at choir tonight . See you then !
No---thank you .
Hey what's Happening ? Just wanted to let you know that today is my Birthday ! We're going yo go to the KiCi and Jo Jo Concert tonight at the Arena Theater , should be very good ! Also , did you hear from Robin that Anna's daughter , Dana , is in the hospital , I'm going to call up there this afternoon and see how she's doing . I'm assuming her last name is Brown . Also , I hooked Cynthia Patterson up with one of my customers ( A divorced brother from S . Carolina) . Girlm she called me this morning , and she was so giddy . She said they really had a good time talking on the phone , they talked two hours . They are meeting for lunch on tomorrow . I'll be anxious to hear what he thinks of her after meeting her . I know she'll like him , because he is a nice looking brother , and nice conversation . I just hope he thinks she's cute . Oh well , talk to you later .
I just spoke with Sharon Mahon and she asked me to tell you hello . Did you know that she was expecting a baby girl in August ? She's five months pregnant and getting married on this Sunday to Tyrone . Can you believe it ? She seem's happy . Did Barbara ever talk with my friend about singing at the wedding ? What did she decide ? Talk with you later !
Good afternoon , Robin called last night after I spoke with you and told me that her impression was that Rev . Jackson was resigning . I called Horace this morning and asked him if he resigned and he said , Oh no , he had just made a mistake ( I get the impression that Greg caught Horace dogging him out and called him out on him , and Horace being the good , honest person that he is , couldn't lie) . He said that it was his idea to get up and talk to the church . Robin said he was just crying while he was talking . He said he's in "time out" now . I tried to ask him if Gregg put him in "time out" but he kind of kept talking . He said he's really having family problems surrounding this church thing and he's just going to be sitting out for the next couple of weeks . He won't be in the pulpit , he said Gregg would probably have him sitting with the deacons . I asked him what is going on with the deacons , and he said it would take all day to talk about that , and he had someone in his office . I let him go after that . Now isn't all of that interesting . I forgot to tell you that I spoke with Sharon Mayon on Friday . She married Tyrone this past Sunday . That revival is this week isn't it ? Talk with you later !
Hey girl , Sorry , I received all of your messages , but did not respond , sorry . So little C.J . looks like a "half-breed" , ( that's what you''re trying to say!) . Is he cute ? I can't wait to see him . Yes , I did talk to Teena yesterday afternoon , she sounded happy . I spoke with Daddy yesterday and told him to sit his butt down and stop trying to go to work , especially if there are no health benefits that he will be losing . Instead of concentrating on that job , I told him to concentrate on his health . He said I was right , and said he was going to seriously consider it . I had to laugh when he said he went to work and fell asleep reading or trying to throw away some paperwork . That was hilarious . Can you imagine the secretary going in and finding "little bitty" daddy sitting there asleep . I cracked up . The concert was good , you know those young men "showed out" . However , the concert was supposed to start at 8 and did not start til 9 and had several acts before them and as a result , did not get out of the concert until 1:15 p.m . I was a tired sister , but it was well worth it . The Hilton Southwest is close to me , its right be Sharpstown Mall . Tell me that dates again . Talk with you later .
Our Michcon and Consumers Guy is iyt having a baby , so here's what he left me for Michcon and zero for Consumers .

Hi Darla , I've put in a call to Nicor . The objective was to pay them $0.01 for the swap between Peoples and Nicor . Thw other ticket involved is 664363 . If I'm not mistaken , I think we have accomplished that . I'll let you know .
Please call so we can discuss !
Darla , I spoke with Michelle at Nicor and I believe that everything is correct . I corrected the tickets back on April 12 , 2001 . Please let me know if this issue is settled or if we need to do more . Thanks

Hello ! How are things going ? I'm pretty tired this morning , I went to get a relaxer last night and got there at 8p.m . and did not leave until 11:30p.m.--pretty exhausting , but Todd is out of town today and I wanted to squeeze that in before he left and I'd have to get a sitter . Anyway , is everthing going well with the house ? Hope so.....My daycare notified us yesterday morning when Todd dropped the kids off that they will be closing their doors permanently on June 1st . Talk about not getting much notice . Anyway , needless to say , that is my new crusade ! Talk with you later !
Hi Scott , I'm still tracking down the Crestar issue , but at this time , it appears as though we should not have changed the name to Gulf Canada until recently when the sharing mechanism came into play with BP for the AOS . Crestar confirmed this and Dan Hyval left me a voice mail alluding to thus , but I need to hear back from him to ask that direct question . I'll be back in touch , hopefully this afternoon . Thanks
would it be possible to leave it on ENA paper , it seems that would be the easiest
Test
Dan Hyvl went back to the original trader and wants to double-check , but it seems pretty likely that everything needs to be done under Crestar . Hold tight !
Hey you go ladies
i'd be delighted !
yes
Yes , your correct , I'm sure that we are going to have the same issue . I'm still waiting for the lawyer to respond back to me . I know he had to contact the Calgary trader to get a resolution . I'll contact him again today and will let you know what he says . Thanks for reminding me again !
Here is my best attempt at month-to-date volumes , holler if you strongly disagree !
Hi , I need to look at the calendar again , but I think we will be leaving on Saturday the 9th of June . We'll probably stop in Coffeyville for a day or so and come on through to Omaha . I'm sad to hear that Daddy's tube does not seem to be doing the job . I had to hear that , because I too feel confident that if we can get some nourishment into his body that he will get alot better . I'm so glad you stepped in and are taking matters into your own hands . I also feel like Daddy feels real good that you are stepping in as well . I spoke with Mom yesterday , daddy was sleep , so she really got a chance to tell me how everything really is . She too is now saying that Daddy is in pretty bad shape . I asked Daddy about the retirement , and he said the same thing , he is not ready yet . but the reality of it is , is that we still need to move now and not wait . I just hope he understands . I'm glad Daddy is not in alot of pain . I think with him seeing the boys will really cheer him up . It's so hard to face all of this uncertainty isn't it . The good part , if there is any , is that Daddy is going to a better place with no more suffering . He's certainly had a good life and we all want him to go on forever , but if there is pain involved , I 'd rather see him out of pain . Just keep praying for Daddy as well as Mom . If there is anything I can do from hear , just let me know . Talk with you later !
Hi Lizzie , Will you please call this lady at TransCanada , Tracy in Gas Accounting at 402-505-8800 . She says we have a couple of term deals that have the incorrect TransCanada counterparty . They are not deals in my region , so I thought it best to have you handle , as opposed to passing her around. . Thanks
That's fine , but I think I got off kinda cheap , so let me know if I need to contribute more ! It was so much fun !
Dear Dan , This e-mail shall confirm the sale of natural gas to National Steel from Enron North America: Date: May 25 , 2001 Price: $4.22 Delivery Point: Nipsco
Hi Liz , Thanks in advance for putting me on the list of people to receive updates or notices regarding Alliance and/or Vector pipeline . This information is extremely important as we are trading this product on EnronOnline without much information . Also could you please add Lisa Kinsey and Mark Schrab to the e-mail list as they schedule all of the Alliance and Vector gas . One last request , could you please send us the daily e-mails that specify the daily AOS allocations . Thanks again .
I called you back at 10:31 , i'll try again in about 15/20 minutes . You should carry your cell phone in your purse in case you need to call me . Then you van hang up and I'll call you right back !
I just found out we have a toll free number 1-800 97ENRON , they tell me you have to select the Enron Bldg and my extension is 5772 !
No , I didn't make the party . I just kind of fizzled out ! Anyway , hope you're feeling better and hope we can roll today so we can catch up chile ! I'll call before I leave .
Yes , I thought we had sent you the contract already . The actual contract only refers to a delivery point at the Chicago city gates , and not specifically Peoples or Nicor , if I'm not mistaken . Is this going to be a problem ? I'm sorry , I thought it had been forwarded to you already!!! !
So sorry everyone , I inadvertently sent you prices from the May 1 , 2001 model . Thanks for your patience!! !
Please prepare a wire transfer to Crestar in the amount of $873,572 for the above referenced time period . This wire transfer should be made effective June 1 , 2001 . Thank you for your help !
Hi Lizzie , Will you please have someone re-send the confirmation to Dynegy Canada for May 25th and May 31st . The sitara ticket Number is 761773 . I trade on a daily basis with Dynegy Canada and I use them to balance on ( a good deal for Enron) , so their volumes may change several times during the morning trading period . So as a result , to avoid sending them duplicate confirmations , would it be possible to wait until the afternoon to send their daily confirmations ? If not , no big deal , it would just make less work for everyone concerned . Thanks
Hey Jimbo , I will be on vacation that entire week . Sorry ! It's so funny , I never take vacation and the one week that I do , that's when I'll be gone . Anyway , you can have my space !
Hello , Tasha told me that you just got back from your trip abroad . Was is just Fantastic ! ( smile) . Any brotha's and sistah's over there ? Hope you had a great time . I would love to see pictures sometime . I would like to purchase some of that eyeshadow base . I think it is the triple action cream or something like that . It has the gold cap to it . Also , I would like some black eyeliner . Just call me whenever you have it . Also , I'd like some of that "Stress Free" cologne from the Private Spa collection . Just let me know when you have it . Thanks !
Guess what , i will be on vacation starting next monday for a week . Maybe we can hook up this weekend ?
Stephen , You are THE BEST!!!!!!! ! One hundred thanks!!!! !
Hey Rob , We have one more comment for you to consider: We must have a definitive number of days in case , "Enron makes a demand on this guaranty" . We cannot leave the contract silent on that issue . How about making it 7 days instead of 5 days . Our lawyers say that we must have a definitive number of days . Your turn !
Girl , This is a Geoff Storey deal , I'll work on it after trading . Thanks
Hi Glen , In an effort to expedite the execution of the parental guarantee for Cilcorp , would you please consider reviewing and utilizing Enron's form of guarantee . I have attached a copy of the gurantee for your consideration . Please call me at 713-853-5772 should you have any questions . Thanks
Hey good morning , How did things go last night ? I hope everything went well . I went to Lane Bryant and did not find anything , but at least it was fun looking . What is Hope's phone number . I'm anxious to see a picture of that dress , ( it better not make me look fatter!) . Write back when you have a chance .
I'll probably be there at around 7:15 or earlier if I need to , what do you think about that time ?
Hey lady , Does the below referenced language work for you ? Let me know . Thanks
Hope , Hope , Hope , The dress is gorgeous!!!!! ! But , hold up , you know you're forcing me to go to the Quick Weight Loss Center about 6 months before the wedding!!! ! Is that a shawl ( I hope ) and not a bow on the butt is it ? How much is the dress , my co-workers and I have a bet going . ( p.s . I'm not worried about the cost , I just want to look good! ) What a terrific compliment from little miss Taylor , I'm certain Jordan will be thrilled . That'll be so cute ! I'll ask him tonight and explain everything to him . I'm sure when I mention Taylor , he'll go to grinning as well . That boy is a mess ! Talk to you soon ! P.S . Please send a picture of the bridemaids dress as well , and what color !
Hi Stuart , Please remove me from your mailing list . Thanks
Girl , that's extremely reasonable ! I'll order mine early , where are we purchasing them from ? P.S . Please send "Tarsha" a picture of my dress . I think I accidentally deleted the picture of my dress , doggonit ! ( You know I need to brush p on my e-mail skills.....they laugh at me all the time. )
Hey Rob , Last time , one more change , if you will ?
Hey Lizzie , That deal should have been booked to Nine Energy Services , LLC . Can you please change that in Sitara.....thanks !
Hi Vonda , Here are the October offers for your consideration . Thanks
Hi Vonda Even though , I know I'll probably be at a disadvantage because of my notification deadline , I'll try again on the S . Texas piece . If my memory serves me right , you were looking for a daily call option on the S.Texas piece . Enron offers the following: Period: November , 2001 - March , 2002 Region: Trunkline South Texas Pool Demand Charge: $0.0425 per MMBtu for the above referenced time period times the volume , for the right to receive the volumes on a daily basis at the Trunkline S .

Lizzie , We have a new customer that needs the billing and payment address and contacts for the new gas purchase and sales contract that we are working on . Can you please em-mail that information to: when you have a minute . Thank you very much
Enron would like to offer the following packages of gas on a BASELOAD basis for your consideration for October , 2001 flow: PEPL Field Pool up to 20,000 MMBtu/d IFGMR minus $0.0475 Trunkline E .

Get our of here!!! ! That's so exciting , did they kick Dorian to the curb ! I like the professionalism that the choir with achieve under Mike . I'm excited ! How do you feel about it , how did Robin feel ? I know we'll be jamming! . I just hope we don't have to sing too many V . Michael McKay originals alllllllllll the time !
So sorry about that.....We do not have a date for you b/c the contract does not exist as of yet . Legal said that we could just end that sentence right after the word "transactions" . take out the language that says "including without limitation the Enfolio...... . Once you make that deletion , how long do you think it will take to have it executed and a copy faxed to me at 713-646-3390 ? Thanks , we're almost there!!!!! !
Thanks so much .
Hi John , Once again , so sorry about Enron's inability to transact on the deal this morning because of contract issues . We need to fix the issue , so that it does not occur again , so.....attached is a copy of the agreement that we need you to review and execute . I believe Sylvia may have worked on this back in March , and I wasn't sure if you all ever received a copy , but if you didn't here it is . Please call if you have further questions . Thanks
I was re-reading my previous e-mail back to you , and saw my typo ! ( you know that's one of my pet peeves)---Well anyway , I'm pleased , I know he's not perfect , and I'm sure he will get on "our nerves" from time to time , but if we grow and learn something from him , and he helps us to reach our full potential as a choir , and we're actually proud of ourselves again , it'll work!!! ! Let's try to convince Robin to think in a positive light ! We've got much greater concerns right now ! Love ya ! P.S . I have a much needed hair appointment tonight , so I won't be home until real late , but I'll have my cell phone available .
Tony , Per our conversation !
Good morning Rob , Thanks so much , it's been a pleasure working with you . Once the document is executed , will you please have someone fax me a copy at 713-646-3390 ( also have someone call me to let me know its on its way) . Thanks again .
Hi Dave , I have attached a revised schedule per our conversation this a.m . My options guy has done more research ( at my insistence ) to determine why our offers for the 5 days are of our sync....so giving me feedback does help me to get the "boys in line" . He has lowered his price by $0.31 so far . I'll keep pushing ! Please let me know how the 10 day option for Dec-Feb at the gate sounds . Thanks Patrice
Hey Guys , I do not feel that the Heartland Steel/CSN issue is resolved . We are now getting calls from a representative of CSN ( Companhia Sidergica Nacional , LLC ) saying that they have purchased Heartland Steel effective July , 2001 . If this is the case , then why are we continuing to invoice Heartland Steel ? Have we been paid by Heartland Steel ? Have we been continuing to receive the prepayments , and if so from whom ? Has CSN assumed the contractual obligations of Heartland Steel ? While the credit risk is not my responsibility , I am , however , extremely concerned that we really do not have a firm handle on the identity of our actual counterparty . Will you please let me know how we should proceed . I have a call into the CSN representative and it appears that they are not really happy with us , and would like to receive a visit from an Enron representative . Let me know what the game plan is by noon , Friday , September 28 , 2001 . Thank you for your cooperation .
John , are your responsibilities concerning Heartland Steel fulfulled if the contract is terminated ?
Thanks , I love this e-mail !
Hey Debra , Here is the assigment letter that we talked about--the deals that they want to assign from Kaztex to Nicor Energy are the following: They want these contracts assigned to Nicor effective October 1st . From my perspective , is there anything else I need to do , other than change the name on our documents,once you have approved the assigment agreement . Thanks
I'm gathering the base contract as we speak , I'll get it to you asap ! Thanks
Hey girl , I'll be out of the office all next week , traveling and meeting with customers in Chicago . Call me if you have any questions regarding Kaztex ( or anything else ) we have worked together on . My cell phone is 713-851-6240 . If i'm not there , please leave me a message . Thanks for all your hard work !
Hey Rob , I haven't heard or seen anything yet on the executed contract ? Is everything okay ? I'll be out of the office traveling next week , and I wanted to get a status before I left . Thanks
Spoke too soon....it's here !
Spoke too soon!---It's here ! Thanks
Hey Jason , I understand that you were out of the office on Friday , and I'll be out of the office on Monday , but I will call you on Monday mid-morning . The customer has called again on Friday , and I would like to get this thing resolved . Please work with me on this issue . I'm not sure what Enerson's role is anymore , but we need "all hands on deck" to get this issue ironed out immediately . My cell # is 713-851-6240 and you may call me anytime . I'll be visiting customers , but please call and leave a message if I'm not available . Thanks
John , Since Heartland Steel was sold in July , 2001 , are you still involved in this deal ? Thanks Patrice
Get out of here!!! ! Is this an Enron company ? If so , I am so happy for you Lizzie , I will certainly miss you . You and I have been working together for years and it's just been so comfortable ! ( just like "old shoes" ) .  I wish you well and I know you'll do a great job !
Hey Lizzie , what is her address , I forgot , I need to send her a business card . 
Hi Guys , Attached please find Enron's offer for additional supply for the November , 2001-March , 2002 period . Please call me with any questions you may have at 713-272-9825 . Thanks
Jim Simpson will be trading these locations , ENA-IM MKT Central C.G . is the book and the the book adminsitrator is Jad Doan . I'm ust helping out and will probably continue to help out . When do you estimate that they will be ready ? Thanks
Thanks so much ! What about the assigment letter between Nicor Energy LLC/Kaztex/Enron ?
Hey girl , I'm trying to print this document....is this something you scanned ? Why don't you fax it to me real quick and I'll sign immediately !
no i have not received yet , what time did you send ?
Did you know......The Royster Clark Nitrogen facility was originally built and constructed by Nicor Gas Company in an effort to stabilize pressure at the East Dubuque location of their system . Royster Clark is currently listed as the largest industrial consumer of natural gas in Illinois , burning 30,000 MMBtu/d . Quote of the Day: There is no "I" in TEAMWORK .
Hi Bob , Here are some notional sales prices at the Chicago City gate starting with calendar year 2003 . Of course , these prices are probably already old , as the NYMEX went up a little this afternoon , but nevertheless , they should at least give you some idea . I'll gladly update these prices for you whenever you give me the word ( we can update them fairly quickly) . As far as a publication such as PIRA , that Enron would recommend , we really aren't comfortable making recommendations as such . Regarding our electronic trading platform EnronOnline , I would like to spend a few minutes via the telephone , walking you through the steps to access that program ( forms to be electronically completed) . I think you will enjoy having access to this tool , so let's set up a time . P.S . Would you be trading under the entity , Corn Products , International , or another entity ? If it is Corn Products International , then we can proceed rather quickly . I'd also like you to start looking at our ISDA agreements ( International Swap Dealers Association) , so that when you are in a position to trade financially , we have all the contracts in place . Please reply when you have a moment . Thanks
Hey girl , I don't know what in the heck I was talking about , Nicor Enerchange did send me the correct version . Please review and let me know what you have for them . Thanks , Patrice
Update: I spoke with Jeff Hodge and was able to obtain a Bill of Sale document from CSN . Jeff is currently reviewing this document and will let me know how to proceed . I'll let you know more when I hear back from Jeff .
Thank you !
Hi Pat , Just a note to recap our recent and ongoing discussions regarding the disposition of the Heartland Steel and CSN agreements: At this point , Enron's Legal Department has requested documentation from CSN that substantiates the fact that CSN did purchase Heartland Steel . I have contacted your legal counsel , Mr . Tarter , and obtained information that will hopefully satisfy Enron's request . The next step for me is to meet with my legal staff on Monday , October 15 , 2001 to determine the following: 1 ) Is the relationship between Heartland Steel and Enron completely severed ? 2 ) Do we come up with a brand new pricing and deal structure with CSN , or does the existing structure with Heartland Steel remain in place ? Once , these determinations have been made , we'll follow up with the necessary legal documents . I'm hoping to have resolution to these entire process by early next week . Talk to you then . P.S . As a notional indicator , November , 2001 pricing for Chicago city gate delivered volume ( which is comparable to your location ) would be estimated at NYMEX ( currently $2.41 ) plus approximately $0.10 . Please keep in mind that the NYMEX price changes on a second-by-second basis , and this will impact your price .
Hi Bob , Per our conversation this a.m. , here are the notional sales prices for Nicor City Gate deliveries for the following: Five Year Price out of January , 2004 = $3.67 estimate Ten Year Price out of January , 2004 = $.3.92 estimate ( Please keep in mind that these are ESTIMATES!! ) If you need these prices further broken out by year , please call me . I will also forward the ISDA and Long Term Gas Purchase Agreement to you early next week . Thanks Patrice P.S . You forgot to answer my question regarding what financial entity you would be trading under , is it Corn Products International ? Write back , because I need this information for the contracts , etc .
Hi Dave , Attached , please find Enron's offer for Trunkline East Louisiana volumes for the winter months ending in 2002 and 2003 . Please feel free to call me at 713-853-5772 should you have any questions . Thank you
Hey girl , What's going on ? It is truly a slow day over here . So far , I really could have taken the day off and would not have missed anything . Last night I had a date with my mother-in-law . She's a member of a book club and they had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel . It was nice , but long . The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their at 6:00 . The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and seating at 6:45 . I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated . But , girl , Ms Thang felt so good last night . I felt like a million dollars in my semi-formal attire . After I left church , I went to one of my favorite stores , Chico's , and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor length ( not by design , I'm just not tall enough ) black skirt . The top that I bought set it off so nicely . It was black , light brown and gold ! I wore my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings , not the ones I wear all the time , but a new pair , much mo' flashy and my black high heel sandals that show all my foot . Boy , I felt good about my appearance . When I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed , Jordan said "Mommy.......you look pretty . Made my evening . Of course , Bozo the husband , didn't say one word . But I felt good , I even had Jordan take some pictures of me , so we'll see how those come out ( smile) . We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home , Todd said the septic tank is stopped up , I have no idea what that really entails , but it must of been ugly . He was pissed ! Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night , speaking of rehearsal , I was wondering where Samantha had been , and Poiter told me yesterday that she's back in school , so that's why she's hasn't been there . How did your evening go last night ? We still need to talk , maybe we'll get a chance to visit tonight . Todd already said he wasn't going to be home until around 11:00 p.m . on Mon , Tues , or Wed , of this week , due to Power Mart . I said fine , have fun . I am so bitter , I'm ready for a change too . Right now , it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing much . All we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different , independent , activities . Plus , I'm ready for a new house , clean break and new environment . Oh well , talk with you later ! Thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos !
Girl , what is PMO ? I'm doing fine , I just sent Tarsha an e-mail , and I hit the send button and there you are ! Is everything going as planned in all of your wedding preparations ? I certainly hope so . I know planning a wedding is alot of work . Jordan is still excited about walking with Taylor . I had a good time with my boys this weekend . They are crazy . We went to the dreaded "Chuckee Cheese" this weekend and oh boy , was I ever glad to get out of there . After that , we went to the Galleria , because when I was there before without them , I saw a shoe store that had really cute , fashionable shoes for little boys . What I didn't realize was that they were designer shoes . Who ever heard of Kenneth Cole shoes for little boys . $65 a pair for the kind that I liked . But since I was there , I said , what the heck ? After about 20 minutes , we had been waited on , but still neither one of my boys had even tried on a pair of shoes yet , let alone buying a pair ( the sales folks were truly taking their sweet time) . I was pissed and me and my possee ( Jordan and Kendall ) almost "set if off" at the Galleria . We just left after I told them that their service was unacceptable . Anyway , don't mess with Moma Thurston . How was your weekend ? See ya !
Hi Pat , I spoke with our attorney this afternoon , and he is in the process of contacting your attorney . It appears that the bill of sale that your attorney had sent to Enron , did not specifically address the agreement that Enron and Heartland Steel entered into . Long story , short , our attorney is following up with to obtain documents that contain this provision . Thanks
Girl , that's my dilemma as far as a house is concerned . I have no idea , all I know is that I don't want to drive for an hour to get to work . I really wish I could tear down and rebuild where I am . I love the "hood" aspect of the neighborhood , I love the "colored" folks , and so on . I need to talk to a loan officer and see exactly what I would qualify for . All I know , is that I'm not getting any younger , and why not enjoy a new house now , what am I waiting for ? Girl , I hope the plumbing isn't too expensive as well , but it has to be done ! Jordan's old silly teacher called me at work this morning around 8:30 a.m . When I answered the phone , I recognized her voice immediately , and I got scared that something had happened . That heifer called to tell me that Jordan was telling her that I had given him money to buy a Fruitopia soft drink ( first of all , it took me questioning her three times to find out what the heck Fruitopia meant ) and she wanted to check with me to see if that were true , because she didn't allow that particular drink in her class because it had too much sugar in it......well , I was pissed number one , that you would even call and upset me at work by asking me such a dumb ass question . You are the adult here , not Jordan ! She also said Jordan kind of smarted off to her.....well , take control sister.....you obviously have no control if you have to call me on my job to settle an insignificant matter such as this . ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!!! ! Now on the other hand , Jordan will have to be punished for lying , but my goodness , can you believe it ?
Here are my cryptic notes from the PEPL class: The field area of PEPL is considered to be everything upstream of Haven Haven is considered to be the demarcation between Field and Market area on PEPL PEPL mainline divided into 100 mile marker segments Two legs in the field area---Liberal and Seiling and/or Elk City ( named after the Elk City Plant ) Liberal historically has been a constrained area , but has seen alot of non-constraints as of the last couple of years due to the strength in the West , as well as production declines in the area For anyone trading PEPL cash , etc , it is important to watch the spreads b/t Rockies , CIG , TW and PEPL--for instance the variable rate to move CIG into PEPL is roughly nine cents . The fuel is 2.67% Another big point that frequently gets constrained is CIG Lakin--point flows roughly around 175,000 MMBtu/d Field Storage - there are actually two storage facilities in the PEPL field area , although PEPL considers field storage to be at Haven , Haven is traded as a field point Greensburg off of NNG is another major supply area on PEPL--called Mullinville on the NNG side , it is called bi-directional , but most likely can be done by displacement only Tuscola - is the interconnect between Trunkline/PEPL interconnect Lebanon - often constrained Also talked about not being able to drop off at multiple delivery points on PEPL--unlike ML7
Hey Neal , My offer for the Fixed Float is $3.11--

Hey Sister Sims , You were really singing those hymns last night ! How long did choir rehearsal last ? I had to go , I was sleepy and , quite frankly , had a hard time really getting into the hymns for that length of time . I do need to look up some of those 2nd and 3rd verses though...... . How is Siera doing in school these days ? I hope everything is going well for her . I still need to get out and look at this other school for Jordan and see what's going on over there . His teacher is really very immature . She called me again yesterday with some silly stuff . You know we need to set aside some time to go get massages and facials and talk . Write back
I did not enjoy it either , I'm glad you said it first . I'm going to look up that Clarins Spa and see if I can afford it and then maybe we can go together . I'll let you know what I find out .
Hey Pat , I've done some research on the actuals that you make reference to ( Vectren) . Enron's sale with Heartland Steel is at the interconnect between Midwestern Gas Transmission and Vectren ( formerly know as Indiana Gas) . The actual volumes that you are reporting and consider to be your monthly actuals are volumes that I believe are behind Vectren's city gate ( which means that you more than likely have an imbalance on Vectren's system) . This bears checking with Vectren , regarding an imbalance behind their gate . You should be receiving some type of statement or invoice from Vectren . Per the contract , Enron uses the Midwestern Gas Transmission ( pipeline statement ) to actualize our monthly invoices to you . I've attempted to draw a diagram for you to make it as clear as I can . Let's talk ! Midwestern Gas Pipeline Interconnect b/t Vectren ( this pipe owned by Vectren ) Heartland Steel Facility & Midwestern Gas Pipeline ( Burner Tip )
Hi Lisa , Will you please add Petro-Canada Oil and Gas to the list of counterparties for Mid-Market . Thanks
Melba , On location #1--I want the name to be NGPL/MANHATTEN--is this too many characters ?
yes
Please see attached .
Did you get with Alex to find out what hotel ? It is the Westin . Also , who is Jason and what are HS numbers ? As far as delivery point , yes , it is the interconnect between Midwestern and Vectren ( the LDC) . Please make sure and bring your pipeline statements . Also , I did meet with Jeff Hodge , our attorney , and I know the details regarding the contract . I'll be in the office until around 10:30 . Thanks
Please call me when you arrive . Thanks
Hi Gene , As promised , here are estimated historical pricing for deliveries at the Nipsco city gate . These prices are by no means , what we specifically charged at the time , but should give you an idea if this pricing is more competitive than the prices you have received in the past . These prices also assume that you purchased gas at the First of the Month Index . Please keep in mind that these sales prices are for deliveries to the Nipsco City gate , and you will need to find out what Nipsco will charge you to transport the gas from the city gate to your burner tip . If my memory serves me , I believe you indicated that you were buying your gas directly from Nipsco , and if that is the case , then we will be comparing "apples to apples" . I still need to find out from you what type of volume you will need on a daily basis . Please call me at 713-853-5772 once you have had a chance to review the information and let me know your thoughts . Thanks
Hey Debra , Here are the changes back from Cilco . I have no problems with the changes , let me know what you think . P.S . Where is the Aux Sable contract ?
These changes , in addition , to the others are fine . Thanks for your help! !
You are sooooooo crazy!!! ! I'll call you after trading !
Hi Jan , So nice to hear from you . I am glad you are finally "enjoying life" . I wish I could join you now . With the Enron stock and "whatnot" , I'll have to hang around alot longer than anticipated ( smile) . Are the boys excited about going to "MDO" . I bet that is a change for them , and alot less expensive for you . The job is going well , I really like it , it is a different kind of stress , but definitely more preferable for me . I really like what I'm doing . My boys are getting the added benefit of Mom being in a really good mood most of the time . Jordan is doing pretty good in school , I'm not really sure that he's in love with school , but he's doing well . Kendall , what can I say ? My Kendall is something else . He is so funny , and guess what , he talks in a very loud voice , it kills me , i wonder where he got that from ! Suzy is moving to New York this Friday morning . Her husband's mom lives somewhere in New York and they will be moving there so that he can hopefully find a job . I hate to see her go , but if it's best for there family , then go for it . Anyway , take care Love ya !

Hi Debra , Nicor Gas Company wants to amend our base contract ( their form of agreement ) to add some "netting language" . Please review ASAP and let me know what you think . I am most anxious to get this amendment reviewed , as this is our biggest LDC in the Midwest and they are continuing to do business with us , and have even sleeved some deals for us , when others would not sell to us .

Hi Pat , As we discussed the pricing for December , 2001 will be as follows ( all prices are estimates at this time and will follow the direction of the NYMEX): For Enron to perform full balancing , this means if you nominate 1,000 MMBtu/d and you burn 2,000 MMBtu/d or if you nominate 1,000 MMBtu/d and you burn 500 MMBtu/d.... . the price will be an estimate of $3.10 per MMBtu for December , 2001 For Enron to perform the service , just as we are currently doing for November , 2001 , whereby you buy or sell the difference at a Chicago Gas Daily price.....the sales price for a baseload quantity ( you select your quantity up to 1,500 MMBtu/D ) will be an estimate $2.85 per MMBtu/d . As I stated above , all the prices listed above are estimates . As of this date , Enron will need to receive a pre-pay on the above listed deals . Please call so that we may discuss . Thanks P.S . The burns are as follows: Date MMBtu/d

We don't have much information , other that the same information that you see . I would like to say yes , I have a new employer , but it seems a little too early as of yet . Keep pulling for me , I need all the help I can get . See ya !
Sandra , Here is the telephone number to the place that Ken Logsdon works . The guy listed at the bottom works for Ken .
Yes , my sister , you have been heavy on my mind.....is everything okay with you ? How are the proceedings coming along ? Everything on my end is okay...still alot of unanswered questions and i'm just waiting to get answers . The positive is that we do have a buyer for the trading group....because it could of easily have been the situation , whereby , nobody was interested . Thank God that did not happen . I've got to plan a birthday party for Jordan next week , and as usual , i'm wracking my brain trying to decide what to do , I detest parties on Saturday at these public place because of the large crowds . Got any ideas ? By the way , has Marcus learned how to read yet ? Jordan tells me he really wants to learn how to read , and I want to make sure that my baby is not behind the rest of the pack . I went to the library yesterday and checked out about 7 books for my baby . We are some reading fools these days . Write back!!! !
You can rest assured that I will definitely have you in my prayers . How is everything going this morning ? What is your state of mind ? Are you feeling strong this morning or a little apprehensive ?

Call me when you get back from your visit . I will probably be leaving here around 2:00 or so . Call me on my cell . Love ya !
Hey , how are you , Yes , I'm still here , I'm doing well . 2001 was not a pleasant year for alot of people , and it was certainly no exception for me . Along with my favorite company going bankrupt , my father passed after a lennghty illness . But all is well for the time being . Nice to hear from you . Tell everyone I said hello . Thanks for thinking of me !
Hey Tom , Not as of yet , but it sounds like maybe shortly . Talk to you later .
Hey Pooky , The rest of the weekend was fine . I forgot to tell you on Saturday night about our choir's performance at this community function we had . In fact , I was on my way home when you and I were talking . Sometimes our choir members are so sad , they don't always show up at functions and events like they should , unless its an opportunity to showboat . So.....I had to sing on the front row on Saturday evening . We sounded like crap....I was so embarassed , I actually got so hot and started sweating , because of my embarassment . It was awful . I just thought about that when your e-mail arrived . Kendall was very whinny and cried alot yesterday , I actually thought he might be getting sick , because that was so out of character for him , but he's back to his old self now , just talking alot and being hard-headed . I just called the lawyer again and got the secretary....she said that she had been out sick with pneumonia and the attorney had some major oral surgery , so she could not talk....so I'll give this firm the benefit of the doubt . The secretary said she would have her call me back shortly or at least the secretary would call me and let me know . So "F" is starting to feel the effects of his years of dishing out dirt . I hate that it hurts , but most men do end up regretting their previous behavior . I know what you mean about your Dad . In my case , my dad would be saying , hold on... . Anyway , I love you too and can't wait to see where we both go from here.... .
Hey "G" , what's up ? I know you will be shocked , but I brought the purse and necklace into the office and will be sending them out this afternoon....so there ! How's it going this morning ? I have been sitting in a class all morning that Hunter is teaching . It's on options and volatility . Boy , that stuff does not sink in well with me , I find the class a real challenge . I'm so uncomfortable in the class . Pray for me , because I need to get this stuff and be able to chart this stuff . Everyone is real helpful though , but being put on the spot , its hard to come up with the answers quickly . It's painful for me....whew ! Talk with you later.......how many days left now ? Love ya
Got it , let's talk tonight . What time is good to call you ? or you give me a call !
Yes , you may us me...are you going to have trouble getting home ? How much snow is on the ground now ?
yes , yes , yes , looking forward to it !
I did not realize there was a problem . Pretty bad out there huh ? You really need to get a cell phone for bad weather , you could have been stranded. ! Glad you're there !
Hey Jimbo , Good morning , Will you please send me your address and fax number , we're going to try and get some contracts sent our sometime real soon . Thanks

Hello Mr . Uutella , I am an analyst working for Enron Industrial Markets in Houston , Texas and I am gathering some information on tissue . I spoke to Rod Young and David Pinault from RISI and they told me to contact you as you do some more extensive studies on tissue usage . What I am looking for are: tissue capacity worldwide and by region ( North America , Europe , Latin America , Asia ) and the biggest companies that produce tissue . Can you also include how much this information would cost ? Thanks in advance , Monika Causholli Enron Industrial Markets
Andrea , I found a private consultant on tissue ( as RISI does not do anything on the subject ) and he is located in Germany . Below is the kind of information that he can make available to us as well as the costs . Can you please advice me on how much information we want to get from him based on what he wrote below ?
Dick , Just spoke with Peter Cardellichio at RISI who is the person in charge oh Asia and he told me that their forecast for Japan is based on the European prices . He said that prices in Europe and Japan have been pretty close historically thus he uses European prices as a base and adjusts thoem based on what is happening to Asia . Hope this helps , Monika
Jim , I found a consultant who does extensive studies on world tissue . PLease read below . Just wanted to know if you knew the guy . His name is Esko Uutella and he is located in Germany .

Andrea , Attached is the pulp presentation . Please take a look and let me know of any changes or additions . Also , tissue facts are taken from a bank of America report as RISI does not have any studies on it . I found one guy in Germany that seems to do quite an extensive work on tissue . I sent you an email yesterday stating what he can offer us and what the costs are . Also note that fluff pulp data is very limited . I am waiting David Pinault from RISI to get back to me as he is researching and digging inside his organization to find anything on the fluff pulp . All these data can be added to the presentation upon availiability . Thanks , Monika
Karen , You are right . I should have included some of my comments on the FOEX recent trends . I''ll keep that in mind for next time . Thanks , Monika
Hello Avril , We have found some good info on tissue paper from an independent consulting company.I talked to Andrea so we are going to go and purchase the study .

You need the following ingredients: Trout Fish ( medium size ) About 4 big yellow onions- chopped into little pieces About 4 pieces of garlic- also chopped in little pieces Tomato Sauce Red Pepper Black Pepper Bay Leaf Lemon Juice Salt White wine Vegetable Oil The process: 1- Clean and wash the fish . Cut the head off you don't need that . Place the fish in a pan and pour lemon juice in it . Leave it in lemon juice while preparing the sauce . 2- In another pan put some vegetable oil and fry the chopped onions . After about 4 min add a little black pepper , red pepper , garlic , salt and bay leaf and stir . 3- Continue stirring until the onions are a little brownish in color . Then add the tomato sauce and continue stirring . You will have a reddish sauce ready . 4- In a baking pan put the sauce that you prepared above and open a free space in the middle for the fish . Place the fish in the middle . Then pour lemon juice and white wine on the whole pan and put the pan in the oven . Keep an eye on it as fish is cooked really fast . When you serve it ad lemon juice again . Another way of cooking the trout fish ( much easier and I think tastier ) Get a small trout this time. , After cleaning it place it in a baking pan . Then add olive oil into it ( lots of it) , lemon juice , chopped tomatoes ( about 2 tomatoes ) ,  and olives . Just bake it and there you have it . Again when you serve it you need to add some more lemon juice . It's delicious ! Try any of these and let me know how they taste . Have fun Monika

Hello Margaret , I am trying to figure out how my husband can obtain a driver's licence in the state of Texas but the office of social security , IRS , and DPS all give me different answers and are not helpful at all . We are confused . My husband is on H4 visa and he does not have a social security but the state of Texas requires the social security to obtain a driver's licence . He has a tax-payer SSN but that did not work for the licence . Do you know what the law is in this case ? Can we ask Enron lawyers about this problem ? Common sense tells me that there can be a way for him to drive here but I don't know how . Please help us , Thanks a lot Monika Cauhsolli
I will be attending . Thanks Enron Industrial Markets
Probably in three months .

SAO PAULO , Brazil , Oct 15 , 2001 ( Reuters ) - Brazilian paper and pulp maker Industrias Klabin Papel e Celulose SA said on Monday it would restructure its units in a cost-cutting drive it hopes will save 60 million reais ( $22 million ) per year . Klabin , one of Brazil's top producers of paper , tissue and wood pulp , will incorporate its Klamasa , KIV , Industrias Klabin and Igaras units under its subsidiary Klabin Riocell SA ,  the company said in a statement . Riocell will remain the sole publicly held company in the group and will be renamed Klabin SA . Minority shareholders in Klabin will be given shares in Riocell at par , Klabin's Director General Josemar Verillo told Reuters . The restructuring , to be completed by December , should reduce administrative , operational , financial and tax costs . It will also improve operating synergies , allow for a better use of financial resources and improve the group's transparency for investors , Klabin said . "We have a lot of business between the group . That leads to operational and financial inefficiencies," Verillo said . The company said it expects to save about 60 million reais ( $22 million ) per year and could trim staff in the long term as a result of the restructuring . In a separate statement responding to an inquiry by the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange , Klabin said its consolidated net revenues would be 10 percent higher in 2001 , driven by exports and a depreciation of Brazil's currency . The company posted net revenues of 1.9 billion reais ( $684 million ) in 2000 .

Foex is up again for the third week in a row even though the increase was at a slower rate than last week .  The increase seems to continue to be the result of price increases announced by pulp producers earlier this month . Today NBSK came in at $463.94/mton up $5.05 ( 1.10% ) and BHKP was Euro 461.76 up Euro 8.78 . Expressed in dollars BHKP was $416.72 up $1.24 ( 0.3%) .

Dave , I am meeting with Maria Teresa this Wednesday to start working on price forecast . I am currently working with Andrew on inventory forecast and the procedure is as follows: Based on the formula ( capacity * op . rate ) - shipments = forecast inventory . We used PPPC capacity forecast for the year and divided by 12 to get the monthly forecast . Then multiply this with our own estimate of the operating rate which can be an average of the last 2 months or the operating rate of last month carried forward , or the last month's operating rate difference with the average and apply that difference to calculate the next month op . rate . We also estimate the level of shipments as the last 3 years average for the month we are trying to forecast . So far we have only tested September and the forecast was pretty close to the actual . let me know if this is what you requested , Thanks , Monika
Karen , Attached is the capacity growth compounded annually for the main regions and the world . Let me know if this is what you wanted , Monika

Cartiere Burgo's Cellardennes pulp mill in Belgium , is back following a seven-day shut . During the closure , the company installed a new 700 air dried tonne/day ABB pulp dryer at the site that will boost Cellardennes' elemental chlorine-free pulp capacity from 260,000 tonnes/yr to 360,000 tonnes/yr .

San Francisco , Oct . 18 , 2001 ( Forestweb ) - Weyerhaeuser Co . will increase the U.S . price of its northern bleached softwood kraft ( NBSK ) price by $20/tonne to $500/tonne effective Nov . 1 , according to a buyer source . Another buyer source said Weyerhaeuser has increased his price by $20/tonne on the sawdust pulp that he buys , "and I assume on the others." Weyerhaeuser officials were not available for comment . Weyerhaeuser has been the lone holdout at the U.S . price of $480/tonne for Oct . 1 , when other North American producers went to $500/tonne . The competitors have complained that Weyerhaeuser's price was a drag on their efforts . Producers and buyers alike have said that $500/tonne has been a hard sell in October , partly because of the market , but also because demand has been so slow . A number of sources say NBSK is at $480/tonne for October , though a few are paying the $500/tonne price . "I don't think we will pay $500 ( in November)," a buyer said today . "I think it will be $490." An agent today described the Weyerhaeuser news as "a plus," but added , "Now all we need is for demand to pick up." Another agent also responded cautiously . "There is no indication anywhere in the world where demand has picked up , certainly not in the paper business . Without that , ( producers ) can announce what they want to , but it is not a slam dunk," he said . As for October transaction ,  aid that in most cases , they didn't move . "I know everyone needs ( price increases ) and I know the inventories have gone down , but my feeling is they will go up again," he said , noting typical late-fall patterns . said that in contrast to the past , paper companies have not been able to make money off of low prices . "It's going to be a battle , for sure," he said . "There's a lot of fighting going on , a lot ( of buyers ) are saying they're not going to pay it."
Doug , Why is the map cut off at the top ? Can you fix this so that it shows all of it ? thanks , Monika
Count me too !
The good news in terms of pricing is that consumption rose this month by 16% , and higher consumption levels will deplete inventories and consumers will need to replace those inventories faster . Hopefully consumption will continue to grow over the next several months . Monika
Thanks ! this is better . Did you by any chance start working on the large map ? Monika

G-P Leaf River pulp mill sale deal with Enron falls through By Diane Keaton San Francisco , Oct . 24 , 2001 ( Forestweb ) -- The tentative deal for Georgia-Pacific Corp . ( G-P ) to sell its Leaf River market pulp mill to Enron Corp . has collapsed , according to a knowledgeable industry source . Neither company is speaking publicly about the latest development , citing policies against commenting on rumors . However , the pending arrangement , subject to final approval , was no secret to some pulp and paper industry players ( see Forestweb , Oct.19) . Top Enron officials were said to have nixed the agreement this week . Last week in its third quarter earnings statement , the company reported a net loss of $618 million , including a write-off of $1.01 billion . The source said the deal might still be salvageable at a later date . The Leaf River mill , in New Augusta , Miss. , has the capacity to produce 600,000 tonnes per year . Since February it has produced exclusively softwood kraft pulp .
Thanks !
Andrew , As a follow-up to our conversation last week I have tried to get the list of mills from PPPC but they are not responding to my requests . There is another way to compile that by using Jacobs Sirrine database information . Second , I changed the inventory sheet to reflect the latest NORSCAN inventory number that I got from PPPC and so the forecast for October changed a bit , more in line with the historical average now . Let me know what you want to do on the pulp mills's list and also anything additional in the inventory forecast sheet . Monika
Hope this helps Monika

Hey Doug , Here is what would be great to have: for Pulp All the mills , their most updated capacity ( can you also find out how often they update the capacity and whether they remove the maintenance related downtime when they come up with the capacity number ) and the type of pulp they produce . for Printing & Writing paper same thing for paper too.In addition , what kind of pulp they use to produce the paper . Can we get the same info in a spreadsheet from too ? thanks , Monika
Today FOEX published its weekly index for pulp: For the first time in weeks both the softwoods and the hardwoods show signs of weaknesses again . NBSK was down $US0.48 or 0.1% after four weeks of price increases . BHKP was Euro 466 down Euro 3.34 . Expressed in US dollars BHKP was $US416.09 down $US2.33 or 0.56% . These decline happens despite the recent efforts from the biggest pulp producers , including Weyerhaeuser , to raise prices . This might be a sign of the fact that the market fundamentals do not support the price increases in pulp . The average FOEX for October is: BHKP:$US 414.76 up $13.67 from the September level Please attached for a chart of FOEX prices
Done !

Hello Jim , It's been a long time since I last wrote you but here I am again . I am still working for Enron , but I moved away from Oregon . Now me and my husband are living in Houston , Texas . I worked in Portland until May of this year and then I though of moving away from Oregon just because opportunities are not as big there . In Portland I wroked as a power real time trader buying and selling power real time . I got tired of that job because of shift work . This summer I joined the forests products department and right now I do analysis for the traders . I ahve taken a couple of derivatives classes offered in the company and plan to take some more . My goal is to move to a trader's position , mostly financial trader to work with derivatives but we will see what happens . Right now I am learning about the market , and how it functions . I plan on taking some classes next term at Rice University in Houston . I need to have better mathematical skills and I will start taking math classes at night after work . We will see how this goes . i have to prepare myself well for the future . That's all on work side . Moving to Houston was quite a change . The weather especially . Right now though the weather is great , it's sunny and in the mid-70s to 80s . I love it . Koli likes Portland better . Houston is a much bigger city and a little more dangerous . I like it though , what I miss is Corvallis and school . I miss business school at OSU and studying for finance classes . I want to go back to school eventually and get both MBA and PHD so I can teach . I would love to be a professor . So how are you ? How is your wife ? Your kids ? Is anything new happening ? What about your parents in NY ? Are they OK from all that has happened ? What about OSU ? Anything new there ? How is prof . Moulton ? Say hi to him from me . What about the students ? Are you still demanding of them ? You know I remember that I put a lot of work in your classes . We plan to go home this Christmas and meet our families . My parents ask me about you all the time . They had the greatest time when they visited me here . well that's all for now but I will keep in touch more often . Let me know how thigs are going with you , say hi to your wife from me best wishes , Monika
yes please include me in the class . thanks Monika Causholli

Shipments of market pulp to China totaled 462,157 tonnes in September , down 0.6% compared with August shipments , according to a report last week by China's Materials Information Center.Despite the month-to-month decline last month , market pulp imports into China year-to-date have climbed 33% vs . the same period last year . From January to September 2001 , imports have totaled 3.54 million tonnes , reported China's general administration of customs . This might indicate that the Chinese buyers have plenty of stocks available and might slow down their purchasing patterns . Weak market in the pulp industry continues to push producers into taking further downtime . As expected the bulk of downtime is taken by the Canadian producers who face the highest producing costs . Today NorskeCanada announced it will take additional curtailment at all four of its BC pulp and paper divisions during the fourth quarter to reflect the continuing difficult market conditions.The company said it will curtail paper production by 60,000 tonnes ( including 38,000 tonnes of newsprint ) and pulp production by 23,600 tonnes in the fourth quarter . Fourth quarter curtailment brings accumulated total paper curtailment for 2001 to 166,000 tonnes ( including 112,000 tonnes of newsprint ) and pulp curtailment to 121,000 tonnes .
Sorry Nyree . No exceptions . Monika
Amy , You could probably add expected capacity projections to see how Asian capacity will change in the future both in pulp and paper and compare that to let's say other areas of the world . I remember that in the RISI conference the speakers were saying that Asian pulp capacity increase will lag behind that of Latin America but their paper capacity will probably explode so they will major pulp buyers . Anyways , you can find the capacity expansion data in the PPPC website . Let me know because I have some printed copies too . Monika
When is the next derivatives II class offered ? thanks , Monika Causholli

In September North American paper demand continued to fall . This is not positive news for the paper and pulp industry . The following is what PPPC released: North American printing/writing paper inventories dropped by about 6% from August to the end of September , but shipments , production , and demand stayed depressed from year-ago levels . Total North American printing/writing production was down 11.0% in September compared with a year ago , to 2.091 million tonnes , PPPC reported . Total shipments were off 9.9% to 2.224 million tonnes . Total inventories decreased 133,000 tonnes from August to September to 2.145 million tonnes and were 313,000 tonnes or 12.7% lower than in September last year . The industry overall operating rate ( shipments to capacity ) in September was 84% , down from 88% in August and down from 96% a year ago . Uncoated free-sheet accounted for most of the inventory drop , according to September statistics released yesterday by the Pulp and Paper Products Council in Montreal . North American demand was down 10.2% in September to 1.038 million tonnes Coated free-sheet ( woodfree ) demand was down 11.2% in September while coated groundwood ( mechanical ) papers demand was off 7.5% , PPPC reported .

Hello Karen , Please find attached Chile's capacity and its expansion projects . Note that: 1- Arauco's Constitucion mill might have another alternative capacity of 360,000 tons a year . I was confused because in their annual report the capacity is mentioned many times , each time different numbers . Can I get your input on this . We can discuss it when you have time . 2- There is one modernization project that will increase the capacity of Pacifico mill ( CMPC ) that will come online on Q1 2003 . I did not apply any percentage rate for the project implementation . PLease advise me if I need to do that plus the rates I should use . 3- The projects in red are not impelemented yet and PPPC does not look very optimistic for those . 4-Sheet 1 of the spread sheet contains the mills' capacities from Jacobs Sirrine which are not far off from the capacities I found in the annual reports . Let me know if I need to work and improve this further . Finally , I had a lot of fun working on this project : ) Monika
Hello , The November FOEX that came out today showed a small up-tick versus last week . FOEX for BHKP was Euro 466.02 up only Euro 0.02 . In terms of dollars BHKP was US$420.55 up US$4.46 ( 1.07%) . Even though the movement upwards is very minimal , it is still in line with the pulp producers' attempts to raise prices . The price increases so far have been partially successful as producers have only been able to push for a US$10-15 dollar increase instead of US$20-30 as previously announced . Still price increases are expected to continue in November . Please see attached for a chart on FOEX indeces . Thanks , Monika Causholli ext . 5-1510
Maybe I should rephrase it: What I was trying to say there was that producers are going to continue to make efforts to increase the prices in November in line with what they have announced . Whether that happens or not remains to be seen . thanks for the feedback though . It helps a lot . Monika

Hello Jim , I was glad to hear back from you . So you are going to be a grandpa soon . That's great news ! Well , the main reason I am writing to you is that I need some advice . I would like to go back to school next year but I have no financial security . My job prospects don't look good either now that Enron was bought from another company . I know that many private schools offer scholarships as well as assistantships . I am looking into all of those . It would be very helpful for me if you would help and direct me in the righ direction , let's say if you know a professor that would like to have his own researcher which would help me in the process to go through with school . I have a great deal of interest in finance , and that is what I want to do , I really don't want to do a MBA , rather a MS in Finance . I am very ambitious and work really hard to succeed . I have great work experience and I have worked for a company that is well recognized for its talent pool . If you can't help me with this process , do you know anyone who can ? I really would appreciate any advice that you can give me because I have no one else to get advice from right now . In addition , if you have any contact in the job market I would look into that too . Thanks Jim , Monika

Hey Ami , Here is my resume . Thanks , Monika
Jim , I was thinking that since I do not have enough time to prepare the appplication process , it would be a good idea for me to fax the recommendation letter forms to you first so you know what to expect and maybe start writing . In the meantime , I will mail those forms as well as envelopes because you have to retunrn those to me . The envelopes would have to be signed across the seal . There will be a total of four schools that I am applying to . 1- Yale 2- Boston College 3- University of Massachusetts 4- Bocconi University ( Italy ) Thanks , Monika

Dave , Just got off the phone with the school . Apparently I don't have enough time to submit application but I practically begged for it so they are allowing me to submit a late application .

So , is it possible to change the date of departure until Jan 11 in the letter that you wrote for me . It would be great . Thanks , Monika
It's all corrected .
