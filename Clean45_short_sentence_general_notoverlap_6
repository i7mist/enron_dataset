email works good
do you know which deal i should put that on
no replying this late at night
then i don't have an excuse for not doing my job
i just created deal 0
an equitrans
capacity deal
i populated all the fields because sylvia campos had created the information prior to my creating the deal
after i released the deal
the pipeline contract and agency contract disappearred
the equitrans capacity deals exist
i have very little info on this deal
who pays for the ft on equitrans
contract 0
volume=0,0/day
start date = 0/0/0
max demand
all receipts and all deliveries
and the end date is 0/0/0
looks suspicious to me
scott is trying to find the term of this deal from equitrans
i believe equitrans did say this is a capacity release deal
scott
i'm going to list this as a wholesale deal for now
it was not on my wholesale transport worksheet from mark breese
please email everyone with the end date when you find out
also
please find out who the releasing shipper is and the primary receipt and delivery points
thanks
done
take a look
thanks buddy
not yet
however
the contract is valid because vickie is using it
i believe this was suppossed to be a much bigger deal
there was some confusion between ces and eagle point and it ended up just being more or less and exchange deal on anr and a transport deal on cgas
check out this website

we bought gas from keyspan at $0.0 intraday today

we have no value for this much marq
we might be able to use about 0,0 dth of this
i have a call in to greg synder at cng
greg is in the rates group

this is the way i show the dayton power exchange deal starting 0/0/0
please let me know if this is incorrect
ena delivered gas to dayton's tgt citygate
in return
dayton is giving ena gas at various cgas citygates
there are no fees for this transaction
the tgt deal is 0
the cgas deal is 0
the volumes on these deals should match
also
dayton should not be using any ena supply
pool gas or ena storage
to supply the cgas citygate volume
victor
i did not put a meter number on the cgas deal
also
it's time to introduce steve gillespie to sitara
sorry it took so long

hi guys
we need to add the ces demand charges to the east desk p&l
the impact to the desk is
$0,0
this includes the demand charge paid to calp and the reimbursements for the penn fuel capacity

how are we accounting for that
the file is under o:/logistics/capacity/east/ne/ces/0ces0.xls use tab ces wholesale

my note in a bottle
stumpy and his wife martha went to the state fair every year
every year stumpy would say
martha
i'd like to ride in that there airplane
and every year martha would say
i know stumpy
but that airplane ride costs ten dollars
and ten dollars is ten dollars
one year stumpy and martha went to the fair and stumpy said
martha
i'm 0 years old
if i don't ride that airplane this year i may never get another chance
martha replied
stumpy that there airplane ride costs ten dollars
and ten dollars is ten dollars
the pilot overheard them and said
folks
i'll make you a deal
i'll take you both up for a ride
if you can stay quiet for the entire ride and not say one word
i won't charge you
but if you say one word it's ten dollars
stumpy and martha agreed and up they go
the pilot does all kinds of twists and turns
rolls and dives
but not a word is heard
he does all his tricks over again
but still not a word
they land and the pilot turns to stumpy
by golly
i did everything i could think of to get you to yell out
but you didn't
stumpy replied
well
i was gonna say something when martha fell out
but ten dollars is ten dollars
a much better

here is what i have so far
one of the floor tech's i chat with is ishi carter

i learned some things today
ishi said enron hires techies through 0 companies new boston technologies
0-0-0
and comsys
0-0-0
techies work for these companies for 0 months and then enron may or may not make them an offer
ishi said it would be ok for you to call him
but
i'm thinking i should at least know your name first
also
we have a ton of other it type people in the company i'm going to chat with
i get you more scoop later
i just sent you and email
feel free to mention my name to ishi

hey
how's my little boy doing

here are some numbers you may need to reach me this weekend

and
you can leave me a voice message on my pager

returning on monday
this file is located at o:/logistics/capacity/east/ne/ces/ces invoice thanks
get out
no way
i think i'll change something in the system
i think its just the demand charge
algon only has 0 firm commodities that we have worked with and both are fairly cheap
most of the algon expense is in the demand charge
fyi
not the markets i was hoping to see
does any of this impact the central desk
my worksheet has a lot of support for the pricing we billed for january
take a look at the worksheet and give me a call
we probably will not be able to cover everything at once
we still have a few items to bill
i will let you know what those items are and when we expect to bill them
i just created
0bug0.xls
and
0tran0.xls
joe
we will continue to use the ces wholesale tab in the 0tran0 worksheet
i sold 0 to ces at the allied meter for tomorrow
deal 0
joann
let the tenn schedulers know what additional volumes you need at broad run
i knew we would have to address this eventually
ces is long 0/month in tgt z0 at cg&e
i showed them a $0.0 bid for tomorrow
before i had worked up the price
ces decided to take the gas into cgas at lebanon
this gets real messy
is there any way we can refuse this
at first
i was thinking we would have to do this
now
i don't like the idea because it will be really messy in the summer
i didn't have this email when i left yesterday
always a pleasure
o
you go girl
ces has decided to take 0 dth/day of their texas gas zone 0 length into cgas at lebanon for the 0th-0th
to keep the deal tickets simple
i am showing a purchase from ces at lebanon for 0 dth/day at the first of the month cgas price
joe
i created a purchase from ces
deal 0
match this up with 0dth of deal 0

last week
he said he was working on their transport numbers
also
yesterday i informed jeff about some transport cgas had listed on the ebb
good news
even better when it happens
my contract at ces
brian perrone
just told me ces will pay the invoice we billed them
they still need to reconstruct january
billing i still need to work on january capacity and sales to ces
i found a significant amount of transport i left out of january
i want to fix the feb capacity sheet and bill ces tomorrow or fri for capacity and the scheduling fee
the feb invoicing should be much cleaner and ready to go out by the 0th
i love chic fe le
0:0 am am dear producers and shippers
in january
you were notified that the schultz gas processing plant would be permanently shut down on february 0
0
we heard from many of you regarding the financial hardship this shut down may cause schultz area producers while a gas delivery alternative was being constructed
given your concerns and given that natural gas liquids prices have risen sufficiently to allow operations at schultz to be marginally profitable
cng transmission will continue to operate the schultz facility until
0
it becomes uneconomic to continue operations or
0
cng develops a compression/pipeline alternative for delivering and processing the schultz area gas elsewhere on its system
we remain committed to serving producers throughout the appalachian basin and hope this operating decision addresses the concerns voiced by you
if you have any questions regarding this notice

here is what vickie told me about capacity on your pipeline after you eliminate segmenting
example #0 assumtion
peco has 0,0 dt/day of telescoped capacity with a primary delivery point of peco in z0
what will enron and peco be able to schedule iff peco releases 0,0 dt/day of st 0 to peco citygate under the following scenarios
peco schedules gas from st 0 to wss
and enron schedules gas from peco schedules gas from st 0 to st 0
and enron schedules gas from st 0 to assumtion #0
peco released enron 0,0 dt/day of telescoped capacity
enron schedules gas from st 0 to wss
and from tetco/ragley to z0
check it out
nuthing but retail stuff
why would anyone do retail stuff
meredith
please path deal 0 with 0 for jan 0
this should capture the meter bounce fee ena owes bay state
sherry
i don't remember who gave me this invoice
i will leave it on your desk
m
these deals should show up in unify by lunchtime today
sherry
you guys should see this after lunch
thanks
uhhh
you bet
call me if you have questions
i believe we need to assign someone from the central desk to be the point person for ces central desk activity
for pricing and scheduling issues
ces currently has issues with the btu conversions at the different michcon citygates
ena delivers the gas to different michcon citygates and each one has a different btu factor
this causes ces to be long or short depending on the conversion factor
i'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it but i would prefer to have someone from the central desk address this issue
comments
do you think scott should go to this

the bottom of my foot was facing north east
i got to ride in an ambulance to the hospital

he popped my foot back in place and sent me to x-ray
i don't have any broken bones but the ligaments are probably all torn up

i'm still working on the february invoice to ces
i estimate that everyday this invoice does not get out cost enron about $0,0 a day
feel free to call my boss scott neal about the problems you are having
do we have an invoice from cgas of ohio
i would like to see it if we do
i don't show any record of a deal like this
i'm going to send an email to my ces contact to see if he shows anything in his notes about this
brian
we have a deal we can't identify
do you show anything in your records about purchasing 0,0 dt's on jan 0th or 0st
it looks like a 0 day deal and we bought the gas delivered from cgas of ohio
the delivery point in our system is 0n but that may be wrong
the price would be somewhere around $0.0
do we currently have any mountaineer or west virginia production
robert
i changed the volumes on the ces buy/sale deals 0 and 0
i just entered a volume for the last day of the month
you don't need to do this right away
when you get a chance go into unify for feb and show an actual volume of 0 for the 0th
0th and a volume of 0 for the 0th
then retrack and balance
jeff
i will include these deals on my manual billing worksheet to you
you should be able to apply the payments to these deals
i think we are good to go
jeff
i believe the manual billing items are in the

i will be out for the rest of the afternoon
i will try to touch base with you later today

kimat singla entered this deal in the system and it shows maureen smith as the ena trader and tim ray as the ees trader

kim is taking care of that invoice
thanks
hi gang
you guys may or may not be interested in this
the files
febsaleinv0.xls
and
febsaleinv0.xls
are excel formats of ena's invoice to ces for the month of feb
the
0ces0.xls
file is where goodell and i keep track of the ces transport demand charges and all the transport pricing
there is also a tab in this file called cgas
i use the data in this tab to calculate the sale to ces on cgas
it is a completly manual process
i believe it would be benificial for all of you to at least understand the pricing
excellent performance review stuff
i do want to go over the data in the cgas tab just to make sure i'm looking at the data correctly
thanks
did you ever send ces copies of the demand charges for jan 0

scott
according to colleen
this will take up a significant amount of someone's time to track
i took the egan storage demand charge to 0 in the ces wholesale worksheet until david can determine it we have accounted for the charge someplace else

my ces buddy is starting to focus on local production now
what's bad is ces has seen some of the pricing for the local production
i was going to bill them a lot more for it
that does not mean they agree to the pricing
would you guys please give the latest cgas number for ces
you know
thats where you give the total volume delivered by day on ena
calp
and dayton transport
thanks
i know we have not been treating storage correctly in sitara
i would like to disscuss the best way to handle the ces storage
it involves several pipelines
who should i talk to
on some storage contracts
ena will buy the gas from ces on withdrawals and sell the gas to ces on injections
on other storage contracts
ces will give ena a predetermined injection schedule
however
ena will make the acutal injection and withdrawal decisions
which means
what we bill ces will be different from what actually happens
i know this is what we did with bug
i just don't know how to do it
who do i need to meet with to discuss ces storage
i want to make sure joni sees everyting on cgas as well
brenda was able to obtain a copy of the ces egan storage contract
we don't have a copy of the letter assigning the contract to ena though
we do have copies of the invoices for jan and feb
the invoices are addressed to ena which is good enough for me
i am going to set the contract up as an ena contract effective jan 0
unless someone has an objection
brenda will give a copy of the contract to sylvia
egan does not have a contract number so brenda will determine that
also
the contract has an evergreen provision but i don't think we should set it up that way
let me know if you have questions
thanks cg
dick
i don't have this deal in my records as a sale to ces
when you get back
let's look at your deal sheet and see if there are any notes
fyi
need an upgrade on the 0nd
thanks
i understand
i'm involved because it may have been used to serve ces
if we used it to serve ces
i should have called ces to negotiate a price and thats what i don't see in my records
i guess we won't be having dinner for a while
huh
the web site is in the first paragraph
have fun

it's not in the worksheet
i sold ces 0dt of cglf mainline gas
deal 0
effective 0st-0st
aristech only had enough mainline capacity to pull away 0 dt

0 variable cost mainline to leach
0 demand charge please let me know if you have any questions

cng has granted ena fuel waivers from iroq/canajoharie to the following cng citygates
nimo
east
west
nyseg
and hanley
bird
according to this morning's sheet
we are delivering about 0,0 dt to these 0 delivery points
following are 0 ways of getting the gas into cng at canajoharie
0
idle some of our tenn z0 capacity and flow iroquois in to cng
at today's prices we save
savings tenn variable $.0 at $0.0 cng fuel $.0 at $0.0 total savings $.0 at these prices
if the tenn z0 and cng pool spread is inside $.0
we should idle tenn capacity and deliver iroq to canajoharie 0
buy waddington
get an it discount from wadd to canajoharie
we save the cng fuel cost
this usually only works when iroq shows a discounted rate of last year
cng granted most of these fuel waivers all summer
i always have time for you
i'm out all day tomorrow
funny
oh my poor foot
noone cares about me
looks pretty empty so far
that's all good and well buy where is my diet coke
i will be emailing all of you with any capacity issues i find
cglf k#0
this is an offshore fts0 contract that we use with the west cam devon production
the demand charge is $0.0 on a volume of 0,0 dts and the commodity is $.0
according to my notes
this is a volumetric demand contract and the volumetric demand charge in my sheet is $.0 i am changing this to a regular demand charge contract in sitara and the worksheet
i don't think 0rd times a charm
did you go to scholl at a&m buddy
for jan
the difference between volumetric and demand was less than $0.0 enron capital management
i'm out tomorrow and if i win the lotto tomorrow nite
mr
goodell will be a busy fellow
i think i visit tahitti
that's ok
i need to buy back the gas ces is not taking
i think that will be easier to do after the month is over
i will calculate the volume and pricing in a worksheet and just enter a buy and a sale with ces on the last day of the month
steve will find out what the pricing is and will let me know
cindy/cng is looking at the park and loan deal
she laughed when i said gave her the volume of 0,0
the most she will consider is 0,0
so i told her to look at a total storage volume of 0,0 and ena would pay $0.0 in demand charges each month
she needs to think about it
i'm out tomorrow but i will call her
also
we are actually looking at
0,0 to 0,0 and we would be billed fuel if the deal rolls from 0 month to the next
i added deal 0
cglf k#0 for feb to sitara
what is this capacity for
its fts 0 at rate $0.0
pulled up deal 0 and added a demand charge for k#0
what's this
according to navigator
we only have this contract for 0 day on feb 0rd
i just entered it in the ces retail sheet
mdq = 0 and the rate is $.0
who did this deal
the receipt points are exxon-chalkley
ngpl
and tenn-egan
the delivery point is rayne
it looks like we nominated gas on this contract
i'm setting up this up in sitara and on our 0tran0.xls worksheet and i entered it in sitara deal 0
jesse
this will need to be scheduled in unify
i need to pull my tapes for jan 0st
would you take care of that please

enron north america corp
this is ok for march
i entered the sale to allegheny in sitara
deal 0
effective 0/0/0 thru 0/0/0
dick
scott
the sales price is trigger deal priced at nx0 + $.0
allegheny holds the trigger and the daily volume is 0,0 day at leach or the cgas pool
my contact at allegheny is nat miljus
phone 0-0-0
david is going to make me fill out a term ticket and i'm running it through dick's book
actually
my preference would be to have the contract released to ena year round
this means robin would have to bill calp for the commodity and demand during the summer
depending on the relationship you would like to have with the customer
i think it is easier to bill the customer for the demand and the commodity as opposed to reimbursing them for when we use the transport
at least with the way things work in our systems
yuck
some of this looked spooky
baseball tickets
you and your buddy maureen go to the game on tuesday

joanie's email to me about the roanoke pricing has me curious
do i need to check the pricing on all the wholesale ces deals
i do have some reports which paul drexelius gave me in january out of ces's gms system
dick had asked me to sit with paul one afternoon and talk about the deals
i have not done any price verification or auditing of the deals in sitara
let me know if you want me to audit sitara
i guess my new address is chris.germany@enron.com
i changed the volume on the deal to 0,0 dts
charlie
this is a deal dick jenkins did with john
ena is buying this gas let me know if you have questions
that stuff will just make you fat
you keep that up and you will never have a slim
trim figure like i do
what do i get if i break the chain
yep
i'm a wild man now
you know all and see all
who can i start sending all these pricing questions to
enron north america corp
i'm thinking about getting a
hang glidin
tatto
them's fightin words
ahh my poor ankle
it's just about time for me to leave i think
since we now feel certain ena bought this gas on jan 0st
please path the supply deal from coh
deal 0
to one of those large ces deal tickets
i'm still checking the tapes to see if we can recoup the cost from ces
joanne

we parked 0,0 dt/day on the 0th-0th
deal 0
on cng and we will be taking it out during april
deal 0
ena will pay cng $.0 x 0,0 dt = $0,0.0 in april
please let me know if you have questions
oh it hurts so bad
sure wish i had a diet coke to take my mind off the intense pain
hi team
i just extend cng deal 0 through 0/0/0
hey
i just undid what i did because the deal already exist under ena
market east
thanks dude
i would change it to an it gathering contract
i didn't know we had any firm gathering in the market area
and currently
i am not working on the other gathering contracts
mary theresa franklin will be working on all the gathering stuff
she and i will be getting together tomorrow afternoon at 0:0
actually
you could set the priorities for us
what should we work on first
we borrowed
deal0
about 0,0 dt from cng for the 0th and we will pay it back
deal 0
on the 0th
ena will pay cng $.0 times the daily balance on the 0th
this gets confusing because we already have a parking deal from the weekend that comes out in april
i sure did work hard on this didn't i
you de
woman
what's the word mr
goodell
i'm thinking there is no demand charge and this acts like a shell agreemtent which i don't understand
i'm all over it
i executed the bug capacity for april
offer #0
vol=0
k#0
deal numbers 0/0 i set it up under marketeast and east with market east as primary
effective april 0st
we will have several transport capacity tickets set up under 0 desk
market east and east
all longhaul capacity on tetco
trco
and tenn will be set up under both desk
all capacity on cng
iroq
equit
nat fuel
and cgas will be market east
now
all of our current capacity on these pipes is either bug

or east
so even on these pipes you will probably see the same contract under both desk

after the all offers have been executed
have meredith check screen an0 effective 0/0/0

i need to make sure we are not paying for this
if it turns out to be retail
i will make sure i give ces credit for the transport
scott goodell thinks this might be wholesale capacity for april and may
this is the first time i've heard about this
i believe joanie said this capacity is primary to op 0 which doesn't do much for us
i need to know if we have to take this space
i would prefer not to take the space if we don't have to
joanie will send us an email after she checks with the ces asset management group
i segmented the rest of our tetco capacity this morning effective the 0th
please update your morning sheet with new an0's
thanks
this deal has been entered a cng south citygate deal and it should be entered and cng appalachian production
jim javins said he thought the deal was behind hastings
could you guys move it
i would but mr
tengle yelled at me about messing up the risk assignments
t&f operating has sent ena a
breach of contract
letter and is requesting to terminate the contract effective 0/0/0
colleen
i will give you a copy of the letter that was faxed to john singer
ces did a buy/sale behind penn fuel on cgas for 0 year starting nov 0
0
t&f is the supplier and glenn gary was the market
the market went away effective 0/0/0 and ena/ees has no other market behind this part of penn fuel's system
we checked with the penn fuel asset management deal and according to penn fuel
they can't take it either
t&f is looking for their payment for jan
feb
and mar
and t&f will waive any and all
cover
cost that ena would otherwise be liable for subsequent to john singer wants to make sure we address the hedges in the books
will this need to be included in the ces true-up
also
john wants to know if he should sign the letter
colleen
i told john you would anwser that question
hey dudes
we need someone to attend this
i'm thinking scott goodell should go
let's chat
i took the volume on deal 0
devonian resources
to 0 for april
hey john
give me a call when you get a chance so we can chat about this
also
send me your phone number
i can't find it
hey john
did ces take this gas for jan
feb
and mar
wade would like to see this deal in the system
if this is metered production then its not cut
it just flows to the pool
if its pool gas then it probably is cut
so you tell me
metered production or pool gas on cng
ok this is metered production on cng
gloria will let us know which cng contract to path this deal with
the meter numbers are 0
0
and 0 and this is ces production
after gloria lets us know which contract
s
to use
angie will path this deal in sitara with a zero volume
secondary non-recallable
you can use $.0 year round or $.0 for apr-oct which is probably a little high and $.0 for the winter
the non-recallable factor is the hard thing to figure in
i faxed a copy of the psnc invoice for march to brian perrone
i show this as a purchase from ces at st 0

i guess you won't be taking me out for a cheeseburger this evening will you
actually
cheeseburger and a shake
i'm going through the jan transport invoices
i see i need to bill ces for some south georgia activity
how did we pay south georgia
i don't see a matrix in unify
big bang
are you saying i was born out of the lowest form of life on earth
i've gone through most of the ces stuff for jan
i'm missing several demand charge contracts and commodity for ces on trco
i think you need to call me
brian
i'm fed exing you copies of all the transport invoices today with the following exceptions
transco
i missing some of the demand charges and all of the commodity charges
i am still updating my transport capacity sheet with actuals and i will be making a billing adjustment this friday
i have not review all the invoices i am sending you

hi campers
its that time of month again
i need all the transport information for ces for march
i apologize for this
may i get a copy of all the invoices we sent ces for january please
i think the national fuel is local production
i'm don't know how you would swing this volume
do we still need to be transporting bridgeport cng produciton gas through coronado to cgas
and if yes
will this gas always need to go through coronado
i thought that was just a seasonal thing
the ces/cem cng appalachian production is still flowing into the ces/cem gathering and transmission contracts
unless someone objects i would like to get this moved over to enron's pool
we don't need to have the gathering and transmission contracts moved over
i havn't worked on any of the april pricing in the system yet
i'm working fast and furious on march
i was going to do most of april next week with molly
can i give it to you then
also

terry

0-0-0
at cng transmission and have these meters moved from ces/cem pools to enron's pools

if cng needs meter information
maybe you could send them the statement they send to gloria
i believe ces/cem has 0 contracts
let me know if you have any questions
thanks

demand charge of $.0/mmbtu to calp for any volumes utilized by ena

everyone else is more than welcome to attend
please let me know if you will be attending
i will schedule a conference room after i know who is attending
hey anita
i changed the price and attached is my calculation
your rates are close enough as far as i'm concerned though
chewies on the way
no
calp is a wholesale contract
don't i always get back to you within 0 min
ok
now either mary theresa franklin or angie needs to path out this deal in unify with a zero volume
please reserve a conference room for up to 0 people for 0 hour on wednesday
april 0th around 0:0pm
thanks
hey gang
joanie is still working on current day activity
joanie
please call jeff porter at 0-0-0
i will try to update this worksheet every other day if not every day
could you get terry authorization to path in unify please
thanks
the meeting is in room 0 from 0:0
0:0
experience has taught me that someone much more important may bump us
this meeting will focus on the cgas storage contract
what we bill ces for storage injections will be different than what we actually inject
april is a little more difficult because we will be injecting and withdrawing at the same time
cgas only bills on the net injections or withdrawal amounts
the deals in sitara are set up as cpr storage for the injections and the withdrawals
which brings up the following issues
* how do we bill ces for injections if we don't enter buy/sales with ces at the storage facility
kate fraser said there were never any bug buy/sale tickets in sitara for storage
how did that work
mark
i'm counting on you for this one
* how do we track the storage balance in unify
* how are the injection/withdrawal cost capture
especially since cgas will bill on the net injections/withdrawals i'm sure there are more issues that will come up during the meeting
thanks enron north america corp
fyi
hey gang
the room number has changed to 0
why is bill clinton so reluctant to decide the fate of elian gonzalez
because last time he made a decision about where to put a cuban
he was impeached
please change the zone location for meters t0 and t0a0 from north other to south other
thanks
i don't think ces has transport on these pipelines
i should have february to you by next week some time
what happens if we sell ces spot gas
it would be fixed price
maybe we could send ces a different type of report since they have so many deals
what do you think
hey guy
please copy scott goodell and molly on anything you send me in the future
molly will be working with me on all the ces deals
her email address is molly.johnson@enron.com
thanks
molly and i discovered that ces has about 0 dt of texas gas zone sl to z0 capacity each month
dayton releases this capacity to ces each month
we have been using this capacity since jan 0 to serve the ces zone 0 markets
according to steve
the primary path on this capacity is zone sl to dayton's meter in zone 0
i have been pricing all the texas gas zone 0 at if cng app
i believe we need to add a texas gas zone sl if and make the premium $.0
i have not brought this to ces's attention
they will eventually catch it because we have been billing ces the transport demand charge
seen this one
according to ed santa with iroq
we paid the disputed parking for june 0 activity and we did not pay $0.0 of expnese in may 0
i not concerned about the june 0
would you once again please verify what we paid iroq on the disputed parking fee from may 0 through july 0
thanks
jeff
i have update this sheet for the actual storage to date
i'm trying to keep this worksheet simple
i added the actual numbers per navigator
i think i need to add an enron balance and a ces balance
what do you guys think
jeff
i highlighted all items that need to be suspended or changed in yellow
i'm still working on the purchases
i do have 0 significant purchase items that i want to include on the manual bill
and
i'm still working on the pipeline demand charges
i call you with that number
please add the following demand charges to the manual invoice
transport demand $0,0,0.0 i may have included the scheduling fee in the manual invoice
this morning
roman blake with calp told robin barbe that calp never received the payment for the wire transfer
this is the first i've heard of this
mark
would you please verify that the payment went out
i've copied joanie because she talks to calp quite often and i just want her to know what is going on
also
i have a copy of the march bill
i will go through it today and give mark a copy
thanks
joanie found the email from calp stating they did receive the wire payment
robin called roman and gave him the info
thanks joanie
i love being a man
ain't life great
hey

scott goodell
molly johnson
jeff westover

i don't know a thing

goodell is an expert

i'll let kevin answer this one
anr and michcon are central desk pipes

i would prefer to address all items on exhibit 0
if possible i would like to see the original exhibit 0 volumes and updated exhibit 0 volumes through march 0
however
i don't remember buying back any baseload gas on tco for april
i thought we priced everything at fom if and every day
we are buying back gas at gd
$.0
0
are you doing a buy sell with erron at the same price
does duke bill ces directly for this
0
see attached worksheets
0
i don't know all the information on the local production yet
the pricing i'm currently using is the exhibit 0 fom deliverd pricing
pricing using ena transport
the attached april file has a local production tab
molly johnson is updating this information
after she completes april
she will recreate jan
mar
0
since the delivered pricing on tco is the same
i'm not concerned about the individual citygate volumes
for pricing purposes
i only care about total daily deliveries
it would be a problem if you were trying to take additional gas from a non-constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and you don't have enough capacity
this holds true for most other pipelines as well
tenn z0
cng north citygate
cng south citygate
this would be a better question for charlie to ask me when he is looking for something specific as it comes up
the only thing i will not allow you to do is take gas from one pipeline to the other
texas gas z0 to cgas
and colleen has discussed this with melissa
transport pricing info formula where
dp = delivered price rp = receipt price commodity = usage rate
$.0 on cgas
the password is 0tran0
ain't i just the nicest guy you know
modest too
my fault
the numbers in yellow are estimates
ces contact
ugi ships the gas for ces
normally we sell ces this gas at ela
it looks like it will be at cglf mainline for the next few months
doug will verify this information and let us know

robert

moths
a man and a woman meet at bar one day and are getting along really well
they decide to go back to the woman's house where they engage in passionate love making
the woman suddenly cocks her ear and says
quick my husbandjust got home
go hide in the bathroom
so the man runs into the bathroom
her husband comes up into the bedroom and looks at her
why are you naked
he asks
well
i heard you pull up outside
so i thought i would come up here and get ready to recieve you
okay
the man replies
i'll go get ready
he goes into the bathroom before his wife can stop him and sees a naked man standing there clapping his hands
who the fuck are you
the man asks
i am from the exterminator company
your wife called me in to get rid of the moths you are having problems with
the husband exclaims
but you are naked
the man then looks down and jumps back in surprise
those little bastards
do you know if this has been addressed
they are all in really bad shape
may is looking pretty good though
has this been addressed

according to joanies worksheet
we can inject a max of 0,0,0 into storage for the month of may
for now
our target injection volume in storage for may will be 0,0,0
when we overinject
like we did for the first four days
we need to decrease the volumes on deal 0 for the rest of the month so that the total volume on this deal will be i will try to monitor the deal volume
thanks
richard
according to marlene

term 0/0/0
deal 0 ces buy and deal 0 ces exchange sale
term 0/0/0
thanks
what do i need to do
should i end the exitsting contracts effective 0/0/0 and create new ones effective 0/0/0
does marlene need to create a new type of ft rate service to make these contracts appear different
maybe that has already been done
hey

shows a basis price of $.0 for april and ces is showing $.0
please verify which price is correct
done
please review the following zones
they are different from last month's pricing
tgt zone 0 <=== the biggest change tenn z0 and i added cglf onshore and cglf mainline
i don't know if we will have cglf changes or not but i wanted to set up pricing to take care of it
i was trying to send the tractor photo to you yesterday but i was having problems
i will try again tonight
it takes a long time for system at home to show a photo email
molly set up the following tickets to capture our cgas storage transactions
this is how it will work
deal # comment 0 ces exchange buy
use when storage injections are less than the proxy volume 0 ces exchange sell
use when storage injections are greater than the proxy volume 0 ces sell
this is the proxy storage injection ticket
the volume should not change
the daily proxy volume for the month of may is 0,0
when we inject 0,0
the transport we use to fill storage will be the supply for deal 0
when we overinject like we did for the 0st
0th
0,0 of the transport will be matched with deal 0 and the balance of the transport will be matched against deal 0
when we underinject
we will use deal 0 as the supply for deal 0
this may seem a little confusing
please call me if you still have questions
thanks
fyi
robert
would you put these deals on the morning sheet please
thanks
we will not be using the cpr storage deal ticket any more

the tetco demand charges on the ect trans worksheet were not subtotaled

i'm taking it out of the ena sheet
its $0,0 that's all for now
as usual

new virus taking offices by storm this virus warning is genuine
there is a new virus going around
called
work
if you receive any sort of
work
at all
whether via email
internet or simply handed to you by a colleague
do not open it
this has been circulating around our building for months and those who have been tempted to open
work
or even look at
work
have found that their social life is deleted and their brain ceases to function properly
if you do encounter
work
via email or are faced with any
work
at all
then to purge the virus
send an email to your boss with the words
i've had enough of your crap
i'm off to the bar
your brain should automatically forget the
work
if you receive
work
in paper-document form
simply lift the document and drag the
work
to your garbage can
put on your hat and coat and skip to the nearest bar with two friends and order three bottles of beer
or rum punch
after repeating this action 0 times
you will find that
work

did cove point approve that
i'm always willing to drive for a free lunch
do you have a home for the t&f explor behind penn fuel for june
i left a message for charlie at ces this morning about all the other citygate production
i'm also trying to get a bid from cng for the month of june on the eog and peoples gas
i'll keep you posted
just got word from ees
they can take the eog gas
marde will show me a number after i find out if ces wants this or not
marde also said the seller pays a flat $0.0 to transfer gas out of their pool to ees's pool
marde said the nom for june would be done as an imbalance transfer and she paid if +$.0 for gas this month
ees cannot take any peoples gas
should i have scott hendrickson try to sell it to peoples
i'm also going to leave a message for paul at clinton
marde is going to check around
yep
so that would be part of our $0,0.0 gain
right
i just spoke with ces
ces will keep the national fuel for the month of june since june is the last month
please call me when you get a chance to discuss everything
i did not discuss the equitrans gas with ces
i want to talk to scott about that tomorrow
hey you said i could delete this one
yea
did you get the fax of the consumers energy invoice
we have the equitrans capacity
0,0 dt/day
through july
scott will tell john singer we need to get out of this capacity
scott and i have decided to leave this on the ces retail worksheet and see what happens
ena purchased the 0,0 of bg&e space from ces
did you get the fax of all the deals in our system for june
hey
you still exist
one free soda for you upon request and providing i have $.0 in my pocket
as of today's gas day
ena has a balance of 0,0 dth in ces's storage
we still have 0,0 dth we can over inject for the month of may to reach our

i killed deal 0
the contract number was incorrect
hi
chris
iroq cannot find the payment for may 0 of $0,0.0

i thought the meter numbers were different
just be nice to me when you become my boss
boss
o
in today's gas daily
northern natural gas has a help wanted ad
you probably aren't doing your job
i found a couple of big adjustments on the april capcity sheet
i am still billing ces for the union camp capacity and it was terminated effective the net impact is $0,0.0 that needs to be credited back to ces
it also appears that i billed ces the scheduling fee of $0,0.0 twice
jeff
the new transport demand charges plus the scheuduling fee of $0,0.0 equals $0,0,0.0
if we billed ces twice for the scheduling fee
then we should issue a credit to ces of about $0,0.0
please redraft deal 0 and let me know what the impact is
i would like to send out the credit either today or tomorrow
thanks
cg
i changed the effective date on the following transco deals in sitara
transco told me this morning that these contract agencies were terminated effective 0/0/0
deals 0 and 0
please send this email to anyone that may need to see it
i'm sure i left someone out
this is citygate gas ena will sell to ces for june
this will reduce the numbers on the sheet doug sent us yesterday
east ohio gas on cng 0,0 dth
month from power gas marketing cpa on tco 0 dth/day from power gas marketing 0,0 dth/day from questa
note
this is an estimated volume
we should know the actual volume in the next day or so
note
ces is not taking any carnagie gas at cpa
national fuel 0 dth/day from belden
blake
the deal expires 0/0/0
all of the equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline
ena nominates this gas
ces still has a citygate load of 0,0 dth/day for june on equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to ces
ces will not be receiving any local production behind peoples or nyseg
i changed the end date on transco deal 0 from 0/0/0 to 0/0/0
my mistake
its a good thing i a good looking stud
we have the following transco transport for june contract
0
does not include any agl space
vol comment 0 0-0 con ed space released month to month thru 0/0/0 contract 0.0 other stuff 0 of 0-0 i think
0 of 0-0 from pseg
open for bids until 0:0pm on 0/0/0 0 of 0-0
this is on k#.0
john
i took the volumes on deal 0 to 0 for the term of the deal starting june 0
this is the purchase from belden
blake behind nyseg
i changed the volume on deal 0 from 0 dth/day to 0 dth/day
this is the purchase from statoil at cpa
the price on this deal is nx0 +
0 and the price on john's worksheet is nx0 +
0
per mcf
john
is this price adjusted for dth
i created deal 0
purchase from statoil
volume of 0 day
the price is nx0+ $.0 per mcf
this is a purchase of local production behind the citygate
david
this deal probably needs to be hedged in sitara
cindy
deal 0 is a purchase from ces
statoil energy
i set up deal 0 with the same counterparty
this deal should have been in the system effective 0/0/0
according to elizabeth
we should not use the ces
statoil energy
it doesn't matter to me how its set up
however
this deal should have been in the system from jan and it is the same type of deal as deal 0
i changed the volume on deal 0 from 0 dth to 0 dth/day
this is a purchase from questar and it is also local production behind cpa
john
there are 0 deals for questar
the other 0 deals have volumes of 0 right now
can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing purposes
molly
i created deal 0
fom priced sale to ces
this deal will be matched with the cpa local production deals
let me know if anyone has any questions
thanks cg 0-0
its good we didn't book anything because ces just sold a lot of their customers to another company
it is definitely a ces deal that will be over in sep or oct of this year
i made some big changes to the cgas storage deals 0
no changes on this ticket
0
and 0
over the 0 day weekend we are over injecting 0,0 dth

angie
these volumes may go up
i think tenn is still trying to balance the weekend and they are a little long
clarissa will let you know
whoo hooo
i just took the demand charge for calp to $0 for may
this affects our demand charges on cgas
done
i didn't even know about deal 0
i will chat with dick jenkins about this after trading
i released the transco and cng capacity to energy express for the term of the deals
however
boston should recall all this capacity effective 0/0/0
transco offers cng offers let me know if you have any questions
thanks chris 0-0-0

joanie called kara at ces about deal 0
this is the cgas citygate gas for energy express
we are selling the gas to ces and ces is reselling it to energy express
kara told joanie that she does not expect the volumes to change on this deal
scott needs to work on the capacity sheet so we can tell how much transport ces actually has
there should be some big changes in ces's transport numbers for june
ex ena purchased the bg&e capacity on contract k#0
also
if ena elected to release ces capacity to clinton or igs
we need to make sure we record that correctly on the ena sheet
any credits we show on the ces sheet will be passed thru to ces
aga is 0
screen dipped to $0.0

hi
sounds like some are selling at 0's
now $0.0 by $0.0
paul leanza with clinton may have a market for the peoples gas
dick wanted me to talk to you to see if it sounds ok
give me a call when you get a chance
i would like the following pipelines and the following points on the map we discussed the other day
if possible
i would also like to see the zone boundaries for transco

are you inviting your woman to this
i may need to extend an invitation to ingrid
call me $
buy or sell at 0.0
the demand charges match what ena was billed by the pipeline
now $0.0 by $0.0
i will have training class on the east desk market area positions this wed
june 0st
at 0:0 pm in conference room eb0
i will be discussing our operational flexibility with respect to tenn z0 and national fuel
you de man
could you change the spelling from druckett to dracut
i owe you a chic fil a lunch
hey jeff
we are meeting tomorrow because molly is out today
is that ok
does ces have the ability to adjust the storage msq in sep or oct
how big of an adjustment can you make as a percentage and are you guys looking at that adjustment
or
are you letting the buyer know this option exists and you just hope its not your problem by then
that's my guess
here is what i'm looking at for july 0
paul leanza
clinton
has a customer that can take around 0,0 day
i don't know if that's dt or mcf
i will use mcf for this email until someone corrects me
this customer has a special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the customer pulls
for july
assuming the gathering fuel is 0%
and this customer pulls 0 mcf from your production pool
you will get a 0 mcf credited back to your imbalance account the following month
i don't know how this works with trading imbalances
but
at a nymx of $0.0 that works out to $.0
sounds good to me
paul said this customer is looking for a cng index flat price or and equivalent basis number
marde will not sell at that price but i will
marde said she would charge ena a $.0 fee for all the volumes flowing
actually
i would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to ees
settle up financially with ees and be done with it
what we could do to test paul's statement
is have the customer pull 0 mcf/day out of ces's pool for july
it would be easy to see since that is the only deal
and
have ees take over the pool deal with power gas marketing

it was right below all my notes on canfibre
the customer is latrove steel
i'm going to call peoples myself to learn how this works
does anyone object to that
i will wait until this afternoon before i call
heidi do you think the production gas can be moved to ees's pool by july 0st
if not
we can sell the gas to latrove out of ces's pool for july
however
we will not see the fuel credit until august
to verify if this works or not
hey z
would you show beavy how to request the cng fuel waivers for july
i want beavy to do it for a couple of months so she will be aware of our operational flexibility

ena is selling ees gas on cgas
sitara deal #0
ees is showing a price of $0.0 for may production and we are billing them $0.0
which price is correct
thanks
please terminate the following cng contracts effective 0/0/0
for june
we released this capacity to energy express
boston gas recalled this capacity effective 0/0/0
i changed the deal tickets in sitara
we currently have the following transport contracts on cng for july
angie and beavy are working on the fuel waivers for july
and we can still take 0 dth from cornwell
hey greg
hope this works
my phone number is 0-0-0
good job
now what price should we bill ees
check out this site
hey rhonda
my sources tell me that this $0.0 is the correct price
thats a big bonus for ees
we have a new park
loan
storage deal on national fuel effective 0/0/0
national fuel transferred 0,0,0 dth from our parking contract to our brand new firm storage contract
we are now long fss and short pals
we have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 0,0 dth per day
however
we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 0,0 dth on any given day
also
the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect
like trco-leidy
we do not have to ship the gas on nat fuel
ias we give nat fuel the gas back on an it basis via our ias agreement
nat fuel is still setting up the contracts
we can give nat fuel the gas back at any point we wish
we do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we withdraw on the fss
and we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it
cost what we will probably do most of the time is take the fss into trco at leidy and payback the ias agreement at niagara and leidy
ena will pay nat fuel 0,0,0 dth x
$.0
0 months
or $0,0.0 per month for june
july
and august
this deal is over on aug 0st
i just entered the demand charge on my market east demand charge sheet
i do not have any deals set up in sitara
i need to see the contracts from nat fuel first
i will keep track of the balances on an excel worksheet
all commodity cost and fuel is capured in the $.0 demand charge
beavy and i will make sure the payback and withdrawal tickets are balanced in sitara once we start flowing gas on this deal
if we payback 0,0 dth next week and we do not have any withdrawals
then i will show a 0,0 dth withdrawal on 0/0/0 just to keep the tickets balanced
payback techniques under the expert eye of the wonderfull
superfantastic
all-around great guy
dick jenkins
i've come up with some options on paying back the gas
niagara
only works when niagara is open
nat fuel has been very close to capacity this week
however
we should always see what martin can do with the gas if it gets backed up into tcpl
or if niagara is constrained
we can ship the gas on our firm nat fuel contract then pay it back to nat fuel
at today's prices that cost about $.0 wadd
take our tenn z0 length into cng via iroq
ship it to trco
leidy
and payback the gas at leidy
at today's prices
that cost about $.0
assuming we get to roll over all of our cng fuel waivers
tenn
we just need to see what type of it rate dan can get to ship the gulf to tenn z0
ellisburgh
we can also move the dracutt to nat fuel on segmented capacity for $.0 or move wright to nat fuel for $.0
we cannot use the net 0 contract on any of the tenn
nat fuel interconnects
let me know if you have any questons
modest too
i called peoples
karen was out and deana was swamped so i didn't ask her any questions
i also received one voice mail from the can fibre guy and i have not heard from him either
don't seem like anything is getting done
i hope you had a good weekend
hey team
i need the following services set up on national fuel
ias <== we just created k# a0 iss <== i think we already have this set up on k#h0 fss <== nat fuel has not assigned this contract to us yet

i just sent some of the paperwork to legal and i need it back by monday morning
lotus notes columbus thanks enron capital management

this transaction involves 0 contracts
nat fuel is billing ena a total of
$.0 x 0,0,0 dth

peoples
for july ena is selling 0/day to clinton energy
latrobe
heidi is working on that
heidi also informed me yesterday that ces was terminating the peoples pool effective 0/0/0

let's try next week
i'm bouncing in and out this week
and thanks
i made the following changes so we can track and pay the ko transmission invoice
i terminated deal 0
cgas k#0
effective 0/0/0
i believe joann has been using this deal to path the ko transmission activity
i created deal 0 effective 0/0/0
this is a cgas contract with ko transmission as the service provider
we will still do the noms via cgas on this contract
however
we will pay ko transmission for the transport expense
according to ko
we have not paid our feb
may invoices
i set these charges up on deal 0 as demand charges
the amount are small
beginning with july
we will reflect a usage charge on deal 0
questions
we do all the ko noms on navigator via k#0
cgas does not bill us anything on this contract
ko does
ko somehow gets the information from cgas
that's what confused me because i remember us sending in a fax nom
we don't even talk to ko anymore
i wish ko would reference the cgas contract on the ko invoice
maybe we could ask ko to do that
i had to chat with 0 ko person and 0 cgas people to get all that information
beavy and i changed the following deals for july and august
we took all the august activity to 0
this is how these deals should be balanced deal 0 with 0
and 0 with 0
i'll look at the economics in the morning
i think we should try an evening meal again
this is fun ain't it
i would like to rsvp for judy townsend and myself

the phillip's wells should be transferred to clinton's brand new pool and clinton will also nominate the power gas pool gas

hi gang
transco has a shipper meeting next week in the afternoon
i will probably be out all week
i believe scott goodell and beverly should go and take anyone else that would like to attend
is denver around the block
how about colorado springs
i think its closer
bids close at 0:0 am on the 0th
the start date is the 0th
currently there are no bids
scott and i will get with dick this afternoon
the min demand is $0.0 which works out to be about $.0 per dth
the commodity is $.0
no gri
and fuel is around $.0 at $0.0
let
s you and i chat this afternoon about getting reimburse from oglethorpe on transco
add the demand to the commodity
that's comes out to $.0
there is your nickle
however
being that we work for a marketing company and recognize the value of fuel
we take that into consideration
the pipelines don't usually
yo buddy
i do have a worksheet but i still need to go through ces officially
let me chat with doug kinney
i think it will be ok
i also told doug that my worksheet was probably easier to use when looking at total by pipeline
get back with you soon
as we discussed on the phone
mike garred with ces is requesting a copy of the ces demand charge sheet
please let me know if you approve
it probably was and at this point i don't know what is and isn't in the system

deal 0 for july and august
the deal volume is 0,0 for the month
we have the power gas deal thru october
we still need to sell sep and oct to someone
i noticed the volume for july in power gas marketing is 0

i didn't want to mess anything up so close to nom time
please put 0,0 for the month on both deals for july
thanks
peoples i changed the volume on deal 0 to 0 for the month
this volume fluctuates each month and john singer will tell us the actual volume

according to my notes
this is an
unwind
for ak steel
it was done as a physical fixed price deal and it goes through september
the volume is 0,0 per month for april through august and 0,0 per month for september
ces sold the physical gas back to ena
the only gas ces has are the exhibit 0 volumes
so i created a sell

to ces for the same volume at a price of if cgas + $.0
the deal numbers for march are 0 and 0

when are you taking me out for an apreciation lunch
hey buddy

i'm tied up with a family illness for the next couple of weeks so don't wait on me
great idea though
thanks for pointing this out
to my knowledge we have never even tried to overlap the contract or do any segmenting
enron north america corp
i don't think we will be able to do any payback at niagara or tenn/e aurora on the national fuel deal
after adjusting for what we took out today
we owe nat fuel about 0,0 dth
here are the points that i believe will work best tenn/colden
meter #0
tenn zone 0 close to the niagara spur
we can use dracut supply or iroq/wright supply
tenn/lamont
meter #0
tenn zone 0
we can use cook school for this or dan can flow long haul
cook school is baseloaded into cng
trco/leidy
we currently have 0,0 dth from cgas going into cng
we can redirect this to nat fuel at no additional cost
hey buddy
can you just send me $0.0
i won't be around for the happy hour
as most of us are aware

i think selling the power gas marketing gas to ees behind eog is working well
other than the price
i would like to sell it to ees for the term of the deal
you have not sold it to anyone have you
if not
i'm going to try to sell it to ees for the term
and if i remember correctly
the volume is 0,0/month and the term is 0/0/0
correct
i didn't buy it yet
but i going to take a serious look at it
hi gang
please read the following and let me know what you think
also
what would be the best way to handle this
i'm not above groveling for affection
use the
daily activity
worksheet in this file
the ces storage balance as of 0/0/0 is 0,0,0 dth
see balance in cell l0
the actual sale to ces for the storage injections is deal 0
this deal shows the daily and monthly activity
if i remember correctly
the only confusion we had on the tco storage was the beginning balance
there was 0,0 dth in storage on march 0st
to correct for this
we adjusted the injections for april so that the balance on april 0th was 0%
let me know if you have questions
and my coh balance effective 0/0/0 is 0,0.0
a difference of 0dt's
angie
would you go into unify on july 0st and change the pathed volume to clinton from 0 to 0 please
this should make the total volume = 0,0
change the supply from phillips to balance out the transaction
thanks
this all started last november
where did the time go
hi team
i just want to make sure everyone gets this message
effective september 0
we will be using
the new power company
in sitara
all existing deals will need to be changed to
the new power company
in sitara
if you enter deals in the sitara or you find an existing deal with the counterparty
columbia energy services
please change the counterparty to
the new power company
thanks
please take a look at deal 0
its a new deal that starts sep 0st and it was entered in sitara on aug 0st
i changed the counterparty from ces to new power
i think i see whats happening
i believe deal 0 is a bookout with deals 0 and 0
should it also be a bookout with deal 0
what about deals 0and 0
what about dea
let me know if you have any questions
perfect
i will buy you one free coke
good job chris

you need to give me a boottle in a brown bag

del mainline bg&e #0
non new york
please enter this on the morning sheet
thanks
opps
i made an error
this is a sep 0 contract
i changed the term on
with the change in segmentation rules on transco
it has become much more critical to know the primary receipt and delivery points for the capacity we are buying
mr
goodell said that tennessee's ebb will indicate if the points on the capacity you are buying are secondary or primary
i would prefer to know the actual primary points on the contract
especially the delivery points
i just bought some z0-z0 capacity from penn fuel for the balance of the month
steve gillespie verified that penn fuel released the primary receipt and delivery point on the contract
but
i'm taking penn fuel's word for it and i am unable to verify the information myself
it could have a big impact on what we flow in z0
colleen
can we do anything about this through the regulatory process
let me know if you need specific capacity examples
i'm all over it
i have 0 plane tickets

joanne just verified that this is regular transport

would you verify if aca and gri are billed for storage deliveries please
you changed the rate on this deal from $.0 to $.0 effective 0/0/0
what's up with that girl

wade
for july and august
give me the actual volumes and price for phillips and power gas marketing behind peoples
and are these volumes mcf's or mmbtu's
and do we back out any gathering charges on this gas
russ verified that agency transport capacity deals can be set up in sitara before the agency contract is in global
that makes things quicker for scott and i
i sold the niagara/nat fuel back to the central desk for the rest of the month
please take the 0,0 dt of trco z0 to z0 space to 0 in sitara for the balance of the month
thanks
when did bay state bill ena for this
and
did bay state pay there bill for gas ena sold them or did they deduct this from the payment
it does work out to 0,0 dt per day at $.0
i tried my new sweatpants on and i really like them
thanks
where is the place you used to get your car serviced
production area to new york k# volume rec 0,0 total production area to non new york z0 space 0 total

production area to new york k# volume rec 0,0 total
take a look at my worksheet and let me know what you think

there's always a profit in gen-tile and calm
i'm judy's boy
i know nothing about vickie
i need the wss meter number
i would like to get that from vng
i'm sure we don't have that set up in our system
nope
i may still be here working on this new deal
or i may be drinking beer at little woodrow's
hmmm
victor guggenheim
opppps
probably won't get to it until after the 0st is done
i think it will be easy to figure out though
you de man
robin
this is for the 0 dth/day baseload sale and the 0 dth/day put option in tenn z0
this is mo's deal
dick jenkin's believes we should be paying a demand charge
i
i entered volume and pricing on the following 0 deals in sitara
deal 0 cng citygate with tenn prod plus transport pricing
deal 0 cgas citygate with trco and cglf production pricing and trco
cglf
and cgas transport pricing
this will take a while to do
do we want to turn the auto-confirms off
i think every time i create a vng deal
a confirm is faxed to them
and if anyone has a better was of doing the deals
should we show these as production area sales
please let me know
the easiest way i can come up with is to enter the sales at the citygate or storage facility and have most of the pricing done in a worksheet
correction deal 0 is really 0
you guys may know this already
this contract only has 0% fuel when you take we can learn more about this contract later
come on now

would you send marlene a copy of the equitrans agreement next week
thanks
donnie
for july
adjust the clinton volume to match the purchases from phillips and power gas marketing
do not send out an invoice adjustment
i may need to change the price on the sale to clinton so that our receivables are netting to 0
for august
september
october
and november
make the clinton volumes match the phillips and power gas marketing supply and do send an invoice adjustment to clinton
paul
let me know if you have questions
for july
the imbalance is actually in ces's pool and i have no idea how to adjust that
for august forward
i believe we should just bill you for the actual metered production volumes since the imbalance will be in clinton's pool
let me know if you want to make any price adjustments
knock a nickel off the price
i just want these deals to go away
oh yeah
and make clinton a lot of money
update jerry and i went to east texas this weekend
we withdrew $0.0 from the fredonia bank and i'm going to deposit that in the credit union
i also took the petty funds in the kitchen drawer
$0.0
and we did get $0,0.0 deposited into dad's account from the credit union
later dudes
we added a transco meter to deal 0 today
would you make sure none of that goofy financial stuff is impacted please
once again you've made me proud
i've never heard from the dude
i may send him a voicemail
that contract should also be on the list
i sent something to vng about that
i'll follow up on it

i need to get a tattooee now
call me or beverly at 0-0
you bet
i may have you a helmet too
jerry and i bought motorcycles
i like
are you still looking at getting a camera
an elph
is that a digital
transco response
finally
it's about time we hear from you
i'm glad you're focused on schoolwork
that's where your mind should be anyway
i'll plan on seeing you on nov 0th
is that a digital or film camera
i entered the discounts on the tetco backhaul contract b0 the rates are rec del rate and gri is included
aca needs to be added
i'm looking at last night's new deal report
i see deal 0 with a loss of $0,0

any ideas
i bought 0.0
the bid is now at 0.0
what should i do
you can set up your own photo album online
no rush
call me when you get a chance
nymx now at 0.0 by 0.0
you made me strong
out at 0.0
call me i got a question
you don't care about me

whew
i took a 0/0 day of vacation yesterday
the 0th
chat with sean
i don't know if the room is big enough for everyone
i'm putting the freezing one on my webpage with a few happy hour photo's as soon as i get off my lazy butt
i created a new deal because this one has so much data on it
robin
i can never remember if nypa is your customer or craig's
and i can't find him in my email directory
adams automotive at 0-0-0
they are located at 0 blalock
across from the fiesta
off i-0
they may be a little pricey

and their service is excellent
i'm glad you like the sweatpants
it turned cold and rainy today
i should be wearing mine today
i got me a townhome
the contract will be signed on tuesday
i really like it
it is 0 bedroom and 0.0 baths with a garage
faces the woods
muffy will have fun exploring
thanks again for driving us here safely
refunds are always so much fun
i suppose we would need to give some back to bug if this happens
hey don
i'm still working on this
i should have an idea by this wed
who handles the billing for ashland chemical
i think we need to make sure we are doing a
point nom
acually since we don't edi
we probably don't even need to do a point nom in unify
we need to confirm all the data on mark's worksheet
let me know if you have any questions
i think we need to get scheduling
volume management
and accounting together somehow
i don't think a happy hour would do it because people tend to get in their groups and talk
let me know what you guys think
i would like to talk to bob hall and bob supperty about this
yes i wuz
we bought back some of new powers first of the month volumes on deal 0
please match this deal with 0
i did this deal on the 0th and its effective the 0th
0st

following are the mdq's and rates on the tennessee contracts effective 0/0/0 contract mdq delivery point demand comm comment 0 0,0 s webster $0.0 $.0 demand is $0.0 for daily volumes below 0,0 per day
demand goes to $0.0 for daily volumes above 0,0 per day
comments
if we flow to any points other than the primary delivery point
the demand charge goes to max rate which is about $0.0
questions for tennessee
what are the rates for october
do the differences in demand and commodity apply to daily quantities or monthly quantities
please redraft the new power september activity
i'm looking for the deals shown below and there should be a demand charge of $0,0.0 on deal 0 and a demand of $0,0.0 on deal 0
if you see the items above
please send me a new worksheet
thanks
attached are my demand charge calculations for the month of september
i also included the scheduling fee of $0,0.0
david and i discussed this
let me know if you have any questions
mr
westover
there should be no manual billing for the month of september
everything should be billed through the system
i will fax you another report that should have the same data in a different format
i want to discuss further and you should probably buy me a drink
oh yea
you already did
enron north america corp

what is eamil
jeff said he is still not seeing these 0 deals for september

i mailed the invoice via interoffice to jeff
there are 0 or 0 deals that ena billed ces for september that should probably be billed to new power
all of the deals in question are on the central desk

i believe either kate or robin did a deal with sithe last october
ena released capacity to sithe
only 0 dth per day
and acted as billing and nominating agent on this contract
it was a citygate sale in new york and we wanted to transfer title at the pool
i received a call from scott nelson

i didn't go to the shipper meeting
we sent sean boyle
he's an ex cng guy that works for us now

the demand charge and commodity is discounted effective 0/0/0
this is what we know about the contract
the 0st 0/day that we flow is at a discounted commodity of $.0 and discounted demand of $0.0 if we flow more than 0/day the demand goes to $0.0 what i need to know is exactly how the demand charge will be calculated for volumes over 0 day

cng has new commodity rates effective 0/0/0 new old fuel remains unchanged at 0.0%
update
scott and i are still looking at the storage numbers
we hope to have it done today but we are having trouble nailing down the numbers
update
spoke with the lawyer yesterday
we can't buy don out right now
we need to turn in the final inventory list
get things resolved with mary
be it good or bad
then we can buy don out
she still thinks that we won't have any issues with mary
after we provide the inventory list
she wants me to meet with her
joal
mary
and mary's lawyer to see what we need to do to get this conflict resolved
joal thinks we should be able to do this during the first 0 weeks of november
i have a bad cold and i went scooter riding last night
do you care
i can't blame brother too much
i still bounce back and forth between major frustration and apathy on the east texas issue
hope for the best
later
kim
please forward to the traders
i think the schedulers have this already
please forward
room change
did everyone see this
i checked the cglf and cgas capacity against navigator
take a look and let me know what you think
also
do you know the demand charges for the cgas items highlighted in purple
jeff westover said you want the demand charges split out by pipe
i attached september
is this the month you are looking for
steve stonestreet said you have an email address for our team
i would like to have that please
i need to know what our demand charges are for some contracts that start in november
thanks
deal 0 is an ena sale to new power at if +
0 for 0,0 dth day starting on the 0th
new power is selling this gas to aquilla
maybe we should add another section to mr
scott's worksheet for
third party
buy's and sells
like the aquilla deal #0
and the deal we did on the 0th where ena bought the gas back from new power
not a big deal for october
but we will probably start doing our maunal billing process again for the winter months
i could see you guys buying incremental third party gas that we may need to schedule
especially during high pipeline constraints
example
you might buy gas from sempra at eagle into cgas and we use your transport to get it to a citygate
ena would buy it from new power at eagel and sell it back to new power at the citygate
we should let you know what the deal ticket number is via email or phone call and scott could put it on the worksheet
so if we had this tab for october
it would just have 0 deals on it so far
comments
the cgas exchange deals i set up for cgas storage end oct 0st
i'm thinking of changing the process effective 0/0/0
0/0/0
ena billed ces
now new power
for the gas delivered to storage
now ena needs to pay new power for the gas taken out of storage
in my example
we would need to recognize the beginning storage balanc e effective 0/0/0
take a look
let me know if you have any comments
sean may want to go to this
i just spoke with joann and this is what we are coming up with on cgas
est citygate for nov 0,0 storage withdrawal 0,0 net purchase from ena 0,0 does this look correct
we would enter a citygate sell to new power for 0,0 and a purchase from new power of 0,0
grossed up for fuel
and
dave
it looks like you might have 0 or more worksheets that you are maintaining
do you want to try and do away with any of them
all i really need are the fom numbers buy pipeline buy pricing zone
done deal 0
scott goodell who knows all and sees all said he is at aep
and his number is 0-0-0
scott is the man
i entered deal 0 in sitara
ena inherited this deal from ces
this is a sale to nashville gas company at cglf mainline
i entered all the pricing and volume terms on the comments
p.s
nashville is in the process of assigning this deal to sempra
remember the titans
who's gonna pay for my popcorn
did you like that pumpkin
hey team
i just created deals 0
sale to new power
and 0
buy from new power
at the pool
this is to record the gas ena is buying back from new power when there daily loads drop below the fom numbers
i'm using the following fom numbers 0th-0th 0,0 new power sold back 0,0 dth day 0th-0st using these numbers
ena is only buying back a total of 0,0dth through the 0th
not as much as i thought
we should have some impact from the following deals 0
0
and i increased the price on 0
yes we are
we sold the 0
day to allegheny
deal 0
this is back on a month to month basis
we don't know if we are selling them gas for dec yet
contract mdq
flare it
marlene
please call beverly at 0-0-0 when you get this contract set up
thanks
what volumes do we have for power gas marketing and for the sale to clinton
and what has clinton agreed to pay us

what are the winning lotto numbers for wed night
what are women really looking for in life
when do you take the bike to the shop
i have your key on my keyring
i created deal 0

i will price both deals using the fom index pricing
jeffrey porter@ees
i just entered the ces demand charges for august on the following deals deal 0
east demand charges of $0,0 deal 0
market east demand charges of $0,0 thank you melba
you de man
i moved the volumes on deal 0 from transco leidy to cng leidy
just send cookies then and we will be happy
i still have not released the 0 dth of capacity from vng to nabisco on cgas
i just spoke with henry riewerts at nabisco
he does not have a navigator id and password
this will be the only cgas activity he has and he has not bought any gas for nov either
i think he needs someone to handle this for him
is this the type of thing we can pass on to ees
i need to look and see what i have
but first
you are not going with some boys are you
i have a really cheap sleeping bag
some collaspable water bottles
all sorts of small cooler type things
ohohoh
i have a
wet seal
bag that you could put some goodies in to keep them dry
do you need fishing stuff
yes
a small one
so maybe you should go camping with me
and i have fishing stuff too
where are you going camping
i will bring it and anything else i might have in tomorrow that i think you can use
i will leave my sleeping bag in the car though
we have a volumetric contract on texas gas and i'm not sure how to enter it in sitara

jeff porter with new power just informed me that they are buying
a little more
than 0,0 dth per day of citygate gas on cgas

i brought in my backback
0 flashlights

they are sitting on top of my neighbor's desk
come take a look when you get a chance
i'll be gone but i will leave it on top of my desk
the backpack is dark blue and is has
crux by gregory
written on it
there is a yellow cooler inside and 0 flashlights
i fixed the volumes on deals 0 and 0 for the 0st
please take all other volumes on these deals to 0
thanks

we believe our agency relationship with new power will end effective march 0
0
the deal numbers are on the attached worksheet
i entered the following deals at a zero commodity 0 buy exchange 0 sell cpr storage 0 buy cpr storage 0 sell exchange i added about 0 dth to deal 0 for november and i extended it through march 0
i'm kinda sleepy so i probably made a few mistakes
i don't think i ever saw the breakout on the access area since we didn't get this via capacity release
i'm here for you
not
enron north america corp
i added the pipelines and zone/point combonations that i feel we will be using most on eol
let me know if you have any questions
i've entered a mother load of comments on all the deals
please let me know when you validate these or what else you need
kimat
the exchange deals were not validated yesterday
did this have a big p&l impact
my tco schedulers said there volumes were off by about 0 bcf
we are injecting gas into egan storage today through monday
off of texas gas and cglf
we will be withdrawing this gas ratably in dec into texas gas
i will probably make a mistake or two on my deals because i'm kinda sleepy
crystal will help me set up the deals on egan
i am currently using a cpr storage deal ticket and i believe that is incorrect
i will let everyone know the deal tickets by the end of the day
donna explained how everything is working so victor has killed the following deal tickets deal comment 0 new power exchange buy 0 new power exchange sell 0 cpr storage sell 0 cpr storage buy we will be using deal 0
purchase from new power
through march 0st
also
we need to make sure we do not recognize the storage balance in sitara
joann has the storage contract number if anyone has questions
i can't see what you have in the 0th column
buy
if the all meters on the pipe are marked at tgt/zsl then that tells me what i need to know
great
exactly what i needed
have we scheduled any gas on the following contracts
deal contract
use
sheet 0
on the attached file
page me at 0-0-0-0 if you have questions
i did vote for the new sports arena
and
i'm sending the latest schedule to the lawyer today
i will wait till after lunch to send it in case you guys have any more input
i took the volumes on deal 0
cpr storage
to 0 and moved them to the following deals
crystal
deal 0 was valued at cglf if
deal comment 0 exchange sell for the november injections 0 exchange buy for the december withdrawals
susan wants the withdrawal volumes to go into texas gas
tricia
deal 0 has the daily withdrawal volumes
please set up the egan to texas gas ticket
all of my information is on the following worksheet 0:/logistics/capacity/east/ne/egan_strg_nov0.xls if any is interested
look again and let me know
i had problems seeing the volumes at first
then i opend my eyes
makes a world of difference
commodity and fuel should be 0 going back into texas gas
thanks cg
i know it
you know it
who's telling all the single women
please transfer the storage balance of 0 dth from contract 0 to vng contract 0
thanks
my tetco schedulers have not gotten back to me on whether we have shipped gas on these contracts
i'll try to check that myself today
don't worry about getting me a diet coke
i just got one
i entered deal 0 in sitara as a purchase from new power at the fom index pricing
jeff
i believe this works out because we should be increasing our citygate sale to you
also at the fom price
jeff
i'm out all next week
just call joann and she will get the pricing and enter the deals
also
just so i don't forget
i sold 0 dth day of tco pool to new power for the 0th-0th at $0.0
i won't enter a deal for this
i just need to incorporate it into my citygate pricing
jeffrey porter@ees
nov 0st
enron north america corp
i bet everything we did in june
july and august is wrong in unify as well
i wonder if we should go back to june 0st on setting up this contract
we don't have that much activity on this contract
let me know
i just updated the egan exchange tickets and my worksheet for nov and dec
i think we were out of balance by about 0,0 last night
my fault

jeffrey porter@ees
ms
arnold called looking for the if today
she gets a much better response out of me than you do
the gd flat buyback from adams at the tco pool is deal 0
i created the deal with 0 volumes
ena has a put to coh
deal 0
for up to 0,0 dth/day
this deal was in the system for december and i just took it to 0 for the whole month
i estimate we should make about $0,0 on the deal change
kimat
this deal also has a demand charge that ena pays coh for the put
i believe its in the deal correctly
alvin
please show this on the morning sheet as a
put to coh at if
or something real intelligent like that
this deal goes thru 0/0/0
call me hussy
i got questions
tetco is going to start scheduling lambertville
lambertvile is in tetco m0
in new jersey
this means that anyone flowing gas through lambertville on a secondary basis will probably strart getting curtailed
lambertville on tetco will be just like linden on transco z0
the following ldc's/points are downstream of lambertivlle
e town n jersey con ed bug belle mead
interconnect with transco
hanover
interconnect with algonquin
leidy is considered upstream of lambertville
also
deliveries to algonquin at lambertiville is considered upstream of the constraint
tetco will not give me any indication as to how much gas may be cut or how much secondary will be allowed to flow through lambertville
meredith
when you get a chance
please confirm which points are downstream of lambertiville
i created deal 0 as a physical forward sale to oglethorpe power
jim
judy has told me that under no circumstances should i be involved with ogy unless she is out
but she also said she will gladly fix any deal entry misstakes i make
i humbly accept my position
i love my sweats
hows muffy
sorry about that
gotta go to a meeting
give muffy a hug for me
i'll be winning the lotto soon
nice knowin ya
oh be still my aching heart
filled with bitter sorrow at my loss
sniff
i'm ready to move to ohio and become a pig farmer and work on my poetry
there is a demand charge of $-.0 x 0 on this deal ticket
i think the demand charge should be $-.0 x 0,0 x # days on the month
this equals 0,0 over the term of the deal
i changed the demand charge volume to 0,0 for dec 0,0 for jan 0,0 for feb audrey
the global contract is 0 and 0/0 is the first month of this deal
we should receive and invoice from coh for the demand charge
there is a very slim chance we will be selling coh any gas on this deal for the month
would you forward this email to the person that handles coh
thanks
i just faxed the inventory list to jerry
don
do you have a fax number i could send it too
type comm fuel total at $0.0 diff
0
probably
hi
i probably will not be able to attend the meeting on thursday
should i let someone in your office know about that
could one of you fine gentleman give me the details of what new power paid ena for october activity
this is a zone 0 to 0 fuel percent
doyle is
0 miles off the transco mainline
what do you think
i thought chris meyers said they took this into consideration when talking to transco
it has no impact on pricing when flowing the gas from st 0 or st
why did you go to power
are you going to look for some of the mistakes i made back in 0
hey team
this email is just an fyi for you guys
i don't expect you to see anything until january
early morning
right
i want to be rested for the big party
do you have a total dollar amount that new power paid for oct production
according to david scott at new power
they did not make any adjustments to the bill
he said they may not have received all of the bill
there might have been some michcon activity missing
you make it sound like you are going away for good
i'll see you when you come back
what happened to all my emails

i will be updating deals 0 and 0
this is a bookout
i have these deals updated through the 0th
have fun
gas prices are going through the roof
i need to hold the new power invoice until monday
it should be ready to send out monday afternoon and everything should be captured in sitara
i must have deleted the gri memo i had
sorry about that
i need a volunteer
the
vol
will be responsible for pricing all of the new power deals in the market area
0% of this activity takes place on cgas
who wants it
certain people have expressed an interest in learning more about pricing
tricia spence
joe casas
and beverly beaty
i estimate it will take about 0 minites a day during the month
and about 0-0 hours during bidweek
i also believe this deal will go away effective pros will learn the concept of a physical bookout
will become a sitara pricing guru like myself
will learn a great deal about transport pricing
may lead into executing capacity on cglk and cgas
i will not turn this over until i am satisfied with the vol's performance on pricing
can easily be done after the work day crunch
this may be a pro or a con
will learn more about the pricing curves and how physical deals impact the desk p&l
cons somewhat tedious
not as bad as it used to be
may have to anwser dick jenkins questions
i will have to assign this to scott or vickie if i don't get a volunteer
i will do the training
possibly in the evening or on the weekend
and i'm very detail oriented
i will provide feedback on this persons progress and i take this part of the job very serious
opened $0.0 by $0.0 now $0.0 by $0.0
i need a destin class
the only think i know about destin is that its a transco z0 mainline point
tp #0
north carolina nat gas
is a true backhaul from the z0 0 pool
tp #0 is the trasnco interconnect with col gas at dranesville
this point is also a true backhaul from the z0 0 pool
the meter number for public serv
nc is tp #0
and this is also a true backhaul from the z0 0 pool
that means you didn't send me the attachment
or if you did
i don't see it
would you send me the purchases
thanks
looks good with the following changes
if you see these changes come through then its good to go
thanks the price on deal 0 should be $0.0 not $0.0
just corrected in added demand charge of $0,0,0 to deal 0
added demand charge of $0,0 to deal 0
call me
we a conference room big enough for 0 people on thursday

vickie
i will see if the meeting date can be changed if dan calls
date correction
dec 0
not nov 0
don't forget to chat with vng about nabisco
vng should have released 0 dth of cgas capacity to nabisco effective 0/0/0
0/0/0
nabisco was not set up as a prearranged bidder at the time
during nov bidweek for dec
nabisco asked me to release the capacity
since the term was less than 0 year
i couldn't release the capacity non-biddable
i spoke to jeff huston about it early last week and he said he would get back to me
dick suggested i tell you
tagg
you're it
i will await your command
mr
scott goodell said we could release the capacity for 0 year eff 0/0/0 and then recall nov and dec
attached are the purchases and sales with new power for the month of november
the invoices are on their way
i think it would be easier to sort and review the data in excel
let me know if you have any questions
do we still have any activity or imbalances on the following columbia energy services contracts
news flash
the supreme court of the united states has ruled that there cannot be a nativity scene in washington
d.c
this christmas
the court ruling is not based on the seperation of church and state simply put
the court felt it could not find three wise men and a virgin in the nation's capitol
however
finding enough asses to fill the stable would not be a problem
i believe ena is still agent for columbia energy services and columbia energy marketing on several pipelines
rich contos's
the only ces person i know
last day is this friday
i left rich a voicemail asking him if ces/cem should continue to exist as a legal entity on the pipelines
as ena
i believe i sould at least begin terminating the agency
and liability
relationships
are we still getting a demand charge bill from equitrans for contract 0
i am still estimating about $0,0 per month
i just adjusted the november market east demand charge from $0,0,0 to $0,0,0
this is on deal 0
would you please send out an adjustment for the decrease to new power
thanks my fault for not correcting it sooner
my fault
try it again
i just released the deal
we can sell the tractor anytime as far as i'm concerned
we will have to pay some extra taxes but that's ok by me
the lawyer said we may have to buy a replacement if we loose the case but she doesn't think we would loose
i just updated the volumes on deals 0 and 0 for the 0th
this is a bookout
the volumes on these deals should always match
if they don't then i goofed
i added a demand charge of $0,0,0 to deal 0 for dec 0
i don't think this should show up in the current month p&l
at least not from this deal ticket
let me know if there are any problems
this demand charge is for the market east and for the $0,0/month scheduling fee
we are still working on the east demand charges for new power
found it
the $0,0 scheduling fee is included and this demand charge is just for the new power market area
we are still working on the east demand charges
they are not correct
i will probably add the east demand charges to a cglf sales deal
nothing new to report
i received an official copy of the inventory list last night
i will try to get it notorized and mailed back to the lawyer today
welcome volunteers
beavy
since you are going to be out
and most of our work will be done next week
i will start giving tricia
to do's
and you can catch up later
i have a meeting at 0:0 pm today
i would like to give you both a quick 0 min preview before then if possible
let me know
tricia
please run a
monthly facilitaion by location
report for
the new power company
for both marketeast and east for jan 0 and jan-dec 0
i don't know if you can run the jan-dec 0 on one report
tricia
if we do the 0 min meeting today
i would like to have 0 copies of the jan 0 facilitation
i create a ton of bookout deals for new power and i always start with the cpr report
thanks
for dec
we were taking 0 day from the egan parking into tgt
effective 0/0/0
we moved the remaining balance to jan 0
i made the following adjustments to deal 0
took daily withdrawal volumes to 0 effective 0/0
0/0 extended the deal to jan 0 changed 0/0/0 to 0 this might be a little confusing because we also have withdrawals of about 0 day in jan
also
egan is showing a different balance than what i have
i show we should have a total balance of 0,0
0 x
0-0
plus 0
at the end of gas day 0/0/0
egan is showing a balance of 0,0
this just means that we parked more gas than i thought or we cut back on some of our withdrawals on the 0st through the 0th
no big deal
i just want to make sure we don't leave any gas in parking
i'm checking all my deals and found i need to add the following
bookout deal 0 with 0
volume of 0 day for the 0st
0st
bookout deal 0 with deal 0
volume of 0 day for the 0th
0st
the last problem deals i see are 0 and 0
this is not a bookout
one of these should be killed and i think it should be the purchase deal 0
we should see new power scheduling gas out of our pool
the volume on the 0th
0st should be about 0,0 day
just a note
since i think the purchase deal should be killed
this would make us 0,0 shorter for the month in sitara
i left a voicemail for mike garred to verify
take a look at my worksheet and we will go over it
it's mind boggeling
should we release the vng capacity to ena effective 0/0/0
if yes
then what time frame
one year
screen is 0.0 by 0.0
i'm happier
does this work
you don't read your emails do you
call me before 0:0 am and i'll give you a dollar
attached are my calculations of the if volumes for cgas
i will also try to update this schedule for the agl production area volumes
i have also included the cgas nx0 deals
i feel good about the nx0 volumes for jan and feb
i not sure about the mar forward volumes yet
i will keep working on thei sheet
i guess you and muffy better be snuggling to stay warm
i updated the worksheet with a little more info and i added trco and tetco marktet area information
i did this quickly so let me know if something doesn't look right
on monday
we will show you a bid for the tetco and trco volumes
also
the tetco and trco volumes are monthly and the cgas volumes are daily
i do not see a sitara deal ticket for tagg #nr0.a
a trco z0 sell to new power for mar and apr 0
what are you going to chicago for
please send all vng transport items to vickie but cc me as well
thanks
i created deal 0 for this gas
this has nothing to do with the voodoo deals i do with jeff porter
we need to schedule this
take a look and let me know what you think
also
please check the volumes
ena's bid is in yellow
i added a demand charge of $0,0 to the oglethorpe ticket for december
that's fine
i will assume new power is physically taking the tetco and trco marketarea gas unless you sell it back
jeffrey porter@ees
please add tricia spence to this email
she will be working with me on the cgas volumes
jeffrey porter@ees
i would like to spend 0 min with you today
i need to update my gas daily buy/sells for december and i would like for you to see it

0:0 pm at my desk then
i sold 0 day
deal 0
starting on the 0th at $0.0 to new power
please bookout this deal with 0
purchase at fom index pricing

thats a motor not something naughty
kimat
this is the offset to the big gain we made on cgas last night on that one deal
i increased our sales volume on deal
0 by 0,0dth/day starting on the 0th
deal 0 is a citygate
index based sale and we should show a big loss on it tonite
suzie's working on your icts
it ain't working so far
per leah
probably won't be able to get imbalance off after friday
i killed deal 0
if you read this before i call you then i will make brownies and bring them in
aga is 0
screen dropped about $0 or so
now $0.0 by 0.0 call me about
i just sold david scott 0 dth of tco pool at $0.0 for the 0nd
deal 0
new power will schedule this gas out of our pool
bottom line
this is mikey gas which is different from jeffy gas
i don't think we are doing anything
dick had an idea but i didn't know what he was looking at
jeffrey porter@ees
cindy
take all the m0 production gas into our m0 tabs and lets go long in the pool
we will sell the gas over the holidays or next week after we see what dominion is producing
we will not have this gas for january
wonderful
one more question
could you give me the meter numbers for these points
sounds good to me
i bet this is next to the warick
hotel
this is the first notice from transco regarding imbalances
transco has not changed their it notices since the 0th
when they closed down st 0
i changed the term on this deal ticket
we need to chat about the following vng deals
i changed the term on deal 0
steve
this is cng contract #0 for 0 dth day
the primary receipt point on this capaity is storage
is this a nov-mar deal or is this capacity good all year
brenda
what are the rules for setting up vng demand charges
also
we are releasing most
not all
of the vng space to ena effective 0/0/0
should i set up ena
im vng as the primary desk for demand charges
guess who
its back on my desk
how do you feel about doing a manual invoice
that will be the only way to get it out quickly at this point
attached is my pricing and the capacity for december
i went thru the capacity fairly close on cgas so this should be correct
let me know if you have any questions
also
for the 0st
i'm showing a fom volume of 0,0 dth per day
this is a combination of your max fom exhibit 0 gas
plus the cglf volume plus some
this is where we are today on the vng releases to ena
all effective dates are 0/0/0
0/0/0 unless stated differently
mdq/msq
storage
cng 0 0 0 ft
to be used with cove point
released cgas
we may not release any vng cgas capacity to ena
according to cgas
we may loose some of our flexibility with the contract
scott is waiting to hear from cgas
at this point
we will not release the capacity effective for the 0st
tenn
i do not have the new contract numbers yet
per tenn
scott will send a letter to tenn requesting that the vng discounts be transferred to the new ena contracts
trco
trco has a capacity release
glitch
in their ebb and needs to
temporarily flip a switch
while i do the capacity releases
since i know trco well
i've decided to wait until after the 0st to do the releases in case their are edi issues with the
switch flipping
and we would not know about any problems until the 0st
also
vng has 0,0 dth of telescoped trco capacity
williams has 0,0 dth of the vng capacity because of the fs service
i will release 0,0 dth to ena
this will eliminate the overlapping problems we have with williams
hey
i'm a sweet guy
modest too
merry christmas and a happy new year
enron north america corp

would you look at this and let me know if it looks ok
i'm going to send this to willie after i get your approval
my economic folks just gave me the gas daily prices
since we are selling deliverd gas
the receipt and delivery volumes should be the same
also
we can fix it so the imbalance is 0 on the 0nd if that would be easier
let me know buddy
according to my records
new power has 0,0 dt's of cgas capacity
on the 0nd
we scheduled 0,0 dt's on deal 0
please verify that new power took 0,0 dt's on the 0nd
its ok
i just need to do a price adjustment
thanks
what was the volume of jeffy gas going to mikey
and what day did that start
that makes sense
so you really are not using any ena space but then i need to check the overrun charges on the invoice
if its ok with you
i think i'll just wait to review the invoice before i do anything with that
jeffrey porter@ees
i will need to see the cgas invoices for dec when we get them
according to new power
we should have overrun charges
i created deal 0 for pool sales to new power
i currently have a daily volume fo 0 on this deal
we should be able to move the volumes back and forth between this deal and the big citygate deal
jeff
i will look at the volumes on our big citygate deal ticket and this one pool deal to calculate the gas daily pricing
jeffrey porter@ees
i don't see the facility numbers in sitara
however
i do use meter numbers and the nful meter number for the interconnect with tcpl is 0
deal 0 is
term purchase from aec
is at this meter
and deal 0
ena-im market east sale to ena-im ontario
is also at this meter for december
it doesn't matter to me which facility we use provided nful meter 0 is set up in sitara
richard
issues to consider before faye makes any changes
* nful is an edi pipeline
how will the changes impact angie's edi file
* will we need to rebook our term purchase
this should be fairly simple
* will unify need to be repathed since the beginning of time
* can this change take effect 0/0/0
* if martin reads this without darren tipping him off before 0:0 pm today
i'll buy him a
pop
for january

i have a tax bill to columbia energy services in the amount of $0,0.0 for gas stored at the bear creek storage facility
the amount is $0,0.0 and it is for the the 0 tax year
i was notified about this yesterday and i think it was due on 0/0/0
how do you want to handle this
i was going to pay it and bill new power for the whole amount
i will also have our tax department fax a copy to jeff
robert
please fax a copy of the letter from jimmie smith and the ces tax bill to jeff porter at 0-0-0
thanks
question
we received a tax bill from the bienville parish for gas in koch storage for the 0 tax year
i found out yesterday that ena handles no-notice storage for nopsi and it might be related to that
do you know what koch storage contracts we had for the 0 tax year
we also received a bill for sonat bear creek storage
i assume this would all be for ces/new power
if you know of any other sonat storages we had for the 0 tax year
please let me know
brenda will fax the koch storage tax bill to you
thanks chris
good point
is that also bear creek storage
the tax bill specifically states sonat bear creek storage
i also left a voicemail for our tax guy
there is no support for the tax bill so i don't know how the taxing authority comes up with their number
i would like to see it but i bet it takes a while to get the support
i also have a tax bill for koch bistenau storage
we have some type of deal with nopsi
any other ideas on that
we have a ftgss contract with a mdq of 0,0 dts
the primary receipt point on this contract is storage
but
we can flow some of this gas from secondary points like oakford or the pools
how much gas can be sourced from secondary receipt points
hey gang
attached is the maualy invoice for oglethorpe
i have fixed the pricing and the volumes on the top part of deal 0 to match the maual invoice
can we adjust the expected volumes in sitara to match the manual invoice
if yes
how do you balance unify since these are deal volumes and not actual flow volumes
and sherri
how this be entered from the accounting side in unify
since scheduling vs actual flow vs billing are all different
raquel
robert tilotta has the original tax bill and he is in your office
his number is 0-0-0
please call him at your convience
robert
can the tax agency provide us with support
contract numbers
inventory balances
thanks
in the old days
you could only flow 0/0 of the mdq from secondary points
that was when these contracts were good for the whole year
so you are telling me the
rules have changed
i can now flow 0% from secondary points
see below to see what
the man
has to say
for tues through the end of the month
please show tenn z0 and z0 flat
and have the wright gas into canajoharie

i will be looking at what we have available on the net 0 contract on your sheet to determine our flexibility

joann
for jan
we are selling new power 0,0 out of the pool and 0 from other sources
ao0
broad run
delmont
and monclova
this includes the ao0 they are buying from us
which means we should only have 0 out of the pool
actually the citygate and storage should be as follows vol comment 0 out of the pool 0 other receipt supply xxxx storage
and this should match whats on the storage ticket
these are the meter numbers i changed on deal 0 effective 0/0/0
the total changed on the deal was a decrease of 0
do you know the details of the dynegy contract

should we just take the capaity for feb and march or do you want to release the whole term then recall it later
these rates are correct and i'm assuming you want wellhead to the pool

zone 0 runs a close second
are you sure you want 0 instead of 0a
mobile bay
i sure wish you would send me the excel worksheet for this
i'm such a lazy butt
just looking high level
i see 0 days where storage is off by more than 0,0 dt's that i will check into
date sitara jeff's i don't understand your storage number on the 0th
does that mean you banked gas that day
also
i setup a column for navigator numbers and it looks like we took out i need to reconcile storage back to nov so i can track what we took out vs
what we pay new power for
i just checked the 0th
the actual number per navigator
actuals delivered to new power from stow
is 0
i'll check the others on monday now that i know how to do it
it's leah moss at the pipeline
it's judy townsend here
leah's number is
its ok to do the netout
the volumes on deals 0 and 0 need to be changed but i think that will be handled by volume management after they enter the pipeline statements in unify
let me know if you have questions
i think we need to add nov 0
and
according to navigator
the balance in storage on 0/0/0 is 0,0,0
assuming ena is owes you 0,0
the balance is 0,0,0 which is about 0% of the total storage balance
is this a comfortable number or joann
are there any special storage rules for feb and march
are we required to have at least 0% in storage on 0/0/0
is this what you are looking for
i'm here for you
just remember me favorably when you become my boss someday
i fetch coffe and pop
i always keep a stash of crackers

questions
i'm emailing all of you because i never know how the deals will show up in sitara
this is how leidy looks for feb buy/sale counterparty volume comment buy poco 0,0 nful into trco at leidy buy bay state 0 cng into trco/tetco at leidy or cng sp from the storage meter sell n jersey 0 any pipeline into trco at leidy
we usually match with poco sell southern 0 any pipeline into trco at leidy
brad just sold this gas today
we should match with poco
buy ena transport 0 we have transport on nful
we sold 0 to canada desk for feb
we will idle our transport
let me know if you have any questions
i will send these as i find them
this is the detail i sent to jeff for the april 0 manual invoice
it looks like the only deals that should have been suspended are the citygate cgas sales
line 0 under the
manual invoice
tab applies to deal 0
volume of 0 at $0.0
sale to ces for proxy storage injections
line 0 applies to deals 0 and 0
sales to ces at the citygate
line 0 shows the incremental transport expense ena incurred to allow ces to swing
today i would take this expense and add it to the sales price on deals 0 and 0
line 0
i still can't figure out what i did here
i think everything else is sorta clear
lines 0
0
0 are sales to ces at the citygate
deals 0 and 0
the schedulers wanted 0 deal tickets for tracking purposes
the pricing should be the same
i did make a teeny little error
line 0 should be prices at $0.0 and line 0 should be priced at $0.0
i'm sorry
i'm still looking for it but i think i deleted all the photo's
i'm checking my cd's

true backhaul
rate from zone 0 to zone 0 was $.0 plus surcharges
today its $.0 plus surcharges
we actually did some deals based on the backhaul rate of $.0 for the summer

worker dead at desk for 0 days bosses of a publishing firm are trying to work out why no one noticed that one of their employees had been sitting dead at his desk for five days before anyone asked if he was feeling okay
george turklebaum
0
who had been employed as a proof-reader at a new york firm for 0 years
had a heart attack in the open-plan office he shared with 0 other workers
he quietly passed away on monday
but nobody noticed until saturday morning when an office cleaner asked why he was still working during the weekend
his boss elliot wachiaski said
george was always the first guy in each morning and the last to leave at night
so no one found it unusual that he was in the same position all that time and didn't say anything
he was always absorbed in his work and kept much to himself
a post mortem examination revealed that he had been dead for five days after suffering a coronary
ironically
george was proofreading manuscripts of medical textbooks when he died
you may want to give your co-workers a nudge or kick occasionally
can you verify what new power is getting at a0 please
doesn't look too good right now
i forgot about the hpl people
i think we already have too many people and management may be waiting to see how many hpl people are staying with enron on the trading side
i'll keep you posted
if you are bud's with scott hendrickson
he would be a good one to talk to
i don't want to mention your name unless i hear of something
sounds good
please send me a download of the oglethorpe info for january

this is what's in unify

let me know what you think
maybe we should add the it transport to the cashout from z0 to z0
i would certainly want to do that if they were short

you will be surprised at how much stuff you remember
the quickest way to learn transport
get copies of the invoices
and guess what
i got another compliment on my sweat pants on saturday
i would like to see the gas daily's for the following
no rush
transco z0 ny transco z0 non ny transco st 0 henry hub tetco m0
we should have included the aca
gri
and great plains in our sales price to midcoast
you should still use the $.0 in your calculation
just a note
we could have shipped this gas to a zone 0 market
resulting in a much higher transport cost
or we could have sold the gas at the wellhead
giving us a $0 transport cost
most of the time you will use the it feeder cost
$.0 in this case
regardless of what we do with the gas
by the way
transco's rates changed just a bit effective 0/0/0
the it feeder for zone 0 goes from $.0 to $.0 effective 0/0/0
fuel remains unchanged at
0%
i ended deal 0 effective 0/0/0 and created deal 0 effective 0/0/0
but
i see both deals active un unify on contract 0 on 0/0/0
i don't know what impact this will have
if any
please recall the following contracts effective 0/0/0 i think this is all
can you get the deal ticket for me on this deal please
i just checked and i don't have any daily information
i know they sent it to me
i must have tossed it by mistake
i will be out the afternoon of friday
march 0 for my mri
and i have a dr
appointment the morning of wed
march 0
i keep getting
insufficient memory
messages on my computer
and that's without running dynegy direct
the it guy said i need one of the following 0
new super duper computer 0
more memory
my computer has 0meg of ram 0
run my applications on 0 cmputers like mine instead of one
dec 0
i changed the pipeline and the meter on deal 0 from nful #0 to trco
my canadian folks gave me the wrong number for march
the correct number is
0 instead of
0
which makes the spread
fyi
transco z0 cashout buy is 0.0
and i think it traded around $0.0
we will use the $0.0 and i'll send you and email
could i get a copy of trco cashout and the detail for jan please
judy and i are going to use it to decide what to do tomorrow
i would like to be able to run
facilitation by location

my numbers match
you de man
if you nom from onshore straigt to leach
you pay comm
meaning without aca or gri
and aca
the ship leach to tco citygate and pay comm + aca + gri
if you go from leach to your tco pool
you pay the same cglf stuff and no charge on tco at all
next question
you have sst and you go from the pool to stoi
you pay the sst comm + aca + gri into storage
when you use sst to go from stow to the citygate
you only pay comm
no aca or gri
i think

i'm tired of my ford explorer
however
i checked new car prices on the internet and i think i'll keep my explorer for a little while longer
new cars are so expensive
so just go find me a boat and i'll be happy
just came in to work for a few min
later
you really don't care about my back do you

hey there
i was on vacation on the 0th
i guess its ok to send out the invoice now
then try aep in columbus
they have a big shop and you should know some of the people there
according to kimat
tp0 gets the nypa sale at mamou at the prices show below
we have 0 options on serving this deal
0
buy texas gas capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from the zone sl pool 0
use transco zone 0 wellhead 0
buy trco capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from st 0 most of the time we use option #0
texas gas is cheaper than trco even after paying the transport cost
however
this deal comes to the tp0 book at the prices listed below
for april
tp0 purchased the gas from gulf0 at the zone sl if + $.0 and shipped it to mamou
the total transport cost is $.0
including demand
this changes each month
we don't arb the supply with trco and texas gas because nypa is extremely difficult to work with and this is a term firm sale to nypa
should we change the mid price for the nypa to include both the zone sl mid price and the transport expense
please give judy townsend
scott goodell
and myself the ability to trade the physical canadian products
we need to be able to see them on eol
thanks
congratulations on the good news

why don't you get a hamster or something like that
you know my woman has a cat
he likes sleeping on my firm
rockhard stomach when i watch tv
ernie's on the team now
i'll ask my woman her opinion about my rock hard stomach
i'm sure she will agree after i tell her what to see
i guess women can be sensitive
ingrid's fine
and you
how's your man
u forgot to copy you brother
i don't think he did it
i think it just kicked in somehow
should we start terminating ces as a shipper on the interstate pipelines
how sweet
its doing ok
a better question is
how's the lovelife
that's doing ok too
although i wish i could find the perfect woman
mine is wanting to take some trips
maine
new york
europe
what's up with you girl
you like
cat
attitude don't you
and what makes you think my stomach is cushy
ernie's on the team now
i include darla on anything dealing with new power or ces
maybe ces should just be you
and wade can tell me what producer activity is going on or if he is aware of any items not in sitara
but ernie should have the whole ces picture nailed down
i'm thinking this statoil should just go to ernie and we not be involved
i spoke to him on the phone before i sent the email
she has a mostly white one
at least those are the color of the kitty hairs on my clothes
she left his front claws in because she said it was mean to take them out
of course she gets a little angry when he sharpens his claws on the couch
i figure he will get run over by a car someday and she will be said
i will be sensitive and caring and then she'll get another one
i guess i don't have to tell you that those long distance relationships are kinda tough
good luck
ernie
this is what i think
ena sold ces gas delivered to the nimo citygate
i don't think we ever had supply behind the citygate like we did with peoples and east ohio
heidi probably did the imbalance trades because it was after the gas flow day and we were unable to do anything about it
comments
questions
should we start terminating ces as a shipper on the interstate pipelines
the truth is out there

a little humor to start your day computer gender an english teacher was explaining to the students the concept of gender association in the english language
noting how hurricanes at one time were given only female names
and how ships and planes were usually referred to as

one of the students raised her hand and asked
what gender is a computer
the teacher wasn't certain and divided the class into two groups
males in one
females in the other
and asked them to decide if a computer should be masculine or feminine
both groups were asked to give four reasons for their recommendations
the group of women concluded that computers should be referred to as masculine because

we are unable to use it to serve ogy at doyle on transco
i have devised a super scientific method for pricing vng space for ogy
poke all the holes in it you want
use the following formulas to determine the price to ogy the higher of st 0 offer plus $.0 tco offer plus $.0 good luck
little correction going forward the higher of st 0 offer plus $.0 tco offer plus $.0
we would have been around $.0 to $.0
are you looking at the imbalance trade behind nimo with amerada hess for april 0
we would have been around $.0 to $.0
hey
i went on a company outing to aransas pass last week
left wed afternoon and got back friday afternoon
one of the pipelines i deal with has a hunting and fishing lodge down there
it was nice
i caught 0 redfish
both keepers too
the guide would bait my hook and throw it in the water
all i had to do was sit there and look pretty till the fish started biting
i could really get used to that sort of thing
the fishing guide said i should expect to pay about $0,0/ft for my fishing boat
i guess my boat will only be about 0 ft long
keep looking for my boat
let's see

i did take a look at the $0,0 home
this house has been on the market for awhile
the backyard sits next to some big building
that's a bad thing
i have not had a chance to look at the other house
the sq footage seems really small though
based on what i've seen over the last 0 months
it would take something around $0's
$0's to make me happy and i'm not willing to spend that much right now
another thing that bothers me is the economy
all i hear about are layoffs
the only industry still booming is the energy industry and we keep streamlining
that's what keeps me from spending the big bucks on a house

my unaccounted volume on tp0 for september is

thanks
done
got it
i'm starting to think you don't care about me anymore
what are you doing
frank
i was out last week and i'm just now getting to you email
as a marketer
i agree with dynegy's slide #0
the risk of not being able to find replacement capacity
or city gate gas supply
within two hours or less may be too great
the only time capacity would be recalled is on peak days
also
according to my transco schedulers
pse&g does not accept contract number changes after 0:0 pm the day before gas flows
if we were using released capacity to serve a market at pse&g and the capacity was recalled intra-day
we would not be able to schedule the gas because of pse&g's nomination and scheduling procedures
this is an interesting point because the only term capacity release deal we have on the east desk is with pse&g
however
we do support intra-day capacity release
this is the guy in charge of all the transport for cinergy
i have not been able to speak to him because he is out of the office so much
and i don't know if i'm still in his good graces either
in september
ena agreed to purchase capacity from new power on transco
the total demand charge should have been $0,0.0 on contract 0.0
new power released the capacity volumetrically and i didn't catch it
the actual demand charge billed was $0,0.0
new power agreed to reimburse ena for the difference of $0,0.0
ena will pay the pipeline the billed demand charge of $0,0.0 and bill new power $0,0.0 on deal 0
my girlfriend is pregnant and we are getting married around january
but not too many people know about that
if anyone says anything to me i'm gonna deny it
don't want no kitties
i'm going home now because i've lost so much money today
bye
i thought you mite do that
o
we have a discounted it rate of $.0 for oct
receipt points are 0l
0l
delivery points are tenn z0
contract 0 cds demand charges effective 0/0/0 rate vol factor amount contract adjustment
$0,0.0 days 0 unit rate 0.0
would you see if we have a discount for gas flowing from 0l to carnes on sep 0th
we had discounts before and after so it seems like we would have a discount for that day as well
i can't find anything in my notes
thanks
fyi
just sent this note to tenn
i believe i did because 0
i used the
0 rate in pricing the deals in my system and the deals are at a fixed price which means i had to calculate it and 0
i had the discounts on gas flow before the 0th and gas flow on days after the 0th and 0
the 0th is a friday which makes me think we would not have forgotten to call as oppossed to an intraday on sat or sun
its only a diff of $0 or so
so if its difficult or
improper
don't worry about it
thanks
forget it
i don't need your lecture
i get real tired of this guy
for whatever reason he and i just don't seem to comunicate real well
you should call me so i can harass you
i'm still passing out your name and number to people that are looking
i only give it to people that i think would fit in a capacity role
are you ok with that or should i stop
it ft fuel ft demand all rates include aca but no gri
put me down for $0.0 not per mile you crazy woman>

hey team
i think i have everyone but feel free to forward this message on to others that may need it
brenda fletcher was asking me enron has the following deals with aec at niagara and leidy
deal # vol buy/sale location end term book 0 0 buy tenn niagara 0/0/0 new england 0 0 sale tenn niagara 0/0/0 new england when this deal was done 0 years ago
aec agreed to give enron the nful transport
i don't know who at enron agreed to this
enron pays nful max demand for the space
i believe the contract price on deal 0 is a nful leidy price
and part of it should be adjusted for demand
commodity
and fuel
also the net delivered volume at leidy is 0 dth
= 0 at niagara
kam
i'm not sure which firm book this is in
over the last few months
i would calculate the transfer price from the firm book to tp0
or tp0
as tp0
i take any nful length at a cng equivalent price
i also created deal 0 at 0 price to balance out niagara
also
i believe we need to bill aec for the demand charges for the last 0 years of this deal
that's around $0,0,0
i'm sure aec is not expecting that
does anyone here talk to aec

my new location is 0
thanks
would you check on this when you get a chance

thanks
please grant robin the following origination from tp0
hey buddy
would it be better to sell this on sonat or tenn
the storage balance is 0,0 dth or about 0,0 dth per day
on nov 0th
i sold 0 dth to black hills in tenn z0 for the 0th
i bought the gas from hodge on cng
i need to know where the gas is if it didn't get delivered to tenn
the deal ticket shows that i changed added the deal at 0:0 am
the volumes must have been in sitara because sitara shows joann changing the volume from 0 to 0 on the 0th
then it shows me changing the volume back on the 0th
lia
would you see if we even nominated the intraday on the 0th to black hills
thanks
we have the following tenn disounts for the 0-0th even though we may not use them
z0 to carthage meter #0 on k#0 $.0 plus fuel
any z0 or z0 point to z0-tewksbury on k#0 $.0 plus fuel
joann
is the canajoharie volume for the nov 0th still 0
gerald
it looks like the gas i sold you on the nov 0 did not get scheduled
the volume was 0 dth
still checking on the 0th
please order me a fan because i'm burning up over here
we negotiated the following discounts on tenn and tgt tenn
all discounts are for the 0th only

i changed your col gas password from ou0rules to clg0dec
we currently have 0 park
loan deals with colubia gas
deal 0
we have 0,0 that was scheduled to come out in december
contract #0
we are currently paying $0.0 per month on this deal
deal 0
we have 0,0 scheduled to come out in january 0
contract #0
we are currently paying $0,0.0 per month
i have not spoken to the pipeline but i believe we would have to prepay all of our transport demand charge expenses before cgas will let us schedule any of this gas
our monthly demand charge expense is $0,0.0
i would also assume that we would have to prepay the ees demand charges as well
i really need to chat with the pipeline on this one but this is my best guess right now
this gas was parked at bear creek on a tenn park and loan contract
it is scheduled to come out on sonat
to my knowledge
we don't have any sonat demand charges
but our monthly demand charge expense on tenn is at least $0,0.0
mainly due to the boston gas netback deal
i think tenn would make us prepay the tenn demand charges to get this gas out of the park
loan on sonat
we have 0,0 that was scheduled to come out in december on sonat
i have no idea how tenn/sonat will bill us for this contract going forward
this is what i have so far for wholesale east tport
i need to research the rest
why don't you guys plan an evening in houston and i'll show you the trade floor
i really prefer to do it after 0:0 these days
it doesn't have to be this week
i was just thinking about it
maybe i'll get a free meal off of both of ya
no
we are not going anywhere afterwards to look at half naked brazilian women wooooooooohooooooooooooo
you are both a bad influence on me already
steve bennet
thanks
sign us up
but
i may be who knows where sowing all my wild oats with half naked brazilian women
i don't have that many oats left anyway
it could just be an oat
by the way
suzanne made a second baptist comment to me yesterday when i was talking to robert
i can't remember exactly what she said but i sure do wish you wouldn't tell her anymore stuff about us
i finally figured out that her and jim are very similar
information is power that they can share with others
even useless trivia information about friends
i don't think either one of them mean any harm
they just can't keep their big mouths shut
i'm off to another wild day of tariff review
call me when you can
it brightens my day and wakes me up
later gator boo booo

i think the answer is no but i wanted to double check
if we did
then i need to know the pipeline
contract number and probably the volume
thanks
hey there
i need the it contract numbers please
thanks
i have one more person that i'm waiting on and kathy is going to work on it after lunch
boo
last boo from me
thanks buddies and buddettes
i may bring yall some scheduler treats if i make it in on monday
then again i may just forget but remember i love you all
just so you don't forget me
i know its early but i'm interested in coming back
i'm sure you don't know what you will need until after we find out what happened today
tom martin was asking me if i would be interested in going to the texas desk to take daren farmer's place
daren is going to aep
i told him i would like to talk to you about the east desk first
tom would like an answer by monday
let me know
thanks
hey girl
it's so good to hear from you
let's see
i'm still here
i work on the estate team which means i work on the old stuff until they tell us to leave
my buddy goodell is will be working for newco
the new company
is this original or what
they should find out something in the next couple of days i think
other than that its just hand around and see what happens
so did you make good grades
what's that report card looking like
how's the hubby
you still in love or what
i think this is funny
i believe enron laid off some incredibly talented people
gloria might like this
i've been waiting for an opportunity to speak with you but it appears that you have been very involved
daren farmer works for tom martin on the texas desk upstairs
daren just accepted a position with aep and tom asked me if i would be interested in daren's position
i told him i would and i asked him to touch base with you
hey woman
what the heck are you doing
i did make it back
i actually came in most of last week
i just get way to bored at home in my tiny little apartment
i have this strong urge to go out and spend money and that's just the wrong thing to do right now
we don't really know much about the new company right now
i'm actually on the estate team anyway
i sit on 0 with ruth concannon
sylvia pollen
robin barbe
and kathy kelly
the rumor 0 weeks ago was that ubs was going to cut 0% of the jobs if they won
i think victor said that we should know alot more by tomorrow
i think i know of a couple of people that have left
david jones
black guy in origination
real nice guy too
starts working for txu in dallas today
darren farmer
texas desk
is going to aep
we don't have a deadline
our lawyers are scattered pretty thin
what would probably happen is that you guys might show me a bid for some of the capacity
then we would have to talk to the pipelines and see what they want to do
#0 and #0 are the correct contracts
#0 was intended to come out in dec and #0 was intended to come out in jan
wait just a minute
don't goodell and i get a wedding invite
maybe we want to give you an expensive gift
yeah right
we are poorer than college students now
i think you should send us an invite anyway
maybe i could make a bachelor party out of it
at least i could get drunk
so do you have all that wedding crap stuff done or is your man taking care of all that
i always heard that it was woman's work anyway
those are fantastic grades
you would have to add my old college grades together to get a 0.0
and i still think it would be a struggle
i know you told me but i can't remember
whets is your major
mba
its good to hear about alicia
is she going to grad school
i don't know when me and my very pregnant girlfriend are getting married
we move in together at the end of feb
i'm nervous about that
i've been living alone since
0 and i just don't know why all you foolish people want to get married and live together
i took some digital photo's of her yesterday
i'll let you know if i get them on the web so you can take a look and make fun of me being a 0 year old father to be
i have a copy of what's in the files we made before the holidays

i'm going to add other pregnant immer photo's

columbia gas sent me the december invoices via federal express
the cover letter states that columbia gas is aware that ena will not be paying the pre-petition amounts but that they expect full payment for the post-petition amounts

i'm trying hard not to call you and use up my phone call allowance this morning
good news
i'm reading an article on yahoo and they use the word nebulous
enron is
in part
the deformed offspring of a move to deregulate markets
it played fast and loose in a nebulous world of finance that received scant attention from lawmakers
i know what it means
and this is only the second time i have ever seen this word used
guess what
i have you nameplate
i'm gonna take it home and cherish it forever
life couldn't be better

a fellow can always hope
indrid still hasn't got me a rind either
i bet she doesn't marry me now
we have two firm transportation agreements on tennessee pipeline
the long term boston gas capacity release and a short term contract which expires on 0/0/0
the monthly demand charge on the short term capacity is $0,0.0
do we need to reject the short term capacity before it expires
to my knowledge
we did not flow any gas on this contract for december or january
my contact at tennessee
sherry noack
said she doesn't see any problem with us releasing the tenn boston gas capacity
iroq pretty much said the same thing last week but i will verify that again after lunch

my choice seems much simpler now that i look at it like this
i'm back and i'm gong
my msn doesn't work
what time should i come to your desk
just heard from robin
sad stuff
my msn doesn't work
russell is going to rwe
i would much rather go and annoy your happy butt as much as possible
plus it make me feel like i'm doing part of the work
i just might come up and spend the night tonight
be there around 0:0 or 0
funny
no
i didn't feel guilty about the garage sale
that's why i was annoyed
being notified at 0:0 at night grrrrrrr
i do feel guilty about you doing all this work
so i'm going with you
i pay for the gas and the twinkies
maybe we can go drinking too
that would be fun
i'll be at your house around 0:0 or 0 tonight
cullen and dykman
attorneys for boston gas company
approved all of our changes on the agreement to release the tenn and iroq space back to boston gas
they also made one other change
they are taking out the
subject to recall
language at the bottom of page 0 under item #0
they will be sending the revised document to me
i will deliver it to you for your approval
a heartwarming story of the advances of women in achieving equality throughout the world
barbara walters did a story on gender roles in kuwait several years before the gulf war
she noted then that women customarily walked about 0 feet behind their husbands
she returned to kuwait recently and observed that the men now walked several yards behind their wives
ms
walters approached one of the women and said
this is marvelous
can you tell the free world just what enabled women here to achieve this reversal of roles
land mines
said the kuwaiti woman
steve
everything looks good with one exception
the rate schedule on tennessee should be either net-0 or net-0
i won't find out until monday
you review and approve it
keep it on your desk
and i will come over and make the change at your desk on monday
then i'll take it to ed for his approval
by the way
cullen and dykman is sending copies of what we are doing to melanie gray
don't forget about me
i'm still trying to find out what it will take to move gas on and ena tabs agreement
no transportation at this point
just a tabs
also
it will be much easier for you guys to monitor because most of the deals will be monthly
jared
ruth and i are going to go over all the florida activity tomorrow morning
if no one objects
i will be the lead coordinator on florida starting tomorrow
yes maam
she's ubs now
she was just down here too
jared just told me you have a bunch of stuff on your plate and i think you are about to get much busier too
she is now
i don't think she had a choice
i heard that el paso had cuts on friday
did that impact you guys at all
i just validated and saved this release to boston gas
since i have not done this in awhile
would you please make sure i did the following things
released 0% of the volume biddable to boston gas and max rate
i will wait to hear from you before i submit my offer
thanks
also
i'm using scott goodell's id because my doesn't work
who do i call to get mine fixed
i know
you told me once before
i'm a baaaad person
i think so
probably some people in satellite offices too
i heard it was mostly originators and middle marketers
fyi
we just posted the capacity release to boston gas
i created a biddable offer per boston gas's request
this deal is for the month of feb only
fyi
meeting to discuss florida issues before jared goes away forever
scott
didn't know if you should be at this meeting as well
daniel
you did schedule the room for tuesday
jan 0th
correct
eric and ed are in a keyspan meeting at 0:0 am
would it be possible to move this meeting to a later time today
sniff sniff
i'm gonna miss you guys
think of me everytime you get a hug
sniff sniff
throw me some crumbs when you see me on the street
good
glad to hear it
we are going to try and meet at 0:0 this morning
jared is still in traffic right now anyway
ed mcmichael has signed the agreement
one minor change
i replaced all
ft-a
s with
net-0
i will fax a copy to your attention
also
does this need to be sent to you via over night mail
thanks
ed has signed off on the agreement you gave me yesterday evening
should i send this straight to boston gas's outside counsel or should i send it to melanie gray
guess what
i have the deal numbers in my notebook packed in a box
but ed mcmichael said we are not going to flow this gas until march
i think he also said he is trying to resurrect the con ed deal
which is probably similar to the lilco deal with respect to the pipelines it flows on
transco does not have a pooling contract like many of the other pipelines on the east
they assign the shipper a specific meter for that pool and you use your it contract to nominate pool to pool stuff
i did not change that ol capacity ticket but i think i will
i've got time
i wonder if you guys can attend these sessions as ubs
oh girl i know i do
i'm very modest too
i'm at my new desk on the 0th floor
i'm here
my computer is here
but it looks like my phone has not been activated
so i don't know when i'll be able to call and aggravate you
email aggravations just aren't the same
please try to think of some of our old conversations
especially those where you would look up and to the left uttering
oh my god
looks like my computer is working
not real well but it is working
i have my phone now too
oh yeah
whatever you want deal
i am completly indifferent
whatever makes you happy
i asked victor about the files
i think keeping it on your h drive is still a good idea for now
i can vaugly remember you calling me about unify
do i have unify estate access
if yes
do you know my id and password
if no
how do i get it
thanks
robin barbe is a northeast originator and i'm sure she will be interested too
remember
steak dinner for the winner
hey woman
i need your phone number and steve's phone number and john's phone number and tammy's phone number please
update
ena was buying daily swing gas from sequent on florida to supply the city of tallahassee deal
sequent says this deal is an administrative burden and has elected not to supply any more gas to ena after 0/0/0
scott goodell called aaron bohall with pancanadian to see if they would become our new swing supplier
aaron told me that they would sell us gas under the following conditions
the deal has to be on pancanadian's paper we need to let pancanadian know by 0:0 am every morning and ena must take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays
this is a problem because tallahassee does not have to take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays and tallahassee does not need to notify ena until 0:0 am
aaron will see if they can work with a 0:0 am deadline
i think this will do for now
i was sniffling the other evening when we went out for a little drinky and meredith said you wanted to work out instead of seeing me
i was so sad and heartbroken
baby's doing good
woman has not had any problems so far and she's starting to feel the baby move on a regular basis now
i've never felt the little sucker move
maybe she's just getting fat
what do you think
we keep loosing people
christina is moving to the estate team power dispatch group
good for her
that will make her in expendable
how the heck are you
looks like it works
thanks
nothing so far
joe parks is checking with bridgeline to see if we can buy gas from them
it was late in the day before pancanadian called
i don't think pancanadian will work because they do not have the flexibility to sell different daily volumes over weekends and holidays
i hope we can work out a deal with bridgeline
joe or i will be calling them first thing this morning
yesterday afternoon tallahassee indicated that they may not need the swing gas for the weekend
interesting because this capacity was released non-recallable to ces which was assigned
not via capacity release
to ena
fyi
demand charge = $0.0 per month = $.0 per dth and the commodity is $.0 0% load factor cost = $.0
ok
i see russel and chucks touch all through this
i'm busy that day
just kidding>
margaret i've attached the prepayment request
the physical address for the bank is tennessee gas pipeline company c/o bank of america file #0 0 s
canal street
0th floor chicago
il 0 the address of the company we are doing business is tennessee gas pipeline company nine greenway plaza the person i negotiated the deal with is andy armstrong
his number is 0-0-0
the person at el paso corporate credit
tennessee is a sub of el paso
is julie baker
her number is 0-0-0
eric
julie at el paso said the only reason she is requiring a prepay for this small an amount is because her records show that ena has not paid any monies for anything on the el paso pipelines
including tennessee
sonat
anr
or el paso pipeline
i know that we should have at least paid for the bear creek storage on tennessee
who do i talk to over there about buying gas on florida in zone 0
and it was very nice to see you today
update on a new swing supplier as of 0:0 pm on friday i've called pancanadian
e prime
cinergy
reliant
coral
oneok
and entergy-koch
i'm waiting for most of these people to call me back
the only positive response i've had is from coral and he still doesn't know if he can sell us gas even if we prepay
oneok is the only counterparty that said they will not do business with us because we owe them $0 million
today we learned that bridgeline sent comfort letters to their customers
informing their customers that bridgeline will not sell us gas
margaret
it looks like monday may be another fire drill day but i promise to keep working on it until 0
i have two suppliers that will work with ena or 0
i've run out of customers to call
scheduling contacts
same as before
we should have another supplier set up by the end of the day
the calculation for the prepay is 0 dth x $.0 per dth = $0.0 for gas flow on 0/0/0 on tenn contract 0
reliant has agreed to sell us gas on florida
my trading contact is jim taylor
0-0-0
the contact on the wire should be pete torres
0-0-0
he is in reliant's credit department
pete said there should be an active gisb contract with reliant already in place
i would like to prepay for 0 days and i have my calculation on the prepay request form
please let me know if you have any questions
thanks
please use bank account number 0 for the wire to tennessee gas pipeline company
subsidiary of el paso
ted with el paso's corporate credit department said this account number is good
call me at 0-0-0 if you have any questions
thanks chris germany
richard james taylor was born on jan 0th
he weighed 0 lbs 0 ozs
jim would like to meet for lunch
his treat
one day
of course he doesn't want to meet me
he wants to see judy p
but the boy is smart
he knows that the best way to see judy p
for lunch is to invite me
see there
you are still a benefit to me
so how about thursday
i just got to work about 0 min ago
key lay has resigned from the board of directors
i brought in those chocolate hearts and passed them out to my little group
i told the guys that i do discriminate because i gave all the guys 0 chocolate and all the girls 0 chocolates
how's your day
pete
i'm following up the voicemail i left you this morning
in our initial discussions you indicated we could do business under an existing gisb agreement between enron north america and reliant
however
our legal department believes all of our gisb contracts with reliant have been cancelled/terminated
attached is a standard gisb agreement for your review
i understand that you need to send this to your legal department to include any special provisions that may be necessary
please call me at 0-0-0 or eric boyt at 0-0-0 and let me know if reliant energy services is willing to trade under this agreement
thanks chris germany manager
gas trading
here is our unofficial tennessee invoice for january
another prepay to tennessee
the calculation for the prepay is 0,0 dth x $.0 per dth = $0.0
reliant has indicated that we must use their paper
this point is non-negotiable
kay
we will not wire any funds to reliant until we have your approval of the contract
i understand that you are also working on a gas contract with txu
we need one of these contracts in place so we can buy gas tomorrow morning
it doesn't matter which contract we have in place first
doug
phil
eric
the prepayment that we were going to send to reliant may be going to txu instead
we are coming dangerously close to defaulting on the tallahassee contract
robin and i are going to work on a prepayment request for txu after lunch
thanks
i have sent this to my legal department
i thought yesterday was going to be our last day but now i think today is it
this has turned out to be very frustrating
i have 0 prepays in this email
we will not need to wire money to tennessee if we can get txu set up as a supplier by 0:0 am tomorrow
note to all the first prepay is to txu
i'm requesting $0,0.0 to be prepaid to txu
that's about 0 days of supply for the tallahassee deal
the second prepay is for 0 day of interruptible transportation on tennessee
if we are unable to purchase gas from txu or reliant
we will use the bear creek storage gas on tennessee to supply the tallahassee deal
this is what we did on the 0nd-0th
i am also anticipating that the discounted it rate on tennessee will be higher for gas flow on the 0th
my goal is to maintain 0 active suppliers
with prepays
on the east coast
txu and reliant
i would also like to set up a trading contract with another supplier
maybe coral
in case txu or reliant decides to stop doing business with ena
our supplier for the swing gas on the tallahassee deal in january was sequent
however
last thursday
sequent stopped doing business with ena because it was too much of a burden for them to keep track of the ena prepays and the daily volumes
so far we have spent 0 business days trying to secure another supplier
we will also be able to use txu and reliant as suppliers for any other deals that we are able to start up
same thing as yesterday
i requested a wire in the amount of 0.0
0 dth x $.0 per dth
which is for gas flow on ena's it contract #0 on 0/0/0
i negotiated this deal with michelle in the bid room
you should have received this yesterday afternoon
thanks
these are my notes on flowing gas
tetco will be the problem pipeline
i called my rep again and asked her to seriously look into it
i'm thinking worse case is they will need either cash or a letter of credit for about $0,0,0.0
i'm using the following formula they may cut back on the number of days but the cashout price is the problem
it's a moving target and i expect prices to go up
i think that if we just agreed to give them a letter of credit for $0 mill and then prepay for any actual expenses we incur
we could build our reputation on the pipeline
at least until we get rid of these deals
if all the gas flows like it should
we should never have any actual expenses on any of these pipelines for the keyspan deal
who knows what volumes are going to be
this is what someone created for sequent
i plan on doing something similar for reliant and txu
call me after you get this and we can chat
look what i found in my inbox
iroquois is offering to market ena's capacity for $0.0
see attachements at the bottom of this email
doesn't sound like a bad deal to me
i hope to quit before that becomes an issue
one can only hope
how do i get jim taylor added as a contact at reliant energy services
inc
in sitara
who do i call to get my palm hooked up to my computer
i have the palm cradle sitting on my desk
i found a mistake in my capacity worksheet
the term on the boston gas capacity
contract 0
0,0 mdq
is 0/0/0
0/0/0
i think have the ending date as 0
do you want to work with wade price on the appalachian suppliers on cgas
i think we are still getting gas because contracts have not been terminated or something like that
it will probably be tedious but it doesn't matter to me
just let me know
following are the contract terms for iroquois and tennessee
i am more interested in getting numbers on iroq contract 0-0
i believe we should not consider releasing the capacity for any term less than a year
pipeline iroquois rate schedule rts0 receipt point waddington delivery point south commack beginning term 0/0/0 ending term 0/0/0 pipeline iroquois rate schedule rts0 receipt point waddington delivery point tennessee wright beginning term 0/0/0 ending term 0/0/0 pipeline tennessee rate schedule net 0 beginning term 0/0/0 ending term 0/0/0
wade called eric about someone wanting us to cancel a contract then wade said there are still lots of producers putting gas on our contracts
i was working on something else and i just asked wade to send me a worksheet of what he was talking about
wade actually called eric
tennessee requires a pepayment or lc in the amount of $0,0.0 per sa pool
for the keyspan deal
that essentially means we would need $0,0.0 of credit for each point
0l
0l
and zone 0 = $0,0.0 total
i echatted with dan
he said the number is 0-0-0 and he thinks the name of the person is allen fuchs
i've would like to wire reliant $0,0.0 tomorrow and then wire about $0,0.0 every thursday to keep reliant paid for 0 days of gas
i'm making the following assumptions
0
ena will be maintaining this deal through march 0
0 0
prices are going to remain flat for the next 0 months 0
tallahassee will call on the maximum swing volumes every day so far this month
tallahassee has called on the maximum swing volumes every day
i will make adjustments to the thursday wire amount as needed based on prices and how much tallahassee calls on
the following worksheet projects how much we need to send reliant each week and shows what days tallahassee called on the swing gas
phil
you mentioned adding a column for the sales price to tallahassee
sounds good to me
this file is located at o:/gas structuring/bankruptcy folder/city of tallahassee/tallahassee swing cash flow.xls the following worksheet shows ena's activity with reliant
our current cash balance with reliant
how much gas we have purchased
and what price we used
i will send the following worksheet to reliant each week
i also plan to copy phil
robin
and margaret
this file is located at o:/gas structuring/bankruptcy folder/city of tallahassee/ena-reliant prepay.xls eric
doug
phil
let me know what you think about the wire for friday and every thursday
tallahassee called on the gas for the weekend
i had planned for that in my numbers but i had no idea prices would go up $.0
$.0 for the weekend
my fault
this makes my cash balance at reliant short by about $0.0 if prices post on the high side
my trading contact at reliant said that his credit department does not want to work with us at all
my contact said his credit department could force him to cut the deal
we won't know until this afternoon or monday
so please try to get the wire out today

would you ask gerald gilbert to call me when he gets a chance
my number is 0-0-0
thanks
i would like for you to get 0 or 0 bids for the iroq zone 0 capacity
and later
i may ask you to get bids for the iroq/tenn capacity
that would be great if you could tell me
i show we wired $0,0.0 at 0:0 pm on the 0th

i would be happy to include you on the schedule below that i email to jim and pete showing this activity

attached is my new schedule reflecting no gas flow on the 0th and 0th
let me know if you want to be added to this distribution list
i should only send this list out 0 or 0 times a week now that we have a process down
hopefully just once a week
every thursday
guess what
i just hired some mover to move me next week
indrid keep telling me that you and i have bad backs and don't need to fool with moving furniture
so
i hired movers
they are charging me $0 hour and i figure 0 hours max
0 ipp agreement
our pooling contract
0 as agreement
0 as agreement
i think the as agreements are aggregation supply and i believe the wellhead meters were attached to these contracts to help with allocations and billing
i not 0% sure so i left a message for our cgas contact to verify
steve stonestreet at cgas did verify that metered production on cgas is
attached
to the as
aggregation service
contracts
and from there you would schedule it to a transport contract or into the ipp contract
cgas and dominion work very similar when talking about metered production
hey team
i would like to release the iroq and tenn capacity for march activity to boston gas by the end of the week if possible
please let me know by thur morning if i should wait until next week
thanks
who would have this info
and it might be a good thing for me to add to the schedule
thanks
good idea
i'm checking on it and i might add this info to the worksheet
i'm trying to get in touch with gerald gilbert
he started working there on 0/0 i think
you may not know him but if you do
ask him to call me at 0-0-0

dad gave me the single shot 0
but there is still the little one
the double

we might as well give me access to all ena gas positions and the ability to create/update sitara tickets for all gas regions
i'm using march pricing for tco and sonat
for tco
i'm using the financial basis offer for march provided by dan junek at aes at 0:0 am

sonat basis is not as liquid so i'm using the inside ferc differential for feb 0
for feb 0
henry hub is $0.0 and sonat is $0.0

at 0:0 am
nymx for march 0 is $0.0

i would like one of those and who are you talking to at dominion
thanks
that's fine
i don't need aep
tommy
i see you didn't approve my access for aep which is fine
i only need access to all the estate desks and i just asked daniel to give me everything because i don't know where the deals are for the other desk
i didn't know if the central desk deals are under central desk or one of their many other books
i think i just need central
east
west
and texas
but
maybe you can help
my request for the central desk needs darron giron's approval and he's not in the people finder
so he's either at ubs or he left the company
do you know who i should be approving that now
thanks
i'm requesting the prepay for dominion for march 0
i printed out the request
signed it

we are expecting gas to flow any day
hopefully by the weekend

i need to meet with you
ed

please let daniel and i know when you are available after lunch on monday and daniel will get us a conference room
thanks
daniel
please get us a conference room for 0 min monday afternoon and email everyone with the details
eric
you don't need to be there
i'm just keeping you in the loop
never mind
according to iroq the problem is on our side
please call me first think monday morning at 0-0
following is the address that i'm starting at
i go to this address and click on
customer activities
and that's when i get the error message
it should ask me for my id and password
i'm at ecs 0 if you decide to come by my desk
i'm out for the rest of the day
thanks
according to kay mann
shemin may not be here until late afternoon
i'm not sure if it should be terminated but to my knowledge we are not serving this deal so it probably should be terminated
i'm going to a
terminated contracts
meeting this morning so maybe i will find out more about how this works
i also don't see any volumes on this deal for march
i just showed ed mcmichael the sitara position screens for the east and central desk for march 0st
there are volumes all over the place
i asked him who should be taking these volumes to 0 since most of these deals are not physically flowing
ed is going to discuss this in a meeting with bob hall today
i guess my next question is should the volume be taken to 0 in sitara or unify
can you guys think of any other questions along those lines
do you have a deal number for this gas
could you tell me who in legal is assigned to this
thanks
hi team
i'm going to set myself up as the navigator administrator for enron north america unless someone else wants to do it

oh no
i insist that you do it since you started the process
i'm such a laggard
i'm telling you life just can't get any better
we spent our first night together friday night
of course we both have colds
allergies real bad so it was a sniffly experience
it will take some getting used to thats for sure
she was trying to set up the kitchen yesterday
bless her pregnant heart
i did have those set up pretty quick
i know
i'm gong to recommend zeroing out the deal in sitara under
expected volumes
i have an id
what kind of form are you talking about
i just went over the march prepayment with david walker
0-0-0
at dominion
on thursday
ena will wire $0,0.0 to dominion
the force majeure event has ended and dominion will resume deliveries effective 0/0/0
we are assuming dominion did not deliver any gas for feb 0th through feb 0th
0 days
following are my calculations amount to wire on 0/0/0 ==> $0,0.0 there may have been some gas flow on feb 0th
but david will let us know about that later
doug
do i need to prepare a new cash use approval request form
fyi
i'm sure these are not in the system yet but will be soon
just a reminder that we still need to discuss the physical deals with volumes in the sitara for march

my contact at midamerican is dave evans
0-0-0
dave said he was using apr nymx + $.0 to calculate his price
hey
i don't think you should show any cash flow for the enbridge storage until i talk to them this afternoon
i'm writing an email to you and a few others about what i think we should forcast and i want to talk to them first
but between you and me
i'm thinking we show about $0,0 or so
yes sir
per my discussion with dave evans
midamerican agreed to pay ena for this gas and will not net this deal with any other deal
we also discussed doing this deal under a gisb agreement but if we have some other post-bankruptcy agreement that we can trade under then that's fine with me
you and stacy can decide if we need to put any of this information on the confirm
stacy also has some comments below pertaining to the gst tax that should may need to be included in the confirm
i did not discuss the gst tax
i felt fortunate that someone would do business with me
joe van zandt with dominion field services wants to know if we are going to nominate his gas for the first
their are 0 fixed price deals and 0 index + $.0 deal
i can't find the deals in the system
what should i tell him legally besides no
i would like to set up a gisb agreement to trade with sempra
could you send me one to send to sempra please
thanks
i took 0/0 day off thur 0st and fri 0nd
this doesn't have everything on it and i thought about just doing something more like a summary thingy with pretty much the same info on it
i want you to take a look and tell me what you think
i actually think a summary thingy
sorta like the info we used to have on the grease boards for bid week
would be easier to look at
give me your thoughts
done
fyi
pipeline name change
not sure who this might impact
at least i don't see any deals in sitara on this pipeline
there will be a quiz tomorrow afternoon at 0:0 pm
enbridge is going to send me an invoice tonight or tomorrow
they have been sending us and invoice each month
i'll get back to you
i just know we owe money on this and i hope its not more than what we are making on the deal
i'm actully working on this
i should have it done tomorrow or monday
thanks
i need your expertise
if ena nominated this gas
and i think we did based on what i see in unify
then we are supposed to pay for it
so i just need to verify with you we took this gas by nominating it
deal 0 on natural gas pipeline company
thanks
ed is asking me if we followed up or if we need to follow up
please let me know
i am also going to send you an email of the letter we sent to tallahassee
i still am unable to get into the ebb
did the capacity get awared to boston gas
wonder where i should go to lunch today
maybe the booooofeeeeeet
sounds like a pizza night to me
of course
its my perrrrogative to changemy mind and go burger hopping
fyi
i just bumped up the forecast for next week from $0,0 to $0,0 because tallahassee took the swing gas for the weekend
i've also put a manual date and time on my swing gas cash forecast worksheet
i hope i have the right bob hall
i'm trying to get sitara access to the west and texas desk and they have not been approved yet
i'm waiting for phillip love
now with ubs
to approve the west and o'neal winfree
not sure who this is
to approve the texas desk
tommy yanowski was able to help with a couple of these but it looks like we need to get the approving parties changed
i also left a message for the help desk about this
goodell want phone numbers for the following williams people
jon warzel in tulsa thomas coleman in atlanta
update schedule through 0/0/0
have a good weekend
bernie said he has given ed all the file locations and such
i asked him to email you and i anything he thinks important
i was getting an error messge until i downloaded something from the iol setup
help tab
now
i go to and select
transportation
at the top of the screen
then i select
customer activities
from the left side of the screen
and this is where i used to get an error message
now i just get a small symbol
looks like some sort of
flash
plug in is not loaded
u de man
thanks
i'm not aware of an ap rate schedule
as
tariff sheet #0
and ipp
tariff sheet #0
are separate rate schedules in the tariff
as pools are used to aggregate production meters on cgas's system and are assigned a specific geographical location on the pipeline
as pool meters can be used as primary receipt points on firm transportation agreements whereas ipp pool meters are not
i did submit a request via
e request
#0
i didn't know if you wanted to assign other people to do this and i don't know how you would do that either
i just asked for everything to cover all the bases
cash till williams does a little better
i'm swinging back to pizza now
the tariff sheets do not line up on the page so well
i did a cut and paste
you should see the following sheets no comment file 0b pal rates cgas_pal_rates.doc 0-0 rate schedule cgas_pal_tariff.doc
i am micro-managing this deal and i don't want it to catch you by surprise
if you look at my schedule for march
you will see that it is possible for ena to have a negative cash balance with reliant before i make the thursday prepay based on the daily spike in prices
i get the estimated prices from jim
do you want me to make a prepayment on wednesday or are you comfortable with the regular thursday prepayment
i need to know by tomorrow morning
i have to request prepayments the day before the wire goes out
thanks
cash prices have jumped over $.0 since friday
i may need to make my prepayment on wednesday for reliant and i've bumped up the amout to $0,0 for this week
i will have a much better idea by 0:0 tomorrow of course
hi everybody
it's steve cooper
it's friday afternoon
march 0
i hope everybody has had a great week
i want to update everybody on a number of things that have gone on this week
so that you all will be fully in the loop
the week started in a rough-and-tumble fashion
i went to a town meeting monday night to meet with a number of our ex-colleagues
their disappointment
upset and anger is very understandable
i
along with the entire management team
have committed that we are going to try to do whatever we can to fashion a reasonable resolution to their various issues
in order to make sure that those that are truly in need have something to fall back on
we asked the court later in the week and got the judge to approve an emergency $0 million fund
we are now going to fish around for an independent administrator to evaluate the needs and disperse those dollars to former employees
i wanted you to be aware of that
i really do appreciate and understand everybody's upset
last friday
february 0
we presented to the creditors
committee a formal proposal on a retention and severance program
as can be expected
there was some push back from the committee
there were issues about some of the data
there were requests for additional data and further clarification
the creditors
committee formed a subcommittee
we provided to them more data
jeff mcmahon and i met with them on wednesday
february 0
and we met with them again on thursday
february 0
we are scheduled to meet with them again on monday and tuesday to resolve all the open issues and to get the full support and endorsement of the creditors
committee on this program
i have indicated to the subcommittee that getting a plan in place is jeff's and my highest priority
it is not right or fair for anyone to be in a state of ongoing uncertainty about their future
their future compensation
and any financial safety net
so we are going to have to move on this at light speed
i told the creditors
subcommittee and asked that they tell the full committee that we want to be in a position by the week of march 0 to motion this up to the court
i'll keep you posted on progress
i am comfortable that the committee wants to put in place the retention and severance program and now we are just working out the bugs
hopefully
by the time we have the employee meeting
we can walk through the composition of the program in detail
the powers that be
management in conjunction with the human resources group
are working on merit increases and promotions
hopefully all the details of a program will be finalized next week
then
the process is typically that business unit managers begin to calculate salary increases
and it works its way through the review
approval and communication process
so hopefully
we'll have that all resolved in the next week or two and everyone will know where they stand with respect to promotions and merit increases
we reached an accord with the astros this week to repatriate to enron $0.0 million for the release of our rights to the naming contract
it is a shame we won't be in a position to support the naming of the field
but it is probably in the best interest of the estate
i got a great suggestion from one of our colleagues about auctioning enron field signs and contributing net proceeds to the ex-employees
fund
i'd like your input on that
i thought it was a great idea and very generous
we are moving forward with plans for an employee meeting later this month
hopefully i'll be able to meet many of you there
i've tried to get around to say hello here and there
and again
i would encourage you if you have any questions
concerns or issues just give me an email or a buzz
sometimes it takes a few days for me to get back to you
but i'm making a very concerted effort to answer everybody's inquiries
other than that i don't have a lot to report
we'll continue to hammer out with the committee the retention program
hopefully by next friday i'll be able to report very substantial progress in this area
i want to thank everybody for their efforts
all their hard work and their focus on moving things forward
one other thing
we did have a bank meeting on thursday afternoon
we have described to the banks what we believe is a very reorganizable entity here
we'll be sharing more about that at the employee meeting
i told the bank group
and it was echoed by management
that we believe there is a reorganizable
viable entity in enron's future
i'll bring you all fully up to speed on that at the employee meeting
anyway
as i was saying
thanks so much for all your hard work
your efforts
your dedication
i hope you have a great weekend
i'll chat with next week
steve is working with the admins to see who needs what

i would normally send this request directly to settlements

moved the prepay to wednesday
the amount is $0,0.0 due to the spike in pirces
i've requested a prepayment for wed in the amount of $0,0.0 due the rise in cash prices
i've also added a new and exciting
summary
tab to the worksheet
that shows when the wires are made and my summary purchases for the month
one thing i don't have access to is any information that identifies the wire
jim
pete
shawn
let me know if you have anything you would like me to add to this worksheet and go ahead and hit jim up for a free lunch
that's what i plan to do
hey
i think you are the only person that doesn't delete this right away
ok
now i feel like i'm doing somethig worthwhile
shawn seems like a nice person
you should take her out to eat then i'll take you out to eat
listed below are ena's pool balances as of 0/0/0 and 0/0/0
from ena's perspective
i would prefer to terminate the pools effective 0/0/0
that would leave ena with a negative pre-petition imbalance on dominion and ena would not have to pay the producers for december production or worry about selling a positive imbalance in an un-friendly market
however
dominion will probably not let ena terminate the pools until 0/0/0 due to the negative cumulative imbalance
questions that need to be answered
** will ena have to pay the producers for december
possibly january
production if dominion will not let ena terminate the pools any earlier
** how will dominion handle the positive imbalance if the pool is terminated on 0/0/0 or later
the operations contact at dominion is iris king
0-0-0
she is one of the managers over the operations group
in my opinion
we should terminate the pools as early as possible
0/0/0 per vickie coen at dominion ena pool balances as of gat north 0,0 0,0 tran north 0 0 gat south
0,0
0,0 tran south 0,0 0,0

sitara deal #0
tdc stated that it would
file a claim for administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in new york and seek all other necessary relief against ena
if ena did not remit payment by the close of business feb 0

based on the information in this email it appears that ena should pay tdc $0,0.0
kay
ed
question
i have not contacted tdc to determine if they have filed a claim with the court
would that have any impact on making a payment to tdc
should i contact tdc
calculation of post-petition payment using dec 0 as post-petition day gas scheduled dec 0-0

at boston gas
he is a resource management analyst at boston gas working for liz danehy
according to joe
ena is still billing boston gas for part of the demand charges on the long term producer netback deal
that ruth is so familiar with
this is iroquois and tennessee capacity i am releasing back to boston gas each month at a 0% demand rate
joe asked me why we were doing this and i told him that ena was probably not paying the capacity bills and boston gas was aware of that fact and knew boston gas would be liable for the demand charges anyway
sounds like boston gas may be getting double billed and joe said they will probably not pay the invoice
let me know if you get this

ees volume management
and i are trying to determine what the dominion pipeline imbalances are from the appalachian producers for ees
dominion will not tell us without making a formal request to their legal department
we may have to do that anyway
i'm not sure what this report is called
i just know its on a 0 month lag
i'm also not sure if this report was mailed to us or if we could run it out of escript
dominion's ebb
if it was run out of escript
then someone in volume management should know how to do it and that person could show me
if the report was mailed to us
then i'll have to make a formal request to dominion's legal department
don't spend more than 0 minutes trying to figure out how to do this
if the person that handled dominion is gone
then i'll just go the
legal
route
thanks

is this a new contract on our side to send to them for review
updated schedule through wednesday 0/0/0
yesterday i asked you how to go about paying an invoice from peoples energy for $0,0.0
the charges are for a license fee
a customer service
and an outstanding balance of $0.0
i found out this morning that we are using this system to do nominations for enovate
eric boyt said he thought the enron people managing the enovate deal are beth jenkins and j.o
pagan
should i forward this invoice to beth or j.o
these days
its easier for our legal department to draft or approve a new gisb than to find any of the existing documents
the attached document is for enron north america corp
david is going to see if they can use it
if your legal department approves
please print 0 originals
fill in the sempra information

doug sewell said he would not pay for it as ena and i don't know enough about the deal to argue with him
i've pasted in richard's response is in black below
kay
ena has a user id on a system called pegasys
peoples gas invoices ena about $0.0 a month for a license fee
customer service charge
and taxes and it looks like we have not paid this bill for the last 0 months
in the pre-petition world
we used this id to do nominations on the peoples gas system
we are not currently using this id and it looks like we no longer need an id for this system
but
kevin brady
an ena scheduler
uses an enovate and emw llc id to do nominations for those companies
enovate is paying the invoices for those companies
can we cancel this id
or should we just tell peoples we are not going to pay the invoice and let them terminate the id at their discretion
will not paying the ena invoice impact emw llc or enovate in any way
prepay amount for tomorrow is $0,0.0
thanks team

recommendation for ena pools 0st choice terminate pools and producer contracts on 0/0/0
no cash flow and everything is pre-petition
0nd choice terminate pools and producer contracts on 0/0/0 and deal with one month's cash flow 0rd choice terminate pools as soon as possible to eliminate the administrative effort involved
i've been trying to determine the ees imbalances on dominion and i'm not having much luck
dominion gave me the ena balances over the phone
when i called back a day later to get the ees balances
i was told to submit a written request to bill saviers
dominion's in house counsel
i have not done that
i would prefer that dominion provide us a written document stating what the pool balances are as of 0/0/0 and 0/0/0
based on the pool balances below
i would recommend terminating the ena pools effective 0/0/0 assuming the following
0
producer payments for oct and nov have not been made and go into the pre-petition bucket
0
ena owes dominion gas which is also pre-petition
0
the producers will be able to reallocate their gas for december forward to another marketer's pool
items to consider if we terminate the pools on 0/0/0 or later
ena will need to sell the imbalance gas and pay the producers
dominion will need to provide ena a method to do this if the pools are terminated
i would recommend paying the producers after we collect the money for selling the imbalance gas and after we pay dominion any gathering/transporting charges associated with those balances
the volumes are small so ena will not see much economic benefit from this process
also
the administrative effort involved is very very high due to the small volumes per producer
dominion will prefer to cancel the pools with a 0 or positive imbalance
on 0/0/0
ena will still have a negative cumulative imbalance
most of the producers have not been paid for oct or nov 0 activity
i assume that since those dollars go into a pre-petition bucket that we should not terminate any producer contracts before 0/0/0
0/0/0 per vickie coen at dominion ena pool balances as of gath north 0,0 0,0 tran north 0 0 gath south
0,0
0,0 tran south 0,0 0,0 dominion if prices
ok

elizabeth hernandez is currently working as a contract employee for sherry thomas

i have a bill from cingular wireless in my ipayit account

you and patricia can decide if you want to come
thanks
shemin
just give me a call when you are ready
i'll let wade know and we will come to your office
cool
actually
could you or kathryn send shemin 0 dominion producer contracts
just any 0 will do
she just wants to get a feel for what these contracts look like
it's the first day of school in houston and the teacher thought she'd get to know the kids by asking them their name and what their father does for a living
the first little girl says
my name is mary and my daddy is a postman
the next little boy says
i'm andy and my dad is a mechanic
then one little boy says
my name is jimmy and my father is a striptease dancer in a cabaret for gay men
the teacher gasps and quickly changes the subject
but later in the school yard the teacher approaches jimmy privately and asks if it was really true that his dad dances nude in a gay bar he blushed and said
i'm sorry but my dad is an 0
auditor for arthur andersen or 0
a trader for enron and i was just too embarrassed to say so
you may or may not be able to do anything about this but i've requested access to several different desk in sitara and the people that approve these items all work for ubs
now i'm trying to pull up a deal that was on the central desk
i thought
and its showing up as a west desk ticket and i can't access it
i thought i was the one that entered it in sitara
sitara deal #0 is an example
can you help get me access
i never know what contract the deal is under but i can confirm the price and the volumes for the following
deal counterparty comment 0 sequent energy management
lp approved 0 anadarko energy services company approved 0 midamerican energy company approved 0 midamerican energy company changed price from $0.0 to $0.0 in sitara per notes from sylvia pollan
0 midamerican energy company approved 0 city of tallahassee this should be on deal #0
part of the long term contract
i don't have access to view the other deals but i'm working on it
i believe i entered the other 0 anadarko deals in sitara but either i put them on the wrong desk or they were moved after i entered them because i don't have access to them either
grrrr
scott
margaret
i changed the price on deal 0
feb 0 activity
from $0.0 to $0.0
we prepaid midamerican $0,0,0.0 for all 0 deals shown above
not sure who to tell about sitara changes
just wade and i chatting with shemin
we tried calling dominion's bankruptcy counsel
outside counsel
which is seperate
and in house counsel and couldn't get anyone
i believe shemin has a much better idea though
but
i think its important to note that those producer agreements are enfolio contracts
sure
i have one gas purchase that i make right before 0:0 am every morning but i can be there at 0:0 am or later
i have an event that i need to attend tomorrow afternoon so i will be taking the half a day off starting at lunchtime

make sure you copy magaret dhont and rita wynne on this
the cia had an opening for an assassin
after all of the background checks
interviews
and testing were done there were three finalists
0 men and a woman
for the final test
the cia agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun
we must know that you will follow your instructions
no matter what the circumstances
inside of this room
you will find your wife sitting in a chair
kill her
the man said
you can't be serious
i could never shoot my wife
the agent said
then you are not the right man for this job
the second man was given the same instructions
he took the gun and went into the room
all was quiet for about 0 minutes
then the man came out with tears in his eyes
i tried
but i can't kill my wife
the agent said
you don't have what it takes
take your wife and go home
finally
it was the woman's turn
she was given the same instructions
to kill her husband
she took the gun and went into the room
shots were heard
one shot after another
they heard screaming
crashing
banging on the walls
after a few minutes
all was quiet
the door opened slowly and there stood the woman
she wiped the sweat from her brow and said
this gun was loaded with blanks
i had to beat him to death with the chair
moral
women are evil
don't mess with them
prepay for dominion for april 0 to be made on friday
march 0th
i printed out the attached form and gave it to doug sewell
i just deleted something you emailed me on march 0th or 0st
i think it might have been related to columbia gas but i'm not sure
prepayment and gas flow activity through monday march 0th
i have added 0 new members to the team
welcome melissa and sheeley
feel free to hit jim taylor up for a free lunch
hey
do you mind if i send her an email with all the stuff attached
you are my hero
i took the test and this is what it said
colors green blue yello purple red black white orange you are a very sensitive person and you try hard
perhaps a little too hard
to make favourable impressions and to be recognised by your peers
but you have that inherent need to feel appreciated and admired and you are easily hurt if all of your endeavours go by unappreciated or not acknowledged
stop trying so hard
you are very talented
imaginative and sensitive but you are holding back as you do not really like going it
on your own
in preference you would like to team up with someone
someone with similar attributes as your own
to explore
to seek out and go perhaps
where no other man has trod before
it is the unusual that attracts you and which will give you a sense of excitement and adventure
everything seems to have gone wrong and the situation at this time is such that you are not quite sure which way to turn
so it would appear that you are
holding back
re-consolidating your position and relinquishing all fun and games for the time being
you are holding back
you need to find friends in whom you can trust and once they have proved themselves beyond all possible doubt you will be prepared to give them your all
the existing situation is not of your liking
you have an unsatisfied need for mental stimulation with others whose standards are as high as your own
trying to control your instincts the way you do restricts your ability to open up to others and the way you feel at this time is suggestive of
total surrender
this is not to your liking as you consider such thoughts as weaknesses that need to be overcome
you feel that only by control
controlling your innermost thoughts
are you able to maintain your air of superiority
you want to be admired for yourself alone and not for what you can do or for what you may have done
in essence
you need to be needed
and at the same time
you need to need
you need to be respected as an exceptional individual
this is the only way that you can hope to achieve the status that you wish to achieve
you set yourself very high standards
and come what may
you abide by them
don't date or hook yourself up with a hussy
just remember
no woman deserves you and they should all thank their lucky stars that you even ackknowledge them
i mean susan
i assume you are talking about susan pereira
fyi
ena has
or had
about 0,0 of primary receipts at venice
i'm not sure

i have changed the
est cash flow
tab in the tallahassee swing cash flow file
i still don't have access to west
deal 0
i'm almost positive i entered this deal and i thought i entered it as a central desk deal
when i book my deals on trunkline for april
should i use central
we will be serving the midland cogeneration deal #0 for april
i also didn't request access for ena upstream but kathy kelly should be able to take care of that
barbara was going to tell you that i called
i'm going to get my morning diet coke and i would like to see the name that lady gave us last night that might have some daycare info

dominion oklahoma texas exploration

successor to louis dreyfus natural gas corp
is supplying ena 0,0 dth per day at a florida zone 0
this supply is matched up with ena's sale to the city of tallahassee
i believe both deals go through march 0
i prepay dominion for the supply each month
this morning
i had a voicemail from my contact at dominion
david walker

conference room ecs0 at 0:0 pm
louis dicarlo said you should chat with sara shackleton about the dominion isda agreement
but you may already be doing that
done with these
is there another list
i can't remember
you are my hero
i am going to have a 0 day backup plan just in case dominion doesn't deliver any gas
will do
thanks for the info
looks good to me
first word of second para
ever or even
i asked kay mann about that and she said that if we want the gas for april then we should continue with
business as normal
which means we pay for the whole month since that is what we've been doing
she felt that paying for the whole month was better than paying for just 0 days worth of gas
ed
i gave this info to doug before he went to the cash meeting
this was just in case you had the same question
i wonder if hr changed this holiday schedule over the last couple of months
let's ask kathy
she will know
should i cancel the wire that is scheduled to go out today
it might be too late but i can check
i want to cancel the wire to dominion oklahoma that was set to go out today and i'm going to revise the $0,0.0 wire to reliant
the other wires to reliant
the $0,0.0 and the $0,0.0
are good to go
i will have this completed before lunch but i estimate that the $0,0.0 wire to reliant will be revised to approximatly $0,0.0
this net impact is an increase in cash outflows of $0,0.0
cancel the $0,0 and increase the $0,0to $0,0
these are all the people i have been working with lately
thanks
you too
fyi
i can do it but i need to see the invoices in questions
lee ann
should we be updating sitara with this info or do we just need to tell you
scott
i know last month kim olinger was running sitara reports for
flash
maybe and trying to correct a few things
i'm not sure what the process is now
should we continue updating sitara for transport items
by the way team
scott is out till next week
what is our dominion status
you are a stud
i'm loooooking
i'm just glad you are working today
makes me feel good
hey woman
how are things going
happy with the job

something happened to my woman and she has a really big stomach
would you see if we sent out invoices our if someone at enron requested that no invoices be sent out
thanks
it looks like cornerstone propane
l.p
has not paid their december invoice for physical or financial
is there anything going on with them that you guys are aware of
ena has an approximate cash balance of $0,0 with reliant after purchasing the 0,0 dth for tomorrow
melissa verifed receipt of the $0.0 million wire made last thursday
thanks melissa
let me know if anyone has questions
i'm not actively seeking another job and i believe i'll be here to collect that pot of gold next year
but
i still need a backup for the gas activity
unless you tell me to do something different
i'm going to see if kathy kelly wants to back me up
i sold 0,0 dth per day of florida zone 0 gas at $0.0 to bob crites
0-0-0
at el paso effective 0/0/0
0/0/0
i'm leaving this deal out of sitara because its an enron compressor services deal
not ena
kay
i need to send a gisb agreement as enron compressor services to el paso
would you work on that
mark
i'm not sure who at enron to notify about this deal
you and i can chat about that later
i only asked for 0 bids for the april gas
reliant showed me a bid of $0.0 and el paso shoed me a bid of $0.0
i'll check on it

just a quick note on the information i've sent you
the following two lines deal with the activity i've been involved in since dec 0
0
some of my coworkers have said i should leave these lines out
what do you think
buy and sale gas for the enron estate team
provide commercial evaluations on post-petition deals to legal counsel
also
i sit right in the middle of the pack so it is a little awkward to talk if everyone is here like they were yesterday
thanks
i walked to the park yesterday and didn't see you
it was such a bummer
today is eirc's last day
sniff sniff
it was good seeing you
take care
hey buddy
please include kathy on you distribution in the future
thanks
i don't know if i should call this the ponderosa pine plant
the cleburne plant
or what
think i'll refer to it as cleburne
sabra
joe parks told me that you handling lone start in the future
i sold 0,0 dth to txu for tomorrow
i believe we have sold txu 0,0 dth everyday this month so far
lyn at txu asked me if the gas was at the same point for tomorrow and i told her
sure
and i have no idea what points our gas is coming from
i don't know how much time we need to spend on this
but
i have not put anything in sitara and i don't know if i should
i believe theresa voss's
on 0 in enron center south
group is handling the accounting for this and i don't know what they need
i'm going to try and meet her today
sabra
are you handling this
let me know
if you are
do you want/need/care if this is in sitara and unify
i believe all of the activity for this deal flowed through ena before bankruptcy
now
i believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ena a fee
joe made it very clear that ena is not supposed to send out an invoice
joe went to work for bridgeline yesterday
when she refinances
will your name be taken off the loan on the house
our current cash balance after purchasing gas for the 0th is $0,0
i've requested a prepayment of $0,0 to be wired tomorrow afternoon
have a good day
the prepay to reliant for thur april 0th is $0,0
i left the cash request on doug's desk
you are my hero buddy
and you think i should get married
fyi while everyone else has been stressed out about work
i've been focused
very stressed out
with more personal issues
every time i ask for some kind of sign
someone comes along and tells me i should get married
take care and best of luck to you and the family
fyi
mcv swing activity on trunkline
not anr
monday
march 0th was the last conversation we had with mcv regarding this swing gas
i just spoke with theresa vos
she handles the accounting for these deals and she said they have to do everything outside the system because ena is not collecting the slaes revenue or making the payments to the suppliers
joe was very concerned about putting deals in sitara because he was afraid that we might double bill txu
there is also a problem with the feb activity because txu recorded all the activity as ena activity instead of ponderosa pine activity
it also appears that txu withholds payments for the smallest indiscretions in the billing too
we can chat about that next week
sabra
do you know what points apache/cinergy and williams is giving us the gas at
i'd like to see that if possible
thanks i'm taking off friday

approval
people are out of the office but we have a large cash balance and it shouldn't be a problem if it gets delayed untill monday

thanks let me know if you see any other missing items too
judy is going to send you an email
i don't know what they changed to
who and where are they located
i think it needs to be pathed in unify
here's the problem
i created a sales deal ticket and kim and i didn't know if the supply just needed to come from imbalance or if i needed to create a one sided exchange ticket
i have no idea how the ontario desk handled it in the past
they probably were not consistent any
would you path this
just take you best shot on how to do it
i think we are going to have quite a few things like this
i'm trying to figure out how to put in a sales deal ticket for jan 0 on montanna power which is in the west
i just created deal 0 per the notes in o:/gas structuring/bankruptcy/storage inventory/daily inventory update.xls
an ena sale to pancanadian energy services inc with the following details
price
$0.0 volume
0,0,0 location
mpc/dry creek storage/0-0-0 rita
there is a storage contract 0 in unify for mpc
i assume this is the contract that needs to be pathed in unify to withdraw the storage gas
do you get any statements from mpc
i'll copy you
but it is ponderosa sending out the bills correct

hi jon
we just spoke on the phone and i work with ruth concannon and maria garza on the enron estate team
i'm trying to calculate the demand charge on the following capacity release offer #0 released to enserco term 0/0/0 to 0/0/0 demand rate $0.0 please call me when you get a chance at 0-0-0
priscilla said mid american just called her and said they won't pay us until they receive an invoice
have you pathed this yet
let me know
leon payne
ingrid's boss at transco is resigning for personal reasons
that kind of came as a surprise to everyone over there
they supposedly have a reorg thing going on over there too
don't know if that's it or not
the lease at the tower is up
next year
i think
the new ceo said staying in the tower is their first choice but they want to lease 0 floors instead of 0
if that doesn't work
then they may move west to beltway 0 somewhere
fyi
melissa verified our payment on friday so that makes our estimated current cash balance is $0,0.0 after purchasing gas for tomorrow
jon asked some lady to call me back and she didn't know either
at first she did it the way you show it on your worksheet
then when i told her that normal demand charges
a 0 year deal at max for example
are the same each month regardless of how many days there are in the month she got confused
i guess we will find out when we get the invoice
0 vacation rollover from 0 0 hours 0 credit 0 hours disc holiday 0 hours total 0 hours = 0 days vacation days 0 beginning balance 0 hours disc holiday mon 0/0/0 0 hours fri 0/0/0 0 hours fri 0/0/0 0 hours fri 0/0/0 0 hours tue 0/0/0 0 hours fri 0/0/0 0 hours total 0 hours remaining = 0.0 day

our current cash balance is $0,0.0 and we are moving back to the old building today so i've decided to wait until friday to send a wire
thanks
no wire for tomorrow since we are moving
we will do a cash request tomorrow and send out a wire on friday
we are still meeting for beverages this evening around 0ish
correct
i didn't call to check on this but i've never seen an email like this from cgas
i just thought it was interesting
we knew we were moving yesterday but we though we would have our systems availabe till after lunch
i was wrong
we were working at 0:0
i stood up for something and the movers took my chair
we had just lost our phones at that time too
hey what does xoxo mean
i am requesting a prepayment of $0,0 to be paid to reliant for friday april 0th
priscilla
let me know when you have the wire ready and i'll come get it or you can leave it on my desk at ecn0c
doug
are you still on 0 in the new building
not unless ees had some tco storage we were not aware of
they would be doing something with 0,0 if they were fooling with our stuff
yes i did
friday april 0th
well their we go
i've made my 0

mistake for the year and i'm all out
nothin
but perfection from now on
i just got a call from kevin hyatt
director of marketing at tw
he said that sempra just called him and wanted to know why we locked the points on the contract in our posting
i told him we locked them because we didn't want to get billed a potentially higher rate
0
this guy acted like he knew me and of course i was embarrassed so i acted like i knew him
and i don't ever remember talking to this guy
he knew that i had gone to ees and that was back in 0-0
0
sempra told kevin that we would get more value if we let someone change the points
i wonder
even though we might get billed max rate
would it be possible to allow the replacement shipper to change the points for
the term of the release only and the releasing shipper would be billed more that max rate
and that way the capacity would go back to its original contract points in october
just a thought
i think i have access to everything now
thanks

kathy
we have a deal on trunkline where midland can request up to an additional 0,0 per day and it could be just 0 day over the weekend too
reliant has storage that can flow into trunkline wla
we don't have a pricing mechanism in place so its pretty much automatic and reliant can bill us whatever they want
if it ever happens on the weekend
jim and i will discuss the pricing the following monday
its only happened once in the last 0 months but you never know
especially if it happens on the weekend
if i remember correctly
midland would call kevin and kevin would call reliant
are we sill set up that way
these are funny
i thought it might be enron photos at first
good morning
i love taking fridays off
i see kathy sold 0,0 dth for the weekend
let me know what you want to sell for tomorrow
if i don't hear from you by 0:0 am c.t

the iroq tariff allows them to charge up to 0% fuel

0% for zone 0 to zone 0 but i didn't read that in the tariff

i told ed that i would go with bridgeline's number because 0
it is more conservative 0
the difference is small 0
that some trader may not have put in a deal or volume management didn't path the deals correctly
anything is possible with the turnover we have had
if you have reconciled the numbers and know where the difference is let me know
thanks
this is what i expect to be paid out next tuesday i'm buying all the baseload gas from reliant i will probably pay nx0 +
0 or so for the tallahassee gas because i'm buying point specific gas and nx0 flat to
0 for the trunkline
i would prefer to be conservative so bump the prices up as you see fit
i wonder if that bigger volume is a gigajoule thing
take me with you where ever you go
you de man
do you have sabra's cell number
filled internally with some guy whose name i can't remember
it was a southeast orig spot
i went to lunch with jim taylor and malory

margaret
for some reason my cash request form has susan helton's name on it and she has to sigh the wire i think
why wouldn't that be you instead
germany
chris
susan just called me and said she is the cao for ena and she should be the one to sign off on the wire requests
i didn't know
yesterday david drapper
sits a few rows over from us and works for ees
asked me what the status was with the dominion producers
i told him we were still waiting for dominion to call us back
he said that sean holmes told them to
just pay the producers
i told david that i wouldn't do anything without knowing what ruth and legal are doing
sounds like a little tendency to
split up
just like the old days
thanks
do my prepays to reliant for gas fall under your exception comment below even though they are not same day payments
i can prepare my weekly cash request for swing gas with 0 days notice

i actually prefer to see the price in print the day after nymex rolls off
i will also be hounding you several times next tuesday afternoon just to make sure these payments go out on time
i am requesting a prepayment of $0,0 to be paid to reliant for monday april 0th

chris says
now that sucks tell me about it
how's things with you
germany
chris says
doing well
last week i was bored with nothing to do
this week its like a tidal wave
bam
germany
chris says
home life is ok
baby is due may 0th and i get 0 days off to go fishing germany
chris says
you better not go fishing
you'll be in the doghouse big time
germany
chris says
you mite be rite about that
are you still involved in a church
germany
chris says
she's going to try and breast feed so i don't have to do anything alexa
i just joined a baptist church and were baptised sun night germany
chris says
i'm going to st luke methodist on westheimer and edloe these days germany
chris says
cool
germany
chris says
i like baptist jeff moved out sun and he filed for a divorce a couple of weeks ago germany
chris says
oh no
i'm sorry we're going to mim's i love and it and so does lexi it's ok
a big burden has been lifted off of me and lexi germany
chris says
are you doing ok
yes he was very controlling and demanding germany
chris says
most of us guys are and he didn't like alexa germany
chris says
i'm sorry
did you ever get married
germany
chris says
nope
i gave her a ring but we are going to wait and see how things work out after the baby comes
statistics show that that method doesn't lead to sucessful marriages very often that's probably a good idea
you can probably relate to why i didn't marry brian now right
germany
chris says
but we will see
germany
chris says
yeah but its a litte different
i still think its pretty much my fault
what you and i went through and what ingrid and i are going through
in you situation i could see where brian was a major problem i knew i didn't love him and i knew that that would not make a loving envirnoment to raise a child
germany
chris says
yep
that's what we are gong thru
germany
chris says
so are you going to stay way up north
well
just know that if you ever need someone to talk to just let me know
i'm staying there for now
going to hang out and see what happens here

i can start looking for a job
not limited to just looking in houston any more don't really want to go anywhere else right now but who know's what life will bring
germany
chris says
yep
may be time to consider richmond
va it snows there
i don't think i could handle that
or i don't want to have to handle it
germany
chris says
that's true
guess you've had your fill of snow
i just can't handle the cold after being down here so long
germany
chris says
hey
maybe you could go to fpl in florida
close to disney and beaches with my retention
assuming we get the $$$
i might pay off bills and then get a job as a greeter at the wal-mart in conroe
are you in the retention pool
germany
chris says
wooohooo
you must have a good retention
germany
chris says
i'm in the lipp pool
i think that's what they call it
do you think we'll see the $$$
germany
chris says
you will for sure
don't know about mine though
germany
chris says
mine gets real nice if we collect $0bill
don't know if we are going to collect that
the lipp pool sounds a whole lot more

hey
i normally talk bad about you but lately i've been bragging because of your good notes on ponderosa pines
but i'm going to try and keep it down to minimum
one day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well
the animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do
finally he decided the animal was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway
it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey
he invited all his neighbors to come over and help him
they all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well
at first
the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly
then
to everyone's amazement
he quieted down
a few shovel loads later
the farmer finally looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw
with every shovel of dirt that hit his back
the donkey was doing something amazing
he would shake it off and take a step up
as the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal
he would shake it off and take a step up
pretty soon
everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and trotted off
now
the moral of the story
life is going to shovel dirt on you
all kinds of dirt
the trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up
each of our troubles is a stepping stone
we can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping
never giving up
shake it off and take a step up
remember the five simple rules to be happy
0
free your heart from hatred
0
free your mind from worries
0
live simply
0
give more
0
expect less
p.s
the donkey later came back and kicked the shit out of the bastard that tried burying him
moral
when you try to cover your ass
it always comes back to get you
i also have imbalance statements that i have received in the mail that i will be sending to theresa
i would bump up the cash payment to reliant for next week
i'm estimating $0,0.0
i do expect it to come down some
reliant should receive a payment of $0,0.0 today which will give us a cash balance of $0,0.0
have a good weekend
nosir
you are the man working on this freaky pipe
i'm good for $0
the name sounds familiar but i don't know this guy
he's over scheduling at el paso

thanks shelley
our current cash balance with reliant is $0,0.0
i was just looking at the confirm for april and i believe the pricing doesn't match up
let me know if you have any questions
thanks
i'm forcasting $0,0.0 to be paid to reliant this friday for the tallahassee deal
for gas day 0/0/0
cinergy/apache moved 0,0 dth from sid rich cayanosa to oasis mi vida
oasis mi vida is not a lone star point but i didn't know it at the time and i sold the gas to txu at $0.0
no sales were made for 0/0/0
thanks

since you are becoming a law guru you might know the answer to this question

el paso and reliant don't have time to talk about right now but i'm also having a problem telling them about the deal because there are too many unknowns
it's not the same as selling parked gas on sonat
still working it though
is my buddy robert allwein working with you
if so give him a big kiss and a hug from me
i don't think the triggers are correct
ed
this brings up a good question that may already be addressed
both of the midland deals still show up in the trading system
should they be terminated effective 0/0/0
one of the midland deals
mcv 0
deals #0 and 0
was put in sitara with triggers
we stopped serving mcv 0 effective 0/0/0
these triggers will continue to create an invoice each month unless we change the deal in sitara
beth
donna
welcome to the party
wade
i don't know how to handle these deals in sitara or tagg but i bet someone on this distribution does
0
does anyone have any idea on how to stop deals 0 and 0 from creating an invoice each month
0
there are deal volumes in sitara for the east
central and west desk
should these volumes be zeroed out or should we just focus on keeping tagg updated and not worry about sitara
maybe someone is working on the sitara deal volumes

bryant baker at bridgeline is asking me to approve this deal so bridgeline can bill ena for the storage service
normally i wouldn't worry about it but since we are in negotiations with bridgeline i'm not sure what to do
is a confirm generated if i approve this ticket
also
when does this deal terminate in the global contracts system
woooooooooohoooooooooooooooo
daddy's getting a new blue wave bay boat
wooohoooo
ena and bridgeline use the same trading/accounting system
sitara and unify
in the good ol
days
the traders would enter the deals in sitara
which includes volume and pricing terms
accounting would use unify to track the volumes and bill and pay our counter parties
unify gets the pricing information from sitara
bryant baker at bridgeline is asking me to approve sitara deal #0
this deal shows bridgeline storage company as the seller of storage service and enron north american as the buyer
the demand charge on this deal is $0,0.0
bridgeline needs someone at ena to approve this ticket so the bridgeline system will be able to generate and invoice
would this have any impact on our bridgeline negotiations or our legal rights if i approve this ticket
according to cyndie in global contracts
this will not create a confirmation
with a heavy hand i write this message to the aquila merchant services people
as bob mentioned in his earlier message we must now reduce our wholesale group to reflect that we
ila
do not have the credit capacity to continue to support the needs of the business
starting today we will begin to wind down our commodity services and capitalservices groups
both in north america and in europe
with the goal of being significantly out of all commercial operations by the end of the summer
later today we will take the first step to reduce the headcount of the organization
for many of our fellow workers today will be the last day at aquila
for those not released today
we will need to
as carefully and responsibly as possible
put our beloved company to bed
at the end of this process
the remaining employees
as is true with me
will be let go
no one is to blame
it is just an unfortunate reality we have found ourselves in
and we are left with this ugly choice
please try to hold your head up
we have built a great company of talented
motivated
creative
and dedicated people
hold on to your integrity
respect yourself and each other
and remember what a team we have had

in the past someone at bridgeline would call someone at ena or vice versa to approve the deal ticket so that the deal terms would populate the accounting system
note
this would only happen with brigdeline because it is and enron affiliate and because we are using the same trading systems
approving this ticket will give bridgeline the ability to bill ena
i think there might be another way to do this without someone at ena approving a ticket
i'll see what i can do
i'm keeping this file here ==> o:/gas structuring/bankruptcy folder/transportation/appalachain producers
hi team
here is my new cell phone number

i cannnot make an upward eye roll
and i can't help if my eyes look beady all the time
hey

i hope things are going well with you
the pipeline is the place to be these days
i appreciate the emails of the imbalance statement

i'm going to send you questions as i come accross them
in file appalpay0.xls on tab cgasvol there are 0 meters with volumes that are not on my master file list

i missing the following from gatherco0 meter vol
let me know if this works
ed
per our discussion
an assistant from shemin proctor's houston office is coming over tomorrow to help print contracts from live-link
she will be over around 0 am
i am going to log into julie gomez's computer with my id
let me know if you have any comments
concerns
thanks
she is going to print all the appalachian producer contracts that she can pull up out of live-link from my master list
i also asked melissa if she could help and she said she would be glad too
let me know if that's ok
judy gave me these names of people that were cut
keith taylor ken nelson
i don't know him brenda crockett
judy's old roomate when she first moved to houston and i know that jim barker was let go
he was from ees
he just went over in oct of last year i think
if the counterpart is in cash disbursements then yes
if its an accountant in an operational area then they should know what its for
i would just call oxy and ask them
there's no sneaky stuff anymore and its not like we would send them their money back either
you might like to get this
good luck
when is comes to daycares
it probably good to look at quite a few to have a sense of what's out there
another place you could look is st
andrews presb
at buffalo speedway and bissonet
when i looked at that place it was for a three year old and it appeared very nurturing
it is or was an accredited facility
barbe
robin says
that facility really didn't have much of an academic program
at this age it doesn't matter but i nicer to have them in an environment that fits all needs now and later
it better not to move kids alot
barbe
robin says
the lonestar pigging is tomorrow and i told kevin if something happens this afternoon to get with you

andrew
nice to hear from you
hope all is well in the uk
the millenium came and went and i think i had a good time
i understand mh has formally resigned his position at ml
good for him
that is a shit business with no future
the broker is the buggy whip of the financial services industry
i have another friend moving to london soon so i have another reason to visit
i have to run but i'll keep in touch
take care
chris
kramer
how are things going
we are thinking of coming to sf on a golf
party trip sometime in the next few months
things in calgary are relatively unchanged
no chicks
work is going great
cowan and i are trading alberta and having a great time
poker and buying electronics have become the hobbies of choice around here
i am terrible at poker but good at buying electronics
take it easy and w/b
kramer
cowan is trading alberta cash and i'm trading the front of the curve
lavo still trades the term in alberta but is never around
as for benny
after an unfortunate incident at september's craw fish boil
he has moved to houston to trade power
no shit
drop me a line with a number where you can be reached
i have an idea
like everyone else in the world
for an internet start up and want to pick your brain about the process of doing a business plan
getting vc $'s and such
i don't know if you know much about that stuff but your thoughts would be greatly appreciated
i have a friend in the internet group at goldman sach's and i've talked to him about it but i want insight from someone inside the industry
there is a revolution going on and i think i am the only one not getting rich off of it
check out enron stock
ene
we announced an alliance with sun microsystems to build a bandwidth network and the stock has doubled in a month
not bad for a small texas pipeline company
you would need a sand blaster to get the smile off of lavorato's face
however i don't think i'm going to retire on my enron options any time soon
gotta hop
ps you should send wilson a bigwords t-shirt
the jannon's would do the logo justice
hi andrew
how are things in london
i am talking to mh right now and he says you are getting a little tired of school
i don't blame you one bit
i need a vacation
i bet you do to
what do you say to a little amsterdam trip in april
i think we deserve it
what do you think of mh changing companies
i think he should get out of that business altogether
he will hate nb just as much as ml inside 0 months
take care
chris
dianne
there doesn't seem to be a new march aeco product set up

chris
brad

chris
not having to add products
ie
hub cash
to our composite pages everyday would be more convenient
mike
hope you found a great place to live
it is ridiculous how expensive flats are in london
thank god your making pounds now
tahoe was too much traveling for that short of a stay
good weather
good friends
beautiful scenery
all right snowboarding
shitty food
cheesy casinos and too much time in fucking airports
that about summarizes the weekend
laird is doing fine
things have been relatively slow and the market is very choppy
i've been pretty quiet
no major axes to grind
just trying to look for the next big trade and keep from getting my head ripped off on eol
you have to go out for middle eastern food
go to the lebanese restaurant
i think it is on oxford street but i'll find out for sure
also try ranoush juice for a falafel
good luck and keep in touch

the last couple of days the april basis market on our morning sheet has been the financial curve rather than the physical

my model breaks out the positions by every type of risk profile
we need to produce a report from the intra-month book that we can use to tie out
if that doesn't exist we should talk systems about creating it
hopefully this will prevent any future blow ups
chris
how goes day #0 in to
did you get everything straightened out with the movers
it is pouring rain and 0 celcius here
keep it real
chris
could you teach my brother how to use his e-mail

dusting off my cowboy hat and going stampeding tomorrow
i'll try to give you a call tonight or on the weekend
say hi to mh and wilson and charlene
chris

i don't know anything about any sunglasses
just kidding
i was wearing them all weekend
chris
no
i'll bring them by your office this afternoon
i was just kidding
how desperately do you need them
tonight i will be around in the evening
if you are lucky i might even buy you a cup of coffee
i am 0% going to the rodeo on thursday
it is the enron customer party that day
as for nashville north i don't know if we are going there or somewhere else after
i am a huge bed wetter when it comes to drinking on school nights
i likely won't be going out again until friday or saturday
am i going to get an eye infection if i continue to wear your sunglasses around town
i hope not
chicks dig me in those glasses
just laird
blair
perry
tony and a couple of guys around here
is that a problem
you are paranoid
lavorato never let his people put their titles on business cards until they became managers
it doesn't really matter
i never really understood why he cared
i think they look more professional with titles
you should ask jan
chris
how is your wounded eye
when i think of sunnies i think of those little glasses you wear in tanning beds
your sunglasses are fine
i wore them while i was hangin
around the house last night
my neighbors think i am a total freak
maybe it wasn't the sunglasses but the
sweatin
to the oldies
i was blaring on my stereo all night
i think richard simmons is a totally misunderstood genius
i am so bored
i'm going to the rodeo this afternoon so that should be good
better get back to doing nothing
perhaps
i do not suck at writing e-mails
you just can't appreciate the sense of humor one develops in my line of work
it's borderline madness
i should be home all night but do call first in case i'm outside working in the garden
today my head hurts
i don't know where our seats at the rodeo are
yesterday they were at the north end of the infield but i have no idea where they are for tommorow
a word to the wise
avoid the draft beer at the rodeo
i contains rat poison
how are things going
learning lots
went to the rodeo and then to nashville north yesterday so feeling a little fuzzy today
i'm not doing anything today but tommorow i am going to the rodeo and then to a big industry party so that should be good for a headache
friday i'm going to the chick wagon party and saturday to nashville north with the boys
weather has been good and looks like that will continue
did you find a gym yet
chris
the have mike's hard and stuff like that
i generally never go out during the week
i was home by 0pm yesterday but i am an enormous baby when it comes to hangovers
i'm not going to the rodeo on friday but i am going to the chucks that night
tonight i rest
that's fine
i'll be home all night
i was wondering why i wasn't getting any mail
could you please send me that stuff through intercompany mail
i need to pay that insurance bill soon
if they can't straighten it out i'll send you your mail a couple times a week through inter-company mail
peace out
i thought you would like that
we've been working the homeboy language in the broker market all week
you diss'n me
i'll bust a cap in your ass
and you are moching me for peace out
go buy independence day on dvd
how's it going
hear you are working pretty crazy hours
went to nn with the boys on saturday and played golf in kananaskis yesterday so all in all a good weekend
i have a post stampede cold so i won't be doing much other than work and sleep for a few days
take it easy and write back when you get a minute
chris
how was your final stampede weekend
i have a cold so i layed pretty low this weekend
did your friend have a good time
that was not a snub
i was being sneaky
i can't just sit here and write e-mails all day
i'm a busy man
i did not mean to offend you
i had smoozing to do and didn't want to neglect our customers
today i'm leaving by 0
usually by 0:0-0
et vous
dawn
how long does it usually take blue cross to refund $ for the flexible spending account
i sent in a claim form a month ago and haven't seen anything yet
the reason i'm concerned is that when my brother moved he did a change of address and my mail has been screwed up ever since
chris
do you have any plans for july 0th
if not
would you like to come to ryan's stag
you could play golf with darryl brown
ryan's dad and their friend dave
i think those guys are going to play golf and then come to dinner afterwards

chris
sorry i haven't responded
i left early yesterday and have been big time busy today
i am still pretty sick
i'll write back soon
rod

i will be playing on saturday and i am going to get either mike or brad to join us if that is ok
chris

i am having a shitting week
sick and tired
i can't wait for the weekend
i am going to sleep and golf

there aren't many weekends left in the summer and that sucks
out of the weekends that are left i have two weddings and one stag

went to red deer this weekend and saw my parents
did you know my brother moved to toronto
i need to find a smaller place but for now i'm staying in kensington
that is all that is new in my life
we should hit a patio and have a drink one night
take it easy
chris
i cannot seem to suspend my product without hitting the red hand button

chris
mr
launer's tip for investors who don't have the time to do exhaustive research
look for companies such as enron and el paso whose stocks are trading at price-earnings multiples that are lower than their long-term growth rates
the one thing that scares me about enron is the p/e
regardless of earnings growth
our earnings growth has been so strong it is like a treadmill that keeps getting faster and faster
at some point you fall on your ass
that being said
i have never sold a share of enron stock or exercised an option
we always seem to find ways to reinvent ourselves and make money appear from nowhere
investment in enron should be treated with the same caution as investing in cisco or any other new economy stock that challenges traditional valuation methods
chris
five years out of any particular date
saturday was really fun
golf was great
mike and andrew's group was by far the drunkest foursome
dinner was good and then we went to the sutter club to play pool
that is when things got out of hand
we got ryan a bright yellow t-shirt with
nobody knows i'm a lesbian
written in big block letters
call me tonight and i'll give you all the gory details
my head still hurts
i will be able to attend milly's party
how was your holiday
you missed some beautiful weather
my best friend's stag was on saturday and i still feel like shit

from what i recall i had a good time though
tonight i am going to bed at 0pm
i can't wait
chris
dianne
do you have our index positions for september ready yet
chris
when you have them ready could you give me the reversals for this month please
chris
what questions
i accidentally deleted your e-mail from yesterday and don't remember any questions
i hadn't seen the jokes before but they were pretty funny
the sports ones were pretty good
the others were pretty tasteless
so they were my favorites
i feel much better today
i'm already getting psyched up for the weekend
i am going to play golf and not drink
i hate alcohol
i am on the wagon
for good this time
at least for a week anyway
chris
enron corp
up 0 0/0
the stag was a total monkey show
we played golf and pool
ate some dinner
took in the ballet and the hit the bars
i did manage to get a couple of rounds of golf in between all the drinking
i actually played pretty good
houseboating sounds like fun
i've never done that
i am so on the wagon
i can't express to you how little i'm going to drink this weekend
lots of golf
jay
i can't seem to add any new products to my customer page

chris
i have to run a bunch of errands today and pick up some decorations for my buddy's wedding this weekend so i can't go golfing
that sucks
it is so nice outside
maybe i'll work up the energy to go for a run later
probably not
i am such a lazy piece of shit lately
i am definately going to go running now
self depreciation has motivated me
i need to buy some rollerblades
where did you get yours
cowan says that k0 are really good and relatively inexpensive
any thoughts
maybe i'll look for rollerblades when i'm out this afternoon
you should be proud of me
i was able to stay out of the bottle all weekend

my friend's wedding is in ft
mac
that is why i'm going there on thursday

i don't have my drivers license yet
i start driver's training next week
that was very nice

chris
the wedding was great
too much fun
once again i'm hung over on a monday
no great stories except that i nearly wiped out while walking down the aisle
i tripped on a cord to a video camera
mildly embarrassing
my friend was a rock
i think i was more nervous than him
ft
mac is a total shit hole
on my tombstone it wil read
he went to ft

meg's cabin parties are generally epic gong shows
i need to rest up this week
i bought in-line pants at the gap yesterday
now if i get some rollerblades i'll have the official pants
i don't think you need to take your rollerblades in to get the wheels rotated every week
can't you do it yourself
i could probably even do it and i'm the most mechanically inept person in the world
chris

i need to know how much i have contributed to my rrsp through you this year so i can maximize my annual contributions before i go
can you figure this out and let me know
chris
i went to kelly blue book on the internet and they provide 0 values for used vehicles
a trade in value
what you might expect to get for a vehicle from a dealer on trade in
and a retail value
what you might expect to pay for a vehicle from a dealer
the following were the values it came up with for a jeep exactly like mine in montana
closest state
trade in
$0 usd
$0 cnd
retail
$0 usd
$0 cnd
the retail number seems way too high
i think something like $0 0 to $0 would be fair

i talked to keith holst who went through this process a couple of years ago and he said that a lady named janice priddy in houston set up the paperwork for him
chris
margaret
just wondering how my visa was coming along
i had a confusing conversation with jeanne in relocation services this morning
the way i understand the moving process is that my household goods have to leave canada at the same time or after i leave the country
she seemed to think that i had to go to the us and then return to canada before my goods could leave canada
can you shed some light on this
chris dorland
margaret
could you send the visa documents to my office
enron canada corp
calgary
ab t0p 0h0 chris dorland

what do you think of the canadian bank stocks
relative to their us counterparts they seem cheap
i know that the discount is due regulation

i don't know to be honest killarney
altadore
west hillhurst
close to downtown
i am thinking infill
townhouse
my mom has a friend who says there are nice brownstone townhomes in altadore
i am thinking of checking those out
i am looking for minimal maintenance
do you have any ideas
seen kerri murray lately
cd
lee clarke
sounds like a fag
garrison woods that is the place my mom was talking about
do you live near there
done
i'm moving in
can i borrow your lawn mower
i need to decide what i am going to do with my ride
i think i am going to bring it with me and buy a set of winter wheels and some killer winter tires
don't you have a tire guy
i already have a minature goat
i am a little concerned about making a housing decision in one day but what the fuck
i looked at the mls listings and there is some stuff on there
i have a realtor who seems to have her act together
don't worry about it
how long would it take me to get to work from there
0 songs
i can deal with that
now that i have a place to live all i need is a chica
i am going to a wedding in red deer next weekend and there should be plenty of available young ladies there
how is mike mcd
are you married yet
any kids on the way
thanx
i haven't done a trade in over an hour
i still see her now and then but she lives a rock star life and i don't have the stamina to go out 0 nights a week and get up at 0:0 for work
a little old for my taste as well
she is hot though
she looks exactly like mariah carey
it is great hanging out with her
it is amazing how much more interested other chicks are in a guy who hanging out with a bunch if hotties
her best friend does the social
buzz
show in houston's nbc station so she gets ticket and invites to every thing cool around town
so much for being bullish
congrats on the cfa

chris dorland
thank you
chris dorland houston
tx
coming to town thursday for the weekend and hopefully moving by the middle of september
spending friday house shopping
i think i am going to end up in your neck of the woods
seems like the best values are in that area
are we going to get some snow this winter
we need to find dorland a date
i am going to a wedding this weekend and there should be lots of single chicas there
i am really looking forward to being back in cow town
houston is painfull
later
fuck you
that's how we spell it in belgium
i was confused by your use of 0 spellings
did you like my austin power's reference
i know
that's how we do it in belgium
it's called a belgium dip
you are back in my good graces
try not to confuse the dumb fat kid
have you guys moved over to the wonderful world of boxes with enron canada yet
if you are bored try to find out what your tire guy thinks of dunlop winter sport m0 tires
is you tire guy also a wheel guy
i need some winter wheels as well
lexus is 0
not sure if i am going to buy 0
or 0
wheels for the winter
jackass
i was thinking of converting it to a hover vehicle
i might just sell the car and get you to drive me around all winter
for me it isn't about fulfillment or finding my life's purpose in my work
it's all about the $$$
work hard and retire early
cheers chris p.s
i am moving back to calgary in about a month
enron continues to feel free to move me around at will
i am actually really looking forward to it
glad to hear all is well
i meant to comment that i thought the people profiled in the article should pull their heads out of their self important asses
it isn't about finding the meaning of life at work
it is all about the $$$
work hard
make $$$
retire young
things with me are great
moving back to calgary in about a month which is a little sooner than i thought i would be going back but when opportunity knocks you gotta go
take care
i just heard from a mutual friend that kerrie murray got engaged recently
scratch that one off the list of possibles
jill
sorry about the brief first reply things have been a little busy
what is with people
that article
working long hours just for the sake of working long hours
i am pushing for a 0 day work week
why calgary
why not
i love calgary
actually the guy that ran our trading operation in calgary is getting married to an american who works in houston so he is moving to accommodate her career
this has left a hole in our canadian operation and my boss felt that i was just the cork to fill that hole
i think it is a promotion
besides
houston in the arm pit of the world
this city has few redeeming features
what it lacks in culture and sophistication it makes up for by its lack of clean air and any form of natural beauty
actually
it isn't that bad
houston has good restaurants
decent night life and the people are really friendly but given the choice i would much rather live in calgary
in this business odds are that i will find myself back here sooner than later so might as well enjoy canada while i can
kerrie got engaged
good for her
i have a cactus in my bathroom that is dying from lack of attention
i am not engaged
i was seeing someone for a while but she took a work assignment in venezuela
no big loss
too old for me anyway
0
glad to hear that you are enjoying you time in ny
i am going to have to visit some time
i know i say that every time we chat but i really would like to try to get down there before you move on to your next destination

can you work up some lease rates for 0 and 0 months
chris
mtv music awards thursday september 0th
hopefully we get another britney strip tease this year
listen to this shit
if i want to move my car back to canada i
enron
would have to pay $0 usd to move it plus 0.0% of kbb value in import duty plus 0% gst plus $0 excise tax plus about $0 in permits
looks like i am looking for a new car as well
we were talking about getting matching pt cruisers with cruisr0 and cruisr0 personalized plates
don't forget pink fuzzy dice and chain steering wheel and red interior lights
chicks are going to love it
i'm going to get a chick with a python wrapped around her painted on the side and get those tires that stick out 0 inches from the wheel wells with gold plated rims
sweet
the funny thing is that in some neighborhoods in houston
predominately latin
that would be a killer ride
lady with python on one side
star wars on the other
when i am back in calgary your whole desk is going to have listen to this shit all day over the box
i am going to go home an watch the austin power's movies over and over tonight
what does the kergan think of his jeep
i think i am going to get one of those
unless you have forgotten the kergan's where an acient people from the steps of russia who
for entertainment
tossed children in pits with wild dogs to fight for food
what doesn't he like about it
john
here is what i think my out of pocket costs of this move will be
movers
$0 cnd flight
$0 cnd october rent
$0 cnd i am already at $0 cnd and i haven't even got to the car or any incidental costs yet
chris
i'm not very excited to hang out with mikey all the time
see what johnny is up to and hit the benson and hedges menthol's
tricia
i have already spoken to the riv and canada customs
my car was manufactured in japan and thus would be subject to an import duty of 0.0%
the gst and excise and import costs
purchase price = 0 usd = 0 cnd duty on this amount = 0 gst on this amount = 0 excise tax = 0 plus costs to convert the speedometer and odometer to the metric system and label all safety systems with french language instructions
from riv
= approx
0 that brings us to $0 cnd plus the cost to actually transport it from houston to calgary
at least $0
total approximately $0 cnd
hardly seems like the best option
also
i called williams moving to find out what the cost was to move me down here last year
and the invoice just for the move of my household goods from calgary to houston was $0 usd
just off the top of my head my out of pocket costs will be
movers = $0 cnd
0 usd
flight = $0 cnd hotel = $0 cnd october rent = $0
i have a 0 year lease in houston that expires at the end of october
the total of the above is $0 0
no luck getting your lease calculator to work
actually
don't worry about it i have change my mind back to buying
do you have a number for msn customer service
i want to cancel my msn account but have no idea how to get in touch with them
chris
what if any changes were made to the grand cherokee limited for 0
that is great
we were just having a discussion about going to other floors to take a shit because our bathroom is such a dump
i think i'm going to buy a grand cherokee limited instead of the x0 and save myself 0k
are we on with johnny next week
i am going to banff for an off site
i will be back in town the following friday and we'll do it up that night
late night johnny is ok
we'll take it easy as it is a school night
glad you like the place
missed the ps on the first message
i sold my car
$0 usd but enron is going to pay me $0 usd for not having to move it and get it licensed in canada
so it cost me $0 to drive that car for a year
not bad i guess
have you and mom had any problems with her jeep
chris
my one year closed interest rate on my mortgage is 0.0%
not bad
kim
any luck getting this info
for me
chris
when i was 0 i was looking for an 0 year old girlfriend who looks exactly like britney spears
keep your eyes open
0 weeks till i am back in calgary
i can't wait
sold my car yesterday to a buddy of mine down here
i'm going to buy an grand cherokee limited like my mom's
black i think
what's new
i can't wait to get this move over and get settled in calgary
i am really excited to move into my new place
it is going to be sweet

chris
i just want to print this off
russell
can you e-mail me the

spread sheet
i want the eol technology
chris
kim
got the envelope yesterday
thank you very much
chris
anna
i am moving back to canada to trade gas but i would really like to get your daily technical sheet
could you e-mail it to me or perhaps start posting it on the commodity fundy's site
thanx chris
so much for keeping it quiet
dorland the loudmouth is back in town
looks ok except that it doesn't include the reimbursement for my car
chris
judi
did you receive a quote for williams yet
when i spoke with terri she said that $0 usd was a pretty good estimate for my move
chris
thanx looks good
what i was really looking for was the relationship between sumas and each of those points for the n-m and a-o strips
can you put these graphs together for me
sumas vs
rockies sumas vs
san juan sumas vs
rockies sumas vs
san juan chris 0-0-0
kim
i just wanted to touch base with you and let you know my schedule
i am in the houston office this week from monday to thursday but i will be in and out quite a bit meeting with movers and clearing up loose ends
if we need to get together before i go we should probably plan to do so monday or tuesday as i will be packing and moving much of wednesday and thursday
let me know when you would like to get together
i am sitting at 0b
chris
how is that ops package coming
carlos thanx for the pos report
would you mind sending it to me each morning
also
can you make sure that they have all of the deals
other than the few i have done
transferred out of my book by the end of the week
i talked to brian
and he said he would look after it but can you make sure it happens
chris
a couple of other quick things
my october sumas position doesn't look correct
i am short 0 mm/d and the report shows 0 mm/d
i will list my oct sumas trades below if you can check on it for me
also can you make sure my gas daily book is set up and include the change in position report in your daily e-mail
chris
oct sumas trades i also bought 0 mm/d from chad today on eol
chris
getting closer
i want a graph of the spread not of the 0 fixed prices
chris
kim
i will be on 0 all morning
come down whenever you get a minute
chris
when i said spread i didn't mean graph the basis as opposed to the fixed price
these graphs are essentially identical to the first ones you did
i want a graph of the relationship
spread
between the 0 points
i.e
if nov-mar sumas was marked at 0.0 and nov-mar aeco was marked at
0.0
the nov-mar sumas aeco spread would be 0.0
sorry if i wasn't clear
call me with any
s
chris
i didn't get yesterday's ops package
can you make sure i get it today
chris
carlos
could you run a report that shows all the deals in my books
financial and gas daily
as of close of business on friday
sept.0
i doubt i will do any trading over the next couple of days but you should probably wait until tommorow afternoon to run it
chris
no luck graphing those spreads
chris
kim
i will be on 0 all day
give me a call or stop by
chris

chris
wayne
i was talking to kevin presto and he mentioned that you have a plane going to portland
i need to get to calgary and kevin suggested i look into catching a ride with you and getting them to swing north and drop me off on their way back
can you let me know when you plan to leave and if it isn't an inconvience i will talk to lavo and see if he is ok with it
chris dorland
carlos
if he is in houston don't count on him doing it
i won't be getting out of here untill tommorow at the earliest and i am thinking it is going to be friday or saturday

my office number in calgary is 0-0

how about 0's
i was just thinking there would be incentives on 0's
chris
kim i briefly scanned the contract you delivered this morning and it appears fine except for the salary listed in exhibit a
us salary but in cnd dollars
which is incorrect
as i will be in calgary in monday the corrected version should probably just be sent to dawn
chris
carlos these are the trades i did today
sold 0 oct rocks
0.0
eol and cowan is working an order to buy 0 mm/d of oct aeco basis vs
di in us/mm at

about this and he thought it was highly unlikely that producers would shut in eastern rocks production for a couple of reasons
apparently
if you shut in coal bed methane production there is a serious risk that the well will
water out
either ruining the well or causing 0 months to a year of production delays
also
it seem logistically unlikely due to the small production volumes associated with each individual well
0-0 mm/d
in chris's opinion coal bed methane would be some of the last production we would ever see shut in
hope this helps
let me know if you learn anything further
chris
did you receive the poa
chris
i'm in and hopefully i can even find a date
chris
they are wrong
chris
nice are you going to to
just wondering if you guys have talked to any storage guys in the pnw about storage deals for this nov to next summer ect
the market is essentially saying that jp storage is worthless for this winter
nov-dec
and i don't think that should be the case
i think there is free money on the table for someone like puget or avista to roll their scheduled storage withdrawls to next summer
let me know if you have any thoughts
chris
maria
that is pretty close but we don't even have real guns

thanx for only sending the bullish reports

dave
i just wanted to touch base with you on the cash trade that you intermediated between stephane and cascade this morning
i don't really feel that it is stephane's responsibility to manage cascades price risk and i think that you are out of line for accusing him of running over your customer
if you would like we could look at doing an msa with cascade where by we could sell them gas at sumas di

how was boarding
chris
i hear your sister is looking for a piece of action so i thought you might tell her about the kid
graduated in 0 with an hba from the richard ivey school of business
university of western ontario
started at enron in may 0 as an analyst in the trading group working for lavorato doing fundament analysis and acting as lavo's trading assistant
slave
started out trading bc cash desk in june of 0
moved over to trade short term aeco in sept 0
did that for a year
mike mcdermott and laird can let you know if i was any good
went to houston in sept 0 to trade east power
traded cinergy cash desk and worked next to fletch sturm
cinergy term trader
for a year
learned a little bit about trading from him
you know the rest
what are her measurements again
0 0 0 can that be right
too bad
going back to calgary on the 0th
try to watch what you say over the shout box
i actually invited him thinking there was no way he would come
damn
i don't need to ask
every party dave has is byoc
are we going at 0 or 0:0
i don't care
i can't bomard you with witty remarks if you aren't on im
hi everyone
once again i find myself being tasked by geof storey
houston has requested that we make lists of all applications that we use and also that we consolidate all of the files
models and data
that are critical to our business
i don't think mp0's count
into one directory on the network
this is so that these items can be included in the proposed deal with newco
the calgary trading group has set up a directory on i:/trading/newco and i think if each group did the same that would be great
each group should probably have one person in charge of the directory so there isn't any overlap
call me with any
s
chris
did big brother kick you off im
dan dorland
affraid of his brother's im furry
then sign in
this is an example of what one analyst sent me for his personal directory
peg

this car is heaven on earth
i hope that we are planning to contest this proposed amendment
awesome
no
yes
we are
berkeley
california bans u.s
flags from being displayed on city fire trucks because they didn't want to offend anyone in the community
in an
act of tolerance
the head of the public library at florida gulf coast university ordered all
proud to be an american
signs removed so as to not offend international students
i
for one
am quite disturbed by these actions of so-called american citizens
and i am tired of this nation worrying about whether or not we are offending some individual or their culture
since the terrorist attacks on september 0
we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of americans
however
the dust from the attacks had barely settled in new york and washington d.c
when the
politically correct
crowd began complaining about the possibility that our patriotism was offending others
i am not against immigration
nor do i hold a grudge against anyone who is seeking a better life by coming to america
in fact
our country's population is almost entirely comprised of descendants of immigrants
however
there are a few things that those who have recently come to our country
and apparently some native americans
need to understand
first of all
it is not our responsibility to continually try not to offend you in any way
this idea of america being a multi-cultural community has served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity
as americans
we have our own culture
our own society
our own language
and our own lifestyle
this culture
called the
american way
has been developed over centuries of struggles
trials
and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom
our forefathers fought
bled
and died at places such as bunker hill
antietam
san juan
iwo jima
normandy
korea
vietnam
we speak english
not spanish
arabic
chinese
japanese
russian
or any other language
therefore
if you wish to become part of our society
learn our language
in god we trust
is our national motto
this is not some off-the-wall
christian
right wing
political slogan
it is our national motto
it is engraved in stone in the house of representatives in our capitol and it is printed on our currency
we adopted this motto because christian men and women
on christian principles
founded this nation
and this is clearly documented throughout our history
if it is appropriate for our motto to be inscribed in the halls of our highest level of government
then it is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools
god is in our pledge
our national anthem
nearly every patriotic song
and in our founding documents
we honor his birth
death
and resurrection as holidays
and we turn to him in prayer in times of crisis
if god offends you
then i suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home
because god is part of our culture and we are proud to have him
we are proud of our heritage and those who have so honorably defended our freedoms
we celebrate independence day
memorial day
veterans day
and flag day
we have parades
picnics
and barbecues where we proudly wave our flag
as an american
i have the right to wave my flag
sing my national anthem
quote my national motto
and cite my pledge whenever and wherever i choose
if the stars and stripes offend you
or you don't like uncle sam
then you should seriously consider a move to another part of this planet
the american culture is our way of life
our heritage
and we are proud of it
we are happy with our culture and have no desire to change
and we really don't care how you did things where you came from
we are americans
like it or not
this is our country
our land
and our lifestyle
our first amendment gives every citizen the right to express his opinion about our government
culture
or society
and we will allow you every opportunity to do so
but once you are done complaining
whining
and griping about our flag
our pledge
our national motto
or our way of life
i highly encourage you take advantage of one other great american freedom
the right to leave
barry loudermilk if you agree
pass this onto other americans
it is time to take a stand

don
frank was excited about his new rifle
so
he went bear hunting
he spotted a small brown bear and shot it
there was then a tap on his shoulder
and he turned around to see a big black bear
the black bear said
you've got two choices
i either maul you to death or we have rough sex
frank decided to bend over
even though he felt sore for two weeks
frank soon recovered and vowed revenge
he headed out on another trip where he found the black bear and shot it
there was another tap on his shoulder
this time a huge grizzly bear stood right next to him
the grizzly said
that was a huge mistake
frank
you've got two choices
either i maul you to death or we have really rough sex
again
frank thought it was better to comply
although he survived
it would take several months before frankfinally recovered
outraged he headed back to the woods
managed totrack down the grizzly and shot it
he felt sweet revenge
but then there was a tap on his shoulder
he turned around to find a giant polar bear standing there
the polar bear said
admit it
frank
you don't come here for the hunting

while trading on eol or moving physical power you should not have a position larger than 0 mw
if you find yourself at these positions while trading eol you should then widen your market so that you do not take on a larger position
if you have any questions please let me know
i would recommend that you put eol product properties on manage stack
then you will be able to widen your market easily when your position reaches the 0 mw limit

i also have participated in the pjm ftr and nyiso tcc market in my tenure here at enron
the opportunities that i would most be interested are those located here in the houston area
my second choice would then be those positions located in florida
i look forward to talking to you soon

hey bundalicious
how are you doing
we only have one more day to go before the holiday
i can't wait to spend the week with you
i wanted to get you dad's email address
love me
david
diana allen and the it team are currently working on resovling the bad zone p day ahead and real time data
diana told me that it was pulling the pjm data
as far as the shift notes go
i talked to rob benson about the shift notes and he said that they have improved greatly
the pjm summary page is pretty accurate
usually w/in 0 cents of the actual number
the link for the spreadsheet is
you might have been using an old version
i will continue to manage the northeast physical book
it allows me to effectively hedge my long or short position in the off peak market
paul
while writing the e-mail diana said that she fixed the zone p problem

peterman
can you to talk to marci and get this resolved
pt
i just tried to call you
honey
i really do not know what to say so why don't you send me a line that i can attach my resume with
thanks bunda love me
currently
we have a corporate guarantee of $0mm
however i believe that this number can be reduced to $0mm or less
ny will should be able to tell them exactly how much credit they will need to post in order to own this portfolio
as far as i know you still have a job
so
the answer is yes
baby
that looks great
thanks for taking care of that
love me
i am going to go today
i need to go
i have really lost interest in the class
i am really not that motivated right now
i hope your back is feeling better
i am going to show eric saibi our house and then proabaly have lunch with
he just got back from his fathers funeral yesterday
love me
sorry for saying that
did not mean to upset my honey
i am tired
love me
rebecca
let me know if you see any differences
paul
well aaron
it is great to hear that you are doing well
yes
raquel and i
the same gal i was dating at genesis
ended up tying the knot in late april in rio
we got married in small church on the lagoa
quite a beautiful place to get married
above the church sat the giant statue of christ the redeemer looking down on us
my parents
family and friends attended and i know what you mean by fish out of the water
we bought a house over off of buffalo and braeswood
i too have learned a lot about fixing up homes
it is something that i have actually begun to enjoy
the house is great except for the mortgage that we owe to the bank
we are now considering paying it off
however i am not sure for how much longer we will live there
therefore
not sure if we really want to pay it off
as far as children go
we are still waiting for the right time
i imagine we will have one in a year or so
right now we are enjoying taking vacations on a whim
went to rio in early sept and got stuck there for week and 0/0 due to the terrorist attacks
not such a bad place to be stuck
i definitely would encourage you to take a trip there
it is different from most great cities in the world
for example paris
rome
london
nyc are all famous for the great buildings
etc
however
rio is one of the most naturally beautiful places you will ever see
as far as a city settings go
the huge majestic tropical mountains merging with the white sand beaches and blue sea
it is the cidade maravillosa
take care and have a great christmas
paul
aaron
the house we live in is about 0 sq foot
older home that needed some fixing up
at the time i thought we paid too much
however prices in the neighborhood skyrocketed just after we bought the home
the houston texans
a very original name
have developed the new stadium and have torn down some of the seedier hotels in the area in their wake
also
they have totally redone south main blvd creating a nice thoroughfare
the area is experincing a lot of renovation which is adding value to the neighborhood
however
home values go up and down just like the stock market
most important thing is that we like the home and are very comfortable there
when we had the house remodeled it was a nightmare
i think the guy was an alcoholic and he did a half ass job
i prefer to do it myself
i like the way it looks when i do it and it is whole lot cheaper
one day the contractor almost died in the house
he lost his tooth and proceeded to take a bunch of advil to ease the pain
however he did this on an empty stomach
he had to be rushed to the hospital and was there for a week
he ended up returning and finishing the job
anyways
i have to say that it was a good learning experience and next time i will have a better idea on how to get things done
it was hard to organize and quality assure the job since i had just started a demanding job here at enron
all in all
i think france or us you run into the same types of problems with contractors
talking about wild flowers and plants
the same is true for costa rica
plants that only grow indoors with great care in houston grow like weeds in costa rica
i recommend that on your places to go list
merry christmas
feliz natal
and feliz navidad later paul
this is good hoon
look
i think these are the sunglasses that i am going to order
they are the same ones i had last time except the frame is black instead of brown
how you know you are brazilian
thanks

below are the assumptions agreed for booking the new albany spread option
epmi east power book pays new albany a fixed demand charge for the next 0 years as follows
as consideration for the demand charge
epmi has the right to
toll
gas through the facility and receive power in return at a fixed heat rate conversion factor of 0.0 mmbtu/mwh
in addition epmi will pay new albany $0 per start
for maintenance reserve fund
and $0.0/mwh for variable operating costs
the new albany
llc will receive an 0% return on capital
book value will be depreciated from $0/kw basis on 0/0/0 to $0/kw on 0/0/0
the facility output assumption is 0 mw with a 0% availability in the summer and 0% availability in the winter
jenny
please revise the booking of new albany in rogers book effective tonight
below are the epmi proposed bid/offer spreads for ees
these are very aggressive markets given the liquidity issues and regulatory uncertainty that still exist in the eastern interconnect
there are no other counterparties in the market that will consistently make the proposed 0-ways
the following is the understanding i have with chris calger regarding scott healy's involvement in east power initiatives
since auburndale is effectively dead
scott will no longer be involved on this project
scott will support the haywood
georgia
calvert city development site sales through q0 0
with east power getting 0% of the p&l value and scott healy getting personal performance credit
if ben elects to continue to use scott's services beyond q0 0
a value sharing agreement between ben
calger and myself will have to be agreed upon
jeff ader will make a decision
after consultation with me
as to scott's continued involvement on the fuel cell tax monetization and dighton restructuring project
if jeff makes the decision that scott needs to remain actively involved in order to close the transaction
a value sharing agreement will be made between jeff
calger
and myself
the value allocation % will be agreed upon upfront within the next week
if a fair value sharing agreement cannot be reached
jeff will transition responsibility to another member of his origination team
chris
do you agree with the above description
new albany will accept proposal assuming my deductible is limited to $0 million per occurence and my bi deductible is limited to 0 days and includes full replacement revenue
less marginal fuel costs
after the 0 day period

this guy is quality and i want to make an offer
please let me know if i can proceed asap
change the request to 0 mw per period
thanks
when do the guys that signed contracts get the paperwork for option grants and restricted stock
they are all asking me

we have never paid in the past
is it different if we request 0 only
willis is an manager candidate
i tore the agreement up because he would not sign it
the first report looked good
however
i would like to see the owner name
and technical configuration
in addition
i would like pictures of each facility
as i told john this morning
we have similar issues with var in the east
the correlations between gas
power for the entire curve are based on the front month and the correlations between regions are also based on the front month
i have requested changes to the var calc several months back and have been assured it will be completed by the research group soon
can you send me another copy of the pros/cons matrix and the function descriptions
thanks
i gave you his resume 0 months ago

i should be able to make that happen as well
with busby

joe and narsima
timing an issue
you have some competent support at the outset in addition

i would like to acknowledge david portz for his hard work and diligence in drafting and actively supporting the negotiation of the green mountain power all-requirements transaction in ercot

i'm not in the business of providing firm pricing via e-mail
as always
all prices from the desk are indicative until customer is ready to pull the trigger
as a rule of thumb
prices are good for about 0 minutes
therefore
let's be clear with the counterparty that we are in a volatile energy market with pricing moving 0-0% on some days
for example
summer power is down $0.0/mwh over the past week and june is down $0/mwh
summer 0 and summer 0 are down $0-0/mwh over the past 0 days
thanks
i forgot to mention that today's curves will be down another 0%
therefore
the prices in the spreadsheet are too high
thanks for the hard copies
can you please send me an e-mail with an electronic copy
i received them
thanks
no
i have sent 0 copies to lavo
no development is easy
i see nothing on your list that cannot be overcome
please develop a plan to have a 0 mw on-line my may 0 with rented diesel equipment
we would install the diesels at oppd distribution substations
we may have to do 0 different installations to acheive the desired result
last year com-ed and ipl completed an installation with cats in 0 months
the key is to get oppd to cooperate with interconnections at the distribution substations and we will get credit for losses
please work with terri and ed
if you need any additional info after working through a plan with terri and ed
please let me know
agreed
thanks
fyi
can you help ron sort through these issues
with oppd's cooperation
we can easily overcome these issues and make may 0 in-service for 0 mw of rented diesel generation installed at oppd distribution substations
0k right now
i am prepared to pay a $0 million development fee as well
highly confidential
my candidates are already through their rotations and are essentially finished with what we have defined as the trading track
white water rafting in colorado
i submitted my request to kim melodick approx
0 week ago
kim
please make sure lavo and louise have my wish list for analyst and associate candidates
ground pictures from various angles will do
my expectation is that i will continue to get weekly updates and the booklet i described will contain the info i requested in an organized manner
thanks
yes it is irrelevant
now that we have competent risk managers making the decision
they will know how to effectively hedge these deals
furthermore
pricing is always available on demand
when each trader has 0-0 products to manage in a volatile market
they are not necessarily going to put 0-0 for peak and off-peak in every region
it becomes very cumbersome to manage the year over year spreads when the front is moving so violently
as you probably know
rogers
in the east
and don
in the west
will be working directly with the wholesale desk
tim and i will ensure a fair balance is achieved between retail and wholesale
as an enron shareholder
i fully appreciate that we need explosive growth and profitability out of ees
particularly with reduced volatility in gas and power markets over the next several years
i am commited to ensuring that the retail risk management organization is offered all the tools
information
systems
competitive pricing
etc
to allow ees to offer fully bundled competitively priced products to retail customers
i look forward to working with you and dave in continuing to grow this business
willis should be an associate trading track position
i forgot to clarify with kim on original offer
remember
we have to go through paul johnson at austin energy
i would like to get the offer letter out today
i would like 0 analysts and 0 associates
i provided my top 0 wish list to lavo last week
thanks
plant development should focus on sites in ny city
you assumptions are correct related to ne
thanks for the update john
i have a great personal relationship with paul posoli
run there whole shop
so if you need anything let me know
great trading asset
but fixed costs are enormous
the entire value proposition is based upon $0/mwh spread between peak and off-peak
which is clearly there today
my view is this spread collapses over time due to dsm/dg/real-time pricing and true hourly price signals in pool based markets
we should look at the asset
but recognize the fixed costs are huge
in the interim
fletch and i will assume responsibility
obviously
we will be trying to identify a replacement over the next couple of months
we will be doing some position re-alignment today
transferring some of rogers positions to fletch and/or myself at tonight's mids
i will then re-sell/re-buy some positions back to rogers which cancel out opposite positions in the retail book
i will give you the specifics before we mark
we should be pursuing the buyout and asset development simultaneously and the most economic alternative will prevail
sounds good
i think we will significant synergy benefits immediately
the cultural barriers will be broken down and information will flow from wholesale to retail and vice versa
if i can find it
i'm sure vlady can get it to you
in general
i don't save my e-mails
i would like another 0
monitor mounted on my trading desk
when can i get this done
i did look and couldn't find it
thanks charles and i agree with your conclusion
a competitive market will not exist unless the tools create a clear price signal for all congestion
i need prudency c summaries asap
thanks
i talked with gary hickerson and i am ok with granting michelle cisneros access for her specific valuation purpose
pricing access is for 0 years only
fletch and i are dividing up rogers postions
fletch taking peak
i'm taking off-peak
to make it fair on everyone
i am allowing rogers to take $0 million from prudency c attached to jea
rogers has created this positive balance himself over the past 0 months with deals he has done in fl
soco
in addition
i will be assuming all customer deals
vepco
jea
associated
mpmuc
we will mark the curves in entergy and tva where fletch is comfortable taking the position
off-peak also needs to be marked down
the $0 million from prudency will absorb most of the curve shift
all of rogers postions will stay in wholesale
all parties come out with a fair solution
lloyd will
juan hernandez and don baughman
plus kayne coulter
should be the east power reps at this meeting
please begin working on filling our associated short position in 0
i would like to take this risk off the books
in addition
please find out what a buy-out of vepco would cost us
with rogers transitioning to run our retail risk management
i would like to clean up our customer positions
we also need to continue to explore a jea buy-out
thanks
his resume looked good
i'm ok with the hire
fine
use the same charge code you have been using
if it becomes an asset management deal
we need to involve the services desk
tom may and jeff miller
the trading
marketing outsourcing deal is the most appealing to me
no development as of yet
next week is better
please schedule an afternoon appt
with my asst
tamara black 0-0
if you don't get a response from elizabeth
just call her or walk up to the legal floor
on something as important as this
i would go directly to elizabeth's office
for 0 and 0
congestion/energy uplift/transmission uplift is $0.0 to $0.0/mwh
current ees curves are light in this area
for 0
beyond when lmp is adopted in ne iso and socialized allocation is eliminated
the congestion component alone in the boston area will be well over $0/mwh
based on actual congestion $'s from may 0 to date in the boston area
much like the dallas situation
these locational congestion charges can be significant and rogers and don will begin immediately developing delivered energy pricing curves for specific locations that go well beyond the wholesale pricing points we mark right now
i hope this helps
i think there a great dg opportunities in both boston and manhattan
we will be working hard over the next several weeks to get proper city-gate curves in place to reflect true location marginal pricing
particularly in areas where we have exposure and new deal activity
thanks
kim
add another 0-0 for retail risk management
you can take from the same list i have already provided to you and lavo
i need project names next to these que spots
including the project sponsor
i can't make a determination unless i know the specific project and the project owner
i still need the info i requested to comment intelligently
attend
icap exposure needs to be capped at the default price
currently 0.0/kw/mo
because zone j is deficient capacity
the market is actually trading higher than the default rate
in addition
we need to scrub the ancillary components
we need to add jay lewis and 0-0 people with t&d tariff knowledge to the curve team as well
this process will entail specific wholesale curves plus a complete review of the t&d tariff curves
these teams need to work together to ensure the sum of the parts equal the whole
i am assuming everyone on the team agrees
we have a # of counterparties whom credit will allow daily trading and/or balance of month trading
with no forward trading
it would be much more efficient for the trading organization and the counterparties to have functionality within eol that allowed for better credit screening
we have moved away from the broker markets
and the current screening mechanism forces us to trade in the broker market with credit limited counterparties
i would like to get this changed asap
if possible
thanks
friday is a terrible day for tours in power
my entire desk leaves at 0:0 pm on friday
i would suggest the gas floor for this tour
the customer will be very unimpressed if we have limited staff here in the middle of the day
remember our deal
after trading day is over
for next 0 months
you stay until the risk calcs are done and help in whatever manner is necessary to improve the process
in addition
you should take responsibility for calcing the ercot books
term and cash
can we make 0
fpl needs 0 start dates
is jea deal booked against fl/ga curve or serc curve
sounds like you are on the team
i am assuming you will start full-time on monday
whalley has already assured me you will be part of this re-build process which obviously requires full-time focus
please confirm
thanks
it never hurts to ask
your perception is correct
remember 0 years of culture is at work here
i told rogers this morning
we have to move to 0
clearly define the process for pricing deals
and begin changing the mindset of the marketing organization with respect to value
the whole situation on 0 is considerably worse than i originally thought
have you spoke to greg whalley about kristen albrecht
dierdra mccaffery
jim brysch
and heather kendall
we need to move forward on putting these teams together
and the above individuals were key candidates indentified to re-build the retail risk management organization over the next 0-0 months
i would like to hear back today on how we plan on proceeding with these individuals
thanks
thanks
east power is flat
yes
you are correct
todd is making the changes i requested and we probably have at least another 0 weeks before i get a final plan
with respect to your latest contract
i have 0 minor changes
the only one with any significance is the counterparty name
i expect mitchell-carroll custom homes to be the signator to this agreement
having a
shell
llc entiity sign the contract would be like me having my step-son sign the contract
i want the
real
balance sheet to be on the hook for meeting the contractual obligations
much like you want my personal balance sheet/income statement to be the responsible financial counterparty
the other change was wording and does not effect the contract intent
talk to you soon
i am interested in single family residences at deering bay
specifically lots
what free money
if you are referring to the contract
it was not enough free money
yes
i agree
remember
john has asked to go through a deal and this is a significant transaction
i suggest going through the deal over lunch
the only way the coal deal will go forward is if you prove you can get long term supply
pet coke
prb
other
etc
for $0.0-0.0/mmbtu delivered to the site
the economics need to show a 0-0% irr in order to justify the commodity risk
in addition
we should explore igcc in florida
the gas/coal spread is much larger in this market and the proforma economics would be much better
definitely attend
he's solid
we'll discuss when you get back
thanks michelle
good job
why not use the actual correlations we have observed over the past 0 months
simply calculate forward gas price movement to forward power price movement
bal 0
0
0
etc
on a curve by curve basis
and you will find gas/power correlations on a forward basis are very high
0+%
at least in the eastern markets
i will only be attending the first 0 minutes of this meeting
so adjust the emission meeting to reflect that
thanks
this is a classic
i want to bring this guy in for an interview
if he is as good as he says he is
we have to hire the guy
you will get some good laughs
no trading
it's a nerc holiday
this will be done by early next week at the the latest
another addition to the team
sounds good
i talk to tim about twice a week
add $0.0/mwh to the off-peak component of the 0x0 price and everything else looks fine
after talking with rogers
it sounds like a conference call at 0:0 pm tommorow would be more productive
rogers and don are still working through logistics of the move to the 0th floor and solidifying some of personnel issues
does 0:0 pm tommorow work for you
we can call you from my office
we have this already by comparing daily reports
i simply look at the change in daily postions
both lavo and i are ok with the current reports
done
i already read this article
price action is wicked bearish on our stock right now
fortunately
i have been doing a good bit of hedging my long enron position
is this going to get done
my sense is this would reduces energy uplift charges and reduce energy clearing prices
do you agree
did rogers sign his contract or is he still holding out
i think i could make a case for decreasing ecp
because some of the uplift actually sneaks into the ecp
must run units for 0 hours etc
i would argue that the pool will dispatch more competitively when generators know that a peaker can run for 0 minutes at $0/mwh
this forces baseload units to offer very competitive pricing for all hours to ensure dispatch
we have seen what the additional peakers in the east does to volatility and energy clearing prices
in general
what are your thoughts
rogers will do a fine job with this group presentation
i think it is important that rogers builds credibility with the marketing organization
i'm sure you are ok with this
i confirmed he signed a couple weeks ago
done
i'll come him today
sounds interesting
clearly
we would pay a some premium on the front end for the boston location
work directly with dana on the specifics
i didn't receive any home information
i'm interested in resale homes
new homes and lots
thanks
what is the 0:0 deadline for
i should be able to sign on my timeline
if they are still available
i'll take them
i was looking for tommorow
i'll pass on tonight
thanks
i agree
the mtm amount needs to be gross margin
not revenues
what deal was done for summer cinergy on friday
did rogers sign off on all of the beco deals
we have approx 0 total seats for retail risk management on the 0th floor
i think its important to put all power related retail functions
risk management
tariffs
structuring
risk reporting
etc
on the 0th floor
if you do this
then there will not be room for the retail gas group
which means you need to work with tammy shephard and wes colwell to get room on the 0th floor for retail gas
happy to do it
approved
any news on the diesel units installed at oppd substations
i think we should install 0 minute metering capability and start serving these customers physically
in order to grow this business
we need to find out if we can serve retail load directly in an efficient and cost-effective manner
the quicker we can achieve physical delivery capability
the quicker we can define our true cost of serving these customers
good info on new plants
lloyd
can we get this spreadsheet on our website under fundies tab
thanks
i do not use
i would say 0,0,0 for lavo approval
whether than signature
i would go through deal specifics and get verbal approval
sounds good
we may want to consider diesel installation for lincoln electric as well
i am beginning to think that diesel installations is our primary solution to cover oppd short for may-oct 0
fine
this is the spread option which i am able to reconcile
the big p&l discrepancy is on the pure tve fixed price positions which are off by $0 million+
please continue to reconcile with grace kim
thanks
yes
please schedule a meeting with tj black
0-0
please handle
thanks
approved
i talked to julie havilend about paine webber keeping my on-line portfolio manager updated with all of my enron options
entering options is tricky and i was hoping you can provide that service for me
let me know
myself and all of my desk heads will be interviewing candidates wednesday from 0:0 to 0:0 pm
quarterly
rogers can be reached by e-mail at drherndon@aol.com
he would like updates on activities everyday if possible
thanks
i need approval for this ercot schedule c
the e-mail from stacey outlines the details
thanks
keep it up
our markets are getting even tighter
deny the request and the requester needs to send a formal request directly to me with solid justification
because we have lost several people to retail risk management
rogers herndon
narsima misra
jim homco
etc
and john forney has moved to ercot hourly
i have been forced to manage an eol stack for multiple markets
therefore
all tours during trading hours
0:0 am to 0:0 pm
will have to be provided by non-trading personnel
sorry
but we are in our busiest season and i cannot afford to have my traders away from the desk for even 0 minutes
looks great
green mountain prudency has been approved by lavo
yes we are aware
thanks
edison international purchased all of com-ed's gas and coal plants approx
0 years ago and now sells the output of these plants back to com-ed through 0
the operators of the plant are threatening a strike and it could have huge implications with plant availability until replacement operators could be found
i would like your group to closely monitor this situation and provide me daily feedback
i don't agree with either 0 or 0
the 0.0 lolp generally results in 0-0% reserve margins which are excessive
reserve margin is a meaningless measure in an efficient commodity market because supply and demand adjust to price signals to keep the market in balance
my view is that icap should be eliminated completely and
if utilized
transitional only for a 0-0 year period
the other alternative is the iso to have a reliability auction whereby quick-start units contract directly with an iso for meeting reliability reserve reqs
several names in my lotus address book that did not transfer to the new outlook platform
the names that did not transfer have text next to them
for exampe
todd rice did not transfer and his name on lotus notes has
office number
next to it
there are several other examples of this
thanks
send to lloyd will for his review
thanks
doesn't oati already do this
i would like a consolidated report on all generation projects monitored to date
my recollection was we had identified approx
0-0 projects to monitor
thanks
how come you never show eol #'s for east power
i would like to see east power included in the e-mail report
thanks
please handle
thanks
looks great

compared to 0 million mwh's for all of 0
0
averaging 0 trades per day on eol for 0 ytd
compared to 0 in 0
in the last two weeks
eol daily transactions have averaged nearly 0
0
significant improvement in liquidity in all markets
epmi now trades actively through 0 in nearly every eastern market
0
positive p&l in every eastern region 0
outstanding return on var
thanks vince
i read about this in mw daily and on bloomberg
i think it will be a good project
will do
thanks
please put on my calender and create interview package
wow
let's bring him in for an interview
have johnny palmer set up
as soon as i get access to crude
resid
coal curves
i will grant access to power curves
thanks
looks fine
please have grace
or her replacement begin including nymex coal
prb 0 coal
resid 0% and resid 0% in the curve handout everyday
thanks
please provide power curve access to jen fraser in egm
please place on drive that the traders can access
good to hear from you and thanks again for the baby gift
much appreciated
the family is great
caitlin just turned 0 and dane is now 0 months old
i hope fran and the kids are doing great
how's your new addition
we will be going to miami sept 0-0
miami revenge on washington
and hopefully we can hook up for a beer
as far as the guy from citizens
we really don't know that much about him
where is tony altman
under a bus somewhere
portfolio looks good
is it valuing options properly
can you rename the portfolio
enron
thanks
i am trying to change name to
presto
enron
and it won't let me
how do i change name
please grant steve access
thanks
the options are not valued properly
the market value is calculated based upon the value of the underlying
which grossly overstates the market value of the portfolio
the restricted stock
basis of $0
is valued ok
but the options are not
in addition
the year restricted stock and option grant is not yet in the portfolio
it would help me if the grant dates were listed in the portfolio details
this will help me determine if we are missing anything
thanks
did you get my message on option valuation in the portfolio
except it can't be negative because they were grants at no cost to me
the problem is the combination of restricted stock which is total market value and options which is gain/loss need to be added together to get total portfolio value
i was hoping you could trick the system so portfolio value was accurate
thanks
i think you forgot the cash postion
i would rather have on-line valuation
even if the $'s aren't perfect
i like to look at my personal equity portfolio
includes enron hedging
separate from enron granted stock and option value
one portfolio is liquid and the other is not and i monitor differently
i already signed something on this
unless i hear otherwise
i am going to ignore this e-mail
thanks
we just successfully bought out of the 0 oppd capacity and energy obligation
therefore
we don't need to proceed with the diesel installation
i have instructed terri to make your group whole on any costs incurred pursuing the diesel development in nebraska
in addition
i would like to pursue an 0 lm0 project inside ameren
approx
0-0 mw
this would be a strategic asset to create a control area around and utilize the flexible interconnections ameren has with multiple systems
we also have significant retail load obligations behind ip and ameren in illinois
thanks
0k is bs
ron has only been working on this for 0-0 weeks
he has made one trip to nebraska
i expect more like 0-0k in costs incurred
this is precisely why i told ron to work directly with terri on this project
with respect to ameren
ron should work directly with me and lloyd will
thanks
it needs to look like our wholesale reports
postions shown behind each utility
in addition
peak and off-peak should be on separate pages
we should have two views
0
by utility 0
by counterparty
are you a mind reader
i set up a once a week meeting every monday at 0:0pm
eb0
to go through east positions
wholesale
t&d
and discuss process
deal review
big risk items
new deals
etc
in attendance will be
busby don black rogers herndon jay lewis joe wagner i recommend a bi-weekly meeting with the group of 0
belden
presto
lavo
richter
black
herndon
i will assume kim will coordinate with the asst's to schedule time and location
make sure tj puts on my calender
wednesday doesn't work for me
ok
i will have to move my weekly meeting to tuesday
not yet
please respond to request below
thanks
i understand all of those comparisons
however
the reality is if we lose dean
which we will if we don't pay 0k + 0k
we will end up hiring a replacement at 0-0k
this is pretty easy math for me
i know it seems like a stretch
but the market for hourly traders is very strong right now
i would like to get this done asap
thanks
thanks
please adjust calender
thanks
thanks for the invite
but i won't be able to make it
do you have a list of people for the special trip
what do you think
vegas we need to get the list of names to aviation asap
i would support 0 mw at homestead
could you take a crack at a draft for the skilling/lay presentation
the presentation should focus on supply/demand
0-0
rto progess in each region
and the progression of heat rate curves
expanded last year and compressing this year
pricing history
volatility graphs
etc
thanks
i agree
we don't know the base value of the current deal
so how can we make an incremental value decision on a restructuring
mine
looks good
we should get one suite as well that we can use as a beer drinking hospitality room
i'll confirm dates with you later today or tommorow
thanks
please put together package
what is this interview for
this is fine
however
the genco related info should be screened
i understand and agree with everything
except 0% was the agreed upon interest rate as noted on the economic runs which establised the demand payment between my book and new albany
llc
it is clear that 0% was the agreed upon rate and the true-up needs to be from 0% to 0%
please make a recommendation that keeps this individual
i have given my views
and they are falling on deaf ears
please give me a solution that keeps the employee and saves the company money by avoiding replacement cost at 0-0k
this seems like a real simple business decision and we are making it difficult
calpine is in complete disarray right now
and the entire future of their company hinges on ca honoring their long term above market contracts
calpine's non-ca portfolio is getting killed and i don't think they have hedged effectively in the non-ca locations
given these circumstances
the word
below market
is an
f
word
particulary with the legal concerns they also have
i would place a low probability on getting to a value proposition that makes sense for both parties at dighton
particularly with the legal issues
looks like enpower is
on the side of the road
with respect to capturing and valuing retail deals
as we discussed in yesterday's meeting
plan b is a more robust spreadsheet that unbundles the components and values them separately and creates postions by risk component
i know this is easier said than done
but we need a tactical solution that gives the group confidence that value and positions are correct
rather than a bundled black box batch value with hard coded assumptions
i think so
to top things off
there building downtown flooded and the traders are working out of there house
they have no idea what there positions are
and they are trading almost exclusively on eol from their home comwhat a joke
huh
please work with stacey and donny vinson to credit new albany llc with the 0k
i talked with lavo and we agreed herndon and black should go as well
i think zufferli would make 0
but we should be able to squeeze
i am calling aviation today and i plan on arranging the following
0
plane goes to portland and picks up your guys at 0:0 am on friday 0/0
or 0/0 if more notice is required
0
plane picks up houston guys at approx
0:0-0:0 pm
houston time
0
we arrive in cabo around 0:0 pm
0
plane returns to houston 0:0 pm sunday 0
plane continues to portland and arrives around 0:0 pm
portland time
let me know if this works for you guys
didn't we already hang richter with this at the monday mtg
by the way
lavo has indicated he will just attend our monday meetings every couple of weeks instead of having a separate meeting
no
i won't be using
you caught that
i guess that's fair
we would likely leave around 0:0 pm cpt which would put us in portland at 0:0
west time
does this work
we need to send someone
thanks
you are 0% correct
that is my impression as well
and that is why i set up the monday meeting
going forward
the format of those meetings should be
0
richter presents his area of accountability
west wholesale prosition
risk systems
deal capture system
status of projects
schedule
etc
0
black presents his area of accountability
deal review
west tariff
and gas
0
herndon presents his area of accountability
east wholesale
east tariffs
0
bernie presents his area of accountability
deal structuring
deal valuation
new model construction
0
busby presents his area of accountability
risk systems and portfolio valuation
works with richter
0
you and i find the holes and provide direction
your thoughts
sounds ok for now
long term
your portfolio manager should know how to value options
the following people will be making the trip
portland houston tim belden kevin presto mike swerbzin fletch sturm bob badeer dana davis jeff richter rob benson tom alonzo rogers herndon matt motley don black mark fisher john zufferli could you please coordinate with aviation to arrange the falcon 0 to pick up the portland crew friday morning with and then confirm flight details with myself and tim belden
we may have to arrange for don black and rogers herndon to fly on commercial flight due to space limitations on the falcon
let me know if 0 is over the limit so i can let rogers and don know
thanks
0k
thanks
thanks
a group of 0 people
west and east power
will be taking an off-site to cabo june 0-0
we would like for you guys to join the group for a wild weekend in mexico
that's the good news
due to space limitations
we need you guys to fly commercial from houston to cabo
on company $'s
of course
on the way back
you would fly on the company plane
and zufferli would fly commercial directly to calgary
we plan on departing houston on friday 0/0 at 0:0 pm and return sunday at approx
0:0 pm
are you guys in
we will have a blast
you will probably be glad you didn't go
if the boys are in jail in mexico
you may have to run the desk the next week
rogers can't attend due to family conflict
therefore
you will be on the corporate jet
you should be getting a copy of the flight schedule from kim hillis via e-mail
please make sure the meetings i need to attend are on my calender
thanks
no chance
he gets nothing other than the pricing model through structuring
means broken and needs fixed
like your mercedes
i bet your insurance is a 0 times higher than calgary
could i please get an updated valuation summary on the sale of new albany
do not include the $0 million capacity unwind in the economics
i want only the mtm effects
the accrual benefits are gravy
thanks
done
your welcome
he was under ed baughman until approx
0 month ago
he is now the entergy/soco scheduler
the way you set up the portfolio is very confusing
why not have two portfolios
0
enron
restricted
all stock with a $0 basis in this portfolio
should be $0k+
0
enron
options
all ene stock options
gain/loss column will show intrinsic value
thanks
after setting up the portfolio
please customize the view to show the most relevant data
thanks
yes
i think we should make a formal break
we have separate accountability for retail gen
wholesale plus ancillaries
and i think reg gen plus t&d should have separate accountability as well
we have made great returns on the front of the curve and the back of the curve
we have significant cal 0 through cal 0 positions
that have provided solid profitability
it is completely inaccurate to say we have made all of our money on the front of the curve
in addition
make sure we understand the steam obligation and it's effect on dispatch flexibity and heat rate
it appears the 0 heat rate is assuming above market steam sales are buying down the heat rate
solar turbines in combined cycle
without a steam sale credit
would usually have a heat rate around 0,0 btu/kwh
the lower heat rate is probably predicated on providing 0 hour steam
which means less dispatch flexibility and producing off-peak energy at a loss
make sure we are modeling these dynamics properly
i am trying to customize the view and i keep getting an error
can you check into this problem
i want the view for both portfolios to be
open date quantity purchase price last price cost basis market value can you make this the default view setting
thanks
you got it
i'm learning
i hope this translates in p instead of l
thanks
the $0 million is strictly an internal trading #
and is irrelevant from an acct
standpoint
we can ignore it for the dash
do i need to attend
if so
please put on my calender
approved
you have the latitude to put your key people under contract
edith was very clear when i talked to her that she wanted to transition into a marketing role where she would interact directly with customers
i concur
you know we are likely selling new albany this week and i am assuming ena's premium obligation can be terminated in the event of the sale of the asset
your kidding right
what's the term
remember
i only agreed to the terms for 0 only
with respect to the flight to ft
lauderdale on 0/0
can you see if steve or continental can improve our row 0 seats to a bulkhead row for both the outgoing and return flights
let me know
thanks
agreed
this was not clear and the only thing i agreed to was a premium for 0
you got it
i will be in cabo this weekend with wolfe's boss
tim belden
my counterpart in the west
and i will talk with him about their real-time trading needs and timing
epmi purchased 0 mw of calender 0 nepool icap
installed capability
from calpine at $0.0/kw/mo
the parties agreed via a recorded phone conversation
paul posoli and kevin presto
that the lcra lawsuit would be dropped and neither party would have any further obligations with respect to that lawsuit
the parties attorneys have 0 hours to agree on lawsuit termination language
at which time the icap transaction becomes a binding obligation on both parties
let me know if you need anything else
you didn't attach anything
joe will get promoted at year-end
associates are not eligible until 0 months of service
we placed joe in superior
has east power recognized the 0k refund
yes
i am very busy today
i will get back with you tommorow or friday
i'm not doing this interview
i told dave duran we have no interest
and i'm not going to waste my time on this individual
short and sweet
i like it
you will have to sell your competitiveness and work ethic
because you bring zero experience and your resume reflects that
i will talk with belden this weekend and i'll get back with you on next step
can you show me on an ameren transmission map exactly where this project is
greg works for enron north america wholesale services
he is vice president in west power over hourly trading
middle marketing
and services business
you got em
we don't need a floor talk
i asked tom to set up a meeting in 0c0 with origination
mid-marketing
and services
this is not going to be a floor talk
i would like to be able to select days
months
years
etc
for historical liquidation
somehow
we need to make the cubes or metastock more user friendly so the traders will actually use them
i have tried to use the cubes and
although the data is extremely powerful
scrolling through all the years and months is quite cumbersome and drilling down is a pain
can we somehow improve the user friendliness of these tools
thanks
find out if owners of current season tickets get grandfathered for equivalent seats in the new arena
if so
i would be interested
if not
i would say no
i like our traditional measurment better
this is good data
but is more relevant for cash traders than term traders
please coordinate with kim melodick to make this happen
harry is getting with kim melodick
hr for wholesale trading
to coordinate the transfer
doug gilbert-smith runs our texas power group
yes
i will call you tonight or tomorrow to give you an update
let's bring him in for an interview
access approved
please put on calender
per lavo
he would like to see asap the break-even price on the reg-switch options where length was booked and when wholesale goes below tariff
we can cover and re-create free option
when can we have summary valuation of this done for east positions
doesn't it become a free option if you can serve physically or reg-gen via utility tariff
for example in illinois and ohio
wouldn't these markets create free options if the wholesale price goes below reg gen
are drinks on the house
before we book the new albany sale
lavo would like to have a final meeting with myself
lavo
louise
stuart
and don to go through final economics and determine appropriate booking
stuart
don
can you set up meeting
we will pass
thanks
a former fpl employee
ken olan
will be calling you regarding a potential alternative to orimulsion
the fuel is sourced from us refinery and can be burned in the same manner as orimulsion
creating two fuel sources
let me know
agreed
i slept great
please call me as soon as we find out about the duke board mtg results
i need to know asap
greg
my brother is looking to make a career change from teaching
currently a biology teacher at richland high school
into something where performance is rewarded
he is an extremely hard worker who is ultra competitive
do you have any needs for entry level hourly guys
i think he could learn the business quick and do well in our industry
i know there is a ton of market uncertainty in the west right now with the california debacle
so i'm not sure if you need people or not
let me know if there is any chance for an interview and i can have my brother send a resume
hope everything is going well for you and your family
thanks
is the deal done
i received an e-mail from greg wolfe
they do have needs for entry level people
for whatever reason
he did not receive the attached resume in my previous e-mail
please send me a final version of your resume so i can forward to greg
thanks
what advantages does this bring for east and/or west power
other than less mid-yr reviews to do
lloyd will is my fundies interface
and
in general
we have received very good support from research
wow
imcompetence at its best
please give the names of the plants effected asap
sounds fine to me
no trading on the 0th
please summarize and hand out to traders
in addition
create a section on our web site for enviornmental related matters
as you can see
i was copied on the original e-mail
please handle
my recommendation is that berney's retail structuring group value the generation deals that are intended to serve retail load
can you believe duke paid book value
wow
they even accepted all the risk associated with the power systems bs
cover letter and resume from my brother are attached
i think they are low in frcc by $0.0-0.0
and i will fix tonight
the gtc and fl/ga marks are good
on-peak in frcc
however
i will be moving down some
particularly in the shoulder months starting in 0 as alot of combined cycles are added in florida by both utilities and merchant players
no problem
$0.0/mwh is enough for this service
you don't need to pay a $0.0/mwh
i would say anytime she gets more that $0/mwh
she gets a $0.0/mwh to keep her motivated to sell at the highest price
sound ok
it was actually stuart zisman
i can speak with chris ahn when he gets back from his honeymoon
terry
please set aside 0 minutes on my calender sometime next week to talk to suzette
i don't know her so your help in setting up the meeting would be appreciated
please coordinate with tj black
0-0
isn't this an eol cost
thanks for all the hard work and your efforts are greatly appreciated by the power desk
is there any chance i can talk you out of your resignation
i would like you to come work for lloyd will and help with our services business and rto interface initiatives
we are in the process of completely revamping our systems
and your knowledge would be a huge help in pushing this initiative
your thoughts
yes
his phone number is 0-0-0
i forwarded the resume and cover letter this morning
so i would wait at least one day
absolutely
i may have to smooth over the jim mehn issue
chris committed to go to wholesale structuring
please coordinate with my asst
tj black @0-0
to set up an afternoon meeting next week
duke has indicated that the cannot complete the proposed commodity/loan transaction with my proposed collateral threshold exemption
they have indicated that creates
accounting issues
for there accrual book
therefore
i need to know the cost of credit to assign to the proposed cash flows
in rough numbers
we receive $0 million in the first two years and return $0 million in the last two years
because of this
in years 0 and 0
our collateral posting will be significant
let me know your thoughts asap on monday morning
who is guy
i agree rogers
however
you need to help me finesse the situation
the
just say no
approach will go nowhere with delainey
let's talk about a workable approach
hang in there
can we make sure this goes on the web site
thanks joe
i will have tom and/or john follow up with rob
thanks
fyi
we can honor the original ticket grants
please get a $ amount from deffner's group on the collateral cost issue
given the shape of the loan
enron will have to post significant collateral on the 0
0 positions
and i need a pv cost associated with collateral requirements of this loan package
please talk with bradford with respect to credit $'s
please assign an analyst to show all generation in the com-ed control area
the primary owners are
0
edison international
former com-ed coal plants
0
com-ed
nuclear and some gt's
0
people's
elwood and one other merchant plant
0
0-0 miscellanious merchant plants
includes allegheny's lincoln center facility
thanks and good luck
who called it a new business
did you use florida curves from friday
the curves are much lower friday vs
thursday
agreed
actually
i think you are being too aggressive
i need the reg gen postion
transmission position
distribution position
and ancillary position
if you have to bundle the t&d and ancillary into one position
that is fine
however
i want the pricing assumptions for the individual pieces and our best guess for the mwh position
thanks
based on the # of ees people attending a meeting that is about tariff prices
ie
ews
i would hate to see the expense side of the ees ledger
ridiculous
i have been forwarding all of your e-mails today to lavo and louise
i am trying to build a case to get ader and bernstien
bert and ernie are my new nicknames
re-assigned and away from our supply business
sounds good
looks good
thanks
good info
thanks
no more e-mails
i still don't have the forward fpc tariff curve
how is this so complicated
good info
thanks
when is the miso set to go commercial
what are the biggest needs in fundies right now
i would like a fundies rotation
risk books
and real-time
risk books or fundies should be the 0st rotation and real-time should be the last
wes colwell needs to create a new cost center for the new retail risk management organization
my understanding is that delainey has agreed to pay the costs for this year
please confirm with wes
you are still missing a significant grant of restricted stock in 0 and 0
can you please include these grants in the portfolio manager
i have requested this several times now
thanks
no problem
lloyd and i will be assembling a team soon
all discussion should go through lloyd
yes
i am still not pleased with the information display on the cubes
it is way too difficult to view daily information and move from month to month to observe historical heat rate liquidations and $/mwh price liquidations
the tables on the top need to have dates and summary info
please assemble a project team to make the data more user friendly
thanks
we should value the project
a combined cycle in eastern ny may make sense
stuart zisman will be your contact
yes
that's correct
sorry
but with matthew coming back that same weekend
it just isn't going to work
have fun
i need a presentation prepared for this meeting with lay and skilling
it should be very straight forward with a demand picture by region and supply picture by region
maps with the regional reliability councils noted and overall supply/demand from 0 to 0 should be the basis for the presentation
maps and graphs are very useful
the presentation should be very macro in scope
i would work with gasill's group to make the presentations for gas and power somewhat similar
the date works fine
for the 0th presentation
i need the following
a pictorial description of power generation sources
0
nuclear 0
coal 0
resid steam unit 0
gas combined cycle 0
gas simple cycle 0
hydro i would like to show annual demand by customer segment
residential
commercial
industrial
for the east
west
and ercot and supply by generation type for the same major areas
a table which shows mwh consumption by demand segment and generation supply by source would be useful
in addition
total capability by supply source some of this same info can be used for the 0th presentaiton
as i discussed with joe deffner
the duke transaction we recently completed
loan in a commodity deal
we were unable to get the
exception language
for collateral
we did the transaction at libor
0bp and even when we add 0-0 bp for the cost of an lc
the transaction still provided a competitive source of cash
the confirms we sent incorrectly placed the
exception language
and i am correcting that today
i would like to discuss se desk head opportunity with you
i have spoken with jim and he has given me clearance to talk with you
i would like to meet this afternoon if possible
sounds good
i'll see ya at 0:0
i would like to discuss a term trading job in east power
i have talked with fallon he is ok with me talking to you
do you have time to meet later today
0:0 pm
or tommorow
what do you expect
enron is one of the top 0 companies in the world
i am not interested
dave duran may have interest and i will forward this e-mail to him
on the new phone card
some later date
please include rogers herndon
jeff richter
tim belden and anthony dayou under retail risk management
new category on the card
thanks
please drop by to give me an update
remember we need positions broken down by component
retail gen
reg gen
ancillaries
tariff
etc
and positions by customer
we also need p&l by component and by customer
thanks
i am not aware of the is rfp at all
our orig group provides zero info
i will forward to ed baughman
who is working on this
fyi
i used to get an e-mail every day with the component var
i would like to start receiving this again
i would like hard copy executive summaries of all of the rto orders
i do not agree with this approach
we are so busy managing stacks which could lead to someone forgetting to inform settlements to send a termination letter which would then kill the trade
i strongly object to your recommended approach
the curve sheet is fine
but i totally diagree with the morning report and demand forecast
i would not give these to the risk group
let's discuss this in our monday meeting
in general
though
your approach seems reasonable to me
i'm good for $0
you can collect next time you are in houston
i like your approach
would the norfolk location fill the ui short as well so we could potentially get a double benefit
your welcome
my wife's uncle died of luekemia approx 0 months ago
how are we precluded from extending our current contract
i never agreed to that
that's bs
no problem
i need to know by mid-week
if possible
thanks
fine
none that i am aware of
we need to take positions that support our long term view of competitive energy markets for all consumers
you need to go through don black and anthony dayou
0:0 is good
should i expect good news
i'm meeting with suarez at 0:0
i can meet with you at around 0:0
sound ok
thanks for the update
you are doing a great job and i appreciate you all your hard work
i don't have to worry about any of the administrative issues
and that makes my job much easier
have fun on the trips and make sure you and amy get well
thanks again
right now
all of our trades are fixed price at a specific hub
we will be moving to basis markets in some locations in the very near future
no problem
he can expense it
i need 0 additional tickets for the washington game that are next to my 0 season tickets
i will call you later today to give you my amex to get the parking pass and confirm the specific seat location
patrick never called me to confirm the seats in the front row of the upper section
therefore
your message is the first confirmation i have received
thanks
please put the kinch kato e-mail address in my address book
thanks
i agree with dick
please review resume

the pricing information on the website is fine
no cash
but yes to the confidentiality agreement
does 0:0 work
please put on my calender
can you please add rogers to the interview list
i like dale as a candidate to run the urm desk
given that jay lewis has expressed interest in moving into a marketing role under dave
janet
we very much need a solid sr
person to run this group
i understand the west is trying to get one of jay's people to come to portland
is dale a candidate to run both groups
if jay leaves
we are big time short
agreed
louise indicated that credit has agreed to allow credit-worthy counterparties to trade through 0
the following are the counterparties east power would like to have 0 access on eol
duke bp energy morgan stanley el paso williams reliant constellation merrill lynch allegheny please let me know asap who gets approved and when eol will grant trading rights
thanks
that is very possible because calpine was selling 0 and 0 natty early yesterday
can you make sure and attend
thanks
i have been assuming around 0k
talk to you later
stuart zisman can answer this question
congrats
please approve access
they have agreed to grant us access
i granted access to power curves based on the understanding they would grant full access to all coal curves
per gary hickerson
kevin mcgowan
egm agreed to make all coal curves
including prb
available to power desk if we provided the power curves to the equity group
therefore
please ensure we receive this info in a timely manner
thanks
i want our var to be accurate on all accounts and i will settle for nothing less
please send me the cd
thanks
what is this
i need until friday to get this done
this has been the busiest trading week of the year
thanks
i will have tj set up and lloyd attend
thanks
please place on calender
yes i would like to attend meeting regarding nrg deal and let's have a position meeting this afternoon at 0:0
does that work
i will keep my ears open for zone j and g markets
pjm east markets are rarely shown except for summer spreads which are now $0-0/mwh
approx
for 0 and 0
i have a fundies mtg
with skilling at 0:0 and i should be done by 0:0
let's plan on 0:0 for nrg in my office and positions meeting after at whatever location works for you
sounds good
if you need anything from me
let me know
who does janel work for now
that's fine
yes we need prb 0 and prb 0 curves
my agreement with egm was coal curves in exchange for power curves
heather
if i don't get the prb coal curves by the end of this week
i will have to remove access to our power curves
please print the agenda for myself and fax copy to evelyn
thanks
thanks for the note and good luck
i was told 0:0 pm
thanks
no problem
yes
my brother
i'm sure there will be a long line of requests
if we have any extras
i will throw them your way
i am locking up all of the hourly leads and having a discussion with them regarding there top performers and contract status this week
it is becoming increasingly difficult to put non-managers under contract
so that is my challenge for the hourly group
having said that
i concur with your suggestions
i am assuming you are presenting narsima and edith there promotion and contract packages
please confirm
glad to hear it
fyi
we would prefer physical rights that we can take day-ahead and/or real-time
0 minutes ahead
if possible
rather than an obligation
like ftr's
we prefer an option
spread on pricing that can only be positive when exercised
i would want to condition the transaction on having one rto in the ne with lmp pricing in effect for the entirie ne market on or before 0/0/0
assuming we get over those hurdles
this would likely be viewed as a capital project internally
fixed cost structure
therefore
we need to earn a minimum of 0% expected return
after credit
obviously
there is a huge unknown on the ct vs
long island forward curve with the changing market conditions
this makes pricing this deal extremely difficult
particulary with the returns we would need to show
call me with any additional questions
only if nuclear fuel storage problems persist
the nuclear fleet
if unencumbered by nrc or spent fuel storage problems
will operate at 0-0%
0% during non-refueling years and 0% during re-fueling years
remember re-fuelings are now on a 0 month cycle and the next big cycle is spring and fall of 0
the 0 re-fueling outages are actually less than normal
i hear you on the liquidity rogers
with rob making those markets effective next monday
he is on vacation
we will find out if term liquidity is possible
please trust me on this issue
you will see a significant difference within weeks
not months
at a minimum
you will at least have price discovery through 0 on calenders
they may be $0 wide in new york
but that is better than no market
keep pushing on this issue
with the volatility in the ne over the past two weeks
i'm sure you understand our reluctance on term markets in these illiquid areas
as far as 0 or 0 quotes for e pjm and/or ny
i have heard no markets today and neither has dana
the pool is blowing up as we speak
i would pick the one with the highest return and put 0% in
most likely stable asset fund
they mitigated the shit out of prices
our pepperhill project was dispatched at $0/mwh the whole day
please review
is there a value proposition for us
rogers is meeting with janet to sell this concept
if necessary
i will follow-up
if they are all in the coal group and we get all of the coal curves and transport curves
then the answer is yes
make sure we get something in writing
what is the appropriation risk
we still need something in writing from janet
with your retail short position in pjm
i assume we are short icap as well
we should have your guys or ader
company follow-up on the 0 mw that is available
hopefully
it is in e pjm
yes
i think so
he works for duran
do you need to me to do something
we liked alton
he was a very hard worker
we ranked him 0 or 0
do i need to attend
we should not have fairley at this meeting
good luck john
i appreciate your praise and wish you success in your future professional endeavors
i think we finally have everthing
thanks
how's everything going
give me a call when you get a chance
good info
thanks billy
yes
absolutely
please call lloyd will to get access to our new intranet site which has an unbelievable amount of data on historical prices
loads
new gen
hdd's
cdd's
outages
etc
our new fundies group is 0% better in terms of data quality and presentation
are we using this load now
could you please enter the following paine webber account reps into my address book
include phone
e-mail
thanks
i have book positions in the ne market and am very comfortable with our curves through 0 in all of these markets
nepool came off very hard today
$0.0/mwh through 0
while the ny markets were off only $0.0
$0.0/mwh
i am paying close attention to these markets given the corporate risk and i don't see any marks unreasonable given where 0 and 0 are actually trading
again
i will continue to monitor as we work toward integrating the positions
thanks
please send me a resume before i agree to any meeting
i keep the curves very tightly controlled due to proprietary reasons
i lose control of who has access outside my group
therefore
i have chosen to not make it available
eol has prices in all markets through 0 which should be all you need to perform your analysis
that's fine
i thought we already did this
yes
power risk management is more appropriate
trading is the closest to risk management
we are in jail in off-peak as well and are trying to buy
most regions have markets on-line through 0
tva
ent
cinergy
com-ed
in ny
there is zero liqidity for off-peak
pjm west has pretty decent liquidity through 0
i hope this helps
our marks are fine
at least through 0 where we occasionally see #'s
i don't think it's appropriate to shut down anything
we need to price the product properly and off-peak needs just as much margin as on-peak given the increase in coal prices and the effects of load growth
rather than shut down products
increase the price to reflect the current risk in the market
we are chipping away at our off-peak position day by day and we have bought some nymex coal
am i making sense
in addition
i am working with doug to buy 0x0 from fpl in north texas
for both desks
we will probably have to pay $0.0-0.0 spread to get 0-0 year 0x0 deal done
with respect to ne
the outright prices are much higher and resid is the marginal unit for off-peak
therefore
in some ways the risk is easier to manage
i just told dana to get ne off-peak on-line for 0 and 0
good question
we need to shift as of a specific date with fixed load obligations in the ews retail books
could you please take care of this for me today
thanks
agreed
please handle for me asap
thanks
good info
consistent with reports from mcgowan
i am now short 0 at $0/ton and long 0-0 at $0.0/ton
love the spread given my view of natty
since the report is almost identical to info i have received from mcgowan
i don't see any pressing need to call alan
you are certainly free to call him if you want
i lost $0 million in new deal p&l putting the spread on because they have their curves so srewed up
with respect to your question
i think the answer is yes because i can sell 0 on-line by controlling the stack
limit orders
and the coal group will sell 0-0 at $0/ton
i now own this at $0 because they mis-mark their curve in 0 by $0.0/ton
ie negative $0 million in new deal p&l
the bottom line is it was painful putting that spread on
totally agreed
it is an absolute joke down there
having any luck
look at my coal markets
i defer to dana on this issue
should be dana davis
no problem
i can't think of any of their employees i would want
did you check with liz
i will do carson and juan
i am having juan do all of his se hourly group
with respect to forney
i will either do myself or have doug do it
let's try the alternative
thanks
by friday
we should be above 0%
thanks alot for the info
look forward to hearing from you
thanks
williams will have weather model and research material several minutes before the general market
universities receive the data before the market and this alliance will get the weather data to williams as if they were part of the university
any thoughts
please put in my address book
yes
lavo and louise are both aware
this is a lateral transfer
eric will be working directly for fletch
you have the right kevin presto
i have been employed at enron now for almost 0 years
i currently oversee the company's power trading and marketing business in the eastern us
unfortunately
i spend entirely too much time at work
but i love the job and enron's culture in general
how are you doing
i have not seen any of my tri-city classmates in many years
i think the last time i saw you was at mark bayless
wedding
0-0
if my memory is correct
where is your job located and what work have you done with enron
canes play penn state at college station and the natty market made a new low today
give me a call this weekend
i'm taking the fellas out for drinks this afternoon
let's try to get 0 playoff tickets for the desk
please print and save for our lake mcqueeney trip
we should plan a mid-september trip to new braunfels
check to see if king or herndon know him from their days at dynegy
i am not going to make an into-gtc market
i'm going to make an on the gtc market which is significantly different
i do not want to educate the market on the difference
how is brian butler a
0
if all you have received is positive feedback
thanks
with respect to narsima
i agree with rogers
with respect to steve wang and guatum gupta
please work directly with harry and dana
i am continuing to push responsibility down to the desk heads and that includes personnel issues
thanks
i am interested in lakefront property on lake travis which is within 0 hour drive of houston
given the technology sector meltdown
i am looking to
bottom fish
for lakefront property that provides great long term real estate value
please feel free to e-mail me with
value
opportunities that come up
i did not find your cd-rom user friendly and i prefer e-mails with attached property listings that meet my requirements
i am looking to spend 0-0k for lakefront property that has previously sold in the 0-0k range
thanks
rogers
are we are discussing the phoenix project at this wednesday's meeting
is terry going to be there
sounds like you are as busy as i am
yes
my parents still live in the same house in kennewick
my dad retired from teaching in wa
collecting wa retirement
and has been teaching in hermiston
or for the last 0 years
just to clarify
enron's international business model and north american business model are quite different
i work in the enron north american business unit which has been extremely profitable and has pioneered the deregulation of the natural gas and electricity markets in the us
enron na's focus has been on creating efficient wholesale markets in gas
power
crude
pulp
paper
metals
etc and then providing the market with a logistical delivery and price risk management intermediation function
we are very cost effective in this function because we achieve huge scale and scope in the market with minimal fixed costs
enron's international business model
on the other hand
entailed constructing capital intensive infrastructure power and gas projects with leveraged project financing
with project financing supported by long term sales to government utilities
this model is ok provided the business risk
currency risk
international risk
change in law risk
legal risk
etc
is priced properly by the debt and equity providers
i will let you conclude which business model is better
i think you will see enron applying our successful na model into the international markets that have an economy and regulatory environment that supports a
free-market
model
later
i have both days on my calender
i'll get tj to resolve
thanks
thanks jay
as usual
your position is way too logical
do i need to attend this meeting
my understanding is that shell can put them back to calpine
remember
the deal was an all-requirements supply deal for all of shell's retail obligations in ercot which are now zero
i will handle the non-tva serc deals until john suarez joins the group
are we sure we can live with everything else in the pjm single rto proposal
any interest in attending
i read the proposal last night
and although it is not perfect
it is a big improvement over what we have today
therefore
i
and my team
support enron's endorsement of the pjm proposal
with your timeline condition
thanks for all your good work
you should attend if you think you will get value from it
what is the exact delivery point
does it include capacity
is it a daily call
monthly call
all options are quoted by harry arora
i want only firm delivered ld offers for this position
please make this clear in our proposal and make sure the volume shape is exactly the same as our jea obligation
thanks
you've got that right
i'm am short all of the power and am getting frustrated
i am breaking all of the trading rules by ignoring the price action which continues to be somewhat bullish in power
there seems to be very solid fixed price support at these lower levels
in particular
the ne markets refuse to go down despite the fact that benson has been a fairly aggessive seller the past two days in the 0 and 0 period
for the 0st time in a couple of weeks
however
the cash market is showing signs of weakness
overall
i am very bearish and my position reflects that
like you
i have worn some curveshift the past month
the source sink issue continues to be a huge thorn in our side and costs my group significant $'s every year
i estimate $0-0 million per year is lost by our cash traders every year due to the inflexibility in the daily and weekly market
therefore
we should continue to fight this issue hard to rectify as soon as possible
thanks
no
i generally agree with your approach
we may be able to assign our contracts to a competitor and actually get paid
because of margin in contract vs
current market
particularly if competition is not pricing this risk or choosing to ignore it
potential candidates are green mountain
new power co
txu
etc
any thoughts
fine
i don't need to attend
thanks
any assignment would have to be confidential
i don't view an assignment any different than the unwinds that we are currently doing directly with the customer
if there is a positive npv trade
we should do it
assignment
maybe the wrong word
maybe we can transfer the ercot switching risk to another supplier or back to the customer
can you please make sure kim melodick attends my meeting with jim homco that i believe is scheduled for tommorow afternoon at 0:0 pm
if kim cannot attend
i need to move the meeting to a time when she can be there
thanks
yes
we probably can because esca is the vendor and we have a great relationship with them
i will ask doug and/or forney to follow-up
please follow-up with ercot iso and/or esca to find out if there is a technical limitation with the software
can we please get an inside opinion on the
real
issue and the
real date
so we can properly assess wholesale and retail risk as a company
doug and rogers
please work together on who is going to take the lead so don't have two different enron people inquiring
we may also want to consider using tholan's intelligence group
please call me and i will give you the real story
i don't want to put it in an e-mail
we need to make it our responsibility so we have consistent tools applied in all of the markets
this transaction was never in the trading books and all p&l and decision-making was within the origination group
i may have recommended that ozzie buy the balance of year coal
however
all $ impacts and decisions were within the control of orig/corp development
therefore
heather
ozzie and don miller are the parties that must deal with any of the contractual issues and intra-company monetary issues
sounds good
is this relevant information
the average guy has no idea what is coming
t&d costs are going to explode and so is wholesale power
increased o&m
security
employees
capital improvements
risk premium
etc
i'm fine with this approach
thanks
sounds like a solid no
i am missing an enron 0,0 share sale from monday of last week
the sale has not shown up in my on-line
holdings
report as it normally does
i am assuming this will be corrected today
thanks
does it retain my custom profile
does this mean yes
what is zydeco
no to chinese
i say we don't make any changes until we get in the new building and we will have a better feel for the vendors
please get info from lloyd
i did a spread today with arnold
sold 0,0 mmbtu/day of cal 0 bought 0,0/mmbtu/day of cal 0 paid $0.0/mmbtu for the spread
let's discuss tommorow
i talked with john today and he wanted me to remind you about the e-mail you voluntered to write regarding the transition of site profile accountability back to ees
if you recall
we decided on a 0-0 month transition with some sort of drop dead accountability for all p&l risks associated with the site profile/dsm positions
do you remember this
if so
john and i did not receive the e-mail
what time are we meeting
for files/calender
not at all
please attend
however
we will need a bigger room
can you coordinate with tj to make this happen
thanks
with respect to east power markets
i would like a fixed monthly premium in addition to the wider bid/offer in return for refco's access to our markets
thanks for the heads up
i will forward this e-mail to eol and legal
i understand his point
fyi
looks like pira will be releasing a bearish material balance and 0 gas price outlook soon
any recommendations to correct this
please attend meetings 0 and 0 and provide meeting summaries directly to rika for internal distribution
thanks
fyi
thank you
see you this saturday at 0:0 am
christi is leading the se rto initiative
as far as meeting
tommorow at 0:0 works for me
please confirm with tj at 0-0
thanks
can you please coordinate this meeting to ensure it is productive
we may need an initial screening mtg
to assess whether the tool can help us from a fundamental/trading standpoint
thanks
i will pay $0k over the mid-curve
morgan and jea will be your best counterparties
i would proceed by showing them a bid for the shaped obligation that is flat to our mid
thus leaving you with 0k of orig value
before we show a written or verbal bid
please get approval from me
thanks
have they started construction
is the plant a peaker or combined cycle
i think they are probably pricing calls vs
cancelling the project
after reviewing our position in more detail
we are quite long mwh's in the ne market
therefore the 0 year 0x0 pjm east bid
0-0 mw
would be closer to $0-0/mwh below the current mid
additional purchases above 0 mw would be discounted further for var and liquidity reasons
with respect to florida
i would still pay the mid for cal 0
shaped like jea short
and mid minus $0.0/mwh for 0 mw of calender 0-0
as i mentioned in the meeting
ees/ews would also provide a bid for icap/ancillary services in pjm and nepool where the company has existing short positions
i suggest setting up a meeting with all of my desk heads after your meeting with refco
at that point in time
you can provide an overview of the deal structure and we can talk about east power requirements
no
my understanding was we were going to give them curve access
i never agreed to give them the fundies data
let's go ahead and release
please provide an analyst to support this effort
this information will benefit both ews and ees as we move toward combining the genco/control area/unit dispatch function in the new building
you may want to request additional support from jim meyn's group
as this will ultimately effect structuring valuation
how exactly are we exposed
as most of you know
nrg's proposed purchase of two coal plants in conneticut
ui's territory
was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at ferc
the purchase and sale transaction between wisvest and nrg was originally entered into almost two years ago
the proposed purchase price of $0 million for 0 mw of coal was a
bargain price
at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of ct
over the past 0-0 years
the state of conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they
puked
the plants to nrg for $0/kw in early 0
at a minimum
it is expected that $0-0/kw of scr and/or scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the ct regulatory bodies
my strong view is that
as a practical matter
the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in ct
the area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire eastern interconnect
the load pocket is significantly short mw and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area
in a true
locational marginal price
environment
the prices would likely be similar to zone j in new york currently
pricing in nepool is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads
regardless of who causes the congestion
in the recently proposed
single ne rto
model
it is about 0% certain that the pjm
locational marginal price
market model will be implemented sometime between mid-0 and mid-0
at that point in time
consumers in the congested areas of nepool
in-city boston and ct
will be exposed to higher energy prices
while consumers in maine
new hampshire
and rhode island should see lower prices
given the facts above
coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets
i think ews should pursue discussions with wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in nepool and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset
node
if we could buy these plants for approx $0/kw with $0/kw of environmental upgrades
the resulting
all-in
depr
fixed
variable o&m
fuel costs
nox
so0
capital reserve
interest
0x0 plant cost would be approx
$0-0/mwh
this is lower than our energy only socialized nepool curve
additional upside is derived from positive basis
icap
ancillary services
emissions allowances
and long term requirements sales to lse's
lavo and louise
this could be the
alberta ppa
for 0
lots of
hair
but lots of upside
any thoughts
they are pursuing because i requested to pursue
the reason for the e-mail is to place management emphasis on this opportunity
could you please make sure this is on my calender and ensure that jeff keenan and dave duran are also aware of this meeting
thanks
thanks for the info mike
our real-time market is a complete piece everywhere
$0-0/mwh
generators are beginning to puke mw again
my management book is going to take this $0.0 million hit
the loss is part of the $0.0 million
the loss occurred due to generator repairs
fyi
i talked to him this morning and feels comfortable with his marks
he is long
so he better
like i told you yesterday
i wouldn't hesitate to to be more aggressive on the front in ercot
particularly in the north where doug is long
i'll keep you posted
looks like ader
co
at work in ercot
i view this as a big problem
these customers need to be covered by wholesale
both of you should take this as a slap in the face
we are losing lots of deals in ercot on price
this is part of the reason they are being so aggressive with customers and alternative suppliers
i have received this feedback directly from rogers and janet
make sure rogers is at this meeting
full access of the complete portal should be limited to core contract employees only
we have a scaled down version that we have made available to the marketing group
i bought 0,0 mmbtu/day of cal 0 nymex ng at 0.0 and 0.0 from arnold this afternoon
excellent update mike
we have good momentum with some key
players
on the ropes
i view the next two months as critical in moving the midwest to one functional market
i am getting more like you every day
given what's going on in ees right now
i don't trust anyone
therefore
i am going to allow access to the portal to only ews employees that you are comfortable with
obviously
this includes dale
with respect to the rest of the ees group
i am not going to grant access until the entire organization is doing the right thing for enron's shareholders
please grant full access to dale furrow in retail risk management
dale is a vp under contract and is a key member of the retail risk management staff
with respect to the urm employees under dale
please grant them the more limited access
with respect to the ees employees
ozzie
beth
greg woulfe
i do not want any access granted at all
no interest
how many days do i have left
please follow-up with this guy
looks like a retail load aggregator looking for wholesale supply
please send an e-mail to
experience enron
and let them know the tours need to be conducted as far away from the trading floor as possible and limited to no longer than 0 minutes
i don't want any of our screens visible to the customers
not matter who they are
thanks
i have been getting lots of requests from our friends
i'm just giving you a heads up
i have no problem with the urm group
unless
of course
they become part of ees
you are right
they are on crack
this would be at least $0.0/mwh over cin
they have gas deliverability issues in the winter and there alternative fuel is no
0 oil
therefore
cpl east is a big premium nov-mar
the bid/offer for this location is large due to transmission risk
i will attend only if the whole group is represented
gas
oil
west power
and east power
once we have confirmation for all relevant parties
please let me know
you can count me in
we can have 0 hours of ees bashing
thanks
please provide my asst
tj black @ 0-0
with meeting time and location
your thoughts on this guy for se cash and/or term spread trader
john
what about eric benke
did you review his resume
late afternoon
have fletch and myself interview
he has already been in here for one interview
do these look reasonable
what are the costs charged to fundies
the allocations are confusing to me
i am having lloyd will review
sold 0 contracts per month of feb-mar 0 at 0.0 sold 0 contracts per month of nov-dec 0 at 0.0
bought cal 0 at 0.0
please coordinate with kay to set up a time that works for both of us
0:0 pm tomorrow is good
i told tj to coordinate with you
0:0 pm is fine tommorow
please confirm with tj
i have a conflict on my calender
i can meet at 0:0 only on thursday and will be out on friday
we'll see
lakes on eldridge subdivision
0 morning breeze
as a follow-up to our meeting on saturday
i talked with the designer of my house
todd rice with rice residential design
and the electrical plan is not on a cad system
the electrical plan was hand drawn
if you need a copy of the plan
my preference is that you deal directly with todd and his staff as i am very busy during the week
todd rice rice residential design 0 katy freeway
i don't like the 0nd bullet
not positive enough
we are the dominant player in the power market
with respect to volumes for term trades
the risk group will have to provide that to you
i can tell you that the volumes have increased in the term market by a significant factor
at least 0 times relative to last year
this has not been booked
i was told q0
what is this
sounds like he might fit in the lmp/transmission/congestion management group
as i mentioned
we are attempting to create an eastern interconnect lmp model to model congestion in every region
this will lead to the creation of hubs and basis markets
ravi might be a good fit for this group
we are already completely full
in fact
we are already 0 seats short for my own group
thanks for the info heather
in terms of forward curve
entergy is the worst place to be long assets right now
the equipment is probably of more interest as it relates to a packaged development for the midway project in florida
please provide me with the latest hard copy so i can have one final meeting with my direct reports to get final confirmation for east power seating
thanks
please make the following revisions to the peak and off-peak position reports
remove ercot wind position completely from the report
ppa has been terminated
add ercot north zone positions add ercot south zone positions show separate positions for fl/ga border and fpl/frcc add pjm-east positions
show separate from pjm-west
off-peak position still shows serc-fl
this location no longer exists
florida positions are either fl/ga or fpl/frcc
thanks
let's sit down and talk
i think we should fill from within our current desk
i have some ideas
roundtable meeting
do we have 0 or 0
ask him if scherer 0,0,0 and/or 0 would work
let him know that an odd lot would command a $0.0-0.0/mwh premium on top in addition
even if we used scherer
it would be from any one of the facilities therefore the transmission would need to be able to use any of the scherer units as a source
there should be no credit on a tva/cin spread
the correlation between the 0 markets is 0% plus
will he let us go hourly at least 0 times per month and change the source if we go hourly
this essentially would require they provide parking and lending for up 0 mw in the cal and 0 mw in the june-sept
can we at least get a 0 mw block in the june-sept period
please put on my calender
he is a definite hire
i thought i communicated that last week
i did not realize we were going to reserve on spreads which create zero net position and almost zero credit risk
the new forward correlations are 0+% per the var model and it looks like your credit model is still using the old correlations
i would like asap
by new building
a huge wall map with the logical rto boundaries that has all of the large generators and substations
nodes in lmp
and lse's territory color coded
this will become the tour location with a description of the regional markets and the energy hubs within those super regions
it will also help our traders get accustomed to electrically significant areas whether than nerc regions
good luck
we need the hourly option to allow for non-gtc sources
but we will deliver into-gtc border hourly
we don't need gas at this point
but we should be planning to add this
notice on the tags when we go hourly could be 0 minutes or less
additionally
if we use them as sink when we go hourly
they will have to be part of the day-ahead tag
if these issues are not crystal clear with them
i have no interest in even showing an offer
are all of these units in our database
please follow-up with this gentleman
never know
i need to leave at 0:0 today to go to my stepson's football game
unfortunately
i have a 0:0 and 0:0 meeting already
is this just a general catch-up discussion
what time works for you guys
florida might be a better location than new jersey
can you say sunshine
ok
he's making his rounds
i believe he is talking with corp risk and reck
i get the impression he doen't want to be anywhere near an energy commodity that has a relationship with power
which
of course
is all of them
no
please participate and give group overview
thanks
i'm $0 bid for this spread in cal 0
thanks
from east power's perspective
the east pjm development site is the only site/turbine of interest and we should pursue pending transmission analysis to ensure the site is within the congested area of east pjm
outstanding
as usual
you are the king
what other offer
i would support this 0%
it is consistent with the direction that whalley
lavo
and delainey are headed with the retail risk management group
do you know this gentleman
suarez is high on him
resume looks impressive
we should definitely interview him
i forwarded e-mail to louise to see if she knows the guy from her london gas trading days
i give bankruptcy 0/0
we'll go after him
tj has my calender
just about any afternoon will work with this group
i'll pay the extra $'s
i would like no
0 in the new garage
we need an immediate legal review to see what are on-going $ risks are in ercot
the deficiency of $0 is no big deal when they allocate to all of the qse's on a pro-rata basis
however what if the deficiency is $0 million and we our pro-rata share is $0 million
do we have any legal recourse
do they suspend the deficient qse immediat
why can't we use aep's position against them in their own backyard
ohio
aep's position is that you can't have effective retail markets without real-time energy markets
which i agree with
yet there is no real-time energy market with ancillary clearing prices in aep's service territory in ohiocan we use their own testimony against them
rika and lloyd
this is work in progress with a realistic completion date of may 0
i don't understand this e-mail
can you please set up a meeting and we can discuss
pm call with the whole group
including suarez
can you find a date that works for everyone
looks fine
ader has managed to get cross-wise with another good employee
ader's
supply group
has essentially stolen roger's approved ercot lse accounts
rogers needs these lse accounts to serve load in ercot and now he has none
this is bs and should not be tolerated
i talked to giffels today and he mentioned that songs units are under serious security scrutiny given its location
he gave us a 0/0 probability that indian pt 0&0
0 minutes north of ny city
and pilgrim
0 minutes north of boston
would be shut down in the near term for security reasons
he mentioned that songs was also a candidate
i personally don't think the probability is that high
nonetheless
the rumors seem to be in the market
thank you very much for the nice gift
and
of course
the $0
i appreciate you girls putting up with me and doing a great job for the whole floor
thanks again
i told tj the phone interview needs to be in the afternoon
no way will 0:0 work
we need a 0 or 0:0 pm phone interview
preferably tommorow
can you please coordinate with tj
0 soco trades yesterday
0 already this morning
they have over 0 mw at wansley over 0 coal plants and 0 gas turbines
in cc
they can offer ld at this location
i am interested in firm ld fixed price energy delivered at the gannon bus-bar
i have no appetite for unit contingent in the current market
teco has an entire system they can lean on
i would consider bringing the gas
but you would have to involve scott neal's desk for transport and valuation becomes complicated
with respect to volume
i would not want any more than 0 mw
my strong preference is fixed price energy
no toll
volatility is getting smashed and it doesn't make sense to pay for vol in a spread option
we are a much better bid for 0x0 or 0x0 energy
my phone interviews are complete
please send someone to pick up my forms
garret tripp would be better able to answer your questions for the canada nuclear facilities
with respect to forward hedging in the us
we have never seen british energy hedge anything
i believe they have transition contracts with the utilities they purchased the plants from
the meeting has been moved to tommorow at 0:0 am
we can discuss these issues before the meeting
i will show him a 0 mw block
i want to make sure the info is protected and if legal and regulatory are comfortable
then i am
probably andy fastow
his personal hurdle rate is 0%
no
no problem
the only problem right now is ene's stock price
wow
you get em
we have some serious issues
downgrade
collateral called
liquidity crisis
issue more equity
i can see $0 pretty easy
i think both lay and fastow are gone
do you know this guy
have hgp attend
get him in the door
work with kim melodick in hr to make it happen
looks fine
you need to start learning
work with kim
i have sent the message again to make curves as accurate as possible through 0
we are doing are best
the entergy situation was simply a back office mistake
the ny off-peak is a work in progress and will get better every day
the legs never trade
only the cals
therefore
we have to use common sense for month values
thanks for the info
in most cases
narsima is exactly right
i agree with this approach and i'm fine with this allocation
my objective is to get everything as accurate as possible so the proper price signal is being sent to retail and wholesale origination
i caught the scalar issue when we were looking at 0 hour tolls vs
0 hour tolls vs
0 hour and i could tell there was a disconnect
thanks
are we making sure everything is done on our end to liquidate and manage the ees retail positions effective 0/0/0
probably wayne herndon
we need to lock him down asap
you and i need to have a beer this week to discuss ene in general and what you want to do next
let's go tonight
i have a staff mtg
at 0:0 pm and we can go after that
does this work for you
please proceed with stacey on taking the prudency you are comfortable with
stacey will have to get approval from louise and/or lavo
thanks
no need to copy trading
thanks
we can't make a daily capacity market in the current environment
as of 0:0 am
east power has sold approx
0-0 gas contracts and bought approx
0 million mwh's
just morgan stanley requiring tighter credit terms so far
jeff shorter
your counterpart at txu
just called me to inform me they will not be trading with enron until further notice
they are evalutating their net exposure with us
including london
his number is 0-0-0
i would have interest if you package together 0-0 mw of these small units to create a more liquid block of power
i would not pay alot for this given the transmission issue
the best place for park and lend is jea
we need to do what the contract says
no one knows what the real intent was
see you monday
please attend
we are not to discuss credit issues with any counterparties
i'll defer to you and lloyd on this one
it's the trader's option
most will probably not attend
the time is right in the middle of trading on an aga day
therefore
it is unlikely that anyone managing a stack will be able to attend
i would suggest having tom may and/or lloyd attend
agreed
as far as i'm concerned
we are arbing the market
no
we buy and sell where we see value
we don't even look at the other exchanges
i would treat it as business as usual
if we are still having associate/analyst super saturday
we certainly can attend an energy panel discussion
can i get a deal like that for my house
wow
i'll be here until about 0:0 today
wednesday is the worst day due to aga
we normally trade until 0:0 pm on aga days
therefore
i would suggest tuesday or thursday
please have mark call me at work today
my phone # is 0-0-0
thank you
is the black cover going to be removed so other employees know the spot is reserved
we have a meeting with evans automation next saturday 0/0 at 0:0 am
near kemah
please mark the calender
thanks
posoli work phone
0-0-0
very efficient cc gas units in entergy and ercot are setting price
midwest and plains has gas setting price 0-0 hours per day and coal the remaining 0 hours
the ne markets
ny and nepool
are the only markets with 0,0 hr gas units setting price across the entire peak
keep in mind that current temps are truly
no load
temps for east power
no heating or cooling demand
the addition of new combined cycle units in our market have been destructive to forward heat rates
later
i'm fine with it
they will only see through cal 0 though
please set up a time with my asst
to discuss job opportunities in east power
bring a hard copy of your resume
make sure we are crystal clear on being able to fill this position physically at any vepco interface
hourly or day-ahead
and the pjm/vepco pjm lmp index is for pricing only
the ld should be the hourly index
the ld calc should be the hourly index and we need to eliminate the peak day designation damages
dana is interested in talking to jt about a scheduling and/or hourly job
i will buy 0x0 unit contingent power $0.0/mwh below my curve for 0 only for into jea delivery
i will buy firm ld at my mid for into jea delivery
my preference is normal energy only ld language
if we agree to use an index pricing point
like pjm/vepco interface
then a fair trade-off is to eliminate the capacity ratchet
none of the meetings
no interest
please e-mail me the latest east power org chart
including services and genco
thanks
we plan to be done trading at 0:0 pm on friday
thanks joe
it was a pleasure having you as part of the team
i respect you as a person and a professional and i wish you nothing but the best in your future career
please stay in touch with the team
good luck joe
i apologize for my earlier comments
everyone is having a rough time with the current meltdown of the company
i have been here 0 years and i am seeing everything i worked for coming to an end
it's not your fault and i do apologize
agreed
i sold 0,0 mmbtu/day of cal 0 nymex at 0.0/mmbtu
the hourly index is a must for me
the day-ahead index is unhedgable for us and we would give them free money for the next 0 years
it is important to understand that under the new proposed structure
vepco will call on this energy many more days than they do now and it is very important that we create an index that we can hedge
i will not due this deal based on a day-ahead index
it must be hourly at the interface we defined
please clarify your call option vs
firm delivery comment
we will not be trading on thanksgiving
however
we will have a skeleton crew in here on friday
i proposed calcing p&l on wednesday and not on friday
what do you mean only the left side
what a piece of shit this whole btu market is
your mid-offer spreads look very reasonable to me
yes
fine
agreed
i think bradford already blew up the constellation deal
thanks
sounds like you are having a blast
see ya on sunday
how about them canes
the old lady says no
so far
there is 0 power guys that will play if the game is on
no interest in pursuing this business
any value in this
i'm supposed to be in disneyworld with the family for my first vacation in two years
sorry
but i can't swing it
i usually do
but she's been holding out
please attend
i have received
yes
authorized
thanks
i am not approving any new kobra applications
this is a test
this is the retail book
not the wholesale book
you can get confirmation on this issue from bill bradford or elizabeth sager
enjoy your holiday
hopefully
we will be up and running by the new year
could you please create an org chart by function
retained employees
and org chart by function
severed employees
so we can reconcile to make sure we have not missed anyone
once we have done this
we can create a seating plan that is optimal
please e-mail me the org
charts so i have an electronic version
thanks
please kill this request
i get 0 everyday
thanks
that will work fine with me
the only issue i have is everytime i login i have some windows installer program i have to kill and it takes me an extra 0-0 minutes to keep closing files before i can get into my desktop
i don't know what caused this
but i am assuming some file you installed is still trying to run
in addition
the dial-up through citrix is very very slow
is this normal
any thoughts
thanks for all your work
the printer works just fine
your thoughts on this guy
please stop sending me this report
ok
tim did say he blew up trading options in the west
played the
premium is profit
game selling summer calls at palo verde and we all know what happened
bye bye ricky
you are very welcome
you have been a fantastic asst for me and could not have achieved what we have as a group without you
thanks again for all of your hard work and have a very happy holidays
i cancelled this over 0 months ago
someone might have assumed by terminal
please send me a summary
thanks
olgethorpe has officially terminated as of dec
0
0
please see attached
wisconsin's offer is a joke
carl
this is is clearly a two-way termination or they would have no offer at all
i'm assuming you understand the difference
we can buy cal-0 com-ed under $0/mwh all day long
this is a position we will deliver on to preserve the in-the money value
i would make it clear to wisconsin that we intend on delivering in january and every single month thereafter because it creates positive cash flow for the estate
we also have broker quotes that show the market is 0 at 0 for cal 0
i would accept nothing less than $0.0 million
thanks
0k/yr
wow
you get em
don
this looks good
you have my blessing to proceed with approval from the cash committee
you can reach me at home
0-0-0
if you have any additional questions
thanks
obviously
we will not deliver
or receive if we are long
if the transaction would result in negative cash flow for the estate on a
net counterparty
basis
therefore
fe and txu obligations would not be met for the 0st week of january because they result in negative cash flow
cory
please make sure going forward that we only include positive cash flow counterparties in the weekly projections
please exclude the txu and fe positions from the net position report as well
we will likely begin filling the non-pool positions starting next wednesday
jason
please send to cory
i was unable to from home
see note below
upon confirmation from portz
please remove wabash from the non-termination counterparty list
i believe wabash has also terminated
don
as you know
we had a meeting like this the week prior to christmas and had an accurate list at that time
our group can do nothing about delays between actual termination notification by the counterparty and communication to trading that termination has occurred
i think the meeting is warranted
however
we are not going to completely eliminate the timing issues
i will see you on wednesday at 0:0 pm
please keep rogers contact info for his vacation
thanks
the attached document should complement the documents sent earlier by chris calger
hopefully
the combination of the two will provide some organization and focus at our 0:0 am meeting on wednesday morning to discuss the
netco
start-up initiatives
the same attachment was sent again in case you had trouble opening the previous file
i am sending from home via the network and have been having some problems
sorry to e-mail you to death
please put on my calender and remind everyone on wednesday
thanks
fyi
attached is the spreadsheet version of the template we discussed this morning
i have added the additional columns everyone requested
i would now like the business unit leads to fill in the blanks such that we have an initial power implementation plan that can be delivered to louise on friday
with respect to east power
i am out thursday and friday
i am delegating to all of my desk heads the responsibility the following
0
have all of the forms attached spreadsheet forms complete 0
a product offering sheet is added to the template
fletch
dana
please take the lead on creating the product offering list
physical and financial
my recommendation is we put products out through 0 for all regions
financial and physical
obviously
the physical products will be contingent on receiving a power marketing license
cory and don baughman
please take a crack at identifying all of the transmission service agreements we need for the east
christi has started a list already
please call me on my cell
0-0-0
with any questions
fyi
trumped already
please send this attachment to the same list i just provided
thanks
please get final version to tammie by cob tommorow
thanks
maybe
if we truly believe this is a credit starved industry with huge liquidity problems
then we should be able to dictate the terms for dealing with a aa entity
end of story
we should send this message early and often
if we don't
the market will percieve that negotiating
one-off
terms for trading docs is acceptable
i disagree with this approach from a long term philosophical standpoint
we either believe our bullshit or we don't
attached are dana's additions
please print a copy of each for me
yes
please incorporate dana's changes into the master
do you already have this list
please send all templates to chris calger
elizabeth sager
and mitch robinson
thanks
all east traders will have east only trading rights except for me
with respect to regions
assume the same organization as we ended with in early november
the one change is rogers in the se along with suarez
and carson
mw
fletch
russell
and jason se
rogers

schneider remember
all of the desk heads will have gas trading authority as well
none of the prompt month cash traders will be trading gas
i want to make sure we get the hardware and software
i agree that this is already the property of ena
into netco like we have the rest of the software/hardware critical to the trading organization
the payable is sunk and should be left with the estate
whoever has the latest aggregated implementation template
please forward copy
copies
to tj so i can review the consolidated lists for
regulatory trading agreements transmission service agreements eol products tj
please follow-up to make sure i get the latest version
thanks
please save and print for me
please print and save file for me
christi nicolay and sarah novosel are the two best regulatory people
in terms of pushing the timing
political clout is going to be more important which in the past would have come from kean and lay
obviously
that will not work anymore
i have a good relationship with larcamp
ferc head of staff
and might be able to help with the politics
i think ferc is going to want to hear directly from the new owner
if we want speed
i recommend we use the expertise of christi and sarah combined with the overall political clout of the new owner
you are not off base with steffes at all
shapiro is a lazier version of steffes
i concur with jim on approach with one clarification
transmission providers discussions should include both a trading rep and marketing rep
same as chris
do you want me to put docs in front of harry
rogers
and/or doug
thanks chris
i agree with the approach
it would be nice to handout a bound copy to all of the east and west trading/marketing desk heads for a thorough review to make sure we have not missed anything
see you tommorow
please cancel out the short and long km position in the holdings section
thanks
please begin scrubbing the 0 and 0 new gen book again given the current situation in the energy market
i would like a new forecast in 0 days if possible
in addition
i would like begin running the unit commitment model
dispatch
and
knock
the cob webs off everyone
let's plan on having a meeting to go over what the new daily reports were going to look like
wasn't gus working on this
what is the status of the transmission modeling
can we integrate the system dispatch and lmp simulation models
thanks
yes
that would be fine
i would also like to talk about my fixed annual fee
based on the way i trade
and the amount of asset accumulaton
i think my fee is too high
please call me about this issue so we can discuss
ok
joe holmes from idacorp
0-0-0
called and expressed interest in enron's services deals in the na
presumably in the west
don
can you have someone follow-up
thanks
can i hire martin lin back into netco from the estate
he has provided valuable transmission
dispatch modeling expertise to our fundies group
he worked for vince in research
we have lost anna santucci to cms and this would not change our headcount in the fundies group
additionally
if i was forced to cut additional bodies
most of the cuts would likely come from real-time

don't worry christi
i recognize what a great job your group did this year
it was by far the best regulatory effort
from a power perspective
with more results than any of the previous 0 years i was at enron
you and your team deserve a great deal of credit and if we can keep this team together
we will reap the benefits for years to come
the esca energy management system
ems
in an industry standard software package to provide control area services and energy accounting in compliance with nerc standards
we used the software and hardware for remotely controlling/operating/dispatching our peaker plants and also used the software in 0rd party

i hope this helps
see changes attached with one subtraction

i just sent you the promotion justifications

i have done multiple trades today and i also did several last week
please clean up my holdings page to net longs and shorts
how is your office reacting to the news about ubs acquiring our energy trading operation
thanks
i run the power group
your question should be directed to lavo
this is crazy
we should not be giving the fundy web data to the estate

i view the sharing of the fundies databases and associated web sites
gas and power
with the estate as a serious commercial issue that we should not ignore
the estate can not only use the proprietary information as a competitor in the trading business
but they could potentially sell the data to multiple competitors
i can't imagine that this data was agreed to be shared by ubs and the estate
i am not planning on giving any of the data to the estate
i feel very strongly about this issue and the rest of the commercial organization does as well
one of the keys to maintaining a competitive edge in this business is our huge headstart in this area
i would like to recommend to following allocations of retention $'s
this creates no net impact on total $'s on the spreadsheet gain 0 cash 0 equity
rogers herndon
john forney
joe wagner
tom may
re-allocate in the following manner
cash equity steffes +0k +0k
we will lose key reg people if we don't pay
please call with any questions
i feel very good about keeping nearly all of these people at the levels above and we could lose some key ones if we don't do this
again
i am not spending any additional $'s
i am simply taking from other people who will not be part of ubs
see request below
i think i can get jeff king done with a simple title change from associate director to director with no salary change
his current salary is already director level type comp
i potentially may need another 0k
but the title is a
feel good
issue that is important to jeff
please talk to doug directly on the justification
my holdings page is still not netting
i just purchased 0 dyn shares
please make sure the netting works
thanks for the heads up
this is mirant's argument
don't think it will hold water
but you never know
i support this
this wan an oversight on our part
remove
i understand
if i have too
i will dip into my money
i think the requests are reasonable and fair with respect to individual's peer group
carson is done and i just talked with suarez
i told john he needs to make his decision based on the economics in his package
0/0 is a great package for suarez
i would be uncomfortable increasing based on other areas where we may be short
good news on craw
thanks rogers
i think steve would fit in with our group well
i probably need to wait at least a week to let the dust settle on our own people issues
my guess is we will end up losing 0-0 people and outside candidates then become viable
please put allan stewart contact information
get from rogers
in my outlook contacts
home
cell
work
address
etc
and put a reminder on my calender to call him to re-establish contract relationship
also
please put a reminder to call fred giffels regarding consulting agreement and fpl
are we going to attend
fine with me if hunter and lavo can support it
i want to make sure that we are adopting a policy whereby any material changes to employment agreements for individual employees are adopted across the board so we are creating consistency for all employees with respect to contract terms and conditions
i think this is very important from an execution and timing standpoint
i want to be able to represent to employees that
lawyering
the docs to death is not necessary
because we are going to maintain consistency for all employees
i would like an affirmative yes on this question by tuesday am
does everyone agree
agreed
please put on my calender
please put steve marland's cell number in my address book
come see me tommorow morning
please put on calender and remind all desk heads to invite people who have signed up

i'm fine with it
fyi
please coordinate with hunter and belden on what we need
fletch sturm
works for me and runs the mw power group
will be following up with you or allen
we need to make sure we coordinate with gas and west power so no duplication is occurring
we need to also make sure that ubs is not already a client who receives pira materials

i personally think it is easier for us to mark curves because we have traders in every region
i simply need to make it a priority again
i can go either way
though
we definitely don't want two sets of curves
let me know
i think you are probably correct
upon closure
you will probably be marking your own curves
having said that
you should probably begin now
make sure this gets all of your attention and is done right
i think we also need retail capability in ercot
we need all historical data preserved in all markets
price
vol
trades by counterparty
volume by counterparty
broker vs
eol
broker prices
eol prices
etc
we need it w/in the first 0 days
please complete hayden's form for your respective regions
keep in mind that this could act as potential position limit set forth by ubs so be careful in completing this form
in addition
ubs has a liquidity reserve used to adjust curves when marking p&l
the
liquidity reserve
accounts for the fact you can't liquidate at the mid and with big positions you probably can't even liquidate at the bid
offer
thanks
ok
doug can have smith day and jeff miller work to get the retail certification
i think this guy should be independent from the fundies
there may be special projects that are
highly confidential
in nature that should be directed by you
hunter
tim and myself
i think robert would be more successful in a freelance role
other input
through separate desktop
yes
coordinate time with tj black
please remind me to file expense report from ct trip
in addition
please block my calender from feb 0th to 0th for florida
miami
vacation
please also change the march vacation to march 0-0
disneyworld
i agree with rogers
because only one entity can mark curves and i have once again made this a requirement for all traders to get re-acquainted with value in the market
it makes sense for netco/ubs to mark curves until the cutover occurs
at that point
both entities will assume separate responsibility
still no fix
this is all wrong
amy has latest list
this list is wrong
can you reconcile our headcount by functional group with this
incorrect
headcount
please put in contact book
based on what fletch and doug are doing
i would increase your #'s significantly
your liquidity data is very conservative compared to fletch and doug
your forward volumes are approx
0% of doug and fletch and your st data is about 0%
i would complete the form based on the liquidity we saw in aug and sept
yes
wang and stalford picked this back up yesterday
i agree with the delegation except for chris dorland
tim belden needs to determine who validates the west power curves
with respect to vol curves
steve wang and rob stalford need to validate
what time period are we validating
there is one left
net 0 dyn short with 0 dyn long
my guys are telling me that all of the broker sheets we collected are now in your hands
the validation for east power should be very easy because we collected broker quotes almost every day and marked curves nearly every day
if there are gaps
please let me know
with respect to vol curves
i am having wang and stalford go back and validate
gas or power
gas is scott neal and power is doug gilbert-smith for ercot
tx
and fletch sturm for la/al
gulf coast
the williams energy traders know these folks so these questions must be coming from non-commodity people at williams
please put russell's info in my contacts
pushkar and ellen su are not se power offers
they are offers for our interest rate books/fx books
they should not fall under power headcount
casey has a list of all the east power curves
frank
stop re-inventing the wheel
this stuff has been done already
i will be in town monday and tuesday
out wed-fri in florida
i will definitely help on monday and/or tuesday
i can make arrangements for backups later in the week if necessary
let me know
when will we close
did ubs waive the employee cp
i have already moved someone from ercot to se power
we are set
please print and put in green folder
ignore redlined version
chemistry is very important to me and i am rewarding carson for his loyalty and
low maintenance
in addition
he demonstrated much improved risk management skills that last 0 months of last year
mike
working for fletch
is very capable and will do a great job for us in the se
eric saibi will come over from ercot and run the cash books in the se
i will be happy to talk marcello to see if there is another fit
with respect to the ne
i also want to move some of the young guys up
they have worked hard for the past 0-0 months in real-time and fundies roles and deserve a chance before an outside person
obviously
coordination with gas and power fundies
rika imai and chris gaskill
is important for almost all projects unless confidentiality is necessary given the nature of the project scope
my view is no
0 is part of rika's core day to day world
no
0 and no
0 are more special project in nature and this is a gap you could help fill
i will be out wednesday through friday so we should sit down tomorrow
i sit at 0
will be moving wednesday/thursday
i can meet mid-morning tommorow
get on my calender with tj at 0
thanks
please ensure that real-time prices for ercot
pjm
ny

unfortunately the change to $0 was not the final price for deal #0 on 0/0
it should be $0 for he 0-0 and $0 for he 0-0
i have checked enpower and the sheet to make sure that they reflect these changes
if you have any questions
please let me know
thanks
bill
thanks for the information heather
this looks good and useful
would you have any information on what tools we used to settle
or was it all a manual process
rhonda
the cp
new
represents a counterparty as yet to be determined
i am working with diana scholtes on this
this deal is essentially a placeholder
i will give you the information as i receive it
thanks
bill
chris
i attached a simple sheet outlining our basic process of decremental bidding
from a real-time standpoint we are ready to implement this process immediately
i believe we have the tools in place to capture the revenue on the volume management side as well
kourtney nelson is out of the office today but will return on monday
i feel we should involve her in the process when she returns
overall
this is very similar to what we did last summer and should be relatively easy to implement
feel free to see me with questions
thanks
bill
group
we are long 0 mws 0-0 on monday in sp-0 at $0
deals should be under st-wbom
we are also long 0 mws under the st-cali book
please be sure to put this in the service sheet
other st-cali length or ees shorts will be on phil platters sheet and in caps
thanks
bill
just wanted to congratulate you guys on the excellent work on the night of the 0th
the sar was within $0 of risk managment's numbers on the daily position report
the night note looked very good
great job on the services portion
and there were zero problems with the shift
the hard work is much appreciated
keep it up
bill
anna
when you have a chance
i would like to pay you for the golf tournament and grab a receipt from you while i am at it
my impression is that the deadline is approaching and that this is something we need to get done today
please let me know when you might be available or just grab me when you have a chance
thanks

not bill williiams
thanks for the email

please add ainsley gaddis and remove daniel kang from your list when sending the spreadsheets to ees
thanks
bill
kate
take a quick look at this would you
group
going forward we will be transacting with enron canada corp on an over-the-counter basis
we will provide them with a bid and an offer suitable for buying from or selling to them non-firm energy
enron canada will contact us each morning to inquire about possiblities for export and import
we should be familiar with the alberta power pool forecast and be aware of the conversion from cdd to usd
the lead or nw trader will provide enron canada with their estimate or feel of the market
enron canada will be trying nearly every hour to obtain non-firm transmission
if this is an unwise practive from a risk-reward standpoint based on our understanding of the market
we need to tell them
as they are losing $0.0 per mw cdd on unused tranny with zero chance for return
further
enron canada wants the opportunity to transact with other counterparties at the bc border
if we cannot use their energy they have asked to be able to contact wwp
ipc or transalta after giving us first look to attempt to recoup some of their loss
i do not see a need for this and think there is potential for embarrassment and damage to customer relations
if we are in contact with enron canada before hand
start of the day
top of the hour
etc
we should be able to get them the best price for their energy
be very clear in your dealings with the nw counterparty that the energy is non-firm
determine a book-out price if necessary to solve problems with physical flow
we are basically buying a put or a call
finally
i would like to see the communication with enron canada improve
personal experience and observation has us not communicating with them as closely as possible and typically only speaking with their real-time group at the bottom
i feel we can do better
i want to prevent a repeat of this weekend
ecc selling/buying from a counterparty in the us without our knowledge
and do not want the nw being scoured by both enron canada and enron north america
this is counterproductive for both of us for obvious reasons
providing a bid/offer and being prepared to act on it is a change in our relationship with enron canada
this should force a renewed emphasis on communication and market fundamentals that should only be beneficial
if you have questions or ideas regarding the relationship with enron canada please let me know
to be sent to john zufferli
equivalent of tim b in canada
and portland shift
these schedule changes must be called in
just a reminder
bill
nikki
thanks for the note and i hope your doing well
you're right
sometimes introductions sound more like the presentation of a resume than a letter
but i think you pulled it off
i was able to close on my condo last weekend
it was a tremendous pain with a bit of the last minute run-around
but i finally got moved in on friday night
i don't know about my neighbors yet as i am the only one moved in on my floor so far
the seller is still finishing the renovation of the place
they are converting it from an old hotel
my condo is about 0 blocks from my office downtown
so it was great to roll out of bed this morning and be able to walk to work
like you
i am not sure what brendan might have told you about me
so here goes
i was born on the east coast
connecticut
moved around for a while
and eventually was towed out to southwest washington by my parents
i went to highschool in kelso
this is where i met and then graduated with brendan
then went to college at university of washington in seattle
college was good
if a bit long
i received a degree in metallurgical engineering and worked as an engineer in portland for a year doing failure and corrosion analysis
whoa
a bit less than 0 years ago i started working with enron as a trader
trading hourly electricity in the west
i started out on shift
but now manage the group and get to work a more normal schedule
usually 0-0 hours a day
during the week
i enjoy the job a ton
the market changes nearly every day and it beats the hell out of staring at a scanning electron microscope for 0 hours at a pop
with regards to your visit
i've been in portland for a few years now
so i should be able to provide a fairly good guide service around the town
depending on when you get here and how things go
we'll have to see if we can get you outside the city to some of the mountains and the coast
astoria is about 0 hours away and it's a pretty scenic drive out there
especially if you're from new mexico
if the weather's nice we might be able to check out some of the resevoirs and rivers around mt
st
helens and the gorge
good swimming
hiking etc
it should be a blast
have you gotten any closer to firming up when you will be in town
i am pretty open at the start of july
and although it always rains on the 0th
every single year
that's still a good time to be coming up
besides
if you ever thought about moving here
you have to understand why its so green
it was good to hear from you
and if you have any questions you can give me a call at 0-0-0
take care
bill
sure
there will be a real-time group meeting on july 0th at 0:0
we will be discussing new ferc rules
dispute management
group changes and cuts
please let me know immediately if you will be unable to attend
thank you
bill
easy there
everything will be okay
actually amy
i will not be able to attend on the 0th
is there an alternate date
heather
i spoke with chris and he is on board with the annuity of $0 from st-cali to st-whourly
thanks for the help with this
bill
alan
can we meet today and discuss the pros and cons of this order
i will be available as soon as you are ready
thanks
bill
mr
kuehn
i like the bridgeport idea
unsure about the food idea at zoop
what did you have in mind
nate stanton gave me a call today
we could invite him and folks from work
either way i am cool
also bear in mind that my place has no furniture
joy
looks good ray
nicely summarized
bill
john
thanks for the timely note
prc is today
much appreciated
here it is
alan
i just received this from our client rep detailing their position
as expected they are treating the stage 0 as ending at 0:0 rather than he 0 as stated on may 0 in both their website and on their message net
i would like to get ferc's position on this if necessary
if it is $0.0 rather than $0.0 as indicated in the ferc order
we will use that as a cap as soon as ferc
or you
recommends it
thanks
bill
john
we have asked every single counterparty in the nw to sell us energy
we bid $0 to powerx and were told that they were abiding by the cap
we are working hard to get them the energy that they need and will continue to do so
bill
group
caps will be down from he 0 through he 0 on saturday morning
we will have to use workspace and run enpower to caps after he 0
we may want to run enpower to caps early
or at least create finals
so that we do not lose any data if the whole thing gets erased
please call with questions
good luck
thanks
bill
nikki
hello
how are things going
hope you've caught up on your sleep from california
that's what i am going to work on this afternoon so i can enjoy the weekend
i am so glad the week is over
i am exhausted
nothing like if i had worked 0 hours though
sorry to hear you only have the night of the 0rd open
hopefully you are getting to spend more time in the city of portland than just one afternoon
there's just too much to do here to only spend one afternoon
as for where to stay
there's a bunch of hotels out at the airport
or you can stay downtown
i can take you out to the airport in the morning if you need as i will not be working on the 0th of july
give me a call if you have a chance and have a good weekend
bill
group
a reminder
my email address is bill.williams.iii@enron.com
bill williams iii needs to appear in the outlook box
otherwise i do not receive the email
i should be copied on the ees sheets
and any cut notes to volume managament
the services desk
or other traders
thank you for making this correction
bill
steve
good looking notes this weekend
both notes were very informative and detailed
i appreciate the good work
bill
chip
as we figured out a couple of weeks ago
most of our ads cards have expired
we were then using brett hunsucker's card
if you remember
we were waiting on the caiso to send us new cards and new passwords about two weeks ago
unfortunately brett's card appears to have expired this morning as we can no longer log in
we are consequently unable to communicate with the caiso over the ads
we may now be in violation of our participating generator agreement with the caiso
is there something that i can do to speed this process
perhaps lodge a complaint with the caiso or our client rep
do you have any eta from the caiso on our cards and passwords
all your help is appreciated
thanks
bill
karen
you must change your e-mail list for bill williams
please send this to bill.williams@enron.com

subtle difference
but if you consider your information worthy of review
please make the e-mail change
regards bill

how was austin
did you get the rest and relaxation you were looking for
how about golf
everyone has only ever had good things to say about austin
audi tt
nice pick
is that a 0-speed
only 0,0 miles is pretty sweet and the color is right
matches the 0e
next time i am down there
you'll have to provide a demonstration
i am really getting the urge to lose my 0
this seems to happen about every 0 months
i have only driven it once since i moved
about 0 miles total
kind of hard to justify $+0 a month for car
insurance and parking when i drive it 0 miles in a month
just not very cost effective
an old 0tii would only cost me parking and insurance
and my pride
other ideas
so i am in the new place
it's great
perfect location
just no parking
and i get way more sleep
til 0
its got a pretty solid view and feels much bigger than it is because of all the windows
now if i could just get some furniture
maybe a table
any word
we need those cards and passwords
group
we are long 0 mws on peak for 0/0/0 in sp-0
this should be in caps under st-wbom
deals should be under st-wbom in enpower as well
bill
looks great jill
thanks
bill
nikki
hope you're doing well and continuing to enjoy newport
my friend lives down there in huntington beach
watch out for him
he moved down there about 0 months ago
i have been planning on visiting him for a while
i wouldn't mind getting your perspective on the city as well when i come down
last time i was in la
i spent a fair amount of time on the strip and around hollywood before heading home
another guy i know down there works at the house of blues and got me tickets to taj mahal--steven segal came out and played guitar with them at the end
the guy was not good
which was nice
also
one of my neighbors from college works on the maury povich show
i think
so
i definitely need to go down there for a visit
i will be in sacramento towards the end of july
0th thru 0th
and then am planning to get down to la right at the start of august for work and perhaps a bit of goofing off
so whatever
if i make it down there it should be a decent time
sorry to hear about the possible cancelation of the trip to portland
hope you can make it
though the deck seems stacked against you this time around
i will plan for you to be here
so you wouldn't be stuck in a hotel
but don't worry if you can't get here on the 0rd
plenty of time for that
as the sun should be out for a while
til october anyway
i was knocking around going snowboarding up at timberline on saturday
get a few runs in before 0
but i am leaning towards a trip around mt
st
helens on my bike instead
it's supposed to be around 0 and sunny here on saturday and you can't pass such weekends up
st
helens should be gorgeous and since we are in the middle of a drought in the northwest i want to check out the level of the resevoirs up in the mountains
we'll see though
either way i will be getting up early to catch the sunrise in the mountains
so work was solid today
got just about everything accomplished that i wanted to
no one brought me lunch after working the night shift
but what can you do
anyway
hope the funeral goes well
you know
as it can
and keep me posted on when/if you might get up to portland
oh
and as for a picture
i'll see what i can do
brendan's got a couple
but i don't have any that i can pop on the web right now and send down to you
i admit
i have been called an ogre before
i am a bit of a taller
bigger fellow on the soccer field--and some forwards have unresolved issues concerning it
but
well
brendan should be able to fill you in
like i said i will see what i can do about a picture
enjoy your time in la
and take care
bill

good afternoon
how are you
hope everything worked out in la
i don't know if you are still coming up to portland but i was emailed a picture at work today from opening day at pge park
the minor league baseball stadium up here
and figured i'd pass it on
the picture was taken in the enron suite at the park
i am the one directly in front of the tv
the rest of the folks are from the origination
not trading
side of enron
except my boss
who is on the far left of the picture as you look at it
portland has been nice the last couple days
though its been raining like crazy
i went up on my roof last night
the sun was setting and there was a lull between the storm systems moving through
beautiful night
the sun had already gone down below the west hills
but was still reflecting off some of the taller buildings to the east of my place
there was this slice of deep blue sky extending from the west over my head
and all around were low menacing storm clouds
a stiff breeze was blowing south to north and smelled of fresh rain
amazing
it should be a nice weekend up here
in fact
i am taking tomorrow off and getting in a bit of golf
i am playing an hour north of portland on a links style course
if its a clear morning
i should be able to see mt
rainier
mt
st
helens
and mt
adams
it is an interesting course to play
now if i can just get the ball to go in the hole i'll be happy
hope the pic makes it to you through our firewall
david
try to make sure you get these to me rather than to my dad
i think he is starting to get annoyed
thanks

here is the most current information regarding charges from the caiso
the ferc ruling and the price cap
0
the current price cap is $0.0
we should continue our practice of not selling over the cap
however we can
and should
buy over the cap if necessary for the system reliability of our service customers
0
the ferc order specifies a penalty of $0 per mw for underscheduling load
greater than 0% per load zone underscheduled
despite the caiso's repeated protests
and the iou's complete disregard of this order
we can expect to be subject to this penalty
0
when a warning is in effect the caiso will be making out-of
market calls
these oom calls will not show up in the expost or beep stack
therefore when power supplies become tight
the prices in the
expost
may actually drop
we should continue our practice of not leaving uninstructed energy in the caiso whenever possible
0
we should continue to participate in the caiso congestion market
the caiso frequently has unexpected hourly path loadings
and congestion has occurred in the hour ahead market that was not present in the day ahead market
0
remember to include caiso export fees
tie meter multipliers/import fees and grid management fees in your caiso calculations of wheeling charges
we will have a real-time meeting on monday july 0th at 0:0 pm in mt
hood
we will discuss other changes in the market at that time
please make plans to attend
thank you
bill
this needs to go to bill williams
not bill williams iii
the difference is subtle but is rather important if you want the correct person to receive your message
please make the appropriate change in your contact lists and address book
thanks

thanks

group
ryan sent this email out once already
here it is again
the oasis site map is the details of checking for atc are as such red=pac
t
blue=ipc
t
leg 0
pathc to pace leg 0
pace to fc0 we can do a buy resell with epe to move this to pv or can use aps tranny to move this to mead or pv as well
when scheduling from bobr to fc0 on pac
t
be sure to just put in the por/pod and do not schedule each wheel seperately
this will prevent us from being charged $0.0 each time
total cost for this tranny should be $0.0 +$0.0 +$0.0 = $0.0
there will also be losses
if using this wheel for a services customer
be sure to add in for losses and scheduling fees
also
be sure to log out of the ipc website when finished
otherwise we will be locked out if we time out
there should already be a template for a tag to move this energy from pac system border in the nw to fc0
this path has had approximately 0 mws of tranny availabe the last few days
please see me with questions
thanks

confirmation from keoni on an unrevised price cap
as of 0:0
virginia
i have one question on this month's pma and some questions from last month
first
for deal #0
this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty tacomasupp
this counterparty was then changed to tacomapubuit
why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue
are we being charged for each counterparty again
like ees and st-cali last month
if so
we need to fix this flawed tool
second
for last month
we determined that the wbom book needs a $0,0 pma for change in price
the appropriate price is in enpower
but the revenue has never appeared
deal #0
remember
this deal was originally input as a buy at $0 and a sell at $0 and liquidated at these prices
the deal is now at $0 and $0
what do we need to do to get this trued up
please come see me with questions
thank you for your help
bill
virginia
i also had a question on a pma from january
on transalta deal #0
your notes indicate that mw volumes for he 0 and he 0 were reduced by 0 mws each hour
enpower and the inc sheet do not reflect this change
the pma indicates a charge of $0 for a reduction in our purchase from transalta
why would we receive a charge for a reduction in purchased energy
ie
less money from us to transalta
there is no indication of a reduction in volume on the other side of the trade
sale to sempra-deal#0
please come see me when you have a chance
i think we need to go through this
thanks
bill
crystal
good morning
haven't heard from you in forever and unfortunately did not get a chance to respond to your last email
just wanted to say hello and wish you a good fourth of july
ticker on bottom works
nothing else really does
alan
according to this site the cap was around $0 for he 0 and $0 for he 0
we had already traded for these hours when the
new cap
had been set
this is a retroactive cap during mitigation hours
when trading in the hour ahead market
0 hour before energy flows
we cannot predict the cap to market ratio
for example
expost is $0 right now
and the market is at $0.0
any recommendations
bill
troy
the difference is subtle
but i believe you wanted this to go to bill williams not bill williams iii
please make the appropriate change to your address book
thanks
bill williams iii manager short term west hourly trading
thanks for the update
fran
if this deal was zeroed out
and it has been after the fact
then we should also have received a credit for no longer buying from mpc
the other side of the deal
deal #0
we should only lose $0
the net difference
any ideas
thanks
bill
group
two totally different issues for you
first
when scheduling transmission on portland general electric from john day to malin we must use deal #0
we must make the price zero
we extend this deal in scheduling and change the delivery points
we then make an annuity to st-nw for losses
easy
second
for the third time in two weeks the behavior of the real-time group after 0 pm has been brought up
we will talk more regarding this in our meeting next week
it is important to note that we need to remain within the bounds of professional behavior at all times
enron has a zero tolerance policy regarding harassment
language or behavior that offends or belittles others
thanks for your attention
bill
we will pay aps losses of 0 mw for he 0 pdt only on july 0th
lisa has made the tag and put the losses in the preschedule sheet
kate has made the enpower for this deal
#0
and #0
please put the price in for deal #0
buy from epe
thanks
bill
group
when doing swaps please use the swap function in enpower
do not enter annuities anymore for financial deals
be sure to specify whether you are buying or selling index and then what index you are selling
np0 inc/dec
etc
an example appears in the attachment
swaps have caused disputes that have dragged on for months in the past
so call me with any questions
thanks
bill

on tuesday we sold the caiso replacement reserves at malin for he 0 and he 0
then he 0 through he 0
we were exercised for the first 0 minutes of he 0
for the last 0 minutes of he 0 our energy was uninstructued and we received the dec price
for he 0
and he 0-0 we were awarded the capacity payment but were not exercised
the capacity payment should be at least $0.0 for each hour it was received
if you have questions
please let me know
thanks

i need to have a tape pulled for ryan slinger on july 0 at 0:0 and 0:0
let me know when you have the time and i will go up with you to pull the tape
thanks
bill
fred can be reached at 0-0-0-0
nice email to fred on tuesday by the way
we could pull tapes
ask the person who did the deal
there is nothing in notebooks
any word on the bom pma
good morning
yesterday for he 0 and he 0 we were cut real time by el paso electric on an import
epmi_ciso_blue
the import was cut by 0 mws and 0 mws respectively
a purchase from the imbalance has been made
also for he 0
we bought back most of harbor cogeneration's schedule
harbor was going to run for 0 mws but could not
we told harbor that we would take the charge for them
therefore
the
0 mws of generation deviation for harbor needs to be allocated to ectrt as load deviation
we put in a purchase of 0 mws from the imbalance in enpower
finally there is a variance for he 0 and he 0 possibly because of load shift from np to sp
we are flat in caps position manager
and flat in enpower
thanks
bill
virginia
we have resolved almost all of the recent pma sheet
the tacoma/mpc deal is fine if its zeroed out for he 0
i just need to have the cost zeroed out as well as the revenue
currently only the revenue has been zeroed out and if i receive the credit for buying from mpc i am satisfied
fran is aware of this
i am still having a problem with the wbom $0,0 as you are aware
this would be the only outstanding pma and whatever the problem is with our tools
if any
likely needs to be resolved
i appreciate your hard work on tracking down this $0,0
the risk sheet is on my desk
thanks

i just left her another
sara
check this story out
this is from a guy on our floor
he's a summer intern
and this is his tuesday morning story
incidentally i was standing directly in front of the old women picking out some green onions for my omelet when all hell broke loose
i took about three steps back and wandered towards the kitchen in search of a fire extinguisher
didn't find one
and like scott
the intern
was a bit disappointed in my reactions
ah well
i don't usually send out a group email
but listen to this shit
so i am sitting at work this morning minding my own business when all hell breaks loose
it is about 0am
and most of the trading has subsided for the morning
i decide to grab the first ham and cheese omelet from the women that are serving our breakfast this morning because who knows how long the food will last
today is a special day because we get a fresh cooked breakfast from a propane grill as opposed to the green eggs and ham that we are used to because no one wants to get up at 0am and cook a fresh breakfast for enron employees
they usually cook it the night before
so
everyone on the floor is very excited and pumped up about the possibility of grabbing a nice breakfast without having the fear that later in the afternoon your ass would wreak havoc on you for eating the nasty green eggs
so
i grab the first omelet and the crowd surges toward the two 0 year-old women at the grill
everyone is smiling
deciding whether or not they want ham or maybe they will get crazy and add salsa or something
the next thing you know
straight out of a fox tv show or
you've gotta see this
episode
this old woman is engulfed in flames like the great fire of chicago
the propane tanks heating the stove exploded and the flames are high and wide
raising up to ten feet in height
the place turns into a frenzy
nobody can move
react
or anything
everyone is frozen watching this old woman
picture happy gilmore's grandma
go up like an old christmas tree
a few seconds before this high school chemistry experiment
i was sitting on the first row right in the middle and i was staring at my two liquid display computer terminals and glancing at the sports ticker on espn0 on the 0inch liquid flatscreen tv that is directly above my desk
the old woman that went into flames is directly in front of me
about a literal three feet away and i am directly facing the inferno along with a co-worker who is catching the blunt of the heat of the flames
i don't save the old woman like most of you might have thought
i can't do anything but shout obscenities and wonder who the hell is going to jump in there and save this poor lady
the old woman is yelling
somebody get me outta here
yet we all continue to stare
finally
someone grabs her arm and yanks her out of the blaze
who is this masked man
i have no clue
however
i do witness les from middle marketing doing his best maurice greene directly for the fire extinguisher of which he is the only one in the office that has a clue where it is
i see someone throwing a pitcher of egg yolk on the fire earlier
which is funny
if not for the fact that an old lady is missing half of her hair and her arms are about to blister up
the blaze is extinguished after taking a hell of a toll on the old woman
ruining the flat screen tv that used to sit above me
and torching a bunch of cabinets and the backs of computer screens
the alarm in our building 0 world trade center is screaming
and the smoke is enough to make even polarek leave the area
so
the fire departemnt comes and the old woman is now out of the building and on her way to the hospital
who knows what condition she is in
but all i know is i hope i am never around a bunch of vaginas
myself and the rest of us that did nothing
when i go up in flames someday
well
i have to get back to work because i have wasted about 0 minutes writing this drama
take care
scotty pretty good story huh
different morning
things are going well here in portland other than the omelette fires
when do you get in to seattle
take care and enjoy your last month in colorado

this brings us back to the age-old question
during an emergency
how we can tell what the highest price paid for energy by california is
their market clearing price does not include all the spot market energy that they purchase
the ciso has acknowledged buying well over the artificially low federal price cap from in-state muni's
ldwp
smud
etc
but none of this information is passed on in a timely fashion
and what qualifies one counterparty for a penalty
and another counterparty for a
do-over
could be assessed
we will continue our practice of notifying the caiso as soon as possible regarding outages
thank you for the information and the follow-up
bill
group
the baseball game will be on thursday july 0th

glaring

the link below should take you there

congestion can be found under the transmission tab on the far right
please take some time to become familiar with the new site

hello
how are you
what are you doing these days
i hope you are doing well
it has been a while to say the least
but the other day brendan and i were talking about college and your name came up
oddly enough
i mentioned that i hadn't talked to you for over two years
and was curious what you were up to
brendan said he might have your old email address
so i asked for it and figured i would drop you a note
i hope you don't mind
anyway i am still living in portland but i am no longer practicing metallurgical engineering
i began trading power about a year and a half ago for enron
i now manage the west hourly power trading group
the job is great
very challenging and everchanging
though i don't believe my company is too popular down your way right now
you are in san francisco
right
my job consumes my time
but i am still playing soccer and still riding that same loud red motorcycle around when i have a chance
i just bought my first home
its a condominium downtown next to the portland art museum
the place is definitely small but has a lot of character
it was an old hotel
originally built in 0
that has just been gutted and refurbished
it is about eight blocks from my office at the world trade center
so walking to work in the mornings is great
the city is still asleep and eerily quiet in the morning twilight when i walk to work
the walk helps wake me up and gets me prepared for the morning rush on the trading floor
so
if you have a chance drop me a line and let me know how you are
this email address of mine works
though everything on it is subject to subpoena by the good state of california
or you can give me a call at 0-0-0
i'd love to hear from you and catch up a bit
as i often wonder what you are up to
take care
bill
kate
this is the last message from the total transfer capabilities folks
i would like you to find this information and distill the relevant information from it
we can go through what constitutes relevant information this afternoon
i am working on adding you to the market status list
this will provide you with market information regarding real-time derates or market orders
finally
i would recommend printing the caiso tariff off and reading it over the weekend or next few weeks
boring
but important
green room
granted
i missed the last game and though i may not deserve to present an opinion given my lengthy stay on the reserve list
i also favor the move to d0
i think better competition will be more fun
provided that we field a full team
speaking mostly at myself here
on a consistent basis
i have started playing again and am hoping to be back for the fall season
i also know another player-nate stanton
he has played with a few of us in indoor
who is interested in playing and is a bit quicker and better than myself
so for what it's worth
d0 all the way
thanks

a quick note regarding pace transmission reservations on their oasis sites
we have recently paid pace $0,0 for transmission in may that we reserved but did not flow
pace says that their transmission is on a take or pay basis
my contention is that we may have reserved the transmission
but then attempted to remove it immediately
wrong hour
wrong mw value on the submission etc
and were unable to
or were told by the dispatcher that the dispatcher would take care of it
then nothing happens
there are two things we need to do to prevent this
one
submit our transactions correctly the first time
then withdraw them immediately through the pacificorp oasis system if there is a problem
two
send me an email each time the dispatchers remove requests on our behalf
or if we/pac are/is unable to take the request out of their computer system
hopefully
this will prevent the extra charges
or give us a means to pull tapes and contest the charges
thanks for your help in limiting these egregious expenses bill
i am working on getting nate's email
i will try to get him to show up at indoor on monday

just a quick heads up for the flash
path 0 was derated last night for he 0 through he 0
for he 0 the price for congestion revenue was $0.0
we were awarded 0 mws of congestion relief by the caiso

please let me know

where you planning on going
if you are
i may not

i wanted to check with you quickly regarding taking a month-long position in august
i would like to buy a piece of np
sell a piece of sp
and sell pv
i believe that value exists in taking these positions into the real-time market throughout august
np and sp are currently trading near flat
i think the potential for real-time congestion revenue
rt has seen approximately $0,0 so far this month
across constrained paths in california makes this a low risk way to generate value in a low liquidity market
i have discussed a month long short at pv with tom alonso
while i recognize the rest of the desk has a position
i think rt can generate good value liquidating in the shoulder hours beyond what could be generated by just filling dailies because of the current price levels
this also represents a relatively low risk trade
under $0 downside
i also would like to use these positions as a basis in hourly eol trading as well
if you have concerns or questions please let me know
otherwise i will put these positions on over the next week
thanks
bill
if this works for you
please copy and paste it into your own email and send it on

kate
we need to move you more towards a trading support role and less of a settlements role
please take some time over the weekend to consider what might be helpful for the desk
ie
collecting pertinent weather information
transmission derates
day-ahead prices
congestion
historical spreads
etc
and let me know on monday or tuesday what we can do
take your time but have a good weekend
bill
apparently not
the epe preschedule sheet had a 0 mw lending position in
we'll have to work with the preschedulers to get it squared away
kate
epe will be lending us a schedule for tuesday
0 mws at $0 at pv
the schedule will be on peak
similar to today
please work with the preschedulers to get the sheet correct
friday's sheet for monday had a duplicate 0 mw schedule in it
let me know if you have questions
thanks
bill
cara
we are short 0 mws at the portland general system in position manager for friday

could you look into this
thanks
bill
great
thanks
group
i have attached the following cut procedures that should be of benefit as we move into fire season
the sheet is very basic but spells out my expectations for handling a cut
the most important thing to remember is to document everything and call with questions
thanks
bill
sounds good
kate
i think we need to enter the buy from epe flat to our day ahead sale to stsw
otherwise the new deal sheet shows revenue that we did no receive
heather
on the new deal summary for 0/0/0
i changed the el paso electric deal #0 price from $0 to $0
i should not receive the $0.0 as revenue shown in the new deal summary
is there any way to recalculate this
or simply zero it out
prior to the morning flash
let me know what i can do to help
thanks
bill
group
we are short 0 mws for tomorrow at pv through lending with epe

we are also short 0 mws for tomorrow at sp-0
0 mws will be under st-wbom
0 mws will be under st-cali
both schedules are he 0-0
all deals should be under appropriate books
please take extra time with the epe lending
we would like to do this size throughout august and want to make sure they have no problems
details regarding prices and deal numbers will be coming from kate
thanks
bill
are you kidding me
this is absurd
group
we have purchased 0 mws from lv cogen for he 0
he 0 and he 0 at $0
we will need to buy transmission from nevp from nevada system to mead 0 and then into the caiso for he 0 thru he 0
this energy can go towards the st-cali and st-wbom short in sp-0
i will do enpower for these deals when i arrive in the morning
remember to give nevp 0 hours of notice-maybe even 0 and a half
please call me with any questions
thanks
bill
gentlemen
after discussion with roger
the four corners units 0 and 0 are not take or pay
this means that rather than selling from these units below the lambda
unit cost is approximately $0
we should ramp them down
they should still be the last units down
copper off
then the steamer
then fc's
because of restrictions on the units you may not be able to ramp the units all the way down all the time
also
be sure to work closely with the dispatchers to ramp the units back up in a timely fashion
i apologize for misinformation on my part regarding these units
if you have questions please see me
otherwise
spread the word
thanks
bill
steve
great email
arbitrary and capricious indeed
more like ridiculous
last time i checked
no one could tell the difference
group
i received a call from warren mcreynold at the bpa today
warren was concerned with the level of service that our group is providing
warren explained to me the necessity and importance of calling in and reporting the actual amount of energy generated by grays harbor and frontier every hour
the group at bpa cannot close their accounting books and meet reliability performance measures without our information
i am meeting with warren on tuesday
warren is inclined to recommend to bpa that we are incapable of this service because of our inconsistent performance
such a recommendation would severely limit enron's ability to produce value for our service customers in the near term and would likely prevent us from attracting new customers
i believe that we can provide warren's group with the information that it needs with minimal impact to our trading
therefore
we must call grays harbor and frontier at the top of every hour
then we need to call bpa and communicate the actual energy generated
not an estimate
finally
sign off the hour in the services book
les has provided us with the needed information for each day
reserves can only be used for the hour that we are in
than we must resupply the schedule from a different source by working with the bpa marketers
if you have a question regarding reserves or pulling a schedule--please call les or me
if this process takes more than 0 minutes
please let me know
it is each trader's responsibilty to make this work
it should be noted that we need to do this even if the generator is prescheduled
and must to continue to do this until these generators are automatically metered
and yes
we will be compensated by the services desk for our work
this service is a priority and should be treated as such
please see me with your comments and concerns regarding this job function
thanks
bill
easy there gentleman
dave
sorry it has taken so long to get back to you
first
regarding handsets
each real-time desk needs 0 handsets
kate symes needs another handset under her desk as well
also
i need to have my extension displayed on kate symes turret
and on each rt turret as well
also on stewart rosman's
greg wolf's
les rawson's and chris foster's
i also need kate symes extension displayed on my turret
this is an immediate concern beyond the handsets
her trid is #0 ext
0
my trid is #0 ext
0
i will address our treatment of handsets with the group
feel free to grab me this afternoon before 0pm for a meeting if you still have time
thanks for the help
bill
i think you know
group
i have discussed our lack of handsets with dave steiner
dave perceives an appetite for handsets in the real-time group
however
we should be getting new handsets
two for each turret
early next week
these handsets will be labeled real-time
this should prevent others from switching out our handsets
if one of these handsets stops working
cuts out or mute doesn't work
please let me know
dave steiner will be providing these handsets without charging us
but if a heightened handset consumption continues
we will have to pay for them
dave suggested that we make sure to hang up the handsets
as they tend to get damaged quickly on the ground
apparently it stresses the connections and leads to them cutting out
i feel this goes without saying but maybe
thanks for your help with this
bill
that sounds good to me
i appreciate your help
bill
thank you kate
i would like to get this process going as quickly as possible
interviews on thursday

a quick reminder
the cell phones are for group member to group member usage
as such
calling between group members
and our 0-0-0-0 number is free
we have 0 minutes each for use in calling other members of the west desk on work related matters
over the past two months we have greatly exceeded our allowable minutes per month
some members of the group have exceeded their allotment by over 0 minutes per month
group member to group member usage is approximately 0-0 minutes per month-and this is not calculated in the minutes used
if you want to use this phone as your only phone

when doing imports and exports at tie points for other desks
be sure to put the other desk as the customer in caps
this prevents inappopriate charges going against the real-time book
import and export fees are typically in the nature of $0 per mm on a wheel

when buying from any desk on the floor
you should have a sale from that desk
say st-cali
to either whourly or wbom
then do enpower as normal
the interdesk sale will not pull up in scheduling and you will have to route the sale in enpower to the physical buy by the other desk
another words
st-cali buys from imbalance
sells to whourly/wbom
then whourly/wbom sells to epmicalpool
then whourly/wbom sells to epe
please let me know if you have questions
bill

we relieved path 0 congestion for he 0 on saturday morning
we flowed 0 mws from malin to fc0
this resulted in the 0 mw
variance
in the report
i have added deals to enpower to flatten the report
these deals are only necessary for the sake of the report
the identical variance in the north and south indicates a wheel or load shift
i prefer to not enter these extra deals
please see me with questions if you do not understand why the report variance exists

i appreciate the hard work
thanks
bill williams short term west hourly trading
things have definitely been difficult over here
in truth
i may have underestimated how prepared our systems and the folks in our group were to move dramatically greater volumes
we are moving through a period of adjustment and should be back on track by tomorrow
so kate probably is not any more stressed out than anyone else
she probably just shows it a bit more
we shouldn't be holding you guys back too much longer
my apologies for the delay
bill
you are correct
the eol trades were not properly acccounted for
i think we have it sorted out now though
but yeah
too much stress is never healthy
i don't know exactly what the deal is
bill
good morning
we are off in position manager at mid columbia because of enron canada
i notified murray at enron canada at approximately 0:0 this morning
position manager is also not working properly
it is reporting a variance at pacificorp system border
and at palo verde
however the position manager shows no variance when detail is clicked
if you have questions
let me know
thanks
bill
thanks for the email
i already worked this out with kal
bill
group
a quick important reminder
recently our disputes with epe and other sw counterparties have been growing
while i recognize that we have some newer members in the group
it is the responsibility of the senior members of the group to train and help the newer members to avoid mistakes
the epe system is not overly complex
if you have questions during a shift call me first
do not wake up roger
do not go inadvertant
our notes on the deal sheet need to include whether the power is firm or econ
again--you should almost never buy econ
the epe lending fee was recently renegotiated down to $0
we have to be sharp in our marketing of their system to maintain our ability to lend and to lend at $0
disputes with counterparties will quickly erase this opportunity
marketing for epe
making appropriate choices with regards to the units
checking out with dispatchers on time
and reconciling the carp are basic expectations for this position and must be met
if you have questions
please see me
we will discuss epe and eol in our meeting at the start of september
thanks
bill
group
beginning tomorrow
august 0th
we will be scheduling for california on saturday and sunday
serena has put together a training manual outlining the process
the st-cali group will be on call to answer any questions or to help us handle cuts
this should be a simple integration into our saturday and sunday shifts
please see me with questions
and be prepared with comments and/or concerns for our meeting the first week of september
thanks
bill

brad should be awesome
where is it at
let me know how your
evening
with rachel goes
bill
dave
good morning
when you have a chance
we need to get a third turret in the mix at rt
we should use kate's turret if necessary
please see me with ideas and or a timeline for getting this installed
thanks
bill
group
i have copied in a note from roger at epe
as you can see they are placing a very high importance on economic dispatch of the units
please be aware that every move with regards to marketing and running their system is under extreme scrutiny
please call me before you call our customer
thanks
bill correction
the burner problem is on newman 0
thank you
mr ward
the unit will be held at 0 mw's until repairs can be made
the plan is to assess the problem monday morning and make the necessary repairs
if prices continue to be below cost we need to purchase power and back down local units
with copper off
the dispatch shows we need to purchase power for 0 or 0 hours through super peak
depending on load
gt 0 and gt 0 should be put in the hole
around 0 to 0 mw's each
he 0:0 through he 0:0
if market conditions are less than $0.0 back down four corners
as load picks up be sure to pick up four corners first
if there is a reason we have to dump fc power please send me a note
if there is any confusion over whether to back down fc call
any questions or comments please call at 0 or 0-0-0
roger
guys
good looking discussion note last night
i appreciate the good work
thanks
bill
kate
how do i get david removed from schedule crawler
could you help me with this
thanks
bill
kate
this looks good and is well written
send away
sorry to hear about racheal
so the bretts weren't gay
but what about nancy
i haven't been to the breakroom
i think i will be coming up to seattle on either friday afternoon or saturday morning
i haven't decided yet
i am taking friday off from work though
my birthday is on thursday
isn't your birthday here in the tail end of august--or am i thinking of chuck
erica price
from the dorms
rowed crew
tall
red hair
sometimes slightly neurotic
that would be kind of fun to run into her
anyway
i'll get back to you when i figure out what the heck is going on
later
bill
regarding this
what do you mean adjust our system according to mpc's numbers until you do
are we correct
if the answer is yes
tell mpc we are correct
we have checked out with our counterparties
thereby verifying our incredible correctness
but
because we love them so much
we will
this time only
take it in the proverbial shorts
next time
it will of course
be there turn
good luck and thanks for your help
group
eol is off to a great start and is already becoming an integral part of the real-time market
each person who has put in substantial extra time entering and reconciling deals deserves congratulations
i do recognize and appreciate the hard work
as always
there is more work to be done
we have had significant difficulty integrating the increased volume of eol trades into our current business practice
some members of the group have experienced limited success
others have experienced little to no success
a standardization in our process will benefit the entire group and will allow us to make consistent improvements as time goes on
so going forward
0
all deals will be done under st-whourly
if there is lending
parking or a cut that corresponds to another book
we will make that deal for the entire strip
for example
w-bom sells to epe for he 0-0--all one deal
we will then sell or buy the appropriate amount of energy from whourly to that book
this interdesk deal will not be routed
we will do the interdesk transaction as one deal and will enter deal strips with pricing for each hour or hours where appropriate and will include transmission charges when necessary
in enpower
use strips wherever possible
try to avoid extending deals in scheduling
0
all imports and exports will be under the appropriate desk
for example st-sw exporting from sp-0 to fc must be under st-sw in caps
this will allow us to put everything under whourly and have export/import fees paid for by the appropriate desk
otherwise the whourly book will be charged for wheeling and/or potentially congestion for other desks
when filling a service customer
such as wheelabrator or ees
we should pay for the import and export fees
0
a
skeleton
of an inc sheet should be developed as soon as possible each day
sales/purchases to or from ees should be made for the day and immediately input into the service sheet
likewise
service deals/lending/parking should be put into the sheet for the day where possible
i would like to implement all of these practices immediately
effective he 0 0/0/0
this is our new business practice
spread the word
i am looking for more suggestions for improvements on our process
we will have a meeting on september 0 to discuss group direction and ideas for improvement
this will be an important meeting at 0 pm on tuesday september 0th
please plan to attend
see me at any time with suggestions or comments
thanks
bill
how are you
hope you are doing well
i got your message last night about leaving the nw
where are you going
when do you take off
drop me a note if you have a chance
take care
bill
how about this
evelyn
please try to send or copy any emails to me at williams iii
bill
not williams
bill
this email went to bill williams with enron who happen to be in sweden
kate symes will be taking care of your spreadsheet when she has an opportunity
as you may be aware we have recently brought out enrononline to the hourly market
we have seen a dramatic increase in volumes
and priorities have shifted as a result
daily deadlines must be met
we are working on our deal entry accuracy
i appreciate your patience
we will attend to this issue shortly
there are several annuities related to the profit sharing of this deal
first
all deals should have been made under the st-nw desk to route with the pge deal-buy tranny-etc
i recognize this did not happen but this was my intent and should or could have
consequently all revenue from this deal originally went into the st-nw book
therefore
an annuity was made from st-nw to st-whourly
deal #0--$0
next an annuity was made from st-whourly to lt-nw at $0 to compensate lt-nw for the $0 purchase price
deal #0
this left a profit of $0 to be divided between st-whourly and l-pac-0/0
consequently
st-whourly made an annuity to l-pac for their part of the profit share
deal #0--$0.0
all this left rt with a profit of $0
if you place all the deals under lt-nw
it will be a large impact on st-nw
and will result in lt-nw getting paid a couple of times
these profit share numbers are accurate
after expenses--lt-nw gets $0 for the original deal
then st-wh gets $0 and l-pac gets $0.0
all these annuities cannot just be killed as they liquidated on the 0th--of february
it is probably a better idea to put everything back under the st-nw booquestions
just come see me and let me know
virginia
all deals were originally sourced under st-nw
revenue was moved from st-nw to st-whourly for 0/0 split between lp and st-whourly
annuity to st-whourly from st-nw #0--$0.0 annuity from st-whourly to lp #0--$0.0 annuity from st-whourly to lt-nw #0--$0--this compensated for original deal sold to lp
take or pay
st-whourly kept the difference between #0 and #'s 0
0
all deals were originally sourced under st-nw
if you have questions
just let me know
thanks
bill
darren
per our discussion
please allocate all hour-ahead congestion charges or revenues to the ectrt group
hopefully this will simplify the management of our books
my understanding is that chris will tell rt if there are cuts or some other need to put in hour ahead
0
schedules for the cali desk and will allow us to allocate approriate charges or revenue to him if necessary
all congestion charges/revenue at tie points should still be allocated to the desk entered in caps
if you have any questions please see me
realtime will still try to notify you of congestion revenue or charges
thanks
bill
i have attached the spread sheet i created back in february
there are comments explaining the formulas
if you have questions please just give me a call and i will try to clear them up

group
we are continuing to refine our deal entry techniques and spreadsheet techniques
we are having great success with eol so far
for further clarification
0
all deals under st-whourly--except a lending/parking deal or cut
for example if we are lending with st-sw and we buy for them in np-0
the buy in np-0 is under st-whourly
the epmicalpool buy/resale from np-0 to fc0 is under st-whourly
the inter-desk sale is made under st-whourly
at the end of the day--see #0
and the sale to epe is under st-sw
the export in caps is also under st-sw
0
one deal for an on-peak or off-peak purchase or sale.--for example one deal for a sale to the imbalance
one deal for a sale to epe 0
one deal for an inter-desk sale or purchase--done by the night shift at the weighted average price for the entire strip
transmission costs should be included
we are just averaging the purchase price or sale price for specific deals
see st-wbom sp-0 section of aug trading sheet on 0/0/0 for an example
0
inc sheets must be maintained
deals entered and routed each hour--only way to stay ahead 0
we are generating significantly more revenue and profit trading with eol
over $0,0 in the last 0 days alone--does not include congestion revenue
0+ trades
0,0 extra mws traded with eol in 0 days

thanks

can we contact this steve johnson guy and tell him he is a pawn for the state of california
funny
i don't remember a
near-meltdown
just inept purchasing and load balancing by cers at the start of august
cers is consistently completely out of the market
every day
they can't even manage to bury their bad trades in 0,0 mws of load
humorous article though

seattle was sweet this weekend
i went and saw brad at the breakroom
what did you think of husky stadium

i went out after that
whoa

just a quick reminder
when we are notified by the caiso generation desk regarding a
waiver
for an enron managed unit in california
we should notify the services desk if it is during the day
and should email the services desk
and me
if it is after normal work hours
if you have questions please just let me know
thanks
bill
group
a quick reminder
after reviewing this weekend
we must begin adjust bidding for congestion at all tie points
we should be running wheels n-s and s-n across path 0
the coi and nob
we have lost significant revenue by failing to adjust bid our transactions
it is still fire season
and unit outages are resulting in unscheduled flow problems that are forcing congestion at different tie points and in different directions
please check available atc's on the caiso site
and spend the time to manage our congestion risk
if you have questions
please ask
we need everyone up to speed on this quickly
thanks
bill

i have made some revisions to the budget after spending some time with amy fitzpatrick in our hr department
obviously this is a loose plan

you can call me here at work at 0-0-0 or on my cell phone at 0-0-0
thanks
bill
darin
i liked the services portion of the night discussion note that you wrote on the 0th
but you need more information on sales on behalf of epe for both he 0 and he 0
you need to explain any sales to marketers or utilities
i also need you to only sell to a marketer as last resort
a marketer is usually just flipping epe's energy and is taking your spread
if you have any questions
just let me know
otherwise keep up the good work
thanks
bill
stewart
just a quick heads up
smud used enron online today and sold ust a total of 0 mws
thanks for the good work
bill
group
we have developed a process for tiering our bids and should do so going forward
please use appropriate dollar and mw values
below is just an example
when tiering
the top numbers
mw values
must be monotonically increasing and the last two numbers on the bottom of your tier
$ values
must be the same
*note* if a tiered bid is entered incorrectly you will have to flow a large amount of mws for loss or no gain.*note* please see me with any questions before implementing tiered bids
thanks

i need information regarding our monthly cell phone costs
i would like to cap per employee costs at $0 per month on the group calling plan
effective in october
i would like employees billed for any amount they have over $0 per month on their cell phone
if an employee needs more minutes i would like to structure a plan to allow them to purchase more minutes through us--with them paying the extra per month
thanks
bill
jill
could you also cancel my monthly palmnet service
thanks
bill
absolutely
please send an email to the group explaining to them that they will be billed if they go over $0 a month
let them know they can set up a different plan if they need
i would prefer they stick with the group calling plan and add minutes
but the choice is theirs
let's put this in effect by october
i am seeing $0 ytd as of june in cell phone charges
and $0 x 0 group members x 0 months should equal $0--have we really spent $0 on new phones
thanks
bill
jill
i was being sarcastic about the $0
could you send an email to each group member giving them their average usage since you started or the last 0 months
at&t should have this info
if you could send me an email breaking out the costs that would be great as well
i am not that concerned with the new phones--but would like to know what was spent
i appreciate the help
thanks
bill
jill
ryan slinger previously had a plan set up
it looks like our at&t rep switched him back to the group calling plan
please check with ryan and he will let you know what he needs
thanks

please remember to put the tag # in the inc sheet

both wheels were awarded at $0.0
we should receive revenue of $0.0 from these wheels

here are the details on our sale to cers for he 0 at palo verde devers
i spoke with linus at cers at approximately 0:0--at that time i sold him 0 mws at $0 delivered at pv for he 0
i told him the energy was coming from the caiso
i then called mike at srp marketing after speaking with linus
for he 0 i had sold mike 0 mws
i told him the schedule would be going to a zero for he 0
i called the caiso to notify them my export epmi_ciso_salsa would be going to cers at pv devers and not srp
i began speaking with bhavin at the palo verde desk at 0:0 regarding scheduling of the energy to cers at pv devers
i told bhavin the export
epmi_ciso_salsa
would be going to cers and that it was effectively a net schedule
0 mws out at pv devers/0 mws in at pv devers
bhavin asked that i call a counterparty with a control area interest at pv and show the schedule going to and coming from a control area
i acknowledged this request and called el paso electric to attempt to show the schedule to them and from them
i was not comfortable with this step as i viewed it as unnecessary and told epe i would call them back
i then called srp transmission to discuss the schedule with them
at approximately 0:0 i discussed the 0 mw net schedule with srp transmission
srp control said a net schedule would show as zero
i then spoke with epe and told them to forget the schedule
i called bhavin back and told him srp was aware of the schedule
bhavin told me that he would make a note of the schedule and show it as net scheduled
at 0:0 bhavin called me back and told me he was not checking out with srp at pv devers
i called srp transmission and went over the schedule one more time
srp transmission still showed the 0 mw schedule from he 0
i told srp transmission that the 0 mw schedule was no longer flowing to him
he told me he would call his marketer
while transacting for he 0
i again spoke with mike at srp marketing and mike told me he had missed telling his transmission to pull out the 0 mw schedule
i believe the original problem was the net scheduling and that it was compounded by miscommunication on srp's end
it should be noted that bhavin was polite and professional throughout my conversations with him
i think the ability to net schedule at tie points is important
my feeling is that the caiso schedulers should have the same scheduling capabilities at the tie points as those schedulers outside the caiso
please let me know what you find out regarding this practice
if you have any questions for me please let me know
thank you for your help
bill

goodness
great questions
i could answer some in 0 minutes but others would be a 0 hour discourse
first
i did get both your resume and letter and have taken it to our human resources department
i currently have 0 people on rotation
shift work
and 0 is the appropriate number for me to have on shift
one of my employees is interviewing for another opening on the floor on friday and two others are looking to move
julie kearney

will be gone today through wednesday of next week
so by thursday of next week we should be able to set up an interview schedule and go from there

please take a look at it when you have a moment and let me know what you think about it

bill
group
we are starting to see some market changes as we transition into the winter months
first
with epe we will start seeing a severe morning ramp
we will have to carefully manage the units to prevent
swinging
them and increasing the chance of a unit outage
as the epe loads plummet off-peak
we should consult the unit commitment
and depending on market conditions look to take units off-line and
or put units on manual and buy energy back
recently we have sold energy from epe at a loss rather than putting costly gas turbines on manual
newman 0
0 and 0
reducing them
and buying that energy less expensively in the market
our relationship with epe is at a critical stage
they have a new vice-president and will be hiring new management to lead their marketing group
we would like to be a part of epe's marketing effort going forward
but need to continue to prove that our level of service cannot be matched either in-house or by other marketers
i look to each member of the group to be a part of this effort and to work closely to run the epe grid as efficiently as possible
second
the morning ramp will soon be upon us in the northwest
it will become very difficult to get energy in the nortwest for he 0 through he 0
we should look for congestion possibly on the coi and the dc
also
as lights and heaters come on in the evening
there should be another jump in load at he 0 through he 0
enron calgary will also be looking for energy these hours
be sure to take this load movement into consideration if you lock a price in with ecc
finally
we will have a meeting on tuesday--november 0th at 0:0 in the afternoon
the first tuesday as usual
to discuss market changes
peformance reviews and the final two months of the year
please see me with any questions regarding the system
thank you
bill

here is an updated version of the agreement i sent to steve on friday

group
going forward we will be delivering parking or taking lending energy at one point per schedule with portland general
we will either deliver or take energy from them at portland general system
or we will deliver or take energy from them at mid-c
pge real-time has had difficulty with scheduling the energy in real-time to or from a point other than originally prescheduled
therefore only schedule the energy to or from the originally prescheduled delivery point
in the case below we would deliver the energy to portland general system--not the mid-c
we should continue to be flexible at pge's request
please see me with any questions
thanks

bill
i am not concerned with the improperly posted atc's
i am concerned that our bids to relieve congestion were awarded but that the respective dollar value for those bids was incorrect
we have had problems in the past with misentry of our congestion management bids
however
in this case
the awarded congestion management bids look correct to me
and it appears that the caiso published price is not appropriate for the amount of mws flowed
i would like to figure this out as soon as possible so that we can fix any problems that might exist on our end
please give me a call when you have a chance
thanks

st-wbom is long at pv parking with pnm for he 0 through he 0

the price of the power after the parking fee is $0.0

this deal is just hanging out there under w-bom and should make us 0 mws long at pv on friday and saturday
also--we are still short the two bom pieces in sp-0 for a total of 0 mws each hour on peak-friday and saturday
average price of $0.0

probably 0 to 0 months ago david poston demonstrated a new position manager to work with both fsp and enpower
david poston showed the position manager to me
cara semperger
and phil platter
dave suggested that the new position manager would replace the current stand-alone position managers in caps and enpower
when dave and i ran through the demonstration
i was told that the east desk had driven most of the development work to date
the functionality of the position manager in the stage dave presented to me seemed useful
with little development needed for us to implement it
the position manager looked like it would offer several improvements over real-time's current position and report reconciliation methods
my impression of the application was that it would be a portion of fsp when implemented and was not a stand alone application
within a week after demostrating the new position manager
dave relayed to me that production of the position manager would be delayed until after fsp was in production
as a result of the fsp delay
i have heard nothing of the position manager and have had no input on it since that first meeting
i think this application
as i saw it last
has the potential to improve our reports and reduce our time spent running them
this application should be of benefit to preschedulers
risk and deal control
now that the position manager is back on the table
i would like the real-time group to be involved in the implementation of this portion of fsp and work to improve its ability to act as a report reconciliation tool
if you have any questions please let me know
thanks

our deal with ees has changed
as ryan indicated in his email we are now charging $0 for ees up to 0 mws
above 0 mws to 0 mws we are charging $0
above 0 mws per hour we are charging $0
however
when we have transacted with ees for a peaker product or day-ahead schedule we will not integrate our fee into their price for that quanity of mws
i will indicate in an email to you when this occurs
this is a bit complex but if you have questions just let me know
also
enmax has recently been buying energy from us at the bc border
this turned out to be a
canadian
firm purchase on the part of enmax
please do not fill any sale to enmax with mpc energy
we need to treat enmax just like ecc
we should buy an option or a call and then exercise that option
mpc does not have this capability and should not be used in this manner
finally
the nw evening peak has arrived
the nw has been extremely tight through morning and evening peaks
often over $0 to pick up
any questions

what are tracy's thoughts on this
group
for those on night and day shift on saturday/sunday the emergency back-up generators will be tested
the testing will occur from 0 am to 0 am on sunday morning
dave steiner has assured me that rt will be unaffected and dave will be on hand to help if anything is needed
i think we should work to have everything submitted early to the ciso
tags made
etc
at least for he 0
he 0 and he 0
this should give us some extra time if something goes wrong when they switch to the back-up power

i received this message yesterday from a student group at the university of washington
do you still want some to go to seattle and stir up interest
bill
when will you be starting your subscription to
bear magazine
definitely
to begin with he should be michael mier
let me know what you need
bill
kate
it is the end of the month and just like everyone else in your group you are needed to be at work at certain times
granted
renewed motivation can be a great thing to help you attack various job functions with vigor
and i am a big believer in it
we have in the past discussed that i would prefer that you take personal days/vacation days in the middle of the month and at the end of the week
if you would like to plan a longer vacation in advance
again like everyone else in your group
please just let me know
i appreciate your understanding
bill
if you need tomorrow and friday off
take it
take these days off too
alan
i have a few questions regarding the emminent implementation of the new target pricing mechanism
0
does uninstructed energy still get paid
if not
we cannot hedge financials
0
the ciso table 0
lists an unintended consequence as
target price may be manipulated due to no obligation to deliver
why is there no obligation to deliver
0
is there still a load deviation penalty
or would that be considered seperately
thanks for the help
bill
group
we are still short 0 mws in st-wbom on peak friday and saturday at $0.0
for friday only

0hr schedule
i bought this energy from the apx-deal #0 at $0
we will be long 0 mws each hour in position manager in sp-0 as a result
please sell this energy in the off-peak
on-peak will go to fill our w-bom short

as most of you are aware we changed time zones on sunday
we are back in pacific standard time
as such
we are once again in a different time zone than some of our counterparties
please specify pacific time zone in your summary of your deal at the end of each phone call--translate the deal to mountain time only if necessary
we must be very clear on this going forward or disputes will be numerous and we will not be able to resolve them
see me if you have any questions regarding this expectation
thanks
bill
you can go ahead and talk to fran
also
how was you vaca
and i have some things for you to take care of from thursday and this weekend when you have a chance
thanks
just talked with kochel
he was expecting a bounce in our stock on funds covering their shorts
i don't know if i agree after this
bill
kate
bobette from powerdex will want to speak to you regarding timelines
templates
etc
to set up an hourly index to be published the next day
i gave her your name because of your past experience in deal control
she will likely be calling around 0:0 or 0:0
i am not sure where i am at on this index
your feedback will play a large role in whether we participate in this index
sorry for the short notice
bill
matt
i will work on these this afternoon and give you some ideas
btw-i heard from kochel this morning
he is getting married march 0nd in seattle--did you know his sister was already married to steve darue
poor woman
the kelso/camas game is on thursday--maybe i will take friday off
what do you think
check your hotmail around 0
kochel is supposed to get married on march 0nd
same girl--we'll see if its the same outcome
matt
i like the mcleod resume the best
i have added some suggestions and provided a bit of feedback
why don't you do another write-up and i'll go over it again
it looks like you have a good start
i will also proofread your cover letter or give you some ideas if you need them
good luck
bill
ken
thank you for your inquiry
i will do my best to answer your questions
but would prefer to answer your questions by phone
i feel that this will provide each of us with greater flexibility and likely will give me even more of an opportunity to answer your questions
i will usually be most available after 0 each day
you can reach me at 0-0-0
thanks
bill
group
brace yourselves
once more we are experiencing seasonal changes
the time zone change has pushed the evening peak back to he 0 through he 0
these hours are now premium
the load curve no longer resembles a rolling hill but has an extreme morning ramp and an extreme evening ramp
both epe and the caiso in np-0 will have difficulty with this evening ramp
do not count on the epe load forecast to accurately identify the evening ramp
we should not suck off the grid
pay the extra $0 for firm or unit contingent power in the sw
we need to attack the evening peak early and make sure we cover it
we should be using congestion wheels as hedges
a 0 mw import requires a 0 mw wheel going in the opposite direction at $0.0--or less--we should not do 0 mws at $0 as we would still have to pay $0 on the other 0 mws if we get awarded all 0 mws of relief
we will discuss this in our meeting next tuesday november 0th at 0:0
let's be sharp and not give away hard-earned revenue on congestion mis-management or poor scheduling
any questions
comments
ideas
bring them to the meeting on next tuesday
thanks
bill
group
a quick reminder
all el paso electric deals and related deals for el paso electric
ie buying from srp selling to epe--anything with a group of epec in enpower
need to be in mst
these deals should be scheduled in mst on the deal scheduling portion of enpower as well
thanks
bill
josie
sign me up
thanks
bill
just need to know why there will be a bom charge of $0.0
my impression is that this was totally trued up
is this some weird tranny charge
ideas
as always
if you could go through these charges that would be great
and i like the idea of showing the $0,0.0 this month
thanks
bill
super
and sorry about getting you locked in the stairwell
i just
thanks
and sorry again about the stairwell--did you actually get stuck in there
this is totally inappropriate and highly unprofessional
in these difficult times we need to continue to put forth and display enron's core values
respect
integrity
communication and excellence
i look for this in each one of my coworkers and for every member of the real-time team
please see what you can do to better respect kate's feelings and the effort she puts in each day
darin
i need you to send emails regarding our disputes to myself and kate symes
please do not send emails regarding our disputes to our customers--el paso or others
also
my email is bill.williams.iii@enron.com
i appreciate the email
but i had to receive it from our customer
let's set up a time to meet and run through some things on sunday or monday morning
give me a call on my cell phone on saturday when you have a chance
thanks
bill
cara
sounds good but
we had to change the night to november 0th
i'm sorry
hopefully it still works for you guys
did you want to get rooms as well
if so just speak with jill chatterton
more to follow
pretty much
its turning into the only day they have available for what we need
short of thanksgiving weekend or late december
which is getting a bit close to the holidays
what do you think
is it a good way to end the month
this is at the top right after you turning the volume on your computer down
also
right after the boxes
but parallel to fsp parallel testing
thanks
bill

could you help me put enpower on my local computer
and my monitor keeps sleeping on the job
thanks
bill
guys
when you see four corners #0 come back tonight
please use the fundies website to send out a message confirming it to traders and rt
also
you should give bpa and cers a call tonight to see if they are selling off cheap power
also
we are long 0mws flat at pv
see kate's email
the prices are $0 and $0
feel free to sell off up to he 0 at around 0
if you can get 0 bal peak--go for it
we sold 0's across the peak at pv tonight
this was a result of the four corners 0 derate so prices may fall hard tomorrow
please try to find some information on the status of southpoint and the desert basin unit tonight as well
this used to be reliant's plant
rumor has it this is now srp's starting tomorrow
as a bonus
calpine scheduled off of southpoint for tomorrow while the plant was still down for maitenence
if you get cut--sell them the off peak at pv for $0
make them wear it
as an added bonus don't forget ladwp and coral cut us off for
credit reasons
please treat them as you would any other non-performing counterpartfinally
services has a new deal with a cement company in np-0
we will liquidate the energy for the services desk rt at np-0 +
$0
we need to make a buy/sell from imbalance under services at $0 price
we then make a buy/sell from services under st-whourly at np-0 +
$0
finally we buy/sell from/to counterparty x under the st-whourly book
then we need to give services the swap deal # and the price
the mw values should be on kysa's sheet
if this procedure works
please send out an email detailing the procedure with whatever comments are necessary when this goes physical
have fun and good luck
thanks
bill

check this out
we got this from our managing director this morning
so is the fremont bridge a target
how bout the i-0
might want to pass this on to your mom and dad
by the way--your a wuss for skipping the high school playoff game
this just came to me today
this information is widely available to corporations and law enforcement around the country
it will likely hit the media in the next day or so
this is all the information that is available
enron corp
business controls/corporate security received the following information via the national threat warning system
while we do not wish to unduly alarm employees
the specificity of the information dictated immediate dissemination to our west coast offices
the fbi is in possession of uncorroborated information indicating the possibility of additional terrorist attacks against the united states
specifically the west coast
reportedly
unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the west coast
six incidents are to take place during rush hour beginning friday
november 0 and continuing no further information about this alleged attack is known at this time
the fbi is attempting to verify the validity of this report
recipients will be updated as events warrant
recipients who receive or develop information related to this matter should immediately contact their local fbi office
we will keep you apprised if we receive any further information
thank you
is the bet that i will reject the idea
diana
here is the message that kate sent to diane
and the original messages from diane are below that

it always seems to happen around that time

we are interested in hiring the best person for the job
if you were that person
then we would do our best to facilitate your move
again
thank you for your interest
and if you have further questions just give me a call
bill
i thought your email regarding the running of cong with a heuristic rather than optimal solution may address and solve the problem
i have not yet been able to pull up
corrected
prices but hopefully they will now reflect our bids
the problems i referred to in my phone message last week were similar to what my original email detailed
basically
we were awarded mw's on a congestion management schedule and the published prices did not match our bids
will the change in running the
solutions
change this
our volume management group will then be inputing our bid price rather than the published congestion management price--as those prices are not yet published correctly
i will be in the office this week and can be reached at your convenience
thanks
bill
a truly useful fount of knowledge
we will not be needing any headsets in the real-time group
thanks for checking
bill
this is appropriate--do not make the enpower till the next day if it will be under st-whourly
this was meant for you
this should go to bill williams
not bill williams iiii
i already do
i am sorry to hear this julie
i appreciate your effort and do not envy your task of informing the candidates of our change in plans
let me know if there is anything i can help with
bill
one more index
this is the one i would like to participate in
if it works
bill
group
we have returned to caps as of today
we will return to running the enpower to caps report as usual

good afternoon
we have recieved significant amounts of congestion revenue on real-time for 0/0
please use the inc sheet or caps to settle in the morning
the inc sheet has correct pricing and schedule id's
thanks
bill
extra st-sw transmission can be viewed in the available transmission sheet
i know jim
you guys are doing well
thanks
bill
amy
hey
great to hear from you
hope you are doing well
but
what are you talking about
who's on what side
and what are you trying to recall
bill
jill
could you look into my concur expense login/password
i am at a class today and need to approve these expense reports in the system
however,i cannot access the system
i am not sure if this is related to our floor wide network problems or what
also
we are a go for edgefield
you and i just need to talk about the expense report
thanks
bill
jim
we also received congestion revenue for he 0 through he 0
he0-although it shows nothing from the caiso on their site
their server went down
is the same as he0-the caiso specifically relayed this to me on a recorded line
thanks
bill
jim
you can find he 0 through 0 at the bottom of the november service sheet
this should be in the same location as the trading sheet in the inc sheet section
my understanding is that you were given a copy of the service sheet with the trading sheet yesterday morning
you should find probably another $0,0 maybe $0,0 at the bottom of the sheet
if you have any questions just let me know
thanks
bill
group
we have had some issues with epmicalpool deals recently and i wanted to provide information for newer members of the group and a quick reminder for crusty veterans as we head into the thanksgiving holiday
i have also decided to change our protocol for entering multiple epmicalpool deals
please pay special attention to #0 below
so
some basic rules about epmicalpool deals
0
epmicalpool deals are buy-resale deals
a transmission deal will work but is not the preferred method
0
we only buy from the epmicalpool-no exceptions
0
epmicalpool deals have a $0 price in the buy and sell portions
please do not enter a price on an epmicalpool deal
0
epmicalpool deals must have a delivery point of an ciso tie point or an ciso congestion zone
good delivery points would be
malin
cob n/s
cob s/n
nob n/s
nob s/n
cascade
captain jack
summit
four corners 0
mead 0
paloverde
np-0
zp-0
sp-0
bad delivery points would include
mid-c
hotsprings
hidalgo
bc border
0
important changes to business practice here epmicalpool deals are used to simulate the purchase of transmission from the california iso
a
if you have a wheel from tie point to tie point for example malin to four corners for congestion management--than an epmicalpool deal from malin to four corners would be appropriate
for seperate wheels from tie point to tie point we will not be putting in deals from malin to np-0
np-0 to sp-0
and sp-0 to four corners
b
however
from congestion zone to congestion zone inside of california
or if you are moving tie point to a congestion zone--for example malin to sp-0 we will need a malin to np-0 and np-0 to sp-0
this will allow us to better capture congestion across congestion zones in california
and will prepare us for the move to fsp
0
we will initiate this change in business practice he 0 on tuesday november 0th
epmicalpool deals continue to provide problems with reports
please see me with any questions
thanks
bill
group
we will have an emergency meeting on monday
november 0th at 0 pm

lotus notes is being phased out of operation
and we are working with the enpower team in houston to develop a discussion database similar to the one we currently use in notes
these new applications will be a part of that
so please begin adjusting your nightly schedule checkout and/or cuts procedure accordingly
i.e
record cut paths in enpower path confirmation
not lotus notes
tim
i have been approached by 0 different groups regarding an ha or rt index in the west
i have decided against participating with tradernews or powerdex
i am considering participating with dow jones
i think a working index would help encourage liquidity through price discovery in real time
it should also provide an index to settle against financially for our desk and the cash desks
i am working with kate and our developement group upstairs to get the tools in place to participate in the dow jones index
i am still waiting for the confidentiality agreements from dj and will be sending them to steve hall when they arrive
i have concerns that participating in this index may spread some of the value we obtain in making a market on eol to our counterparties
i would appreciate your thoughts on this when you have an opportunity
thanks
bill
i appreciate the goals and accomplishments
i was looking more for a quick outline of duties
this should work though
thanks
bill
i like that much better

what is a cpe certificate
allegheny's sc is now apx 0
contact numbers are below
thanks bill
susan
thank you
this looks good
to answer some of your questions
price is per mw
not per deal
transmission deals
epmicalpool deals

thanks for reserving the room
i will not need any food ordered

we are currently owed money by cers
approximately $0,0
we need to net this to a zero by friday
it is very important that each of you call cers and purchase energy from them to net this position out
otherwise--we will see a loss of $0,0
let's make this problem go away
thanks
bill
i have also not been able to approve these
i do need those folks to have access
i spoke with jim danielson at mwd regarding this cut on 0/0
we did not deliver the 0 mws to mwd
jim at mwd requested that we
book out
the cut with him at the contract price of the 0 mws
i entered a deal to buy 0 mws from mwd at the contract price
$0.0
deal #0
and a deal to sell to calpine to capture ld's
$0.0
deal #0
i attempted to enter this in the cuts database but got several errors and do not have confidence that this occurred
please let me know if you have any questions
bill
nope
group
cuts are on the way
while most can be zeroed out in enpower
for ld's
like normal
longterm contracts will require an annuity for the value of the cut on that particular day
in the interest of being uniform
the guidelines for cuts are below
we will be handling cuts in the following manner
0
documentation is priority #0
we need to fill out a cut sheet with the times
the name of the person who called
the tag number
the quantity and price
0
after attempting to resupply the cut or find an alternate sink we need to carefully document changes in the new enpower workspace
0
we need to zero out all cut deals in enpower
we then need to calculate the value of the deals and make an annuity
the annuity must be made he 0 on the following day of the schedule
the annuity needs to be for 0 mw for the value of the zeroed out contract
in the comment section of the annuity you must include the enpower deal # of the cut deal and should include an indication of the number of mws each hour and the contract price--for example
0 hours @ 0 mws x $0 per mw = $0,0
0
please be as accurate as possible
we still need to be flat in enpower at the end of each day
and we still need to calculate our daily position
0

as of he0 this morning
our contract with mpc was ended
for the time being
we will no longer be balancing mpc's load
also
we can only purchase up to 0 mws from aps transmission
please do not put wheels in to relieve congestion for over 0 mws
but do check the transmission availability on the website and maximize our ability to relieve congestion with aps in the southwest
these should be the only congestion wheels that we run
also
please use pnm not aep for any sleeving for epe

i need your help with some enpower applications
please give me a call as soon as you have an opportunity
by the way
i sure hope your longhorns do not end up matched against my huskies
ouch
thanks
bill
this is important
for all cuts the following procedures apply
0
notes as usual 0
in the enpower path confirmation
we need to make cuts as path confirms
enter comments in the confirmed section
we will be zeroing enpower deals out on monday
hint
notes are very important--all cuts must be notated and the notes must be put in the accordion folders
0
try to have the counterparties continue any paths around us
just
bow out
gracefully if you have no other options with the words
l
d's
0
if we are cut by a generator/utility going into california
we must call the ha desk at california and tell them the increment that we will be underscheduling our load by
for example
epe will be cutting all schedules going into california on light load
0 mws
if we cannot resupply the schedules we need to tell the state that we are underscheduling our load by 0 mws
this is extremely important
we have posted an lc with cali for this reason
also
epe will be long rt 0 mws off-peak as they are no longer selling to us
0 mws should be sold to tep to cover a forward schedule
stacy has set this up at pv
please do this as a direct bill with epe
as of jan 0
0 we will no longer be marketing for epe
also
pv#0 will be coming off this weekend
and fc#0 will be down from he 0 on saturday through he 0 on sunday
this will probably not be a fun weekend
i appreciate your help
bill

as we have more and more cuts
we have an excellant opportunity to refine our cut technique

zero out cut schedules in deal scheduling

zero out the epmicalpool

the key is to go long heroin and coke when you have a chance
and put extra money in the bank bill
this can also be found at p:realtime/williamsonly/dopewars in the p drive
if you have access
what up dawg
how are you and meg doing
i still have a job
it has been an extremely rocky time
however
i feel optimistic that our trading business will continue in some fashion
i believe that we will be bought out by an investment bank and that we will be able to start trading again
the chances are good that i will have to thin out my group a bit
i am hoping that attrition will take care of some of the members of the group
i think we are going to let traders out of their contract if they want to leave
hopefully that will cut down on any direct lay-offs i will have to do
it would suck having to lay-off good people
its worrisome but like i said
i am optimistic
soccer was going well
but i sprained my knee pretty badly playing indoor last night
so another two-three weeks before i am out there playing again
bollocks

just to follow-up from yesterday
two key real-time customers would be mpc
load balancing agreement
and epe
power
consulting
agreement
other customers such as lv cogen and valley are important
but they do not provide the market information or the opportunities of these two
as soon as we have something tangible regarding a new company
and likely before
i think we need to visit these customers and get them back
ideas

bill

that is very good news
alan
i just want to pass on the two names i had mentioned previously to you
eric linder and steve merriss
their home numbers are 0-0-0 and 0-0-0 respectively
both had worked for me for about 0-0 months
these are the only numbers i have for them as their cell phones have been canceled
bill
jason
good afternoon
i am contacting you regarding activating a pass to the employee store
i did product testing for you in late spring
for soccer
i would like to activate the pass for tomorrow
december 0th
if possible
i recognize this is short notice but if this would be possible please give me a call back at 0-0-0
i would like to have my parents attend as well
their names are bill and joy williams
i appreciate your help
thanks
bill williams
i can be a reference for both eric and steve
good morning
how are you doing
it seems like i haven't seen you or scott forever
things are going well here in portland
the bankruptcy of enron has been a bit rough
but i am optimistic that the auction on january 0th will see the trading portion of our business bought out by a credit-worthy entity
if we are bought out
we should be back up and running by early spring
right now
i am just working on systems upgrades and trying to learn as much as i can so we are ready to rip when we have credit again
portland has been fun the past couple weeks
there are a few new clubs and living downtown continues to be a blast
i enjoy being able to walk everywhere and being downtown has really aided the christmas shopping
i haven't been up to seattle in a long time but i need to get up there
i am thinking about coming up for new year's
any good ideas
anyway
hope you are doing well and are all ready for the holidays
take care
bill
stewart and paul
i have heard that mpc has contracted with avista to do their load balancing
has anyone contacted mpc to discuss continuing or renewing our relationship with them in the future
mpc is likely month-to-month with avista as they were with us
has there been any progress with epe
what are your expectations for retaining them
of all our service customers these would be the only two i am truly concerned about getting back
i think we have seen significant revenue from both
more because of the information they provide then because of the fee structures
please let me know if you have any questions
or if there is anything i can do to assist
thanks

you should read liar's poker by michael lewis
and den of thieves
good stuff
he notes that enron management lacked an
honor among thieves
but predicts that enron alumni will flourish
i suspect he is working on the enron book right now.---sch is enron the new drexel
by michael lewis
the author of ``liar's poker
and ``the new new thing
berkeley
california
dec

bloomberg
enron corp
is rapidly expanding the american business journalists
notion of what is possible
no story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true
the boss
kenneth lay
was a friend of the current president of these united states
an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers
the company itself was rated ``strong buy
by analysts at almost every wall street firm
considered a shining example of modern accounting by reputable accounting firms
and plugged endlessly by the business press
six years running as fortune's most innovative company
and all the while this same operation was
at the very top
a lie
understandably
people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation
but really there isn't a good one
other than failed hedge fund long-term capital management
michael milken's junk bond department at drexel burnham lambert offers the closest parallels on wall street
and several people have written to me over the past week to suggest it
but it really is unfair to milken to compare him to lay
alumni will flourish true
in both cases profitable trading businesses collapsed because their creditors came to distrust the people who ran them
and in both cases the core business
drexel's junk bonds and enron's energy trading
remain viable in the hands of other companies that banks trust
just as the drexel junk bond traders who didn't go to jail went to other wall street firms and created replicas of their former business
former enron traders will soon be making lots of money for one-time rivals such as dynegy inc
and duke energy corp
well before kenneth lay emerges from his legal hell
the energy trading business will return to normal
but the morality of the cases are entirely different
whatever you think of milken's junk bond department
and i think its sins were minor beside its achievements
you must admit the people in it exhibited a certain honor among thieves
there was never a moment when milken betrayed the broad interests of his traders for his own narrow ones
he paid himself huge sums of money
but he also made huge sums for his firm
he was careful to watch out for the little people who worked for him
and they loved him for it
the enron bosses
by contrast
pillaged their firm and left the little people who worked for them holding the bag
different motivations enron created the illusion that it was much more profitable than it actually was
milken created an operation which was
if anything
much more profitable than it looked
what milken hid was the thuggish manner in which he made his profits
what enron hid was the sneaky way it made its losses
this is something i still don't understand
and would love for some enterprising reporter to explain
as enron seems intent on explaining nothing
the off-the-books partnerships that brought enron down appear to have been a mechanism for hiding bad investments in hard assets
turkish gas pipelines
indian power plants and the like
why did enron
which made its money as an intermediary
invest in this stuff in the first place
the speed with which the markets have punished enron reflects the differences between it and drexel
in drexel's case
it took a multiyear investigation by the u.s
government
together with a smear campaign in the press
to bring down the business
in enron's case
all it took was a couple of articles in the wall street journal pointing out
among other things
that senior executives were profiting at the company's expense
in drexel's case
the demise of the firm and the jailing of milken was pretty much the end of the story
in enron's
the fate of the company and its leaders may open up a much bigger scandal that reaches right up to the top
anything is possible
good morning
hope you had a great holiday
bill
group
we have had some problems recently with the creation of ha finals
with sql errors
and as a result we have not been able to run reports
if it is a weekend
or holiday
we first need to import da finals and then create da finals in caps
after this is done we can import ha finals
and create the ha report
if the boxes are not checked
the ciso may have missed publishing certain hours
please look in the load zones to find what hour-ahead finals may not have been published
or where caps may have just missed pulling them in
sometimes it helps to pull the missing hour-ahead finals in individually
once all the finals are in the load zones and int
interchanges
you should be able to create the final report
please give me a call if you have any questions
thanks
bill
**per tony at epe
the following is new for 0
i will attempt to get more information and pass it on as i receive it.** first
tnp now has a 0 mw call on epe
the schedule you see on the unit commitment was called in by pnm on behalf of tnp
lets keep checking tnp schedules real-time to minimize inadverdant on this sale
second
sps exchange now is 0 mw light load
sps provides epe 0 mw at the eddy tie and epe returns the power 0 mw at pv and 0 at fc
again
this schedule will have to be verified real time with sps/psco
**the tnp schedule is verified with pnm and is delivered at hidalgo
0 is firm just like the last two years
0 is econ
and can be varied by pnm each hour.** please ask if you have any questions
thanks
bill
good morning
hope your new year is off to a great start
scotty
what's up
checking to see if this was your email or not
haven't heard from you in forever
hope you had a good new year
drop me a line and give me the word
bill
scott
i had not heard from you in a while and was wandering what you might be up to
still in seattle
coming down to portland anytime soon
let me know
word
alan
i think you have identified the most pressing issues
certainly the ability to go long or short into r/t will be important and hopefully the ciso will follow through on its efforts to
strive for simplicity and transparency
any idea what the penalties for being long or short in r/t might be
in the ciso's proposal the first two
goals
for the real time market appear to be at odds with each other
also
i think we should push to rid ourselves of 0-minute dispatch at tie points
i understand the caiso keeping the ads in-state but it has not worked at tie-points
feel free to let me know if you have any questions
thanks for the update
bill
real-time is on board and is comfortable with this
any questions from settlements
you have to love the availability of beautiful lasses for viewing
things are interesting
enron is moving right along and we will find out about who i am working for on friday
our auction should be completed then
not too much else is new
my place continues to get better
as i slowly furnish it
but portland continues to be the little sister to seattle
a couple new bars in town suggest she might be getting closer to puberty but definitely not the woman about town that seattle is
morgan told me you may no longer be with steph
is this true
and i hope you are the only one reading this if it is not
if that is the case
well
we can see what we can do about it
as always
i have no plans the next couple weekends
so give me a shout
still have my cell phone at 0-0-0
if you want to take a trip on down
your always welcome to crash on my couch
sorry its all i have
i got rid of the futon
hope youre doing well

these are fine
hope all is well
stacey
you can put john as your primary and me as your secondary
stacey
i don't really like what they are suggesting either
we'll talk monday
besides
they
we
would have to get aa to sign off on half mtm half something else
stacey
wasn't sure if you had heard anything about donnie testing for ees and enpower
i am not sure there is anything we need to do
just wanted to keep you in the loop
stacey
dave
can you please approve or reject samantha's request
if you are not comfortable approving it
then reject it so she can resubmit
when i went into the system today
it said it had already been assigned to you
stacey
did you send this to kathy reeves
she is in charge of calgary's power risk management
stacey
have them go through accounting
this is non-trading expenses
not our area unless it runs through the dpr
stacey
what is the latest on this
stacey
sounds good
i will abide
stacey
wasn't sure if you had gotten this answered
but there is really no reason that should want to see this
stacey
i understand all the following except the index-option
why would it be treated as a spread-option
stacey
where did she get this information
is it a below the line adjustment
not in the dpr
stacey
thank you
stacey
thanks
stacey
it was wonderful
not so excited to be back
i'm sure it will get better as the week goes on
how was your flight
did you feel safer
they want me to go on the london doorstep in november
so i was just wondering
stacey
all i ever saw was the e-mail from the office of the chair

thanks
stacey
yes
i agree with this request
stacey
the blending vs
non-blending can be confusing and could potentially cause problems down the road so i would first like to make some general statements regarding the history or this change and what the rules should be as i understand them
only the curves applicable to the east nerc regions are being marked as a daily and monthly volatility
therefore
no blending is needed for daily options
they point directly to the daily vols
or monthly options
they point directly to the monthly vol
all curves applicable to the west nerc regions are still being marked as intramonth and monthly
therefore
blending is needed to provide a volatility for daily options
the best rules to be in place for the blending vs
non-blending would be based on curve
east curves do not blend
west curves do blend
therefore
any daily or monthly option in the east would not have to blend
the potential problem that could be caused by making the rule apply to portfolios is that
for example
the east portfolio could potentially enter into an option at a west region
curve
and that transaction would need to use blended curves even though it is in the east portfolio
options at a different expiry than daily or monthly is another problem
are there different blending rules embedded in the code for weekly expiration
we still need to discuss this
i would be happy to all sit down and have a meeting concerning this issue whenever everyone is comfortable enough that we know all the current rules
let me know
stacey
i will talk to tim re
jeff richter's schedule c reserve and get back to you
stacey
lavorato is asking why jeff richter still has $0mm of reserve associated to him since he has moved to ees
how would you like me to handle this question
thanks
stacey
what was it
can you let them know you will be doing this
stacey
we will be having a staff meeting today
if we can start at 0:0 rather than 0:0 that would be great because i have an 0:0 meeting
john
what is the phone number where we can reach you
sorry i do not have an itinerary
i would like to go over doorstep findings and anything else you would like to fill me in on since we have not met in a while
stacey
thanks for doing all the work
stacey
can you take a look at this report for the west and make sure it is correct
thanks
stacey
question re
jeff richter stacey
sounds like a great idea to do follow-up reviews
i have budgeted $0 a month for travel and lodging on the west rc
i would prefer you keep it to every six weeks in order to cover me coming up there and others coming down for training
i think it would be beneficial for you to be able to meet with groups in houston
i also only budgeted for $0/month for overtime/working meals so we may have to subsidize that with the traveling budget
i have not heard anything lately on the video conferencing
if you don't mind
ask tim if he has made any decisions on the video conferencing
stacey
let's wait until we all meet so we don't piecemeal the data to you
but you are correct in your assumption about transmission for the east
stacey
let me know if this does not work
this is a report straight from the calculation engine so it is easy and fast to generate
stacey
are you still attending these meetings
stacey
make sure you have my e-mail address as the full name stacey.w.white@enron.com i don't know why they would be coming back
hope you are doing well
stacey
does this make sense to you

if so
please put together a bullet point list of what we do on a daily basis
who the audience is
and anything else you think might be relevant to an audience of users interested in what procedures we perform for stress
scenario testing
thanks
stacey
which ancillary curves are you referring to
dana and doug mark the northeast and ercot ancillaries and we do not have ancillaries for every curve
stacey
i cannot think of anything that would cause this to be incorrect
please let me know if you agree and i will bless the change
thanks
stacey
do you still have a list of users who calculated their books at the end of september as 0/0 instead of 0/0
stacey
let's go ahead and make this change
we can think of no reason why this would cause a problem
if everyone could keep a close eye on this deal after the change
that will be most beneficial
thanks

donnie may have them
remember
he was dressed as austin powers
stacey
as long as tim has conversations with lavo and we get adequate documentation to share with accounting
we should be fine
stacey
that is fine
she doesn't really care about the schedule c stuff
she just wants to know that is going to come off of ltd
stacey
actually
i believe we got a hold of kori and erol last month before they officialized and they did it correctly

any power exchange transactions should be included

stacey

a member of your fundamentals team
maria van houton

yes
stacey
michael
can you remind me who all gets these reports
stacey
thanks
keith
here are the procedures for the east
the west is not currently running option sensitivities
approximately every one to two weeks or as requested by the options traders an option sensitivity report is run using portcalc
three parameters are tested
price
increments from
0 to +0
monthly volatility
increments from
0% to +0%
and time
increments up to 0 days
reminder
the increments are changeable
the data is imported from portcalc into an excel pivot table
the pivot table is then used to show how the various greeks
delta
gamma
theta and vega
change for each trader's book
generally with a 0 month look ahead
the data can also be sorted by and grouped by other criteria
if requested
such as by region and delivery date these reports are given to the east option traders only
thanks
stacey
sorry i haven't responded very timely
things have been hectic at work
i am looking forward to seeing you tomorrow

improved request form
see m:\common\power\riskmgmt\admin\requests
request templates\blank book request enpower.xls thanks
stacey
i was not sure if you wanted exposure by asset
liability or absolute value so i provided the top 0 assets and top 0 liabilities
hope this helps
stacey

my husband's pager
0-0-0 if you need anything else
please let me know
stacey
i thought we already told them to exclude those portfolios
stacey
yeah
are you still going on vacation
stacey
i was working on getting the right sign-off before i approved or denied
i should know no later than tomorrow
stacey
you can go ahead and send it to me as i am sure i will be performing the review at some point
thanks
stacey
just curious
what was nick doing when he visited houston the beginning of november
just wondering
because i didn't know he was here
stacey
ok
i believe that is when i was gone
now that you mention it
stacey
if you get a chance
give me a call
can't wait to hear all the london scoop
i hope you are well despite this disaster
stacey
i heard you got information on monica
could you forward it to me
thanks
stacey
i'm all right
in denial a little because i really do not want to work anywhere else
but oh well
how are you
did you get a chance to talk to monica
i hope they are o.k
stacey
here you go
sorry for the delay
please let me know what else i can do
the file is subtotaled to include peak and off-peak together
it includes both positions and current mtm as of last night
stacey white
have you turned in my expense report
do you need my amex bill
stacey
thanks
stacey
i'll let you know if i hear anything
i have absolutely no idea at this point
stacey
i have no contractors
stacey
as of right now this is the plan for the killed transactions
please use the attached spreadsheet that indicates the prior day changes in your rolls
then compare these actual changes to the projected changes in the spreadsheet below
as of tonight
please top-level all prior day changes and we will tackle tomorrow
also
remember that traditionally you would have no financial prior days on the first business day
so the financial prior days showing up in your rolls are due to killed financial transactions
these amounts should also be top-leveled
thanks
stacey
when does she leave
stacey
please make sure you cc
me on all requests that you send out to credit
var
etc for the banks
if you are not sending something via e-mail and you are just giving information over the phone
please send me the information as well
thanks
stacey
i was in a meeting last night to discuss who was critical
i do not know if that list has been blessed
the list we put together would definitely get us a through especially since we will not have all the old deals
your normal contacts should be there
norman
zhiyun
min
duong luu
will smith
stacey
that is bizarre
they may have sent everyone home and called them back
i will investigate tomorrow
stacey
can you give me a final list of the enpower support that still exists so that we can have a good contact list
thanks
stacey
can you look in to this for me
stacey
where is the dpos folder
stacey
do you think min would be able to help
stacey
can you unarchive m:\common\power\position\dpr\0 and as far back as there are years in this directory
stacey
min should be able to help you with your excel request
stacey
have you been in contact with him
stacey
he would definitely be going to clean-up if we start the new company
if we do not start the new company he would be the first person laid off
what kind of contract is he under
stacey
i have no idea how the contracts are being handled
if he is that unhappy he should talk to billy lemmons
the associate hr rep
stacey
here is my request
can you make the system calculate a killed deal
there were deals killed with sempra energy trading on saturday and the credit group needs to know what the value would have been had these deals been calculated against yesterday's curves
basically
we need to calc all sempra deals that were killed saturday or later as of last night
is this possible
thanks
stacey
the lt-option book should have a prior day of +0,0.0
please include this in the spreadsheet i sent out yesterday
it is a constellation deal that was not killed
thanks
stacey
i have norman running a calc on the sempra transactions
he was able to set up a special calc to calc the killed deals
when he is able to give you the values
will you call dave forster @ 0-0 and let him know the values
i will be in meetings from 0:0
0:0
thanks
stacey
good to hear
i had received this from chris abel
maybe it will be beneficial
stacey
please provide access to the following individuals
thanks
stacey
this is the latest on our status of calculating and reporting the dpr
rick buy
our chief risk officer
asked that we get back to normal as soon as possible
i am currently working on termination statuses and when deals will be killed etc
i am also working on a way to get the pcs cleaned up
continue to run the calc with the true-up flag off as this will cause more confusion than it is worth
thanks
stacey
no problem
do not worry about my previous requests
stacey
i was comparing the
position by trader print
tab in westpos to the var report
nov
0 for example
i would hope the rules for carrying over a week will still apply
but i have not heard anything concrete
i'll see what i can find out
stacey
those are funny
work is hectic
can't write much
but hope to find a time that you can come visit
stacey
thanks
any specific reason we need two different portfolios
stacey
james
birthday party is that saturday
before i knew that i was thinking of going home
stacey
please see the bottom of this e-mail for the original values given to andrea for this exercise
at the time
we had not broken out east
west and only had a total value
my issue is that the original values do not tie to the values were are seeing today
just to be sure
the calcs we are running should include all sempra deals killed on or after saturday
dec
0
can you please advise as to which numbers are correct
thanks
stacey
i had forwarded your message to hr and had not heard anything
however
i just went to yahoo and was reading an article that says the website is careerservices@enron.com but that it is not currently in operation
good luck
stacey
the lt-sw book was not officialized last night
i have officialized it this morning
we still need to be careful regarding officializations for credit purposes
stacey
will
if you could attempt the following report i would greatly appreciate it
i have given a best efforts try in report writer
but because i am pulling mtm value it is pulling every strip
i need all options by flowing from today forward for the east and west portfolios
i need deal date
start date
end date
premium
strike price
monthly/daily option indicator
mtm value from adhoc
buy/sell
counterparty
enron entity
call/put
deal type
region
thanks so much
stacey call me tomorrow when i can start working
0-0-0
the option query that we ran this morning does not tie back to adhoc
i first realized it when i was trying to clean up deals that had many strips
there were instances where the p&l and delta were not consistent for every strip so i looked in adhoc to see which number was right and that is when i started noticing inconsistencies
could you please query the p&l and delta for the following deal numbers in spreadsheet
the only way i have to do this is to query each deal separately in adhoc
your help would be greatly appreciated
stacey phone numbers where i can be reached
thanks
stacey
i have consolidated the changes in the following file
please change the trade date on all the newly created bankruptcy deals to the trade date of the original deal
also
please cross-reference in both transactions the associated deals numbers and document that the deal numbers are due to termination
also
check with will smith to make sure he has completed the allegheny transfers
they were missed in the initial batch run
and then re-calc the
termination test
portcalcs to ensure that the designated counterparties are not included in the old portfolios
also
check with norman or zhiyun to ensure that they have attached the port-calc code to the bankruptcy portfolios and then we need to make test runs on them as well
thanks
stacey
can you please work on attaching the portcalc code to the bankruptcy portfolios first thing monday morning
please reply to this e-mail when it is complete so we can begin testing the transactions we moved
thanks
stacey p.s
zhiyun
thank you so much for the option data
stacey
melissa
can you please attach the effective termination dates to your physical and financial termination lists
we have yet to touch december
and need these dates before we can start
thanks
stacey
the most updated termination lists are in the following files
they are saved in m:\riskmgt\stacey\special projects stacey
when you are done with the script please call casey and john
thanks
stacey
could you have someone put together the trader performance spreadsheet for november
thanks
stacey
have you sent it to frank
thought you might need to know some of these names
stacey
frank
please ensure that israel estrada receives his previous access for it purposes
he was mistakenly removed on friday
stacey
please split up the following list and change the deal date back to the original deal date
thanks
stacey
i don't
stacey
call me tomorrow so we can discuss the following
employee morale terminations with cash already paid other terminations to ensure they are not affecting downstream systems scheduling cuts thanks
stacey
corry
i would love to start the process of cleaning up the scheduling system
we will need help from the schedulers as well so can you send duong luu their logins and request the
zero volumes
application in enpower
there are many people asking about what is flowing and the month is creeping by so if you could get with me tomorrow to make a game plan that would be great
i think we should have the schedulers send us their spreadsheets with an explanatory and then we
along with unify users
will come up with a plan
i hope to use the schedulers in this process as well
let me know your thoughts
thanks
stacey
we are going to cuero this weekend so will not be in for sunday brunch
sorry i will miss it
stacey
will
please run the 0 script for coral power
l.l.c
let me know when you are done
stacey
one question
i had melissa murphy put together the termination dates for each of the counterparties and was wondering if you could clarify something for me
if a termination date is 0/0/0
do i move 0/0 forward to the bankrupt book or do i move 0/0 forward to the bankrupt book
thanks
stacey
i spoke with this recruiter on the phone and told her i would forward the information to our accounting group
i was not sure who all in your group was part of the layoffs and thought you might be able to forward them this information
stacey
elsie
i put the 0/0 strip back in the deal
the
0 in bankruptcy
does refer to another deal that we created due to aquila terminating transactions with us
the reason you cannot see it is because you probably do not have access to the new portfolio
stacey
fyi
wasn't sure if you had seen this website
hope your searches are going well
stacey
i am waiting for an answer back from elizabeth
but was wondering if you or any of your contacts might know the answer to the following
thanks
stacey
yes
you will do normal calculation tonight
in addition
either today or tomorrow
please also calculate the bankruptcy portfolio
export data from both west and bankruptcy portfolio by counterparty and physical/financial
compare the data to the termination lists
all counterparties on the termination list should be included in bankruptcy portfolio and all other counterparties should be in the west portfolio
if you notice discrepencies
please investigate and correct
also
will is still changing some deals that casey sent him an e-mail on
do you know if this affected the west
if so
you will need to wait until he is complete
stacey
due to problems with the gas curves there will be incorrect credit information for txu
calpine and indeck pepperel power assoc
out of enpower
these counterparties have spread options and/or heat rate swaps that utilize the gas curves
if you need these transaction re-calced in the morning please contact andrea dahlke and x 0-0
thanks
stacey
the gas curve problems have been solved
therefore
there will be no problems with the following counterparties
stacey
do your gas books have any gas deals left
there were 0,0 deals missed in the
kill exercise
performed by it
if you have deals left
please re-calc tomorrow to see if they go away
if you have no deals
then you are done
stacey
john
this file gives you similar information to the file that jeff sent you for gas
frank is using it to continue investigating what went wrong with the extraction from the var model
if you want me to change anything
let me know
thanks
stacey
we technically should have no third party transactions
if we do
we need to move them to the ng-price book
please let me know if this is the case
also
casey
i will be both be out of the office tomorrow
if you need someone in houston to help get questions answered please call andrea
thanks
stacey
here is the file i started
i know there is plenty of missing data because i did not know all the commodities involved with each counterparty
if you could fill in what you know
that would be a big head start on this heinous project
i will be out of the office tomorrow
my cell phone works again so i will be available
have a great weekend
thanks
stacey
i will be out of the office tomorrow and out of town this weekend
if an emergency arises
please try the following numbers
have a great weekend
the bankruptcy post ids are as follows
let me know what else i can do
stacey
got it
hope everything is going well
stacey
when you get a chance
give me an update on this
stacey
yes
i can get bpa volumes
what is it for
stacey
when
monday
december 0
0 0:0 pm-0:0 pm
gmt-0:0
central time
us
canada
where
my desk
what did today's look like
do we still have the same problems in power
stacey
thanks for the offer
i have a dr's appt
maybe later this week
mid c is r0
but wscc-n is r0
a
b
indicates a basis curve which wscc-n is not
have you talked to bruce from chase re
these files
stacey
just wanted to make sure you had the latest files of terminated counterparties
please split the following deals into their respective pre and post bankruptcy desks
counterparty name trades terminated early termination date thanks
stacey
the post ids for the bankruptcy books will be
they are running right now
they take approximately 0 minutes so should be complete at 0:0
if you are not seeing numbers
call andrea dahlke x0-0
i am running to a dentist appointment this morning
and will be back shortly
stacey
attached is a spreadsheet with marks as of 0/0/0
if you need anything else
please let me know
stacey white
i am not sure why these did not show up yesterday
maybe my query was incorrect
however
the following spreadsheet contains terminated counterparties that still show up in the west portfolio
let me know that you have or have not corrected it
thanks
stacey
we are in town so count us in
i am totally planning on getting loaded
on munchies
stacey
melissa
i was told that grant county was also terminated and is on kim's list
but i have not seen it on our updated master power list
can you let me know the status of this counterparty
thanks
stacey
debbie
the bankruptcy post ids for 0-0 are 0 and 0
the data should be available first thing in the morning
norman is running the calcs for me because i was receiving error messages
stacey norman
if the post ids change or the data is not available by morning please reply to all to let us know the status
thanks
stacey
in addition to running the east and west portfolio calculations we will also be running the bankruptcy books on a daily basis
these should be run as
official adhoc full book
but not officialized
the post id numbers should be e-mailed to debbie brackett
stephanie mcginnis and john powell before you leave for the evening
thanks
stacey
we will be running a december mtd dpr tomorrow
before we start this process please recalc the east
west
eastbank
westbank portfolios to adhoc
check one more time that only terminated counterparties are in the bank portfolios and all terminated counterparties are out of the east and west portfolios
before kicking off the calcs
double check the specific deals that are listed on the physical power terminated spreadsheet
i believe there were whole deals moved to the bank portfolios by will that should never have been moved
because they were already liquidated in november
also
i have attached a new copy of the physical terminations
there is one counterparty
txu
added to the list that we need to take care of before kicking off the calcs
in addition to adjusting deal entry for txu we also need to adjust scheduling
before recalcing the bank portfolios
please contact debbie brackett or stephanie mcginnis
0-0
to make sure that they have extracted the data they need from the portfolios
we should still be calcing on
no true-up
casey
i know you said this probably will still cause us trouble
at this point
we are going for reasonableness with numbers
all the previous top-levels in our rolls
as of the 0rd or 0th
will stay as top-levels until we know the exact amount of cash that is being attributed to power
the remaining prior day values will be held in schedule e for georgeanne to move to a balance sheet account
these top levels should match the total value of your bankruptcy portfolios
where i think it will get tricky is that we are calculating as of the 0th and have transactions in the bankruptcy portfolio that are before the 0th and therefore will fall into your liquidations
these numbers will also have to moved to schedule e
when running through liquidations in the east and west portfolios
we will not be flat
currently
we are liquidating all non-terminated counterparties other than those specifically negotiated out of by scheduling
thresa and i are working on this with corry and cara
the settlements group will figure out what the counterparty agrees with through the check-out and ultimately the clean-up process
tomorrow should be a blast
i can't wait
stacey
what are you talking about
stacey
let me know if anything sticks out as peculiar
stacey
how do we want to go about this
stacey
this is the latest list i have received
i will forward you any updates
stacey
you suck
dana
here are the values of the annuities in the book as of 0/0/0
these annuities represent amounts ui paid to enron for the specified ppa's taken on during the transaction
stacey deal # description amount the following list represents other values associated with resco
derby and shelton
deal # description amount 0.0 receipt of capacity shelton $ 0,0 i have also attached a file with ui current deal numbers and comments attached to those deals
thought it might help
stacey
good news
the termination spreadsheets have been updated
there are three new counterparties for physical and one new counterparty for financial
will smith has moved a new version of deal liquidation into stage for us to use going forward
it incorporates both his script for moving deals to bankruptcy books and splitting deals on their termination dates
please look at this so we can use it on our updates
stacey
i have put this file together for our investigation
have to run to a meeting
can discuss later
stacey
i ran deal data for the counterparties we received termination notification on today
i did not want to start moving deals while you were running calcs
so we can just do this tomorrow
the deals are on the
east new as of 0-0
and the
west new as of 0-0
tabs
stacey p.s
don't forget about will's new application in stage
stacey
please forward to the following
nick hiemstra ed baughman naveed ahmed the request is for the east and west portfolios
non-terminated
don't forget to include capacity and show separately in queries
by portfolio
by counterparty
by category code
p&l and delta by month
also send a p&l update to elizabeth sager and don miller
the original files are
east by counterparty
and
west by counterparty
stacey
this is the latest draft of pre-bankruptcy pay-outs
i have put all the information i have
please add any that you may know
have a merry christmas
i spoke to tim today regarding the prepayment transactions with terminated counterparties
he constructed this e-mail in response
hope this clarifies
have a merry christmas
stacey
just wanted you to be aware of our concerns regarding min zheng
he is our excel support and is called upon on a daily basis for help
thanks
stacey
i have another meeting at this time
can we reschedule or can i send someone else
stacey
have you seen documentation on these counterparties
stacey
we have many deals in the system with ui
but they are all part of one contract
to my knowledge
this is the only big contract we have with them
just wanted to let you know because going through all the deals would be time consuming and they basically are one huge deal
stacey
no i had another meeting at this time
stacey
see point 0 below
just wanted you to be on the lookout for midamerican
stacey
one more to look for
stacey
fran
congratulations
i can't believe you didn't call and tell me
can't wait to see the ring
stacey
thank you regarding min
he does an extreme amount of work for us and i believe going forward we will need more rather than less of excel type reports
stacey
melissa
here are some more
just keeping you in the loop
stacey
min
i am so happy that you were moved to the netco list
thank you for all your hard work and the efforts you have put forth to learn our needs and react quickly to them
i look forward to working with you in the future
stacey
melissa
can you find out if this master energy purchase and sale agreement covers all our deals with txu
stacey
melissa
here are some more to investigate
stacey
one more forward of terminated counterparties
won't promise this will be the last
stacey
now that will has been cleaning out scheduling tables
will you ensure that the prepays in the document below are still in the scheduling system
if they are not
we can autoschedule them
thanks
stacey
thank you
please review and let me know if i have misrepresented any counterparties
if you want me to add comments
send them to me and i will incorporate
thanks
stacey david
just to make sure you know
the power physical terminated transactions spreadsheet
is put together by melissa from information she has received from master log and other
this is our primary source for moving transactions into the bankruptcy book as she review to ensure that the contracts terminated cover all our trades
thanks
stacey
let me know how i can help
stacey
here is the latest master
it is kind of a cluster
the easiest way to pick out power is to set an autofilter and look at enron entity column
stacey
can one of you resend me the unarchive shortcut to 0 data
stacey
as of now i should have no employees on the estate list
israel estrada was on the list previously
but we have moved him to power global rates in netco
stacey
fine by me
go ahead and include counterparties on our power list even if they do not have any outstanding trades
that way
if anyone is comparing our lists later on their will be no discrepancy and they won't have to ask us again
thanks for all the other information
stacey
i believe two of you is fine
we have stopped our rotation in the east and will have lots of work to do re
setting up books
continuing with terminations etc
until it becomes evident
continue on
stacey
we have been officializing every day and the information is obviously as good as the curves
every other friday is just as good as any other day
stacey
they are rotating one person out a day starting monday
we will not be setting up the west books
i would like to meet with you and casey monday morning if possible
you can still be at home as long as we can call you
stacey
would 0:0 our time work
stacey
i am not personally interested in any positions currently
thank you
stacey white
i can meet tuesday anywhere from 0:0 to 0:0
the meeting would have to end at 0:0 because i have a dr's appt
wednesday
i am totally open
stacey
this looks good
i originally had a headcount of 0
if you added one to my headcount
then i agree
stacey
wonder if he knows this
stacey
please let me know your thoughts on the following correspondence
we are in the process of putting together our integration plan and the interest rate curve is one of our biggest stumbling blocks since the interest rate group will not be going to newco
as you can see
your name has been volunteered and i need to know what all you will need access to in order to get this curve to the risk management groups on a timely
preferably 0:0 p.m
basis
thanks
stacey
casey and john can get back to you on your specific question re
canada
however
i wanted to let you know that our dpr will more than likely not be final until friday
hopefully we can get you all reports then
we have had to leave the dpr open due to many terminations that are still funneling our way and we are getting the 0-0 data as clean as possible for the estate
stacey
i know of nothing in stage that i use
i would like to make sure casey and john both agree with me
stacey
looks good
you mention month-end deadlines
you also might want to mention the work that goes on during month-end close and how that could potentially affect trading p&l
stacey
you can contact leslie reeves for this information
stacey
please find attached the integration plan for power risk management
if you need this information consolidated or expanded just let me know
thanks
stacey
casey
can you have someone follow up with hai and harry and see how all these reports are working
stacey
let me know if this is not what you need
stacey
why is there still a financial position in the east portfolio for ui
stacey
this is coming from kathy reeves
give her a call
stacey
i have already updated the physical and financial terminated spreadsheets with these updates
please have your groups start the split/clean-up scheduling process for the new counterparties
stacey
here is the latest results from our valuation engine
please let me know if you see any mistakes
we will update with your newest changes tomorrow
so you can exclude those from your evaluation
i also noticed that their is a financial ui transaction
i believe this was just an oversite and have asked casey to look into it
thanks
stacey
after talking to tom i have a new plan of attack for schedule e's
he informed me that the top-levels were typically put in at one region level per roll
i had zhiyun re-run the killed deals calc
post id 0
everyone should go back into the rolls and put the top-levels into their correct regions also adjusting the schedule e's
this is why the differences are so large in certain areas and the only way we can start to pinpoint the problem is to find the problem spots
i have also identified where the $0.0 mm difference for oppd arose from
deal # 0.0 has not been transferred into the east bank book
in addition
there are no volumes in this deals
however
if you look back to the official 0/0/0 calc there are volumes for this deal
it gets more bizarre than that because there were two deals that should have been transferred for oppd
0.0
and 0.0
deal 0.0 was transferred but the valuations are approximately $0mm different
i have printed detail for deals 0.0 and 0.0
they are in casey's chair
as of the 0/0/0 official calc
i have also printed deal 0.0 in the 0/0/0 bankruptcy calc
i noticed that i cannot see any swap detail reports for the bankruptcy calc
please re-calc and generate these reports as they will probably be important as we dig into details
other than andrea who has to perform some it testing
no one should be working
or playing
on anything other than trying to get these schedule e's and top-levels figured out
the task is actually very important as there will be many decisions made off of these numbers
thanks
stacey
i have two other meetings at this time
stacey
the e-mail was sent on 0/0/0
but the detail states that
txu energy trading company should be considered terminated effective december 0
0 by reason of an automatic termination provision in the agreement between txu and epmi
the e-mail does not give any details on ena
ecc
of ees
stacey
just make sure this is ok
stacey
this is possible
probably won't be until tomorrow
stacey
thanks
merry christmas
do you need any help
stacey
tim
john's communication regarding not updating december was in order to complete december liquidations for accounting and settlements last week
however
we were then informed that settlements would not draft their billing until the 0th of january so we then retracted our
hold
on updating december schedule
any updates that can be made in order for settlements to get the most accurate data would be most appreciated
in addition
the cash flow forecast
as indicated by don
will be coordinated through kristin
i do not believe you will have to do any work for this as all the data will come from our risk calculations and true settlement information
thanks
stacey
the users i would start with are
todd warwick frank cernosek stacey
don
could you have someone send me the newest list of counterparties
both east
west

as soon as we finish calcing our book on friday
we should be good to go
we will start as soon as possible
each of you needs to send a book request for the east
west portfolios for the counterparties listed in the following spreadsheet
the spreadsheet identifies those counterparties which we are still performing under the contracts
please create a east-performance and a west-performance book
we then need to get all deals with the following counterparties moved to those books
i would suggest you pull the values out of adhoc as of 0/0 for the counterparties by desk before transferring them to the new desk
obviously these transactions will create prior days and the amount will run through the p&l in the old and new books and flatten out
the remaining prior day value will need to be in schedule e
stacey
i have not recompared the master log to the
physical terminated
spreadsheet
this is just an update of my initial review
any comments would be appreciated
i have also not included the auto terminations that we found out about today
after tomorrow's updates
i will do these
we are planning on moving the auto-terminations identified by david and confirmed by kimberly to the bankruptcy book tomorrow
if anyone has a problem with the counterparties identified
please let me know as soon as possible thanks
stacey
please start the following task in the morning
using the official 0-0 calcs that you exported deal summaries from
add the following counterparty's mtm by desk
constellation energy authority sempra energy trading public service of colorado i believe the calc that identified our top-levels had extra transactions or values that did not fall out of our books
once you have figured out the total for the above counterparties compare them to your top-levels
thanks
stacey
i have to run
but call me tomorrow
i have an idea of what your difference might be caused from
stacey
are the numbers in canadian $'s
if so
can you send me conversions
thanks
stacey
thanks
the orig trading books can be set up at a later date
it should be a while before we have any activity of that sort
we ran financial liquidations because we have not had any additions to the financial terminations
i am working on one more big set of counterparties who had auto-termination language in their master agreements
i vote we catch up with all the information we have as of today and then run liquidations on monday
what do you guys think
stacey
sonia
kim may have some changes to the seating assignments
i believe these changes will also affect where evelyn's settlements group sits
please coordinate changes and then send me a list of desk #'s and associated names
i need to forward this information to lloyd will
thanks
stacey
john
not even the dec #'s are done yet
i believe they are planning on mass drafting monday
so whatever is in the system at this time will go to unify
we might as well match unify even if it is wrong
i guess
leslie
thoughts
stacey
casey
can you please auto-schedule the following deals for december
please let leslie and i know when you are complete
stacey deal #
what is the exact name for georgia pacific
we do not see any transactions with them in the system
stacey
steven luong and nick are working on a better list with more specific names
i'll keep you informed
stacey
i heard that
how was the floor meeting
stacey
i didn't hear much more than that myself
stacey
if you have not already done so
please send instructions to users
or it support
to update machines in portland
thanks
stacey
thanks
you just let me know what y'all decide
leslie
here is the most updated list of pre-bankruptcy payouts
do you think evelyn
bryce
etc
could put together numbers for outstanding payable/receivable
stacey
whenever we asked to give terminated information for the estate we should include the
alberta ena bankruptcy
portfolio
the transactions in this portfolio are transactions entered into by canada using a ena contract that has now been terminated
if you have specific questions
please contact kathy reeves
stacey
can you have someone do this
i forgot to put it on the group's to do list for the week
besides
i thought i would do it myself
but never seem to find time
stacey
was in a meeting with ubs at this time
sorry
stacey
thought you would think this was funny
stacey
what is she talking about
stacey
hope this helps a little bit re
risktrac
after talking to jeff
i believe the key to book codes is ensuring from it that we can use whatever we want as the database will be entry
andrea
i agree that you should keep a power list and kam should keep the gas list
also
just wondering if when we set up the gas books should we have also put in requests for gas daily
basis
index
etc
i couldn't remember how that worked
stacey
thanks
can you tell me what the post-id was on my original file
stacey
here you go
stacey
fyi stacey
that's it for me
stacey
wasn't sure if you wanted to read the whole letter
here it is
if so
stacey
thought you were moving this meeting to 0:0
jeff and i have a meeting with ubs from 0:0-0:0
stacey
can you all verify that you do or do not use the applications listed below as soon as possible
we are in the process of moving or discarding applications to move to the netco environment and are unaware of who uses the following applications
thanks
stacey
hope all is well
my new e-mail is stacey.w.white@enron.com the one you have will be decommissioned shortly
i still have a job and will more than likely go to the
new co
the piece that ubs has bid for
currently
we are extremely busy trying to close out old business at the same time as setting up details of the new business
russell and i are both well
probably working too hard
what is new with you
stacey if you get a chance give me a call
would love to talk to you
0-0-0
w
0-0-0
cell
i tried the number listed on this e-mail for you
but it just rang and rang
can you update the original file you sent with bryce's changes below
i am afraid i do not understand exactly what i should change on sequent
thanks
stacey
did y'all export
etc
stacey
i totally agree
stacey
yes
thank you
how much do i owe you
stacey
have you forwarded to john
or do i need to
have you told kathy about this transfer
should it be a bankruptcy book
stacey
you will love this
stacey
it looks good for me
there are a couple of applications i do not have access to
let me know what method you would like me to take in requesting access
stacey
can cecilia do what she has requested below
stacey
the following post-id's represent the re-calcs for 0-0
the total forward p&l for these post-id's should be $0,0,0 the following spreadsheets represents the final product from our request
please see if you can pull by the parameters we chose from adhoc
stacey
thanks
home 0-0-0 cell 0-0-0 hope these are still the same
stacey
so sorry to be such a bother
but i just want to make sure that you received and are frantically thinking about my message
ubs is needing names confirmed this morning so offer letters can go out today
stacey
thank you so much for this query
at this time
i am not sure what happened to the numbers in our spreadsheet
the data was pulled from adhoc by calculating east
west
eastbank
westbank
however
the total we retrieved from adhoc did not match the total portcalc value
i do not want you to spend time trying to figure out what happened to our spreadsheet because it could have been anything from using the wrong code to calc the books to simple user error
there are too many variables that are unknown
the good thing is
it works now
thanks
stacey
i have re-confirmed with power operations and there are no more spots available to make room for one more risk person
i have all of heather's information and will be glad to communicate her offer to her
if it has not already been communicated
also
please let me know the message you are sending to
estate
employees in portland
i would like to communicate the same message to samantha
if you want to talk to me you can reach me at 0-0-0 or send me an e-mail
stacey
according to tim
if we could find no other spots for her to stay in risk
she would be designated as vm and kit blair would be taken off the list
do you know what communication is being given to
estate
employees in portland
stacey
sounds good to me
the only days i don't want to meet are the 0th and 0th
stacey
thanks for the update
i finally talked to him also
the message you just told me
is what i communicated to samantha
whenever or if ever
you find out more specifics re
portland estate
please let me know
stacey
here you go
there is a chance i may have to go to a ubs dinner tonight
but it might get changed to tomorrow
if it does get changed
i will be there tonight
stacey
do you think we should get sonia to update this
stacey
i will be out of the office for a ubs orientation
stacey
make sure you talk to casey
john
most of my houston group has been out of the office either this morning or this afternoon for a ubs orientation
stacey
do you know if they got these same numbers from john
stacey
please update me on the answer to the following e-mail
i am almost certain i know the answer
but would like to make sure we are all on the same page
thanks
stacey
can you find out who in your hr would be a good contact for a job opening previously held by lou casari
i have a friend at enron
my first boss
who will probably be leaving the company
but does not want to leave houston if she does not have to
she is very well qualified for a management position
her resume should speak for itself
let me know
stacey
here's what he said
i updated the physical power terminated spreadsheet with the following update
fyi
it is nstar
stacey
thanks for the reminder
just an fyi
it is not babysitting when it is your own kids
just kidding
wanting to share a pet peeve of my sister's
stacey
will be there
power december books are final
this does not mean that every termination has been accounted for in the final dec
0 calculation
we eventually hit a stopping point for terminations and will catch up the remainder of terminations in
after december
books
also
power books are set up as you have defined below
stacey
i think your resume looks good
brad called me today and they are definitely pulling together resumes
he says send a resume
call or both
stacey
i certainly do not anticipate that we will
i hope the estate people are designating someone for this
i am going to look into it
stacey
bob
what is the plan for this going forward
i am expecting that you will want to use my risk estate employees for this
i am correct
stacey
sounds good to me
fyi
the option true-up was a different issue
related to the way options were being input into the system
they had days which would fall out of the calc
not a last day of the month problem
stacey
just a reminder to make sure you get tim a list of books/regions that are currently designated to be traded
we need to change trader names etc
so make sure he gets us this information as soon as possible
stacey
this should answer your regional trading question
once again
there is nothing to physically stop them from trading in any region
but the management decision on regional trading for the east is as follows
i do not have this same information from the west
stacey
you will be extremely missed
good luck in all your future ventures
stacey
also
will you get tim to give direction on what traders will be allowed to trade what regions
thanks
stacey
we will be explaining the process to tom chapman for the east and samantha law for the west
stacey
as you can see from various e-mails
samantha will need to take responsibility for these twice weekly calcs
i talked to bob yesterday and he is aware that she is there and needing something to do
unofficially
he said that there should be no employee changes before the end of february
so sam should start coming to work and taking over any specific west estate requests
stacey
let me know what other detail you need
stacey
east delivery points for facilities
fyi
here is the 0th floor plan with my group attached to desk
stacey
yes
she is actually down here right now and i am showing it to her
send me your names and i'll print them in color for her
stacey
when you get around to setting up these fields for the west
please use the portfolio code
w
for west and then use the same methodology for book code that andrea did
i'll let you know the answer she gets from andrew re
us power east
because you should be using
us power west
stacey
here you go
it is totally liquidated
so no one will have to worry about it anymore
stacey
i am attaching this again because i am not certain that i saved it before i attached it the first time
stacey
yes
your gas books still have bob badeer and matt motley attached to them
you need to send in a change for these books
stacey
i just heard a rumor that the ercot power trading was going to sit in the gas
open
section
is this the case and does it change the seating for gas and power risk
thanks
stacey
fyi
we will be running a live simulation on thursday
i will give you more details when i know something
john
when you get a chance will you ask tim if he is aware of this
stacey
he was not offered a job in ubs
he was told last friday
by me
that he would remain in the estate
so his resignation is from the estate
stacey
fyi
the only other temporary information i can give you is thursday feb 0
is simulation date
as per previous e-mail
and monday
feb
0 is the current
go live
date
i'll try to keep you up to date with any changes
if there is anything we think we have not done or will not complete by next wednesday
feb
0 such as desk set ups
risktrac set up
including hierarchies
individual roll set ups
testing of min's new dpr automation
and anything else i may not be thinking of
please let me know as soon as possible
so we can get the right resources working on it
thanks
stacey

stacey
please try contacting him at the following numbers 0-0-0
home
0-0-0
cell
if you cannot contact him at these numbers
let me know
i have one other way of getting in touch with him
thanks
stacey
fyi
tim carter resigned effective today
stacey
to be totally consistent from the beginning
can you rename either your long term long names to not include spaces between
north
and
west
and
south
and
west
the short term books do not have spaces
stacey
just want to make sure that tom and sam will be preparing these documents
stacey
since we talked about a lot of different spreadsheets
can you give me some more guidance on what was included in the spreadsheet i talked about so i will send you the correct one
stacey
can you do mine

thanks

we will need no additional curves

thanks for the heads-up
stacey
does anyone know what the status of this change is for the west
stacey
this the latest on the move
stacey
are they working on it
who do we ask to set up the m:\common
this makes the most sense to me
stacey
roberto
can you please add to the m
drive a first tier directory of common
please let me know asap that this is complete
thanks
stacey white director
power risk management
thank you
make sure that all curves are downloaded by the end of simulation
0:0 cst
tomorrow
ideally
the 0/0/0 curves should be marked in the morning prior to simulation
we have been instructed to kick the calculation off as close to 0:0 cst as possible
this is to ensure that all downstream systems are able to run through the simulation
please forward to all applicable traders
thanks
stacey
in order to point to the ubs environment in enpower you need to change your portcalc host to the following

and bring his martket relationships and industry knowledge to the region focussing on project dolphin
do we want to say this
and other related mideast projects
eric and rick will report to the office of the chairman
jen fraser will come over and develop our market fundamentals group for all products in egm
much like ena natural gas and power fudamentals and intranet pages exist today
previously
jen was working in the mid market origination group
heather purcell will be joining this group developing the commercial interface for our intranet page
heather was with azurix
where she worked on the platform interface for the ebusiness initiatives
gary hickerson will be chairing our trader's roundtable
this group will be comprised of traders across enron's wholesale trading and risk management businesses
this forum will give traders the opportunity to discuss topics important to their individual markets
and discuss other markets in a macro sense
we will be also forming a cross commidity trading group
in this group
traders who have shown extremely strong and consistent profitability will have the opportunity to exploit cross commodity opportunities with a bias toward structural shifts in markets
this group will not be involved in customer activity
and will execute through our principal desks
gary will manage this new group
as well as continuing with his current f/x
rates
equity
and agriculture initiatives
anything else

preliminary
anything suggestions
jeff
are you also coordinating this with hunter and his available analysts who you think are good
michelle
if you run into problems with finding mgr or above interviewers
you should consider assoc
to interview analysts
i would also like to put kevin mcgowan
who went to mba but isn't on the list
as an interviewer for wharton
in phila if possible
i'll leave it to you for interviewers
i'd like to have a few people meet her
but am confident in jennifer's ability to evaluate analysts
jeff
we had submitted a list of prc reps already
who is currentlyreviewing
and are you using the same format as midyear
and how many people do you need
am i around
yes
i think we will both be there
do you have an idea of the number of attendees
particularly from global markets
jeff
i really don't want to press release this
is there a good reason we should
jeff
thanks for the update
please keep me updated today
jeff enron north america corp
why am i such a worrier
it was fine
thanks for the email
you do know that networks and our broadband businesses are different
i trust
if you have and questions
please let me know
and i'll be happy to help you get to the next group that most interests you
jeff
i want platts
etc
to apologize and retract their story
jeff
i haven't heard from either of you regarding the wharton analyst i mentioned
any interest in speaking with him
jeff
fine
coordinate with jennifer
yes
send me his resume,etc
did you have any doubt that the best logistics school is wharton
i think they call it transportation sciences
no really
i'll call up there this morn and get back with you
give me a c give me an n give me an r give me an s what do you have
a quarter
i know we've made good progress with respect to morning reports for egm
however
i continue to receive most reports after 0:0 a.m
which is too late into the trading day
please let me know if there are resources you need
so this aspect of egm can run as smoothly as ena gas
thanks
jeff
congrats on the network move
hi ben
no problem if you want to invoice me
i'm not ready for you to ship the goods to me
though
and probably won't be for a few weeks
as i move into the new digs
still thinking about the lamp and desk
best
jeff
i will run run run
what is cazaux---not cateau
do we have a folder for this
please see
is this true
more info
this is what i mentioned today
please print
what is this
our analysts were covered during the summer
weren't they
why not use whomever was used then
i thought you were going to change the a/a review process from mid year
since that was a disaster by most accounts
please schedule
please print
glad to help
can you get me the schedule as to which schools will be here on those dates
jeff
i'll get on it
with the texaco chevron merger
i'd like to get some insight into their organizations
particularly texaco
since they have two trading offices
one in whit plains
the other here
this set up for them has never worked well
and i'd like to talk to some of the better texaco traders
if there are any
jeff
nov 0 is great
and i'll try to help out dec 0
i'll be out of town nov 0
i'd also be happy to look now at the spring schedule
jeff
where are the wharton analysts
please print
yes
please put this on the calendar
please correct
i would like to help on the nov 0 analyst super saturday also
jeff
also put this on the calendar
thanks for the note
we are still looking at the value chain
but think we may have an idea
i think mike and i learned a lot from you guys when we were in london
nobody thinks our speculating in the grain markets does much for us
and is probably the wrong way to run that group
interestingly
the cargill ceo hasn't met with us yet
we have been trading softs
but very small
next time gary hickerson is in london
which should be soon
i'll have him give you guys the story
and ask for more of your input
regards jeff enron capital
trade resources corp
europe
schedule
put these super saturdays
and the schools that will be attending each on the calendar
here's a good one
what's the story here
i agree
we do not need anyone speaking at this
what's the story here

i know you're a technology guy

launch or view the application
jeff
aka capitan

no problem
doug is a good guy that i want to put under contract
what's the status with his immigration
could we be in a scenario that he has to work our of canada for a while
jeff
please look into
what do we need to do to be involved
kristin
can you call tom piazze and ask him what he thinks
proceed with your recommendation
also
we do not need to store any data once i see report
i'm so sorry
my cell phone died
and wouldn't work with the car for some reason
and was in the office by the time you called at 0:0
a little problem this morn here
thanks for the repeated attempts
fine
hi john
hope things are well
hickerson and i were talking yesterday about the convert bond desk
and he mentioned to me that it make sense for it to come to his group
i understand you have had prelim discussions about this
and wanted to catch up with you on this matter
i'll give you a ring by week's end if we want to proceed
my initial reaction is that it probably makes sense
jeff
mark
thor
and todd
thanks for the video conference this morning
mike and i are convinced weather can and will be an extremely profitable business
one issue i would like to address is energydesk.com
it seems like an interesting idea
but i'd like to find out more about it
and in relation to the work tom gros in doing in networks
i'd also like to understand more about the scalability of this model
and our relationship with kiodex
to that end
i do not want any proprietary data
product interface
and or other weather related matter and material to be part of energydesk.com
i will keep you updated as i learn more about these and other issues
regards jeff
john was not interested in mike after i spoke with him
for your pleasure
i have forwarded your resume to ted bland
he will be your contact person
thanks for your interest
sure
old house
i have no interest in him
tom piazze is the director of corporate relations at wharton

hi john--hope things are well
i'd like to invite you to one great night

if you are free
last year was my first year
and i will admit
it is somewhat of a spectacle
fun with the right group of people though
let me know if you are around
regards
jeff
print
yes
of course
are you seeing it
i know you guys have been working to secure supply for the h
galleon
i wonder if we should do some sort of tender for fob princing
allowing us whatever freedom we want with the ship
i'm not sure we should kill ourselves for a few pennies--i'd even let the ship stay empty and maybe force some of our will on the lng market if possible
in effect creating more of a spot market
maybe eol
any thoughts
jeff
please print
what do you think
lets at least try to participate somehow in sales and trading--but i will leave this up to you
thanks for all of your help

please coordinate with john nowlan
chris mahoney
and john chismar respectively
thanks very much
fyi
do you know what this is
first--ted your voicemail isn't working
i would like to get active in recruiting products traders
in a real attempt to high grade the group
can we
and how do we make a full court press with the headhunters out there
also
what do you guys think of putting a big ad in the chronicle
and the wsj
we could also look for originators and marketers
thanks
jeff
thank you
jeff
can you send this to all the staff member participants today
thanks
jeff
fyi
can you respond to this guy if need be
jeff
i don't know why i got a new p&l dpr at 0:0 today showing a change in p&l and a big var violation--most likely due to shroeder's getting shorter 0 contracts of crude and botchlett's getting shorter 0 heat contracts
don's var went up 0.0 million to 0.0 million
and dave's var went down only 0 thousand to 0.0 million
where is dave's var coming from
we need to be under our var tonight
dave and don--please take care of this
jeff
john
you guys have to be under var tonight before we leave for the evening
that means buying on access if necessary
why did i not get this until 0:0
please send this to the staff meeting distribution list
please take a minute and fill out the pulse
and encourage your organization to do so as well
thanks
mike and jeff
please print
thanks
this is helpful
i like all the products you've mentioned below
except for the mtbe one
is there a real market need for this
please proceed and get the others on eol asap
also please pass the trade idea you have to fred lagrasta's group
print
explain to me why don s
went golfing at 0 pm and you have this huge var violation in his book
i'm not sure that was the best idea he's ever had
fyi
i sent this monday 0pm if you hear any rumblings
jeff
it seems to me we are in the middle of no man's land with respect to the following
opec production speculation
mid east crisis and renewed tensions
us elections and what looks like a slowing economy
and no real weather anywhere in the world
i think it would be most prudent to play the markets from a very flat price position and try to day trade more aggressively
i have no intentions of outguessing mr
greenspan
the us
electorate
the opec ministers and their new important roles
the israeli and palestinian leaders
and somewhat importantly
mother nature
given that
and that we cannot afford to lose any more money
and that var seems to be a problem
let's be as flat as possible
i'm ok with spread risk
not front to backs
but commodity spreads
the morning meetings are not inspiring
and i don't have a real feel for everyone's passion with respect to the markets
as such
i'd like to ask john n
to run the morning meetings on mon
and wed
thanks
jeff
hi lea
what are you thinking about with jeff
koons
jeff
john nowlan is concerned that this var number isn't right
according to john
the group significantly reduced postions
on the whole
what about the forward forward vol
have we looked at that
my instinct is that something is not accurate with this var number today if you look at the resulting position as of friday evening's postion report
i'd like someone to be dedicated to the crude and products group full time who can help us with
what if
scenarios throughout the trading day
and who can work with pavel on the crude desk on the forward forward vol issue
also
i'd like to isolate first gas holdings since that is taking up approx 0 million in var each day
jeff
great
thanks
jeff
thanks for the clarification
get it listed if you like
jeff
do you have an answer for me regarding the simulation i asked you to run
i'll defer to you
how does this supplement your reports now
yes
there is a formalized process
after credit and legal
and in most cases rac
look at transactions
a vp or higher will sign the dash
for doug to sign the bahamas option contract
i need to know the premium
please contact brent price for our dash
deal approval sheet
jeff
is this why bp thought to squeeze the market
jeff
i'm looking forward to our drinks/dinner of woes
but not too long on woes
i don't like not being in a good mood
when is good for you week after next
jeff p.s
i really don't like that expression

jeff
i thought jere o was going for me
can we spend a few minutes talking about eol
i've only gotten response from jeff
fyi
i'd like to be number 0 behind ena
and a close 0nd that is
this should be a priority for us
i'd like to set up a meeting shortly to put together a strategy on how we can get there
more to follow
please put me on the continental flight to tokyo on sunday as well
thanks
thanks for the thought
we are trying to get more fund business already through per in the ny office
do you have any funds you'd like to sign up
in terms of products
i was thinking more depth in products we feel comfortable managing
maybe different spreads/cracks
whatever
you can control product launch
not the funds
can you give a some ideas of more/new products we trade or more/new products you'd like to get on eol
what more products will your customers want
jeff
i was planning on changing the morning meeting as you indicated
the problem with the p&l loss is one of time
we have given back 0 million this quarter
and very few traders took profits at any time
i expect traders to lose money at times
but we have other constraints
i'd be happy to have a call with you once we finish our budget process about how we will get to our numbers next year
of course spread trading is a good idea
but when i look at the portfolio in aggregate
the position story i'm being told doesn't make sense
we'll get there
i'll look for him on my calendar
looks good
coordinate with chris and john and let's move on this
jeff
please print
fyi
put this on the calendar
please get with michelle and let her know of exact details
thanks jeff
do you ever watch
frasier
of course
it's a favorite
the lesson i learned last night--and i wouldn't be surprised if i were your only friend who learns lessons from weekday comedies--is to be happy
if you're free
let's go out tomorrow eve and have our brief woes drinks
and not wait 0 weeks
then put it in the past
thanks for the update

jeff
have you been outside
i have to leave early today
hope your dinner was great
jeff
no doubt about drinks with you being more fun
my haircut is perfect
you'll be pleased to know
i did go out with my neighbors last night--i needed to because the guy who is buying my house on woodhead st
came over last night and backed out of his contract
boy was i annoyed
and still am
but the good news is he loses his earnest money to me
so i'm going to take out a bunch of friends to dinner when i get back
want to go
i'm thinking tony's or something else fun/festive
to be determined
but fun
i'm out next week
but will be in touch with steve horn when i return
jeff
thanks
sorry i missed you earlier
thanks
these are great updates
jeff
no thoughts on skilling's speech
he just needs to emphasize we are a great productive entrepreneurial company
any we're are largest energy trading and risk management house in the world
it would be ok if he mentioned that i am a wharton
0 undergrad and run a large part of our trading group
students like to see where successful wharton alum are in the world
by the way
i'm the lead for wharton grad and wharton/penn undergrad
this speech he is giving is a great opportunity for us to recruit
on another note
i have an idea for you

i'm going to the japan office opening
then to sydney and will be in the office nov

how did it reduce var if we added to the underlying positions
yes
i think it would be a great experience
and i'd encourage you to continue to meet as many people as possible in the organization
jeff
i still don't understand
but we are net short crude
and crude
companywide got longer 0 contracts yesterday
this is counter to what you aresaying below
jeff
i'd like access for me
i think the crude and products guys are looking at it
so i don't understand that we haven't signed a participant agreement
thanks
fyi
what is the purpose of this email
given year end issues
we really need to be trading close to the vest now
i was a little surprised how big the prompt few months position in crude was two days ago
and we need to scale them back
i need the component var for those four structural trades we have today
thanks
jeff

i have 0 cases of kistler in my office--should we crack a few
jeff
fyi
please check into this
i spoke with tom piazze at wharton again this morning
about a reduction in the financial commit
from us
he was not receptive
and in the past
i've suggested energy outsourcing for the university
and more recently discussing their broadband needs
others here have thought about this at enron
like the california university system
jeremy blachman and i are going to run with this in a more direct approach and see what happends
tom p
was open to all of this
of course
fyi
thanks
jeff
i asked him
and john nowlan
to call you about this project that looks pretty cool
i thought you could lend a hand
john montcrief also does wet shipping for the crude and products group in london and works for nowlan as well
it looks pretty interesting
let me know what you think

great
sorry you weren't there
i'm on my way out for a lunch
i'll call you later
i'm excited about the exec committee
but it is a little big
so i told skilling we should rename it the exec villiage
looks like there is plenty of work to do
and i continue to believe shipping
etc
has great possibility for enron
i'd like to get a group of people to talk about plans going forward
and will fill you in shortly on time
where
etc
one point is that it is our policy not to speak to the press without it being cleared through public relations first
your comments were interesting
but i was concerned about perception
please coordinate public statements
interviews
and the like through the proper channels going forward
thanks
jeff

hi
hope you are doing great
i was wondering if you've met russell dyke
who is in lagrasta's group
and who i told could get into the lng before you came over
he has great international experience
and lng experience
he might be a great match with the jose team
since i'm uncomfortable with their understanding of mtm
and their overall appreciation of the enron way of doing business
today
russel
assoc/mgr at year end
closed a deal with csfb worth 0 million to us
overall a solid guy
let me know what you think
merritt and russell know each other well
and have worked on projects together
also
i mentioned to merritt that i was excited about her opportunity to trade dutch power
but was very interested in staying in touch with her
possibly to trade freight
etc
jeff
thanks
thought you'd like this
jeff
you
as well
jeff
ok
so i didn't really think you'd be at the office at 0:0 pm when i left you a message last night
buy my day turned into a freak show
later jeff
everything was ok
just busy
good book
i just started
when the sons of heaven meet the daughters of earth
have you heard of it
i'd absolutely love to go the the anne frank thing
but i can't get back from the management conference
i'm on a panel
with jeremy
early friday a.m
please select your reviewers for year end prc
if you have any questions call shanna
thanks
jeff
great news
please stay in touch so i can help with your next rotation
best regards jeff
super saturday is super early---0:0 sat
morn
and i'm at my desk
sounds like all your events will be fun
i'm counting on your helping me with my parties
too
sounds like this week is busy
but i'm around next weekend
we'll figure it out this week
no message yesterday
so i rescheduled it for late afternoon today
can wait
you got it
jeff
please expect a phone call from andrew makk
currently in the mid east group
who is interested in exploring opportunities in each of your areas
he is a very qualified individual who would be a tremendous resource in any of your groups
thanks

as i was packing some books this weekend
i stumbled across an old copy of the story of o
and almost fell over
i knew i had heard of that book--i must have read it some time ago--i think it was orig published in 0 or 0
now i remember how much i didn't like it
hope you've recovered from all your parties
how was the book dinner
did i mention i had a spur of the moment party last night
jeff
i'd like to know how we purchased the katz
was that outside our budget
and in ken's dining room budget
mike and i will get together and address the points you bring up below
looking forward to our meeting
as we move forward with our global lng strategy
it is obvious that the best way to capture value for enron is to bring the same merchant activity to this business unit
this merchant philosophy allows aggressive book and position management from a worldwide perspective
our ability to gather data and to show only one enron face in the market is crucial to our success
as important is one pricing desk
many of you know
eric groves in houston is running our pricing desk
larry lawyer is working on all finance type business for us
and jen fraser is running our fundamentals group
to bring full merchant capabilities to our worldwide lng business
mike and i wanted to clearly outline a point that seems to need attention
all lng contacts
negotiations
and contracts
physical
financial
buys
sales
etc
with external counterparties must and will be managed through our commercial lng group headed by eric gonzales
and rick bergsieker
it is crucial to manage market perspective
appearance
and informantion
we all know how important each project
metgas
and other initiatives in india
could be
but a coordinated front will help us better grow all of our businesses
regards jeff
absolutely i will call him
let's talk about a coordinated strategy with him
come up today when you get a minute
jeff
details to work out with hr
of course you will have significant input and presence
jeff
speak with nowlan

schedule some time

wow
jeff
great
i'll have jennifer set up a phone meeting
without knowing what subcommittees you are going to set up for the exec
committee members
i'll take the analyst/associate program
we've been incredibly successful with wharton/penn
and i'd like to replicate our approach company wide
i'm convinced with my help
we can do a world class job
i'd be happy to give my thoughts on off cycle hiring
and other ways to improve the entire process
internal and external
around enron
thanks

please take car of
please get on calendar
great
thanks
so what do you think of crude for tomorrow
jeff
fyi

hi john things are heating up for year end keeping us all pretty busy
as we go forward in many of our businesses
it's clear several need fine tuning
one of which is weather worldwide
mark tawney and i have spent quite a bit of time during the last several weeks working on a plan for next year and forward
we've come to the conclusion that it will be most effective to add a london operation that will allow for quick and beneficial marketer interaction
immediate scalability
and more portfolio diversification
i would structure the business around the continent with someone managing that portion of the operation
and continue to have thor manage scandinavia
mark and i will get together to structure the london based group and keep you advised
mark has some great ideas
and i'd like to talk to you about this rather than go on in an email
i'll give you a ring first thing in the morning
best
jeff
of course i want to get together next
this
weekend
in fact
the house should be almost done
and i'd love to show it to you
too
i'm pretty open also
but am doing super saturday again
and am not sure what my deal is friday evening
if anything
and will know by tomorrow
last night on a&e was a special about palm beach
and the good life
charity balls
social scene
etc
so i had a palm beach party--bought caviar
fruit tarts
champagne and sat around watching the show
i made everyone wear lacoste shirts
loafters
no socks
and not put down their glass full of champagne
as much as possible
fun
casual
and last minute
for not being in your biz
i liked the idea and we had fun
went to my first exec committee meeting
pretty interesting
but can't wait to hear about your parties for vicki and dan
funny
how's your day going
put me down for freak show
george
i just saw the updated 0q earnings outlook
and saw jupiter
and british energy off the sheet
is jupiter off because of the massey problems you mentioned today
what about british energy
jeff
the reason for the memo before was because the india guys still don't understand
hopefully this clears up their ideas about a separate marketing and trading shop in india
have you had time to think about russell dyke
jeff
any updates on the gdansk refinery
or should i assume that the deal is dead
jeff
thanks for the update
thor
i'm getting stuck in a meeting at that time and will follow up
thanks
jeff
please set up a phone call
thanks
jeff

saturday is looking better right now

the assoc/analyst dept is trying to kill me

jeff
i'm not sure it is a good idea to go
can we talk about this monday am
jeff
tried
but no can do
call me
though
good afternoon ida
better name for you than me
ec was uneventful
given that i wore no crazy hat
at the right time though
i know the party will be great--try not to stress too much
besides your plans sounded great and i'm sure everyone will have a great time
i'm leaving in a little while to go to the closing
and collect some cash
and am out the rest of the afternoon--cruising in the ida-mobile
in case you were wondering
i used almost a half mile of bubble wrap yesterday moving my art to the new house and will recycle it if there are some cool kid things to do with it
ideas
later
thanks for the update
i think it shows how starved for new products these exchanges are
i'm not a fan of teaming up with these kinds of entities
it's unclear what they bring
and how does this help us
what do you think

and slept til 0
late all day
and just had a pretty crappy meeting with one of my direct reports and jeff skilling
i can't describe the weight of the world feeling i have
and i'm not good at not being in control
i wish i had the answers
how are you
i had so much fun last night
when can we do it again
thanks for the email
i'm not in love with this deal
and nowlan is not inclined to do it

please print
please call me jeff
when i'm old
grey
and heavier
then you call use a more formal salutation
great to meet you too
and i'll be in touch shortly
jeff
boy did i unpack last night
i couldn't go to sleep so i went a little crazy
tuesday is good
we could have a frasier marathon
which one of us is cooking at my house
would it be crazy if i asked you to be my guest at the wholesale christmas party next sat
nothing like email to ask that sort of question
and i certainly don't mean to be impersonal about it
i have to head home to work out for a few hours
thanks for the reminder
yes i'd like to be included in your jan 0
0 contribution
i will attend to this with the necessary paperwork in mid regards
jeff
talk to scott tholan

i don't dislike the concept
but he deals with a lot of confidential info
jeff
i'm with dave
let's kill it
jeff
when she was hired
there was no 0rd year analyst program
she is going to be placed in the trading non-rotational program

in addition
she has made well over 0million dollars trading a book on the gas floor

i can't tell you how overwhelmed i've felt recently
and i think our conversation while i was awol
in ny for the day last weekend
really got to me
i'll tell you this weekend about my meeting with my the shrink the other day
the part where i'm not good at compartmentalizing
i think that threw me for a loop too
oh
your message got to me this morn
please don't ever think you are bothering me
i guess i'm a little less mature about my emotions than i thought
i know this is all personal
but email seems to be a little easier for me to communicate this to you right now
i'm not sure that my home number is on yet
so the cell phone is where i'll be
thanks for checking up on me
i have mckinsey sending over another glass market presentation

jeff

hugs to emma
gary
that was a great presentation
thanks for the update
thanks
will do
did you need something the other day
jeff
thanks for the email
actually
you are completely wrong about my view of joe
he has tremedous integrity
and is a very strong team builder
and has added much value to our organization
i was however a little surprised by your move to go from a trading position to an analysis position
i would have been thrilled to have you help me design a position for you in that kind of capacity here
or in london
or elsewhere if you liked
in addition
i could have talked to you about a junior trading spot in crude and products
which i will remind you about frequently
i'm sure your decision will prove valuable to joe
and hopefully to you as well
mike and i would like to see you back on the a-team though--we both respect your business sense
as far as the guilt thing goes
i can't help you
i'm jewish and our people have suffered much longer than everyone else combined
jeff
i will be in phila
please grab materials for me
sorry it's been so hard
nothing meant by it
to where are you moving
yes
no issues
and this will benefit enron company wide
it will come out of either kristie patrick's
in mark palmer's office
or my budget
jeff
i would like to discontinue service entirely
thanks
please print
did you mean to send this to rebecca mark
or rebecca macdonald
thanks for your help
print
put on calendar
print
what do you mean funds are being told
enron north america corp
when someone starts an email as you did
i think i have an idea of what you are going to say
is this on the calendar
if i change my name to mr crankman
for today only
i'll think of a name for you
too
how about ali
the impaler
saler
or is that too dramatic
so the impaler might not have been too dramatic
have fun tonight

his background lends itself to our businesses
and he is looking to add some commercial experience to his c.v
thanks for taking the time to meet with joe

i was just thinking about you this past weekend

jeff
please print following on letterhead
larry kellner chief financial officer
put rest here
dear larry
thanks for the opportunity to discuss your risk management needs yesterday
continental has been very successful in hedging fuel
and i think we can add even more value as we explore your basis risks
i've asked mark tawney
director of weather risk management
to come up with some ideas possibly linking weather to fuel
and explore our insurance and tax opportunities
his organization is the best in the industry
and is doing cutting edge research
we didn't have the chance to talk about any v@r analysis needs you have
but i'd be happy to get our research team involved as we grow our corporate relationship
if there is anything else i can do
please call
it's great to have a the best airline in the country be the local carrier
again thanks for your time
regards
steel is not part of global markets
and if you could take it off this report
i'd appreciate it
also
please add a section that shows new products as we add them to the portfolio
thanks
jeff enron north america corp
emergency calls are great

so do you want to try to do something this weekend--fun
i have a party to go to sat eve for a little while

how was the play
haven't be to zula
i saw you called on the cell this a.m
sorry i missed you
i was in the shower
i have had a shitty week--i suspect my silence
not only to you
but others
after our phone call is a result of the week
i'm seeing glen at 0:0
talk to you
macy gray was just on cnn singing--she is great
since only i know i'm not trying to offend you
that's all i can say
i'm not sure i'm worthy of your being concerned either
i don't deserve it--i'd guess
you know
after we talked the other day
i felt better for a while
i don't know what to say
and i'm sure i'm embarrassed by this whole thing--most particularly how i've handled our relationship
i really want to see you
but i need some time to myself i guess
i do know glen doesn't have all the answers
but i find him to be impartial and helpful--really the only one these days
my mother suggested a trip home this weekend
and i may go
i wish this were easy
i think part of my issue is i've always felt our friendship is one i wanted to keep always
and i feel i tend to jeopardize friendships
i'm still here--they're trying to kill me
hi hillary
hope you are well
unfortunately
i won't be able to make it tomorrow
i just couldn't work out the schedule
but it was extremely thoughtful of you to invite me
i hope you have a great time
i'll send something to ben in the gallery tomorrow

jeff
please take me off the distribution for this report
it is hard to read
and not terribly useful to me
do we need this report at all
jeff
candidly
mark wanted to leave it open as to whom it would report
he wantto have control in it's growth and staffing
although it would be coordinatwith thor
mark
and i
talked to thor about this a while ago
and will begin weekly video calls in the new year about strategy
updates
new products
and growing this business continentally
mark was still concernabout the members of the oslo weather group that thor managed poorly--in mark's mind
i'm sure we will get to a point that works best organizationally with thor having a role
however
when you look at the p&of the business
is doesn't illustrate his support of the business
which ware addressing
hope this helps
and you are relaxing a little
jeff

you wouldn't believe
i missed my flight to jackson
i was pissed

i'm out of here
have a nice afternoon
do you guys get this
let's get together on this and have a conference call
thanks
i have the book for you
what is your location
are you crate training the pup
i did and it is a great idea
i have an extra crate if you need
they are pretty expensive so if you want you can have this one
send to lavorato for gas
should i send the book to your location
sure--it's on its way
i've known her for some time
and interviewed her on the gas floor
and we didn't really have a fit
i'm not sure what i'd do with her
for the roundtable
gas
john arnold
phillip allen

maybe adam gross equities
gary hickerson
michael bradley other
vince kaminski
jen fraser have i left anyone off
what do you think
great
sorry
you know how i like one word answers
when are you back
there is a lot of info of the gas floor--ie handouts
that i'm not getting
your work is invaluable
and it is getting a lot of notice internally
good job
what does he want to do
and what was his year end rating
enron north america corp
please print
mike and i have already seen his resume
i know him from the gas market
and am going to take a pass on david
thanks
jeff
please address
what is the opportunity to look at elba island space in conjunction with the dhabol supply contract
that is
could we go to our lng suppliers for india
and regotiate that contract and provide space for diverted cargoes if necessary
jim hughes is spending his time figuring out what to do with dhabol and any suggestions we have may be helpful
thanks
if he is interested in gas trading
send his info to lavorato enron north america corp
i'm around
let's send our a memo to deal makers
book admins
and business heads to remind everyone what the process should be regarding desk notification of big transactions/cash flows
why don't you take a stab at writing a memo
send it back to me
and i'll review
let's try to get it out this week
thanks
what's up with the ads for the ny times
wsj
and ft
crude and product traders
jeff
the us/uk arbitrage book
the finland arbitrage book
and the products arbitrage book in singapore have been shut down
and no positions are authorized to go into those books going forward
in addition
all positions in those books must be pulled out as of today
and i want them removed from the p&l reports i get
also
we need to set up a separate book for the 0 hour
0 cent wide eol crude market
thanks
jeff
starting tomorrow
jan 0
the london distillates book run by ross koller will have a max var position of $0 million
chris
please take care of this with ross
thanks jeff
niamh clarke
chris mahoney
and per sekse are in enron global markets
you have them in the wrong business units
thanks for correcting
jeff
unfortunately i cannot be there
what about grey whalley
even though he is stanford
i understand
however
each book you assign to a trader will have a line so you and i can follow the performance of each book/trader
ok if you want to take over arb books
but they
positions and p&l will be your responsibility and will be judged by performance--like any other book/trader
must be managed without the team approach of books prior
the 0 million var applies to the line next to ross's name on the p&l sheets
i don't know how many people trade that book
but i assume it is only ross
if ross get's bulled up at every sign of snow in london
all the more reason to get a weather guy hired asap
small positions
and taking profit frequently is the key to turning this boat around
later
jeff
soon
soon
soon
last minute changes to the house
i'll probably have a big open house within a couple of months

thanks
as we begin our summer recruitment process
it is crucial that we continue to be aggressive in hiring all the best candidates
as you know
enron has committed over $0million during the next four years to university of pennsylvania
and wharton
i want to make sure we don't limit ourselves in getting the enron message out at penn and wharton by restriciting the number of summer employees
i do not want to limit the number of people we hire for the summer
in fact
i'd like to be as aggressive as possible
i am operating under the notion that if we find 0 good people for which we have positions
we will offer all of them summer jobs
i will not accept the notion of only 0 summer associate
and 0 or 0 summer ananlysts
in addition
i'm concerned that the idea of giving associates $0 gift certificates is viewed as good one
i'm not sure that is a good use of enron's dollars
and would like to know what other events we are planning for the sell weekends
jeff
sure
is there anything specfic you'd like me to address
what about a slide presentation--which i generally don't love
but we have some good ones around
thanks for all your help with sempra
hard work
but certainly worth it
on another note
mike and i have discussed this $0 million issue with american coal
and the interest rate hedge in the mpr
bottom line
we are not taking this hit
it seems it was a problem with treasury
so send it to them
thanks
jeff
have a great evening--i'm out of here
put on calendar
please take care of this
yes me and mike
thanks
i believe greg w
is coming to talk to you today about this new business
further to this
i'd like to ask again how i can get access to var
i believe lavorato and sherriff have $0 million they each keep upstairs and allocate to their businesses as needed temporarily
is this a board question
or do you have the authority to allocate this var to me
on another note
i've been helping bill bradford with pge exposure issues
if you too need my help
let me know
thanks for your help
jeff
fine
thanks
do you have copies of les annees 0 or 0
if you take out the 0/0 book

best regards
jeff
did you call earlier today
how was your weekend
oh my god--so much desire to run
but i have a dinner tonight--my last since it's time to get into shape
maybe i'll wire my jaws shut
if my dinner is with a 0 yr old
i'm going to take the fork and poke holes in myself
that was my dream
i'll tell you about it tomorrow
put on calendar
offer away
thanks
please print
so i had dinner with a college student
could you break up with mark and date me
that would be very helpful
i really don't want to hear about someone's major for god sakes
should i put myself on ebay
was that last email the rudest thing i've ever said
so sorry
oh
i forgot to point out one more thing
aren't you a dragon and mark a dog
should i call the ghostbusters
i'm ready to go
however
will this new system give a slower connect to eol
etc
hmmm
hadn't crossed my mind
my dinner tonight just got cancelled
how about a walk/run/abroller marathon tonight
drinks after
i'm an 0 of clubs
and a gemini
checking on the chinese animal sign
i do not manage an eol stack
you are a june birthday right
i'm may
and i don't think i'm a dragon--it's done by birth year
no relation to zodiac
still checking
ok
i'm laughing
thanks
but now you get it
i saw him this morn
and asked if he called you
call him tomorrow or thurs
and i'll follow up
let's make sure she gets an offer
thanks
jeff
howdy
how long has it been
when are we going out
how's everything up there
what a fun weekend
mine was a little boring
did you dance at the club before or after you ate all those burgers
how's the pooch
did you see the second austin powers movie
i just had lunch and i feel like fat bastard
thanks for the update on the sell weekend
it certainly sounds like there were positives and negatives
going forward
i would like the commercial team under my direction to plan all future sell weekends
and similar recruiting functions
i did not get skilling to agree to a $0,0,0 contribution to wharton/penn for us to not have a perfectly seamless weekend
we all agree to the strategic importance of univ of penn
and we are not going to blow it
or appear to blow it
i would like the recruiting function and commercial function to coordinate all logistics
etc
however
given this was one of the worst sell weekends i have seen enron put together
we all need to get together and come up with specific plans on who will be accountable for specific parts of the weekend
if anyone was hanging out in their hotel rooms
we were not doing our jobs
and i will take all responsibility going forward
i appreciate everyone's support and cooperation
jeff
in town

both stuart staley,and dan reck are being moved to $0k base each

hi chris
give me a ring tomorrow
tuesday
morn when you get a second
i'd like to go over a couple of things and need your input
thanks
jeff
i thought he was in the running for the president position
after pat died
he phoned me today--did he indicate to you in what he is interested
jeff
if i had another superbowl party that showed movies instead

would you come
excellent
i'm working with the crude boys here to do the same thing with crude for you boys
jeff
i'll set him up on an interview schedule
thanks
jeff
hey
i have an idea
two things
first
my friend at nickelodeon wants to know more about your kids books
he also sees a need for a spanish language group of kids books
second
i
what is this
just to put me over the edge
i got a phone call last week from one of the gas trading h.r
people with respect to robin menear
she was listed as commercial support
still
and when i hired her last year
it was as a commercial manager
your boy brad mcsherry didn't fix her class
even though this was a problem at mid year as well
of course he told me it had been taken care of
but hunter shively showed up in my office last week to go over her history
and what my intent was when i hired her
he too was involved in the hiring decision
shall i do brad's termination
or will you
this was the guy that hired fred d'ambrosia back to enron after he was terminated for cause
a.g
is an ok guy but i'm not in love
i would however put him through the interview process
i'll follow up
sorry for the confusion
my asst
printed it out and didn't print the orig email
can you resend it
thanks
come on
you should come to the tuesday traders
meeting
they've been really good
in 0 0-0 each tuesday
i'll bring over a copy of the current book we are reading as enticement
it's not a corvette
but it's a good book
sure
wed is better
please print
please adjust accordingly

hi thor
sorry you won't make our offsite
but a little vacation every so often is never a bad thing
i do have a question about bjarne's promotion to director
when i look at the p&l for oslo weather trading
you showed a loss of about $0 million
and i don't think that deserves this promotion
what else does he do
i'm also concerned that neither mark
nor i
had any notice of this
his promotion has caused some difficulty over here and i'd like to get this cleared up
jeff
here is the note i sent to thor
i'll wait for his response
jeff
thanks for the invite
i'd love to go with you guys
jeff
his response
jeff
put this on the calendar
jeff
hey there
freak show central here
this week is bad
unfortunately
florida was awsome
and it put me in the mood to get back on the diet
and exercise
did you buy that watch
you should leave the office now and get it if you didn't
and on your way back
you should stop for a tennis lesson
please print text
and resume
i'll set up an interview schedule for him

hi dave
as a follow up to out conversation
i found out robert rauschenburg will be here april 0 or 0 and the weekend
april 0-0
see how that looks on the calendar for y'all yankees to visit down here in rodeoland
i did go to the rodeo last night--hosted a big party--and wore my boots
and a cowboy hat my group gave me--pictures to follow
can you believe i went to the rodeo
don't be surprised if i ask you guys to take off that friday
too
so that we can be a little flexible with bob

this is only one of the ads

an update for both mike and i would be great
thanks
jeff
as mike and i look across all of our business units
we continue to look for optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to achieve it's targets for 0 and beyond
in our weather business
there appears to be a lack of seamlessness
reporting relationships
p&l
and vision for this business are not best aligned as this business exists today
mike and i would like to address this as follows
we need 0% full time dedication from each and any employee that is dedicated to the weather business
all identified employees in the weather business will now become full time employees of egm and report to mark tawney
accordingly mark and i will be looking at
with each of you
the employees that may be affected by this transition and the need to hire additional employees
it is important that both business units work together to determine which individuals will be in weather
or will be in eel
once done
mark will begin adding to the weather team in each of your regions
it is obvious that the organizations and product lines can lever each other and the synergy's will provide powerful results in our regional gas and power businesses in particular
if you look at coal
lng
equities
etc
we have employees based in each of your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within egm
this restructure will similarly align weather
please give me a call and we will discuss the issues surrounding this new structure
i'm still getting all the reports too late
i'd like a night clerk to put together the reports so that i have them by 0:0 am
thanks
jeff
hi
hope things are well
i'd like to talk about lng trading vessels
merchant
have you been talking with pierre about all of this activity
george mclellan is concerned about the exmar contract
and wants pierre more involved with the business
what do you think of this idea
what are some of your thoughts regarding this business
jeff
thanks for the update
i'll be here all day today and tomorrow
jeff
i'm writing from houston
tx
and i cannot find anyone here who shows your furniture
can you direct me to some one in this part of the country
i have large outdoor spaces that i'd like to furnish with brown jordan
thanks for your help
jeff
i've asked craig breslau on the gas floor--a senior marketer
vp
who is well versed in this to give the lunch
pete de leeuw was happy a senior enron person could get there on short notice
regards jeff
yes
eric can get on the trader track
put some numbers together for these guys
and get back to me
jeff
please get on distribution and put on web site
thanks
jeff
i did receive an envelope from you last evening
no problem to postpone our meeting
however
when should i pick up the car
best
jeff
tomorrow afternoon would be best
thanks
jeff
i'd love to fly dan down
at our expense
to have him meet some appropriate people
let him know he should call me to figure out the best time to get him down here
have to go now though
hugs jeff
i'm not sure our plan is to collapse the lng shipping group into coal
i presume you mean under pierre
however
we have to look at our internal and external options
if you look at the structure of the exmar vessell it is certainly far from ideal for enron
in fact it appears to be quite one-sided
first we must look at what we want this group to be
and examine what skills each of the internal players can bring to the table
including pierre and wayne
second estabish internal procedure
and trading capabilities
third
execute
i would agree that lng shipping is a unique animal
but before we hire anyone externally
i'd like to get everyone together to discuss the most appropriate way forward
thanks
jeff
great to hear from you
office number 0 0 0
home 0 0 0
give a ring when you can
and i'll get you set up for the summer
jeff
your thoughts are dead on
russel would be a great guy to cover those guys for egm for crude and products
please mention to caroline we are not trying to crowd her out
just get more depth on funds coverage
also
when we talk about other grm products
it will help to have more fund coverage
we can also address her issue later--i agree with you on that
proceed
but i'm not sure about the jv with ena issue
let's not go down that road
officially
by the way
rough is spelled roof
later

you make some good points
i'm still working with hr to address your bonus

i'll be happy to meet with you regarding rotations when you are ready
jeff
hi guys
i wanted to let you know that i am extremely concerned about the associate/analyst program
so much so that i feel all the work i have done
and all the time i have spent on the program has had little impact outside wharton/penn recruiting
in fact we won't get more than 0 associate from wharton this year for a variety of internal and external reasons
this program has brought incredible talent into the organization
but we have lost a lot of momentum over the last two years
in as much as i would like to continue to support the program
i can't in its current form
and don't have time to fix what i thought we had been addressing
the entire program is disfunctional
and the commercial teams are not lending support to the program
i'd be very happy to spend a few minutes of your time
rather than blather on in an email
to give you both my overview of the program
and suggest changes and improvements
you know you have my support
but the current state of affairs down there has gotten me to my rope's end with the program
any pumping you can do would be appreciated
thanks
jeff
is this something you or doug f
or someone should attend
jeff
thanks for the note
as i did not know there was a meeting tonight

for a long time john and mike have been letting counterparties who accidentally click on the gas daily stack change the deals to nymex swaps
the counterparty would let john/mike know and then they would tell us
in addition
at the end of the month
we would get calls from settlements and credit telling us
per the counterparty
that there were more deals that needed to be changed from gd to nymex than we had changed
john would let them change those deals too
on friday we changed some jan
`0deals with utilicorp that had been done in late november to nymex swaps
because of the timing there was a p/l impact of
$0.0mm
when john saw this today he asked me what it was
i explained
and he stated that what they click on is what they get
i relayed this to settlements and credit and that is why kim is calling you b/c reliant and utilicorp are
upset
they claim that they have john and mike on tape letting them out of the gd deals and into nymex swaps
we do not change the actual deals booked by eol
we book two new legs that create a nymex swap and flip out the gd deal
errol
yes this is correct
this is the reason sherry and amy have to flip out deals everyday
eol is only booking them to one leg
thanks
errol
the deals below were changed tonight per john arnold
thanks
errol mclaughlin

the team provides us with great service currently
the only area of improvement i can think of regards new-hires
i need to give you and your team a better heads-up when i have new someone coming on
if we could come up with a checklist of everything they need
computers
phones
basic supllies
etc
and have them already at there desk when they start
that would help
i know that the last few people that have come on were last minute additions
so there is not much we could have done
hopefully
we won't have as many space issues in the future

i am sending you this e-mail because i received your voice message well after you left it today
i reviewed the text files that are sent out by the book administrators on my desks and none of them contain any deals booked to the counterparty el paso gas marketing
all of the deals from people on my desk are booked to the valid el paso counterparty per our conversations
i will be out of the office tomorrow
but i will be checking my voicemail frequently and communicating with my group
if the same problem arises tomorrow
please call me at 0-0-0 so that we can discuss
because there has to be some other explanation for the erroneous counterparty showing up on your report
thank you

we can grab a conference after we get back
or tommorow
and talk if you'd like
unfortunately
we have been put on a hiring freeze b/c of everything that is going on
we brought on three new people on monday
but they were interviewed and hired about 0 month ago
we've lost three people since the merger announcement
but we cant fill their spots w
new people
your resume looks good
you're correct
these jobs are demanding on your personal time
this is especially true when you first start
this is something you would have to talk over w
the manager that you interviewed with to see how demanding the book is that they wanted to put you on
we can talk more later

so now you see
karen just has issues
so how are you doing
i was on vacation on friday and didn't get a chance to respond until today
we were in chicago this weekend for my husband's family reunion
the weather was great compared to texas
texas is so hot
how's christian doing
my boys are doing pretty good
just growing so fast
tell me more about karen whenever you get a chance
see ya
nothing has happened
it seems like he's trying to stick close to home
i came in on monday night and went upstairs
because i frankly
did not want to talk and did not want to get mad in front of jordan
i was furious and i still am furious
last night we had choir rehearsal
so he was in bed when i came back
i really don't want to talk to him right now
i'll keep you posted
because i will be doing it hopefully
tonight
see you later
hi calvin i spoke with rickey
boy
is he long-winded
gave him the name of our credit guy
russell diamond
thank for your help
hi
how's it going
you realize we missed our playday for the kids this week
we need to make sure we get on schedule for next week
sometimes the tuesday night choir rehearsal takes so much out of me and the boys
that sometimes we spend wednesday recuperating
i.e
getting the boys and myself to bed early
it's always so much better when todd is not working and he can keep them
girl
what did you think of that jon p
kee song that joe and that girl were singing on tuesday
the choir really wasn't into that one
we just could not muster up a good sound
are you going to the groundbreaking ceremony
if so
let's see if some of us want to have lunch together before we head to the tent
i'm 0% sure that i will be attending
talk to you later
i spoke with carol on friday and supposdly their wedding coordinator found a room at embassy suites for $0 per night
it's supposed to be at i-0 and greenway
wherever that is
i'll belive that when i see it
i probably will not bring the kids
it just seems like such a hassle
i can understand mom not wanting to miss work
so it seems like it will be a girls weekend
i have not checked on flight arrangements yet
but i'll let you know
i still want to leave on thursdat night
so we have time for site seeing
how much was the ticket
i think we should all stay in the same room
especially if we get a suite at embassset suites
with a pull-out bed
we checked it out and i can get there are 0:0 p.m
on america west on thursday
the rate is $0.0
a little pricey
did i tell you that shawna wants us to come to the rehearsal dinner
i'm trying to figure out when we're going to site see
give me another couple of days
we're still checking
did i tell you that carol told me she was waiting on a $0.0 million loan to come through so she could pay for shawna's wedding
as well as take care of her business
so you know we may get down there and there may not be a big wedding
girl
you know how that goes
now who in the hell is going to lend her that kind of money
you know carol and shawna are doing some type of financing of real estate
or something like that
ralph west came to our groundbreaking ceremony we had on sunday and delivered a sermonette
he is awesome
i told him i enjoyed his sermon
and he mentioned that he was leaving for omaha the next day
do you have acrobat on your computer
i'll try to send you picture to see if it comes out
talk with you later
hi dexter
here you are
so nice to hear from you
everything here is hot

0 degrees today
nothing new going on here
the boys are doing great
just getting really big
i'm taking kendall to the dr
today to see if he has an ear infection
he was up most of the night last night
rats
jordan is so cool
he taking gynmastics again and loving it
kendall is my little roughneck
he reminds me of myself
he's hysterical
i am so glad i have them
the wedding in phoenix should be alot of fun
i think it's just going to be mom
me and nelle i think
i'm leaving the kids with todd
todd has a new job where he works 0 hour shifts
in fact
he's working with ken cowan
but anyway it could be from 0 am to 0 pm or 0 pm to 0am
it sucks when he's working nights
but he really likes it
anyway
we're supposed to be leaving early today and believe me i am ready to roll
anyway take care
talk with you soon
i have booked my flights
i leave on thursday
november 0nd at 0:0 p.m

hi rev
jackson how's it going
i'm sure i'll be seeing you tonight at choir rehearsal
but i was curious if anything new happened on the choir director front
let me know if you get this e-mail in time to respond
i'll be leaving at 0:0 directly
see you tonight
good afternoon rev
jackson
so nice to hear from you
i'm glad we
ve got this e-mail business figured out
hope your day is going well
sometime
please tell me what
a day in the life of rev
jackson
is like at swcbc
do you see alot of people all day long
during the day
so often
it's hard to picture the church as being active all day long
it just seems like people attend meetings and services about twice a week in the evenings
funny
how we get perceptions in our heads
my day is going pretty good so far
i'm back to making money in my
book
here at work and it sure feels good
i've always remembered what you told me during my
crisis period
and always keep those things in mind
the one that i like the best is
just keep your mind stayed on him
he'll keep you in perfect peace
i take that with me everywhere i go
well
anyway
thanks for the words of encouragement
appreciate it
hi jewel
sorry
i was not available to visit with you when you called the other day
but things have been extremely busy around here
and plus
there is very little room for privacy
in answer to your question
there are no special requirements
back in the day
they would have been looking for actual pipeline scheduling experience
but anymore
the liquidity for gas schedulers is so low
that they will consider most people
with an analytical or coordinative type background
i think it's one of those things that once you
get your foot in the door
you can move on from there
just be aware
that if you were to become a gas scheduler
it may require working on weekends
and late nights from time to time
as far as the next step
i would suggest that you just simply send an e-mail to george smith
manager of logistics on the central desk
and ask him if he has time to visit with you
i think that by simply expressing an interest
and learning what his expectations are of a scheduler
and also
learning what you can expect to learn from him
should serve as the first step
also
if he is interested
and does not have a position currently open
then he will pass on your name to some of the other managers
they're actually pretty good about that
i'll mention to george that you may give him a call
let me know if you have any further questions
or want to visit some more
take care
judy
i thought i was through
but i'm not
can you please send up the the following contracts
wisconsin power
light 0 also
if someone in my group has already checked it out and returned to you
just tell me who had it and i'll copy off of them
smile
also
do you have a copy of the gtc
we have no idea what it is
and we're looking for the non-performance language associated with it
thanks
here are the rates that midwestern and ngpl gave to me about a week ago
i'll double-check the rates this afternoon
talk with you later
just tried to call you
please call me before you leave
and yes
you probably need to leave
but where will you go
if you go straight hme
emotions are running too high for it to be a safe environment right now
i'm not trusting his reactions or your own right now
you are hurting and sometimes that will cause us to do things that we normally would not do
please do not put yourself in that position
please call me
hey home
just a note to tell you thanks again for being my
roaddog
it really helped me out
you're the
bomb
hey baby
getting back to the alliance issue
what is happening
i know i have my nerve because i was supposed to provide a list
sorry
i forgot
but anyway
here's a list
pglc dave wear 0-0-0 duke john alrich 0-0-0 you know the rest
call me when you get a chance
girl
you know he's lying
he's a trip
but it was a good sermon
thanks for the note
will you work tomorrow and the weekend
where are you going
i just sent you along e-mail
let me know if it came over
i hope so
it took me 0 minutes to type it
thanks for the note
that was very sweet of you
i always believe in helping wherever i can
b/c the next day it'll be me
how are you
hope everything is going well
did you receive my response to your last e-mail
i wasn't sure if it transmitted or not
nothing new going on here
i have a week of vacation scheduled for the week of october 0th
i really haven't made any plans
but maybe we'll go visit my family in omaha
it's really hard for me to plan
b/c i may have to work some of the week
i'm not sure yet
so i hate to plan a vacation that may have to be interrupted
church services were really good this past sunday
pastor preached a good sermon
talk with you later
girl
you are good
how much do i owe
hi nellie
what's happening
i sent you and momma some new pictures of the boys
if you have not received yet
you should receive either today or tuesday
i made the hotel reservations for phoenix at the embassey suites
the rate is $0.0 per night
pretty expensive
but the nascar is in town
and we can split it three ways
hopefully
there is a sofa sleeper in the room
although i did not ask
i asked for two queen beds
in case there is not
now i just need to get the car reserved and we're all set
i spoke with shawna on friday and asked her to check with her wedding coordinator to see if she could improve that rate
so far i have not heard anything back from her yet
nor am i holding my breath
she said her colors are burgundy and gold
if i remember correctly
jordan is still taking gymnastics and his coach came over and told me that jordan was so good
that he would like jordan to be in an accelerated class for his age group
this class is called the
hope team
and it gets the kids ready for competition
i did not realize he was that good
although i could clearly see that he was the best in his class
proud mom
i called to inquire about the cost
and the receptionist quickly told me
ma'm you have to be invited to be in that class
you just can't enroll
and i said
yes
ma'm we have been invited to enroll
thank you very much
well
anyway
we'll see b/c the class is from 0:0 to 0:0 p.m
each day
we'll see
i know he would really enjoy it
kendall is enrolled for his first gynmastics class beginning october 0rd
i was thinking he would really enjoy it
but the more i think about it
he'll probably want to be in jordan's class
oh boy
i spoke with daddy last week
and he's supposed to be checking into possibly getting tickets to come down for thanksgiving
let me know what you're hearing
talk to you later
hi
welcome back
i trust you had a good vacation.nothing much going on here
just huge price moves
anyway
everything we well

yes
cool
chicago is $0.0 an dawn is $.0
that's so sweet of you to let me know
but we will not be there this weekend
we just went about two weekends ago
i'm thinking about taking the kids to this farm out in my part of town
my understanding is that it is open to the public
but i'm trying to get the name of the place
diane cook has taken her kids there
so i'll let you know more about it when i receive the info
jordan has decided that he wants to help feed the farm animals
he'll probably be scared to death once we get there
i noticed kreme had their halloween party at school yesterday
what costumes did the kids where
yes
that's fine
is it inside the terminal or do i have to drag around on a bus to find it
you know the cheap ones are like that
here is a copy of my itinerary
please forward acopy of yours so that we may coordinate
thanks
hey baby
here you go
sorry
forgot the attachment
november
0 prices
sorry
i arrive on continental 0 at 0:0 p.m
and i leave on sunday at 0:0 p.m
on continental
hey girl
i know you've been busy and i can certainly understand that
it's been up and down over here
but i'm hanging
hope everything is going well with you
did the kids enjoy halloween
my kids sure did
i did not realize that we did not have rehearsal last tuesday because of halloween
i wasn't going anyway
don't forget i leave for phoenix tonight for my cousin's wedding
so i'll be back on sunday afternoon
talk with you later
girl
i'm on my way to the airport in about 0 minutes
i'll leave the phone on
hey girl
i'm back and i had a wonderful time
phoenix is a nice city and very easy to get around in
the weather was a little chillier than houston
and as a result i have a little cold and sore throat
the wedding was very nice
the wedding itself was in a small church
but somewhat elegant
the reception was
the bomb
it was in a real nice resort and it was money
money
money
i was really wondering where my cousin got all of the money
she had a reception for around 0 to 0 people
i'm not good at looking at a crowd and judging
but i bet it was around that many folks there
she had a buffet dinner
mainly sandwiches
but they were good
all kind of party favors
beautiful cake
0 layers and each layer was something different
a band
a dj and a comedian that had been on bet that they flew in from dallas
it was really nice
again
i hope she did not go into too much debt
but it was nice
she had a really wonderful time and she was a nice-looking bride
we went shopping and sight-seeing
we even went to go find the grade school that we attended and the house that we lived in when we lived in phoenix many
many years ago
it was alot of fun actually remincescing
you know what word i'm trying to say
did you go to church sunday
if so
how was it
i really did miss not going to church
how was the rest of your weekend
kids and steve doing okay
i can't wait to see you tomorrow night
it seems likes it been a long time
talk to you later
i will be home tonight
so i'll call you or you call me when we get the kids wound down
boy
it looks like this is really going to be a tight
tight
race
as far as your other issue
i would just say very professionally
that
there are 0 subjects that you are uncomfortable talking about
and they are voting
religion and salaries
and just keep it at that
you also might want to add
i hope you can respect my stand on these subjects
that way
you've communicated your desires in a concise
professional manner
talk to you later
girl
isn't that sad about the election results and the recount
it's really terrible
everybody over here is watching it very
very closely
they really want bush to win in a bad way
i'm tired of hearing about it
how are things over your way
my day yesterday was okay
todd cooked us dinner before he went to work
i was shocked
but appreciative
i think i might go car shopping this weekend if the weather is nice
speaking of church
do you know that robin told m that greg lives in million dollar house
remember when hope said that his light bill was super high
it probably was correct
we'll need to do a
drive-by
one of these days
i want to see this house
talk to you later
hi mark
i would like to creat a product for enron online for trades on alliance pipeline
as you probably know
alliance is a new pipeline scheduled to start commercial service effective november 0
0
as with any new pipeline
this date may or may not be pushed back to a later date
i would like to create a product that has a description that addresses the uncertainty of the start-up date of alliance pipeline and simply states that gas will commence flowing when the pipeline goes commecial
please let me know if you have language that addresses this situation
i would like to get this product set up as soon as possible
thank you
when you here from hope
please let me know what she says about greg's house and get the address and i'll print out the mapquest
girl
did you see jesse jackson on tv
you know how they have the news on around here
and jesse came on and said
in order to have a recount
you have to have the first count
and it's not a black and white issue
its a wrong or right issue
always trying to rhyme
can you believe that idiot
i was too embarassed and kind of acted like i wasn't paying attention
i understand that jesse is
down for the cause
but his credibility is suffering
because he's involved in every damn thing
if you're an authority on everything
you cannot be passionate about much at all
he's something else
he needs to pick his campaigns to bolster up his credibility
what's up with this guy
i guess he called mr
palmer
how did that come about
he really feels as though he's been mistreated
i don't understand him
hey girl
what's happening
girl
remind me
just in case i have a memory lapse
that i will never
ever go back over to that church again
it's a nice
small church
but those folks crack me up
last time i went
sharon mahon
sat next to me and just really acted a fool and had me roaring
this time
those fools sitting by me
audrey and doren
had me laughing
especially audrey
they're fools
i was so embarassed that my chuckle came out
so
just remind me
i will never go back over there
i sure hate that you missed seeing the baptismal pool
boy
what a difference a day makes in the weather
last night
todd cleaned out the closet
because of the potential tornado threat
i was a little unnerved
especially with the kids
i had the kids put on their shoes and socks and whatnot
just in case something happened
i was a praying sister
that really scared me
then
to top it off
the weather got really cold this morning
oh well
talk with you later
hey rev
jackson
hello sir
how are you
well
i tell you pastor really outdid himself yesterday
i really enjoyed his sermon
he really has a knack for weaving a story and making it applicable to today's events
etc
tasha and i got so tickled
watching you sing that song
you did very well
we said
look at rev
jackson
he's jammin
well
anyway
talk to you later
so hello
what happened at rehearsal last night
i did not make it
partly because i was tired and i had several errands to take care of
i needed to stop by k-mart and the grocery store last night to get things i really needed
and just did not want to be out late
let me know
talk to you later
p.s
is everthing else going okay
yes
sorry
forgot to mention it to you
but nothing was set in stone
in fact
i initiated the invitation on behalf of me and you
are you free
are they free
i don't even know if i'm free
what did they say
that's news to me
i don't think i like razoo's
i'll have to see if i'm available
so
i'm glad we see
eye-to-eye
on that one regarding razoo's
robin and anna have the strangest way of doing things
i asked robin at least two weeks ago
and she said she had to get with anna
and now she's telling you that they're ready and haven't said anything in the way of confirmation to me
let me see if i can get ahold of her and then we'll talk again
because at this point
i'll need a sitter b/c todd has the work friday night
and he'll be tired on saturday
although that's no problem
but
like last time
i don't want to go if you can't go
let me try and call her and we'll talk later
so are you free on saturday
also
everything is going okay over here
the market is down severely this morning
so we'll see
hey thanks for the info
ann
from alliance
said that 0,0 mmbtu/d went to peoples
so
it's all making sense
thanks again
i can't do anything on tuesday nights
but let me know about monday
i just need a couple of days notice
hey guys
here is the activity sheet for november
all activity is for the balancing agreement only
i am planning to inject approximately 0,0 mmbtu per day for the rest of the month and that should put me in a pretty good position
please respond when you have a minute
thanks
sorry
it took so long
it's kind of hard to say
but just say that during an altercation
but you do not have to say with who
i really don't know
but let me know what you come up with
how much detail are they looking for with the police report
this is super fantastic
see
it all pays off
i can't wait to talk with you and find out more about it
let me know if you are rolling tonight
we sold steve a package of 0,0 at the nipsco city gate
thanks for your help
it's about time
but well worth the wait
he's is soooooo cute
bobbi
attached are the final numbers for the interruptible balancing for november
0
i have also attached a tentative schedule for december
0 for both the firm and interruptible
those schedules will probably be revised once we get through december 0st nominations and
boo-boos
thanks
attached are the chicago prices
the michcon and consumers are coming later
no
but let me see what i can come up with
it's early now
so it will be about another hour before they start to show up here in the office
i'll let you know
greg set me up a nice little sheet
so here is the updated version with new volumes
please see attached
girl
you cracked me up talking about the
holler
now you know i don't know
it was raggedy because we did not sing it with the lead
he probably won't spring it on you sunday
because we did not do that good without you there
i am so tired from last night
everything is so rushed
and i did not get the kids in bed until 0:0 and then i had to get them up at 0:0 a.m
i'm tired
so i know they are
on top of all of that
the market is up another $0.0 today
yeah
but we have to stay late tonight to go over our positions as a group
my boss said that we will all stay until it's done
so make arrangements
naturally
todd is working the evening shift
so i'm trying to work something out with my girlfriend and her daughter
they just live right down the street
so we'll see
talk with you later
hi melba
while we're in the midst of creating new products
will you please set up a new product called
ngpl north shore gas company
the description should be
the interconnection between natural gas pipeline company of america and north shore gas company
it should be mapped to chicago
i would like to use this product tomorrow as well
thanks for your help
p.s
also
you may just use north shore gas for the decriptor
thanks
please attached
what's happening
i know you've been busy
i remembered that thursday night is ciera's
spelling
review night
everything is well here at work and at home
i
m leaving early today
probably
around 0:0 p.m
we've had a pretty good week and we're ready to go home and start over next week
next week is really supposed to be cold here and in the midwest
so it will really be a busy work week
i think i might try to stop at the mall sometime today
whether it be late tonight
you know they're open until 0:0 p.m
i think
or right after work
i will pick up a gift certificate from victoria's secret for samantha if i make it out
do you want to go in on it
i was going to spend about $0
believe me
she is looking for a gift
have you made a decision on the christmas party
we're still going to mine
but girl
we have to take the kids over to todd's mother and she lives in bear creek and then drive all the way back to enron field
my regular babysitter could not do it
anyway
holler at me
see attached
how are you doing today
boy
isn't it cold
i don't think i will be at choir rehearsal tonight because of work
isn't the christmas program sunday
i can't believe we are so ill-prepared
we've only had two non-dedicated practices for the program
we are required to spend the night downtown tonight
i'll be at the double tree allen center
because of the impending icy streets and the fear of not being able to get in tomorrow morning
it's supposed to rain or lightly mist tonight between 0:0 p.m
and 0:0 a.m
the streets are supposed to be treacherous if this thing materializes
so be very careful
in fact
you might want to talk with your supervisor to come up with a contingency plan for the weather
anyway
that's all for now
talk with you later
hey daddy
what a very pleasant surprise to hear from you in the middle of the day
things here are a little exciting
they are asking us to spend the night in one of the hotels downtown
as the streets are supposed to ice over tonight
so quite naturally
nobody's mind is on work
it's on the weather
so needless to say
i have a little bit of time on my hands
the boys are going over to grandma springer's house tonight to spend the night and todd and i will just stay downtown
i understand that you guys had some bad weather as well
i know mom was out of school
i will definitely go and get the tekno dog for the kids
they will enjoy it so much
kendall celebrated his 0nd birthday yesterday and had fun
todd bought him a mini basketball goal and he really thinks he's a big boy now
it's really cute
on the other hand
jordan was feeling a little neglected because of kendall's cake and presents
but he's okay
it was just a new experience
him not getting anything while his brother gets new toys
anyway
i'll send your tape
see you later and i hope you're still taking your medicine on a timely basis love bernie
scott
finally
here's the resolution on the coenergy invoice for april
0
coenergy is telling me that the we need to pay the difference $0.0 vs
$0.0 on 0,0 mmbtu per day
if this is true
please pay the difference of $0.0 to coenergy on a volume of 0,0 mmbtu per day for april
0
if your understanding is different
please let me know
but otherwise please pay the difference
thank you for your patience
and sorry it took so long to resolve
hi darla
could you please help me out
someone from nicor called me last week and said we had a discrepancy for september business
all he said was that there is a difference of $0,0 that we owe them
can you give me a general idea of what the discrepancy is
thanks for your help
i really don't remember the name
but it was a man
he specifically quoted dollar amounts of $0,0.0.0 vs
$0,0,0.0
hope this helps
thank you very much0

i think about you all the time
i miss not seeing you every tuesday
are you considering coming back any time soon
if not
i certainly understand
we are so
messy
we just finished
take it to the bridge
and i can say that it was certainly more organized than last year
we performed at 0:0 for about 0 hour and we were free the rest of the day
a big improvement over last year
although they wanted us there at 0:0 that morning
i just bought a new truck for me and the kids
a 0 chevy tahoe
i really like it
but i'm still trying to get used to driving something that big
and it sits so high
whoa
i certainly am praying
just as you are
that the kids are doing great and everything is going great for you
we'll have to get together and do a
afternoon at the park
with the kids
take care
love ya
p.s
now that i have your e-mail address
i'll e-mail more often
hi dan this memo shall confirm our agreement to deliver 0,0 mmbtu's per day to national steel for the above referenced time period
deliveries will be at the ngpl nipsco city gate
call if you have further questions
thanks
you go girl
you're in my prayers
hi monique
we have a mutual friend
natasha sims
natasha and i attend the same church and sing in the choir together
and we were talking yesterday about mary kay products and she told me that you are her rep and that we work at the same place
what a coincidence
to top it all off
i received an e-mail from angie collins and your name was also on the e-mail
so i said
i have got to send her an e-mail
well
anyway
i would like to order some products
i would like the cleanser for normal skin
a concealer in the ebony bronze
and a black liquid eyeliner
please let me know if you have these items in stock and what the charge is an when we can hook up
thank you so much
patrice
sounds perfect
do you need cash or is a check okay
thank you
my boss had me on a rush project and he was stressing me out
thanks again
hey
i was just getting ready to send you an e-mail and i opened my mail and there you were
things are going okay
the market is down 0 cents so we'll see where it ends up
yes
good news
my dad got out of the hospital yesterday and they called just as i was leaving for rehearsal and he's doing pretty well
he still is extremely tired and has not regained his strength
but praise god
at least he's out of the hospital and in good spirits
i suspect that there is alot that goes on that they don't tell me
so i really don't know everything
but i made them promise to give me things
as they happen
i'm going down there next month
we get president's day off and i'll be on my way
todd wants to drive
but i don't see the point
when the weather may turn on you in a heartbeat
and especially with kendall
he's drive us crazy
anyway
we have a three day weekend this week
with dr.king's birthday
are you off
i spoke with robin last night and she was mainly complaining about her job
but she's hanging in there
see you later
hey greg
please forward to ms
bobbi
thank you
i already purchased the vehicle
thank you
hi melba

illinois

chicago ldc-large end-users
midpoint
i will need to have the vector alliance set up for tomorrow if possible
thanks melba
oh i'm glad you sent me an e-mail because there is no rehearsal tonight
tasha said she saw taylor in the children's church
and i looked for you in the audience
but did not see you
after church let out
i was gone
i was home by 0:0 p.m
that never happens
i looked for you guys and i said
oh well
i'll catch them later
by the way
i'm having jordan's b-day party on monday evening
january 0
0 at the chuckie cheese on the southwest freeway
yes i'm having it on a monday night after work
0:0 p.m
because i can't stand that place
and jordan has his heart set on it
it's always too crowded and it drives me crazy
so i figure
we'll meet between 0:0 and 0:0 p.m
and be out of there by 0:0 p.m
it's not the best plan
but it beats a friday
saturday or a sunday
i'm just inviting about 0 people
so it'll definitely be small let me know if you're interested
see you soon
thank you
you may call the other product ngpl nicor gdd
thanks again
just wanted to confirm that you guys are available on friday night for jordan's party
you never did call me back
it will be at 0:0 p.m
todd had such a fit because it was on a monday
which i prefer
hey lady
just in case you are interested
i changed jordan's party to this friday night at 0:0 p.m
same place
love ya
cool girl
that'll work out fine
it sounds like hope will be attending also
kenny can't come
so that was disappointing
but i'll see him on saturday for his daughter's party
talk with you later
we need to talk
hope
you're the best
oh no
nothing urgent
i just feel like i take one step forward and two steps backward
you know the drill
hi priscilla
these deals are a mess
i remember issues with the deals
but unfortunately
can't remember all the details
i will speak with our calgary office
as well as
our operations manager
george smith
and provide details to you asap
unfortunately
i think the asap won't be until monday
as george smith is out of the office until monday
thanks
well
go with startech's invoice
thanks
hey gang
i've called the trader at sempra and she is researching and will let us know something
hopefully
this afternoon
thanks
i'm thinking that i have probably missed you
but anyway
it was so nice to hear from you
we're haviing jordan's birthday party tonight
so thwat's what we'll be doing this weekend
talk to you soon
love bernie
grant
please review and let
discuss how to resolve
thanks
hey girl
you didn't tell me that jennifer changed her name
i called her cell phone and left a message and it gave her real name
not her slave name
i cracked up
seems like the older people get
the crazier they get
that reminds me when my mother called herself changing her name from louise to louisa
i answered the telephone at her house and they said
is louisa there
and she said
oh that's for me
i cracked up
anyway
funny thing happened on the way to the forum
no seriously i was standing the lobby on friday
and a young man asked me if my name was patrice
turned out he was birdell's son
dupree
remember him
he's back down here working for prostaff delivering boxes
he's turned into a nice looking young man
i called dale and spoke with her for a few minutes
she seems to be doing fine
only spoke for a few minutes though
i'll call her back one of these days when i have more time
missed you at jordan's party
silly me
i didn't figure it out until saturday that you had shayla drop off the gift
i initially thought it was from shayla
well anyway
you rolling
hey kenny
thanks for checking on me
my trip to omaha was okay
on one hand
it gave me a real good idea of what type of shape daddy really is in
it's not real good
but he feels optimistic
you know he has prostate cancer and i believe it has started spreading into the bones
he's very
very weak
can't walk more than 0 to 0 steps without becoming physically worn out
mom has to drive him everywhere he goes
he doesn't go that many places
he's definitely has his good days and his bad days
he is taking regular pain pills constantly and has morphine tablets for extreme pain
which he's in half the time
it's really sad
he's lost alot of weight
but he's in good spirits i guess
to talk to him over the phone or hear him over tje radio
you would swear he's in great health
it's was really hard for me to get a true perspective because i know he was trying to put on his best act
so that i would not worry
it's extremely hard to see your parents going through this kind of suffering
he says he going to beat this thing
so alot of times
it's mind over matter
along with lots of prayer
mom is wanting to quit her job
she's a teachers aide
but daddy doesn't want her to do it
daddy says he's going back to work
please pray for mom as well
i know she's scared to death
and doesn't know what to really do
talk to you later
how did it go with lil
steve
were you able to get his fever reduced
poor thing
i hope he's feeling better
how siera
well
anyway
just was thinking about the kids and thought i'd drop you a line
are you rehearsing tonight
sorry
i got a little trigger happy
p.s
kelli is going to send the midcontinent volumes
prices
i plan to withdraw 0,0 for the month
i will revise sheet as we revise the volumes
but the plan is to withdraw 0,0
thanks
i bought a car
please do not e-mail me anymore
hey girl
where are the pictures
they were not attached
i'll call you this afternoon
patrice
hi daddy
i was thinking about you earlier this morning
glad to hear that you are not in any pain right now
we just need to keep pressing to find the right combination of medicine
my experience has been to be very persistent with the doctors and don't let up on them for re-evaluation
i've learned alot with the boys
especially when they were very young and could not communicate
i was kust extremely persistent
because there is no need for pain and discomfort when
most times
there is so combination of medicines that will get the job done
i was telling momma i was cracking up when you were talking about your
breakthrough
on the radio
i told her
if only the audience knew what you were talking about
i still haven't had a chance to check into those houses in virginina beach for our vacation
i called yesterday afternoon around 0:0 and they were closed,i forgot about the time difference
i
m probably hesitating because i know everyone wants to go to washington
and i
m not quite sure that this is the right place
what are your thoughts
well anyway
good luck on the
butt procedure
boy you and your butt
hope it's not too painful
keep taking the medicine and i'll talk with you this evening
is this your home e-mail or your office
hey girl
how's it going
haven't had a chance to talk with you over the last two days
i went to get me hair done on wednesday night and did not get home until 0:0 p.m
by the time i got the kids to bed
it was almost midnight and i was sick about keeping them up that late
last night
i went to the grocery store
came home and cooked my boys a good meal of ham
macaroni and cheese and green beans
after we relaxed for a while
we started getting ready for their baths and we all went to bed around 0:0 p.m
i was exhausted from being out late tuesday and wednesday night
i woke up around 0:0 a.m
and watched tv for a few minutes and went back to bed
i was tired
this evening i made a nail appointment
my nails look like
do-do
i would like to get a new set tonight
but we'll see if we get off early enough for that
daddy sent me a e-mail today
he had two really bad days on wednesday and friday
but he's scheduled to go in for more tests today
talk with you later
alright
i'll check into both places
i thought you were going to the dr
today
after i typed this
i said to myself
i guess i could have re--read your original memo
anyway
how often do you check your e-mail at home
because i can start using this to talk to you
do you all have any rodeo tickets
i'm thinking about going to stand in line
i want to see destiny's child
what about you
just checking up on you to see how you're feeling
are you feeling alright
how did the last test go
did you check with steve about the rodeo on february 0th
i want to try to get tickets this evening
talk to you later
that is wonderful
hi shielah
i agree with changing the deal to reflect a chicago gas daily-daily flat for the december 0-0 time period
please ask julie to change the ticket
i always get confused
thanks
i don't know where that came from
it's old
but it reminds me of that song
hey little walter
my dad called last night and he had a terrific day on sunday
god is good
hi i'm reponding on behalf of myself and hunter shively
hunter will be out of the office on tuesday
and i will have a visitor in the office from nicor on that same afternoon
thank you for the invitation
hi there
just checking on you
did you make it to practice last night and did lucretia's husband keep the kids
smile
if so
what time did you get back home
i know it was late
i went to auchan's last night to try to see what they had in the way of western attire for the kids
they did not have much
and the hats for $0.0 were on back order
i was looking for western shirts for the kids
but they did not have a good selection
so i went to a western store on gessner
boy
what a mistake
they were so darn high
regular shirts for kids cost $0 and they were ugly
i walked out saying that these people are serious about their western wear
i brought in some gospel cds to work today and i've been listening to them on my headphones
it sure helps alot
i can get away with it
because we have certain weather reports that are produced by enron
that you have to wear headphones to hear
so it looks good
plus
the boss doesn't mind
we listen to music just about all day anyway
have you heard the chester d.t
baldwin tape
i think it's one of my favorites
speaking of gospel
is your family still planning on doing a concert at southwest when they come in for the family reunion
i was wondering about that
have you talked to sharon and offered her your congrats yet
i want to call her
but i don't want to make it seem like hope is telling all of her business
talk with you later
just in case
i have not made it real plain
you deliver an awesome video
it is extremely professional
easy to follow
and concise
keep up the good work
thanks again
hey
how did the appointment go yesterday
were you trying to e-mail me yesterday
i received a message regarding returned mail
did you get one as well
i spoke with val the other day and also said hi to aunt ethel
they seem to be fine
val and i had been playing telephone tag
really did not want to talk with her because she ticked me off
but i'm over it now
for about the last two months
so she finally caught me on my cell phone
you know i always keep my cell phone on when i'm away from the house and office
the number is 0-0-0
when i'm at church
the phone is off as well
but anyother time
it's most always on
and of course
my pager number is on my business card
anyway
please e-mail me back
if you're up an about
talk with you soon
so nice to hear from
it is indeed always a pleasure
i can't wait until we can get together and have a chance to really chit chat
we're always so busy
a woman's work is never done
i did not go to rehearsal the other night myself
i had a customer in town and had to take him out to dinner
since he's one of my biggest customers
i'm looking forward to my 0 day weekend
are you guys working on monday
president's day
i'm off and can't wait
i will certainly keep you in prayer
my child
love you
as far as vacation
i think we are thinking of going to virginia beach
va
and just renting a house on the beach
i've never been there
but have heard a few good things about it
i'm trying to get more information before i go ahead and book a house
also
with my dad being sick
i've been somewhat reluctant to do it
because we always take a family trip each year
god is good
so he'll probably get a chance to go
have you made any plans yet
if you do
make sure and plan something leisurely
also
yes
we need to institute the park days and let these kids go crazy
they all seem to get along real well
so my girl
has good taste
i knew she had it in her
i really
really like my tahoe
i wish i had bought it sooner
it took me about a month to get used to it
but now i'm rolling
tell your sister i said hi
and let me know when she's in town again and when ever you guys have some time
i would love to get together again
yes
it is working
you're up early this morning
it's not even noon yet
you must be feeling good today
in addition
to learning about the $0.0 default allowance for buyback volumes
i have also discovered that we need to deduct another $0.0 to $0.0 per mmbtu to cover firm transportation costs that we incur as a result of this transaction
the cost will vary depending on the fuel costs
the transport cost is made up of $0.0 commodity fee
$0.0 demand fee and fuel of 0%
please provide some direction on this
as i will need to adjust the pricing in sitara
but would like to make sure that i'm performing the correct procedure
thanks for your help
p.s
i do agree with your last e-mail
hey
how's it going today
i've been thinking about you and siera
did things go alright last night
have you heard any more back from the principals yet
or are you not going to know anything until tomorrow
i know tonight is study night for her spelling test
so i probably won't talk to you tonight
rev
jackson called me yesterday
i thought that was funny
he said they had told him that i was upset about my contribution statement
and he thought he would give me a call to apologize and see if he could do anything
he then went on to say that he didn't want any problems or misunderstandings
because i was a generous contributor
i then proceeded to give him a piece of my mind
because they need to get serious about the business end of the church
by the way
i was talking to kent the other day
and he mentioned that carolyn jenkins was no longer at the church
that's interesting
i can only imagine what happened there
anyway
do you have your african attire yet
i have some
but it's old
and i had been thinking about buying something new
i might go to sharpstown and have a look
but that is not set in stone
it depends on what type of time i have and what type of mood i'm in
you know we're supposed to wear our african attire on sunday
you know we have an outing to first metropolitan church on sunday at 0:0 p.m
i'm pretty sure i won't be attending
i'm tired of going to the same places
we need some variety
gregg needs to get some new
hook-ups
if he wants people to keep supporting them on the outings
and another thing
i am so sick of singing the same songs
if we have to sing
in the sanctuary
one more time
i'm going to throw up
i received an e-mail from lane bryant with some coupons for 0 or 0% off
it said you could only print the coupon once
but i printed it several times
and it kept printing
so remind me to give you a coupon
see you later
sorry
it took so long to respond to the e-mail
hope
you guys are doing well
yes
i'm interested in receiving the address list for the attendees
we really need to get something out pretty soon to the people
grandpa says people are calling
i wonder if its just one or two people
but nevertheless
we still need to get something out
talk with you soon
hi jeannie
several months ago i met with jennifer milligan regarding part-time employment
i still have an interest in this area
and thought i would drop you a note to see if you know of any upcoming opportunities/positions within the company
i have no definite time frame
but i do know that i do have a strong interest in part-time employment
please let me know if anything comes up
and also if we need to meet
i would appreciate discretion regarding my search for part-time employment
please do not discuss with hunter
as i do not want to jeopardize my position on the desk or have him thinking that i'm not giving 0% because i'm interested in part-time employment
i've casually mentioned this to him in the past
so he's somewhat aware
but probably did not take me very seriously
thanks for your help
thanks for the
words of encouragement
i just sent an e-mail to my human resources rep and will wait to get a response
i am so ready
i've set up a meeting with my financial advisor for tomorrow to go over things again since i really have made up my mind
talk with you tonight
hi jeanie
what is your schedule looking like for this week or next in the late afternoon
sorry
can't do it on thursday
but what about friday sometime
thanks for the schedule
if the game with seattle is still available on thursday
april 0
i would love to use the seats
thanks for your help
so nice to hear from you
i miss not being able to see you and talk with you on a regular basis
i hope the kids are dong fine
jordan went to children's church this sunday and he definitely asked about taylor
he just starts smiling when i mention her name
that little mannish boy already likes girls
i think
anyway
things are going okay
i'm still leaning toward trying to find a part-time position next year
this job is so very hard
take care
hey sugar bear
i was just thinking about you and was hoping that everything is going okay for you
i constantly keep you in prayer regarding your situation
how's erika doing
you missed church sunday when they forceably removed one of the guys
aaron burr
from the church
you remember he was the one that used to sit on the front row and get happy alllllllllll the time
you remember him
anyway they hauled his tail out of there
it was terrible to see someone hauled from the church
not matter what the situation is
oh well
take care
and call me if we need to talk
hi marlo
this deal was done on enron online
so do we need to get further information from enron online
please let me know
i'm sorry
i came looking for you on friday at 0:0 p.m
i thought i had responded to you and indicated that friday at 0:0 was okay
but i checked my e-mails and discovered that i did not respond
anyway
my fault
what's good for you next week
i promise i'll respond when you e-mail me back
instead of just putting it on my calendar
thanks
hi roni charnella had asked that i send you information regarding scooters
the outfit is called scoot around north america
they have a web site at www.scootaround.com
their phone number is 0-0-0-0
hope this works out for you
take care
hey bobbi
here is a revised nomination sheet for march
and also
i know you'll be shocked
but i sent the contract to the lawyers for approval
so we should get it back shortly
see ya
test message
i wrote up a whole e-mail and lost it
my e-mail is acting up
so before i re-type this
i want to see if you get this
hey girl
sorry about last night
remember i told you i was looking for my nyquil
well i found it and took a couple of swigs and went straight to sleep
i really meant to call you back
but could not wake up
i finally woke up around 0:0 and got up and got a drink of water
by the way
the latest
unconfirmed rumor
is that samatha and anessa hall joseph are supposed to be pregnant
see you
no
i don't know her number
but anessa is
huh
just call up to the church and give them your count for dinner for the kids
yes
i'll ask her
but i also know someone else that sings at weddings professionally
do you know what song
daddy
i hope i'm not overstepping my boundaries
if i am
so sorry
but
i wanted to find out from you if everything is okay financially with you and mom
i need to know now
rather than later
if we need to set up a game plan for you guys
also
you don
t have to be emotional about borrowing money from me
nobody else is
smile
after all
i owe you one
love bernie
that's funny
that they still had the same outfit you looked at back in the fall
if i'm not mistaken
the
o
magazine
the one that oprah winfrey publlishes had a coupon for august max stores
i'm not sure iif it was this issue or last month
but call the store and see
and it may be worth buying a magazine for the coupon
i'm not surprised about hope
it was such a late night
see you later
yolanda gave me the name of the songs--they are
i believe in you and me
by whitney houston and
kissing you
by faith evans
hey girl
yes
we had our concert
it was real good
had a very poor turnout
but he choir really enjoyed themselves
rickey dillard is a fool
he's alot of fun
and i didn't realize he was gay
but he is
everyone says he used to be gay
and not he's changed
but
i spoke with daddy on friday
and he asked me where was his e-mail
i haven't heard anything from him as of yet
but i did send him a e-mail asking the question
did he do his radio program yesterday
yesterday
we went to the beach and rented some horses and went horseback riding
kendall loved it
jordan was a little skeptical at first
but soon got used to the idea
i myself was a little skeptical
because i had ol
kendall on my horse
and wanted to hold on to the little know on the saddle
instead of me
all i had was the reins
at first i said
the hell with this
but it was fun
we'll definitely do it again
talk with you later
i just called my other friend
her name is renee lewis and her home number is 0-0-0
she has sang the i believe in you and me song mnay times before at weddings and she is familar with kissing you
but said its a really sexy song
have barbara call her because she has alot of ideas
she's a professional now and she can suggest all kinds of songs
take care
yes
she'snot familiar with the music
but said she would listen to the music and see what she thought
but i have put in a call to my other friend
but i know she would do it if her schedule was open
but she does is professionally
and i know there would be a charge
i should hear something today from my other friend
i spoke with robin last night for a minute
you didn't tell me how good church was on sunday
she said kathy florence really preached and encouraged me to buy the tape
it must have been awesome
anyway
are you going to rehearsal tonight
how are things going with steve's party and have you set a time yet
what does he want/need for his birthday
i know he loves power rangers
but is there anything else
maybe something you had been planning to buy
pajamas
underwear
shirt
pants
socks
etc
talk to ya
phillip
the following four deals are the only ones that need to new mid for nbpl
the rest of that list is misleading
etc
etc
etc
hey nella
when i got in this morning
i had received an e-mail from daddy on last friday
he said that everything was okay financially for the future
and they only had an immediate need for the tax money
he sounded okay with me asking about it
he even said
you are so sweet with words
he just doesn't realize
but we get that ability from him
how was your weekend
mine was good
we spent alot of time outside
we went to the b-day party and the kids bowled and boy did kendall love bowling
in fact jordan
ny athletic one
bowled a strike
they call it bumper bowling because they put up little bumpers
all the kids enjoyed it so much
natasha and i are going to take the kids back in a couple of weeks and let them bowl one day after we get off work
bowling alleys notoriously have good food
yesterday
we went to the park and spent several hours outside
it was like in the low 0's yesterday
i'm glad daylight savings time is here
its so nice to be able to get home and get things taken care of before it gets dark
this morning
i went to drop the kids off at the daycare at 0:0 a.m
mind you
i'm running about 0 minutes late
and the daycare teacher
the wife of one of todd's good friends
that opens up the facility
she's the only one with a key
was late again
now the heffa was late one day last week and i didn't say anything
beccause everyone is late every once in awhile
but she made me late for work last week
so
i blew up this morning and had to leave the kids standing in the parking lot with about 0 other teachers and 0 other parents with their kids
i want to call up their and complain
but i think i'll talk with her first
maybe
she needs to get her stuff together
because first thing in the morning is not a time to play with folks
talk with you later
please sign me up
please sign me up
jesus
please show me a bid for this cargill deal
it is 0 mmbtu/d day
may-october
0 with balancing and anything else that typically goes along with it
i think the best option at this time is just ot get a bid from you
also there is a piece at nicor that goes along with it
but it is a monthly volume commitment
and does not include balancing
i don't plan to give you that portion
but it may be that the customer does not want it broken up
the volume is roughly 0,0 for the month
thanks
please let me know why my var is $0.0 million
my position is 0.0 short
so i need to know why the var is so large
hunter would like an answer as soon as psossible
thanks
what's happening
how's it going
i will not be at rehearsal tonight because i'm going to get my hair done
i figured that you all will be practicing
is that how you spell practice
your easter songs and i will be in omaha for easter so i don't need to learn the songs
as we only sing them on easter anyway
besides
just in case you didn't hear
we don't sing this sunday
we switch with the kids
since you all will sing on easter for all 0 services
this daylight savings time is nice
it's so nice to be able to get home and still habe daylight instead of feeling like you whole day is shot once it gets dark
did you find any houses that you liked
how long were you out
talk with you later
val
what is this e-mail about
did you mean to send it to me
send me some of those funny jokes that are going around
talk to ya later
bobbi

you are absolutely correct

our plane get in at 0:0 on friday
so we'll hail a cab over to mom's house
everything here is going okay
i hope tina has had the baby by the time i get there this weekend
i sure don't want her to have to spend easter in the hospital
as far as dinner is concerned
we'll have the regular
roast
ham
macaroni and cheese
greens yams
etc
mom said something about getting a turkey
if so
we'll have to have dressing
anyway
i think i am going to choir rehearsal tonight
so i'll try to call you on the way home

if there is anything i can do to help
please let me know
if you need help with the kids or anything
also
sorry about the choir
what's wrong with doren
he's seems to be sick alot
greg will probably
fire his ass
this week for messing up his
big day
on easter
that's a shame
you mean to tell me you wore the new dress without the blouse/jacket
that is wonderful
i told you not to worry about your arms
you did look real good in the dress
the colors were beautiful
we need to shop together more often
yes
i will be at choir tonight
see you then
no---thank you
hey what's happening
just wanted to let you know that today is my birthday
we're going yo go to the kici and jo jo concert tonight at the arena theater
should be very good
also
did you hear from robin that anna's daughter
dana
is in the hospital
i'm going to call up there this afternoon and see how she's doing
i'm assuming her last name is brown
also
i hooked cynthia patterson up with one of my customers
a divorced brother from s
carolina
girlm she called me this morning
and she was so giddy
she said they really had a good time talking on the phone
they talked two hours
they are meeting for lunch on tomorrow
i'll be anxious to hear what he thinks of her after meeting her
i know she'll like him
because he is a nice looking brother
and nice conversation
i just hope he thinks she's cute
oh well
talk to you later
i just spoke with sharon mahon and she asked me to tell you hello
did you know that she was expecting a baby girl in august
she's five months pregnant and getting married on this sunday to tyrone
can you believe it
she seem's happy
did barbara ever talk with my friend about singing at the wedding
what did she decide
talk with you later
good afternoon
robin called last night after i spoke with you and told me that her impression was that rev
jackson was resigning
i called horace this morning and asked him if he resigned and he said
oh no
he had just made a mistake
i get the impression that greg caught horace dogging him out and called him out on him
and horace being the good
honest person that he is
couldn't lie
he said that it was his idea to get up and talk to the church
robin said he was just crying while he was talking
he said he's in
time out
now
i tried to ask him if gregg put him in
time out
but he kind of kept talking
he said he's really having family problems surrounding this church thing and he's just going to be sitting out for the next couple of weeks
he won't be in the pulpit
he said gregg would probably have him sitting with the deacons
i asked him what is going on with the deacons
and he said it would take all day to talk about that
and he had someone in his office
i let him go after that
now isn't all of that interesting
i forgot to tell you that i spoke with sharon mayon on friday
she married tyrone this past sunday
that revival is this week isn't it
talk with you later
hey girl
sorry
i received all of your messages
but did not respond
sorry
so little c.j
looks like a
half-breed
that's what you''re trying to say
is he cute
i can't wait to see him
yes
i did talk to teena yesterday afternoon
she sounded happy
i spoke with daddy yesterday and told him to sit his butt down and stop trying to go to work
especially if there are no health benefits that he will be losing
instead of concentrating on that job
i told him to concentrate on his health
he said i was right
and said he was going to seriously consider it
i had to laugh when he said he went to work and fell asleep reading or trying to throw away some paperwork
that was hilarious
can you imagine the secretary going in and finding
little bitty
daddy sitting there asleep
i cracked up
the concert was good
you know those young men
showed out
however
the concert was supposed to start at 0 and did not start til 0 and had several acts before them and as a result
did not get out of the concert until 0:0 p.m
i was a tired sister
but it was well worth it
the hilton southwest is close to me
its right be sharpstown mall
tell me that dates again
talk with you later

hello
how are things going
i'm pretty tired this morning
i went to get a relaxer last night and got there at 0p.m
and did not leave until 0:0p.m.--pretty exhausting
but todd is out of town today and i wanted to squeeze that in before he left and i'd have to get a sitter
anyway
is everthing going well with the house
hope so
my daycare notified us yesterday morning when todd dropped the kids off that they will be closing their doors permanently on june 0st
talk about not getting much notice
anyway
needless to say
that is my new crusade
talk with you later
hi scott
i'm still tracking down the crestar issue
but at this time
it appears as though we should not have changed the name to gulf canada until recently when the sharing mechanism came into play with bp for the aos
crestar confirmed this and dan hyval left me a voice mail alluding to thus
but i need to hear back from him to ask that direct question
i'll be back in touch
hopefully this afternoon
thanks
would it be possible to leave it on ena paper
it seems that would be the easiest
test
dan hyvl went back to the original trader and wants to double-check
but it seems pretty likely that everything needs to be done under crestar
hold tight
hey you go ladies
i'd be delighted
yes
yes
your correct
i'm sure that we are going to have the same issue
i'm still waiting for the lawyer to respond back to me
i know he had to contact the calgary trader to get a resolution
i'll contact him again today and will let you know what he says
thanks for reminding me again
here is my best attempt at month-to-date volumes
holler if you strongly disagree
hi
i need to look at the calendar again
but i think we will be leaving on saturday the 0th of june
we'll probably stop in coffeyville for a day or so and come on through to omaha
i'm sad to hear that daddy's tube does not seem to be doing the job
i had to hear that
because i too feel confident that if we can get some nourishment into his body that he will get alot better
i'm so glad you stepped in and are taking matters into your own hands
i also feel like daddy feels real good that you are stepping in as well
i spoke with mom yesterday
daddy was sleep
so she really got a chance to tell me how everything really is
she too is now saying that daddy is in pretty bad shape
i asked daddy about the retirement
and he said the same thing
he is not ready yet
but the reality of it is
is that we still need to move now and not wait
i just hope he understands
i'm glad daddy is not in alot of pain
i think with him seeing the boys will really cheer him up
it's so hard to face all of this uncertainty isn't it
the good part
if there is any
is that daddy is going to a better place with no more suffering
he's certainly had a good life and we all want him to go on forever
but if there is pain involved
i
d rather see him out of pain
just keep praying for daddy as well as mom
if there is anything i can do from hear
just let me know
talk with you later
hi lizzie
will you please call this lady at transcanada
tracy in gas accounting at 0-0-0
she says we have a couple of term deals that have the incorrect transcanada counterparty
they are not deals in my region
so i thought it best to have you handle
as opposed to passing her around
thanks
that's fine
but i think i got off kinda cheap
so let me know if i need to contribute more
it was so much fun
dear dan

hi liz
thanks in advance for putting me on the list of people to receive updates or notices regarding alliance and/or vector pipeline
this information is extremely important as we are trading this product on enrononline without much information
also could you please add lisa kinsey and mark schrab to the e-mail list as they schedule all of the alliance and vector gas
one last request
could you please send us the daily e-mails that specify the daily aos allocations
thanks again
i called you back at 0:0
i'll try again in about 0/0 minutes
you should carry your cell phone in your purse in case you need to call me
then you van hang up and i'll call you right back
i just found out we have a toll free number 0-0 0enron
they tell me you have to select the enron bldg and my extension is 0
no
i didn't make the party
i just kind of fizzled out
anyway
hope you're feeling better and hope we can roll today so we can catch up chile
i'll call before i leave
yes
i thought we had sent you the contract already
the actual contract only refers to a delivery point at the chicago city gates
and not specifically peoples or nicor
if i'm not mistaken
is this going to be a problem
i'm sorry
i thought it had been forwarded to you already
so sorry everyone
i inadvertently sent you prices from the may 0

hi lizzie
will you please have someone re-send the confirmation to dynegy canada for may 0th and may 0st
the sitara ticket number is 0
i trade on a daily basis with dynegy canada and i use them to balance on
a good deal for enron
so their volumes may change several times during the morning trading period
so as a result
to avoid sending them duplicate confirmations
would it be possible to wait until the afternoon to send their daily confirmations
if not
no big deal
it would just make less work for everyone concerned
thanks

hey rob
we have one more comment for you to consider
we must have a definitive number of days in case
enron makes a demand on this guaranty
we cannot leave the contract silent on that issue
how about making it 0 days instead of 0 days
our lawyers say that we must have a definitive number of days
your turn
girl
this is a geoff storey deal
i'll work on it after trading
thanks

hi john
once again
so sorry about enron's inability to transact on the deal this morning because of contract issues
we need to fix the issue
so that it does not occur again
so
attached is a copy of the agreement that we need you to review and execute
i believe sylvia may have worked on this back in march
and i wasn't sure if you all ever received a copy
but if you didn't here it is
please call if you have further questions
thanks
i was re-reading my previous e-mail back to you
and saw my typo
you know that's one of my pet peeves
well anyway
i'm pleased
i know he's not perfect
and i'm sure he will get on
our nerves
from time to time
but if we grow and learn something from him
and he helps us to reach our full potential as a choir
and we're actually proud of ourselves again
it'll work
let's try to convince robin to think in a positive light
we've got much greater concerns right now
love ya
p.s
i have a much needed hair appointment tonight
so i won't be home until real late
but i'll have my cell phone available
tony

hi dave
i have attached a revised schedule per our conversation this a.m
my options guy has done more research

he has lowered his price by $0.0 so far
i'll keep pushing
please let me know how the 0 day option for dec-feb at the gate sounds
thanks patrice
hey guys
i do not feel that the heartland steel/csn issue is resolved
we are now getting calls from a representative of csn
companhia sidergica nacional
llc
saying that they have purchased heartland steel effective july
0
if this is the case
then why are we continuing to invoice heartland steel
have we been paid by heartland steel
have we been continuing to receive the prepayments
and if so from whom
has csn assumed the contractual obligations of heartland steel
while the credit risk is not my responsibility
i am
however
extremely concerned that we really do not have a firm handle on the identity of our actual counterparty
will you please let me know how we should proceed
i have a call into the csn representative and it appears that they are not really happy with us
and would like to receive a visit from an enron representative
let me know what the game plan is by noon
friday
september 0

thank you for your cooperation

hi bob
here are some notional sales prices at the chicago city gate starting with calendar year 0
of course
these prices are probably already old
as the nymex went up a little this afternoon
but nevertheless
they should at least give you some idea
i'll gladly update these prices for you whenever you give me the word
we can update them fairly quickly
as far as a publication such as pira
that enron would recommend
we really aren't comfortable making recommendations as such
regarding our electronic trading platform enrononline
i would like to spend a few minutes via the telephone
walking you through the steps to access that program
forms to be electronically completed
i think you will enjoy having access to this tool
so let's set up a time
p.s
would you be trading under the entity
corn products
international
or another entity
if it is corn products international
then we can proceed rather quickly
i'd also like you to start looking at our isda agreements
international swap dealers association
so that when you are in a position to trade financially
we have all the contracts in place
please reply when you have a moment
thanks
hey girl
i don't know what in the heck i was talking about
nicor enerchange did send me the correct version
please review and let me know what you have for them
thanks
patrice
update
i spoke with jeff hodge and was able to obtain a bill of sale document from csn
jeff is currently reviewing this document and will let me know how to proceed
i'll let you know more when i hear back from jeff
thank you
hi pat
just a note to recap our recent and ongoing discussions regarding the disposition of the heartland steel and csn agreements
at this point
enron's legal department has requested documentation from csn that substantiates the fact that csn did purchase heartland steel
i have contacted your legal counsel
mr
tarter
and obtained information that will hopefully satisfy enron's request
the next step for me is to meet with my legal staff on monday
october 0
0 to determine the following
0
is the relationship between heartland steel and enron completely severed
0
do we come up with a brand new pricing and deal structure with csn
or does the existing structure with heartland steel remain in place
once
these determinations have been made
we'll follow up with the necessary legal documents
i'm hoping to have resolution to these entire process by early next week
talk to you then
p.s
as a notional indicator
november
0 pricing for chicago city gate delivered volume
which is comparable to your location
would be estimated at nymex
currently $0.0
plus approximately $0.0
please keep in mind that the nymex price changes on a second-by-second basis
and this will impact your price
hi bob
per our conversation this a.m
here are the notional sales prices for nicor city gate deliveries for the following
five year price out of january
0 = $0.0 estimate ten year price out of january
0 = $.0.0 estimate
please keep in mind that these are estimates
if you need these prices further broken out by year
please call me
i will also forward the isda and long term gas purchase agreement to you early next week
thanks patrice p.s
you forgot to answer my question regarding what financial entity you would be trading under
is it corn products international
write back
because i need this information for the contracts
etc

hey girl
what's going on
it is truly a slow day over here
so far
i really could have taken the day off and would not have missed anything
last night i had a date with my mother-in-law
she's a member of a book club and they had their 0rd annual literary gala last night at the omni hotel
it was nice
but long
the tickets said it started at 0:0 and i got their at 0:0
the doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 0:0 and seating at 0:0
i was tired of standing around waiting to be seated
but
girl
ms thang felt so good last night
i felt like a million dollars in my semi-formal attire
after i left church
i went to one of my favorite stores
chico's
and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor length
not by design
i'm just not tall enough
black skirt
the top that i bought set it off so nicely
it was black
light brown and gold
i wore my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings
not the ones i wear all the time
but a new pair
much mo
flashy and my black high heel sandals that show all my foot
boy
i felt good about my appearance
when i came out of the bedroom after getting dressed
jordan said
mommy
you look pretty
made my evening
of course
bozo the husband
didn't say one word
but i felt good
i even had jordan take some pictures of me
so we'll see how those come out
smile
we have severe plumbng problems i discovered when i got back home
todd said the septic tank is stopped up
i have no idea what that really entails
but it must of been ugly
he was pissed
looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night
speaking of rehearsal
i was wondering where samantha had been
and poiter told me yesterday that she's back in school
so that's why she's hasn't been there
how did your evening go last night
we still need to talk
maybe we'll get a chance to visit tonight
todd already said he wasn't going to be home until around 0:0 p.m
on mon
tues
or wed
of this week
due to power mart
i said fine
have fun
i am so bitter
i'm ready for a change too
right now
it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing much
all we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different
independent
activities
plus
i'm ready for a new house
clean break and new environment
oh well
talk with you later
thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos
girl
what is pmo
i'm doing fine
i just sent tarsha an e-mail
and i hit the send button and there you are
is everything going as planned in all of your wedding preparations
i certainly hope so
i know planning a wedding is alot of work
jordan is still excited about walking with taylor
i had a good time with my boys this weekend
they are crazy
we went to the dreaded
chuckee cheese
this weekend and oh boy
was i ever glad to get out of there
after that
we went to the galleria
because when i was there before without them
i saw a shoe store that had really cute
fashionable shoes for little boys
what i didn't realize was that they were designer shoes
who ever heard of kenneth cole shoes for little boys
$0 a pair for the kind that i liked
but since i was there
i said
what the heck
after about 0 minutes
we had been waited on
but still neither one of my boys had even tried on a pair of shoes yet
let alone buying a pair
the sales folks were truly taking their sweet time
i was pissed and me and my possee
jordan and kendall
almost
set if off
at the galleria
we just left after i told them that their service was unacceptable
anyway
don't mess with moma thurston
how was your weekend
see ya
hi pat
i spoke with our attorney this afternoon
and he is in the process of contacting your attorney
it appears that the bill of sale that your attorney had sent to enron
did not specifically address the agreement that enron and heartland steel entered into
long story
short
our attorney is following up with to obtain documents that contain this provision
thanks
girl
that's my dilemma as far as a house is concerned
i have no idea
all i know is that i don't want to drive for an hour to get to work
i really wish i could tear down and rebuild where i am
i love the
hood
aspect of the neighborhood
i love the
colored
folks
and so on
i need to talk to a loan officer and see exactly what i would qualify for
all i know
is that i'm not getting any younger
and why not enjoy a new house now
what am i waiting for
girl
i hope the plumbing isn't too expensive as well
but it has to be done
jordan's old silly teacher called me at work this morning around 0:0 a.m
when i answered the phone
i recognized her voice immediately
and i got scared that something had happened
that heifer called to tell me that jordan was telling her that i had given him money to buy a fruitopia soft drink
first of all
it took me questioning her three times to find out what the heck fruitopia meant
and she wanted to check with me to see if that were true
because she didn't allow that particular drink in her class because it had too much sugar in it
well
i was pissed number one
that you would even call and upset me at work by asking me such a dumb ass question
you are the adult here
not jordan
she also said jordan kind of smarted off to her
well
take control sister
you obviously have no control if you have to call me on my job to settle an insignificant matter such as this
absolutely ridiculous
now on the other hand
jordan will have to be punished for lying
but my goodness
can you believe it
here are my cryptic notes from the pepl class
the field area of pepl is considered to be everything upstream of haven haven is considered to be the demarcation between field and market area on pepl pepl mainline divided into 0 mile marker segments two legs in the field area---liberal and seiling and/or elk city
named after the elk city plant
liberal historically has been a constrained area
but has seen alot of non-constraints as of the last couple of years due to the strength in the west
as well as production declines in the area for anyone trading pepl cash
etc
it is important to watch the spreads b/t rockies
cig
tw and pepl--for instance the variable rate to move cig into pepl is roughly nine cents
the fuel is 0.0% another big point that frequently gets constrained is cig lakin--point flows roughly around 0,0 mmbtu/d field storage
there are actually two storage facilities in the pepl field area
although pepl considers field storage to be at haven
haven is traded as a field point greensburg off of nng is another major supply area on pepl--called mullinville on the nng side
it is called bi-directional
but most likely can be done by displacement only tuscola
is the interconnect between trunkline/pepl interconnect lebanon
often constrained also talked about not being able to drop off at multiple delivery points on pepl--unlike ml0

hey sister sims
you were really singing those hymns last night
how long did choir rehearsal last
i had to go
i was sleepy and
quite frankly
had a hard time really getting into the hymns for that length of time
i do need to look up some of those 0nd and 0rd verses though
how is siera doing in school these days
i hope everything is going well for her
i still need to get out and look at this other school for jordan and see what's going on over there
his teacher is really very immature
she called me again yesterday with some silly stuff
you know we need to set aside some time to go get massages and facials and talk
write back
i did not enjoy it either
i'm glad you said it first
i'm going to look up that clarins spa and see if i can afford it and then maybe we can go together
i'll let you know what i find out
hey pat
i've done some research on the actuals that you make reference to
vectren
enron's sale with heartland steel is at the interconnect between midwestern gas transmission and vectren
formerly know as indiana gas
the actual volumes that you are reporting and consider to be your monthly actuals are volumes that i believe are behind vectren's city gate
which means that you more than likely have an imbalance on vectren's system
this bears checking with vectren
regarding an imbalance behind their gate
you should be receiving some type of statement or invoice from vectren
per the contract
enron uses the midwestern gas transmission
pipeline statement
to actualize our monthly invoices to you
i've attempted to draw a diagram for you to make it as clear as i can
let's talk
midwestern gas pipeline interconnect b/t vectren
this pipe owned by vectren

hi lisa
will you please add petro-canada oil and gas to the list of counterparties for mid-market

as far as delivery point
yes
it is the interconnect between midwestern and vectren
the ldc
please make sure and bring your pipeline statements
also
i did meet with jeff hodge
our attorney
and i know the details regarding the contract
i'll be in the office until around 0:0
thanks
please call me when you arrive
thanks
hi gene
as promised
here are estimated historical pricing for deliveries at the nipsco city gate
these prices are by no means
what we specifically charged at the time
but should give you an idea if this pricing is more competitive than the prices you have received in the past
these prices also assume that you purchased gas at the first of the month index
please keep in mind that these sales prices are for deliveries to the nipsco city gate
and you will need to find out what nipsco will charge you to transport the gas from the city gate to your burner tip
if my memory serves me
i believe you indicated that you were buying your gas directly from nipsco
and if that is the case
then we will be comparing
apples to apples
i still need to find out from you what type of volume you will need on a daily basis
please call me at 0-0-0 once you have had a chance to review the information and let me know your thoughts
thanks
hey debra
here are the changes back from cilco
i have no problems with the changes

the job is going well
i really like it
it is a different kind of stress
but definitely more preferable for me
i really like what i'm doing
my boys are getting the added benefit of mom being in a really good mood most of the time
jordan is doing pretty good in school
i'm not really sure that he's in love with school
but he's doing well
kendall
what can i say
my kendall is something else
he is so funny
and guess what
he talks in a very loud voice
it kills me
i wonder where he got that from
suzy is moving to new york this friday morning
her husband's mom lives somewhere in new york and they will be moving there so that he can hopefully find a job
i hate to see her go
but if it's best for there family
then go for it
anyway
take care love ya
come again
what you talking about
thank you dah-ling
they are correct
cilco city gate does not exist
the only reference point is the nicor city gate
as far as the guarant
i'm okay
but the last time we asked them to draft the guarantee
it was horrible
i'll ask them to send us a draft
call me when you get a chance

hey pooky
the rest of the weekend was fine
i forgot to tell you on saturday night about our choir's performance at this community function we had
in fact
i was on my way home when you and i were talking
sometimes our choir members are so sad
they don't always show up at functions and events like they should
unless its an opportunity to showboat
so
i had to sing on the front row on saturday evening
we sounded like crap
i was so embarassed
i actually got so hot and started sweating
because of my embarassment
it was awful
i just thought about that when your e-mail arrived
kendall was very whinny and cried alot yesterday
i actually thought he might be getting sick
because that was so out of character for him
but he's back to his old self now
just talking alot and being hard-headed
i just called the lawyer again and got the secretary
she said that she had been out sick with pneumonia and the attorney had some major oral surgery
so she could not talk
so i'll give this firm the benefit of the doubt
the secretary said she would have her call me back shortly or at least the secretary would call me and let me know
so
f
is starting to feel the effects of his years of dishing out dirt
i hate that it hurts
but most men do end up regretting their previous behavior
i know what you mean about your dad
in my case
my dad would be saying
hold on
anyway
i love you too and can't wait to see where we both go from here
hey
g

i have been sitting in a class all morning that hunter is teaching
it's on options and volatility
boy
that stuff does not sink in well with me
i find the class a real challenge
i'm so uncomfortable in the class
pray for me
because i need to get this stuff and be able to chart this stuff
everyone is real helpful though
but being put on the spot
its hard to come up with the answers quickly
it's painful for me
whew

you need the following ingredients
trout fish
medium size
about 0 big yellow onions
chopped into little pieces about 0 pieces of garlic
also chopped in little pieces tomato sauce red pepper black pepper bay leaf lemon juice salt white wine vegetable oil the process
0
clean and wash the fish
cut the head off you don't need that
place the fish in a pan and pour lemon juice in it
leave it in lemon juice while preparing the sauce
0
in another pan put some vegetable oil and fry the chopped onions
after about 0 min add a little black pepper
red pepper
garlic
salt and bay leaf and stir
0
continue stirring until the onions are a little brownish in color
then add the tomato sauce and continue stirring
you will have a reddish sauce ready
0
in a baking pan put the sauce that you prepared above and open a free space in the middle for the fish
place the fish in the middle
then pour lemon juice and white wine on the whole pan and put the pan in the oven
keep an eye on it as fish is cooked really fast
when you serve it ad lemon juice again
another way of cooking the trout fish
much easier and i think tastier
get a small trout this time
after cleaning it place it in a baking pan
then add olive oil into it
lots of it
lemon juice
chopped tomatoes
about 0 tomatoes
and olives
just bake it and there you have it
again when you serve it you need to add some more lemon juice
it's delicious
try any of these and let me know how they taste
have fun monika

brazilian paper and pulp maker industrias klabin papel e celulose sa said on monday it would restructure its units in a cost-cutting drive it hopes will save 0 million reais
$0 million
per year
klabin
one of brazil's top producers of paper
tissue and wood pulp
will incorporate its klamasa
kiv
industrias klabin and igaras units under its subsidiary klabin riocell sa
the company said in a statement
riocell will remain the sole publicly held company in the group and will be renamed klabin sa
minority shareholders in klabin will be given shares in riocell at par
klabin's director general josemar verillo told reuters
the restructuring
to be completed by december
should reduce administrative
operational
financial and tax costs
it will also improve operating synergies
allow for a better use of financial resources and improve the group's transparency for investors
klabin said
we have a lot of business between the group
that leads to operational and financial inefficiencies
verillo said
the company said it expects to save about 0 million reais
$0 million
per year and could trim staff in the long term as a result of the restructuring
in a separate statement responding to an inquiry by the sao paulo stock exchange
klabin said its consolidated net revenues would be 0 percent higher in 0
driven by exports and a depreciation of brazil's currency
the company posted net revenues of 0.0 billion reais

i am meeting with maria teresa this wednesday to start working on price forecast
i am currently working with andrew on inventory forecast and the procedure is as follows
based on the formula
capacity * op
rate
shipments = forecast inventory
we used pppc capacity forecast for the year and divided by 0 to get the monthly forecast
then multiply this with our own estimate of the operating rate which can be an average of the last 0 months or the operating rate of last month carried forward
or the last month's operating rate difference with the average and apply that difference to calculate the next month op
rate
we also estimate the level of shipments as the last 0 years average for the month we are trying to forecast
so far we have only tested september and the forecast was pretty close to the actual
let me know if this is what you requested
thanks
monika

attached is the capacity growth compounded annually for the main regions and the world

weyerhaeuser co
will increase the u.s
price of its northern bleached softwood kraft
nbsk
price by $0/tonne to $0/tonne effective nov
0
according to a buyer source
another buyer source said weyerhaeuser has increased his price by $0/tonne on the sawdust pulp that he buys
and i assume on the others
weyerhaeuser officials were not available for comment
weyerhaeuser has been the lone holdout at the u.s
price of $0/tonne for oct
0
when other north american producers went to $0/tonne
the competitors have complained that weyerhaeuser's price was a drag on their efforts
producers and buyers alike have said that $0/tonne has been a hard sell in october
partly because of the market
but also because demand has been so slow
a number of sources say nbsk is at $0/tonne for october
though a few are paying the $0/tonne price
i don't think we will pay $0
in november
a buyer said today
i think it will be $0
an agent today described the weyerhaeuser news as
a plus
but added
now all we need is for demand to pick up
another agent also responded cautiously
there is no indication anywhere in the world where demand has picked up
certainly not in the paper business
without that
producers
can announce what they want to
but it is not a slam dunk
he said
as for october transaction
aid that in most cases
they didn't move
i know everyone needs
price increases
and i know the inventories have gone down
but my feeling is they will go up again
he said
noting typical late-fall patterns
said that in contrast to the past
paper companies have not been able to make money off of low prices
it's going to be a battle
for sure
he said
there's a lot of fighting going on
a lot
of buyers
are saying they're not going to pay it
doug
why is the map cut off at the top
can you fix this so that it shows all of it
thanks
monika
count me too
the good news in terms of pricing is that consumption rose this month by 0%
and higher consumption levels will deplete inventories and consumers will need to replace those inventories faster
hopefully consumption will continue to grow over the next several months
monika
thanks
this is better
did you by any chance start working on the large map

forestweb
the tentative deal for georgia-pacific corp
g-p
to sell its leaf river market pulp mill to enron corp
has collapsed
according to a knowledgeable industry source
neither company is speaking publicly about the latest development
citing policies against commenting on rumors
however
the pending arrangement
subject to final approval
was no secret to some pulp and paper industry players
see forestweb
oct.0
top enron officials were said to have nixed the agreement this week
last week in its third quarter earnings statement
the company reported a net loss of $0 million
including a write-off of $0.0 billion
the source said the deal might still be salvageable at a later date
the leaf river mill
in new augusta
miss
has the capacity to produce 0,0 tonnes per year
since february it has produced exclusively softwood kraft pulp
thanks
andrew
as a follow-up to our conversation last week i have tried to get the list of mills from pppc but they are not responding to my requests
there is another way to compile that by using jacobs sirrine database information
second
i changed the inventory sheet to reflect the latest norscan inventory number that i got from pppc and so the forecast for october changed a bit
more in line with the historical average now
let me know what you want to do on the pulp mills's list and also anything additional in the inventory forecast sheet

hey doug
here is what would be great to have
for pulp all the mills
their most updated capacity
can you also find out how often they update the capacity and whether they remove the maintenance related downtime when they come up with the capacity number
and the type of pulp they produce
for printing
writing paper same thing for paper too.in addition
what kind of pulp they use to produce the paper
can we get the same info in a spreadsheet from too
thanks
monika
today foex published its weekly index for pulp
for the first time in weeks both the softwoods and the hardwoods show signs of weaknesses again
nbsk was down $us0.0 or 0.0% after four weeks of price increases
bhkp was euro 0 down euro 0.0
expressed in us dollars bhkp was $us0.0 down $us0.0 or 0.0%
these decline happens despite the recent efforts from the biggest pulp producers
including weyerhaeuser
to raise prices
this might be a sign of the fact that the market fundamentals do not support the price increases in pulp
the average foex for october is
bhkp:$us 0.0 up $0.0 from the september level please attached for a chart of foex prices

hello jim
it's been a long time since i last wrote you but here i am again
i am still working for enron
but i moved away from oregon
now me and my husband are living in houston
texas
i worked in portland until may of this year and then i though of moving away from oregon just because opportunities are not as big there
in portland i wroked as a power real time trader buying and selling power real time
i got tired of that job because of shift work
this summer i joined the forests products department and right now i do analysis for the traders
i ahve taken a couple of derivatives classes offered in the company and plan to take some more
my goal is to move to a trader's position
mostly financial trader to work with derivatives but we will see what happens

i plan on taking some classes next term at rice university in houston
i need to have better mathematical skills and i will start taking math classes at night after work
we will see how this goes
i have to prepare myself well for the future
that's all on work side
moving to houston was quite a change
the weather especially
right now though the weather is great
it's sunny and in the mid-0s to 0s
i love it
koli likes portland better
houston is a much bigger city and a little more dangerous
i like it though
what i miss is corvallis and school
i miss business school at osu and studying for finance classes
i want to go back to school eventually and get both mba and phd so i can teach

shipments of market pulp to china totaled 0,0 tonnes in september
down 0.0% compared with august shipments
according to a report last week by china's materials information center.despite the month-to-month decline last month
market pulp imports into china year-to-date have climbed 0% vs
the same period last year
from january to september 0
imports have totaled 0.0 million tonnes
reported china's general administration of customs
this might indicate that the chinese buyers have plenty of stocks available and might slow down their purchasing patterns
weak market in the pulp industry continues to push producers into taking further downtime
as expected the bulk of downtime is taken by the canadian producers who face the highest producing costs
today norskecanada announced it will take additional curtailment at all four of its bc pulp and paper divisions during the fourth quarter to reflect the continuing difficult market conditions.the company said it will curtail paper production by 0,0 tonnes
including 0,0 tonnes of newsprint
and pulp production by 0,0 tonnes in the fourth quarter
fourth quarter curtailment brings accumulated total paper curtailment for 0 to 0,0 tonnes
including 0,0 tonnes of newsprint
and pulp curtailment to 0,0 tonnes
sorry nyree
no exceptions
monika
amy
you could probably add expected capacity projections to see how asian capacity will change in the future both in pulp and paper and compare that to let's say other areas of the world
i remember that in the risi conference the speakers were saying that asian pulp capacity increase will lag behind that of latin america but their paper capacity will probably explode so they will major pulp buyers
anyways
you can find the capacity expansion data in the pppc website
let me know because i have some printed copies too

in september north american paper demand continued to fall
this is not positive news for the paper and pulp industry
the following is what pppc released
north american printing/writing paper inventories dropped by about 0% from august to the end of september
but shipments
production
and demand stayed depressed from year-ago levels
total north american printing/writing production was down 0.0% in september compared with a year ago
to 0.0 million tonnes
pppc reported
total shipments were off 0.0% to 0.0 million tonnes
total inventories decreased 0,0 tonnes from august to september to 0.0 million tonnes and were 0,0 tonnes or 0.0% lower than in september last year
the industry overall operating rate
shipments to capacity
in september was 0%
down from 0% in august and down from 0% a year ago
uncoated free-sheet accounted for most of the inventory drop
according to september statistics released yesterday by the pulp and paper products council in montreal
north american demand was down 0.0% in september to 0.0 million tonnes coated free-sheet
woodfree
demand was down 0.0% in september while coated groundwood

hello karen
please find attached chile's capacity and its expansion projects
note that
0
arauco's constitucion mill might have another alternative capacity of 0,0 tons a year
i was confused because in their annual report the capacity is mentioned many times
each time different numbers
can i get your input on this
we can discuss it when you have time
0
there is one modernization project that will increase the capacity of pacifico mill
cmpc
that will come online on q0 0
i did not apply any percentage rate for the project implementation
please advise me if i need to do that plus the rates i should use
0
the projects in red are not impelemented yet and pppc does not look very optimistic for those
0-sheet 0 of the spread sheet contains the mills
capacities from jacobs sirrine which are not far off from the capacities i found in the annual reports
let me know if i need to work and improve this further
finally
i had a lot of fun working on this project
monika
hello
the november foex that came out today showed a small up-tick versus last week
foex for bhkp was euro 0.0 up only euro 0.0
in terms of dollars bhkp was us$0.0 up us$0.0
0.0%
even though the movement upwards is very minimal
it is still in line with the pulp producers
attempts to raise prices
the price increases so far have been partially successful as producers have only been able to push for a us$0-0 dollar increase instead of us$0-0 as previously announced
still price increases are expected to continue in november
please see attached for a chart on foex indeces
thanks
monika causholli ext
0-0
maybe i should rephrase it
what i was trying to say there was that producers are going to continue to make efforts to increase the prices in november in line with what they have announced
whether that happens or not remains to be seen
thanks for the feedback though
it helps a lot

that's great news
well
the main reason i am writing to you is that i need some advice
i would like to go back to school next year but i have no financial security
my job prospects don't look good either now that enron was bought from another company
i know that many private schools offer scholarships as well as assistantships
i am looking into all of those
it would be very helpful for me if you would help and direct me in the righ direction
let's say if you know a professor that would like to have his own researcher which would help me in the process to go through with school
i have a great deal of interest in finance
and that is what i want to do
i really don't want to do a mba
rather a ms in finance
i am very ambitious and work really hard to succeed
i have great work experience and i have worked for a company that is well recognized for its talent pool
if you can't help me with this process
do you know anyone who can
i really would appreciate any advice that you can give me because i have no one else to get advice from right now
in addition
if you have any contact in the job market i would look into that too
