fletch sturm
patti
what do i do with this now
how do i get the $0
can i wait and get a series of months reimbursed later or do i have to go through this every month
fletch sturm
louise
i mentioned an idea to jeff shankman the other day about providing some charting and other types of tools to eol users and he asked me to get with you
he said you were already working on some additions to the website
i would really like to participate in the development of these tools
so please let me know when i can get with you and discuss my ideas
thanks
fletch sturm
louise
yes
i'd like to get together as soon as possible
i'm available this afternoon
fri
or tues
next week in the afternoon
let me know
fletch
yes
that's fine fletch
jeff
below is a list of items i'd like to discuss with you when we both have time
i just wanted to brief you first
i'm thinking about having a meeting with the basis traders every morning from 0:0
0:0 after each trader has gathered information from their desk meetings
this would be the optimal time to strategize as a group since changes in regional fundamentals and respective basis implications would be fresh in everyone's mind
would it be okay to delay eol market-making in basis until 0:0
i think it would be worth it
i think it would be a good idea to meet with leaders from other groups
origination
who
structuring
who
julie gomez
and fred lagrasta
on a regular basis to obtain new information on anything that might affect ena's basis positions
could you point me in the right direction as far as whom to involve and maybe notify them of my intentions
should we set up a new book
under my management
which would hold certain strategic positions such as spread trades and/or more complex structured positions
i think it would be easier to manage that way by not being
cluttered up
in different books
i.e
the p/l from these trades would be my focus instead of managed by other traders
do you think the traders could eventually report directly to me
it seems like more intense leadership might provide an extra push to the group
talk to you soon
fletch
i'll need to go another time
already have a meeting
i definitely want to see the demo
fletch
hey
sorry i haven't read my e-mail in the past day and a half
too busy selling
but that sounds good
fletch
ok
cool fletch
sorry
i have a meeting today
then going out of town for the rest of the week
i'll have to do it next week
bob
my one pass number is yy0
thanks for the tip
fletch
that won't be a problem at all fletch
kevin
don't forget about us down here in the dusty old gas trading business
congratulations
fletch
could you re-send to everyone and ask them to bring a copy of their one-month and summer basis positions
thanks
fletch
thanks coi fletch
congratulations dave
you're the king
fletch
greg
i've been working with an it guy here who has been building a spreadsheet for some of us that can receive live prices from eol
i've used this to build a real-time matrix which shows spread relationships between different gas locations
including variable cost analysis
npv
etc
i think that this would be an extremely useful application to include on the eol site
whether it is in excel format or some homemade format
for example
hunter and i were in chicago last week talking to nicor about analyzing the risk components of their pbr
we brought up this idea and they were excited about being able to more clearly see daily cash spreads
hedge mtd and bom pbr price with gas daily swaps
storage utilization logic
etc
if we can develop an eol
dependent application that is helpful to our customers in terms of how they make trading decisions
it will reinforce the importance of using our site over our competitors
let me know what you think
fletch
sorry
just read this e-mail and don't think i did the trade you are referring to
let me know
fletch
greg
check out a company called opus 0 for recruiting it people
www.opus0.com
it might be a good investment for the equity group too
opus

thanks
fletch
thanks for the note
we're doing fine and trying to get some sleep here and there
i'll e-mail pic's to you
take care
fletch
we're ok for now
thanks for checking fletch
douglas
thanks for your interest
my book does go into some option detail
not really collars since they're a combination of the tools i discuss
and plenty of swap transactions
obviously
i think you would gain some insight for both your personal and professional interests if you go through it
thanks again
fletcher sturm
natgas is going to the moon on monday
melba
the description you sent to me yesterday seems a little confusing
how about the following
floating price a
gas daily midpoint for henry hub floating price b
gas daily midpoint for __________ buyer pays floating price a plus applicable basis
seller pays floating price b we should substitute your long description for
gas daily midpoint
above
run this by everyone asap so we can activate these products
fletch sturm
sheri
robyn menear is my new assistant on the ft-central book
i'd like to have her set up to use eol stack manager
product manager
and transact on the website
i believe she already has a login id for the website
but i don't know about the others
in addition
her trades
stack manager customer trades
and her own website trades
need to go into my book
ft-central
if you need me to do anything else in order for this to happen
let me know
thanks
fletcher sturm
scott
i'm receiving faxes from you guys everyday
and would just like to be taken off the global e-mail distribution
thanks
fletch sturm enron
anytime after 0:0pm is fine
i am at eb-0c fletch
rain
i'd like to coordinate this with the other fellas
hunter
scott
etc
let's see if we can all go to the same one
fletch
rain
please put this on my calendar
thanks
fletch
scott
please take me off the global e-mail list
thanks
yes
that would be fine
fletch
sorry so late fletch
rain
please sign me up for the class on fri
0/0
thanks
fletch
melba
i'm sorry i haven't replied sooner
but there is a decision to be made about what type of product these should fall under
gas daily
or basis
we're afraid that if we categorize them as gas daily
then anyone who logs onto the site looking for basis would miss these products altogether
the
us gas daily hehub
chic
is cleary the best description for the website
i'll get back to you as soon as we make a decision
fletch
please put this on my calendar if you haven't already
fletch
sorry
but i've been out of town since you sent this
there have been a couple of errors pointed out to me since the publishing
most of which have apparently been somewhat obvious
i.e
not difficult to figure out
i'll look into this one and get back to you
fletcher sturm p.s
thanks for your support
if you haven't received the details yet
here they are
enron sells
if you need anything else
fletch
under the alternative
bumping
method
if the market is 0.0/0.0 and our eol and ice market's are both 0/0 in that case
would we pay brokerage if someone executes on ice rather than eol
fletch
dale
i agree with your proposed changes fletch
dale
the product that crosses monthly and daily swaps is the if vs gd index swap that we currently offer
i'll call you later
no time right now to write more
fletch
the following is a list of daily basis product names that we would like to create
all of which are us gas basis deal type
gd/d tecop-hhub
short for teco pool
i have put a call in to mark taylor regarding new product descriptions
but have yet to hear back from him
fletch
one more change
nl0 change to nxl0
also
if
nl0
appears anywhere else
change it to nxl0 thanks fletch
these looks good to me except for the lower case
h
in the hub phys that we already talked about
fletch
john
the new products have been built and are in the process of being mapped to sitara and tagg
i'm working with melba lozano
eol contact
and she tells me they should be ready tomorrow
mark taylor and i haven't spoken yet about simplifying the language in the product long description
so i'll try to get with him tomorrow
for now
we're staying with the existing language which isn't really that bad
any of these products which are intra-month will stay in the swap filter as us gas daily products
but longer than intra-month will be in the basis filter as us gas basis products with the format
the only product that will be different is the nymex to daily swap which will be
any questions or comments
fletch
brad
see message below from melba
which one should we use
and how should it look on the website

only five characters will fit in the name

not in a hurry as it feels like real estate market cooling off somewhat
thanks
fletch
marc
sorry
we don't have anything open right now
possibly in 0 months or so
fletch
jeff
with little physical knowledge of the transmission and generation constraints
etc
it's going to be difficult for me to say
geographically
where i think the boundaries ought to be
however
i think the market would always prefer a simple layout
something like miso
west
central
east
south
to me
i think that would cover the basic areas that trade differently in terms of price
fletch
terri
do you think we're close enough to book the deals
rogers and i keep forgetting that they're not in our positions everyday
fletch
jenny
i'd really like to be able to set my curves through dec
0 without having to freak with that g.d
contango weighting table in the mw0 file
the market changes so fast during the day that i don't have time to switch between my mwsum and mw0 files fast enough to keep up with it
i have a section in the mwsum spreadsheet where i keep all of the quick calcs on the calendars
so i could link that to the mw0 file like i'm doing through oct
0
come by tomorrow
fri
and i'll show you what the h i'm talking about
fletch
yes
lloyd will

thanks fletch
great man
we just lifted a new pad too this past weekend
bunker hill fletch
yea
probably get a little relief from the inspection report though
jenny
thanks for the response
i was under the impression that what you and i had worked out was more of a temporary fix and that there was another group working on a perrmanent solution for all of us
i'm still obviously trading options
but would like you or jp or someone else in risk run a standard report for me each morning which shows my net delta positions by month and the subsequent gamma positions for certain $ moves in the underlying
i could have peter do it at night if it needs to be done before calc
just let me know
thanks
fletch p.s
sorry if it seems like this is being blown out of proportion
what does this mean
fletch
how about 0:0 or 0:0
fletch
please put on my calendar for every tues
thanks
also
please notify my team that we will have a meeting with the marketing group every mon at 0:0pm that ed baughman should be setting up with you
that should be a weekly thing too
fletch
attached is the form i'd like everyone to use for tomorrow's reports
we will probably modify this and the ones to follow
so be prepared
fletch
you're cool
i'm not sure

who did the trade
customer/ene market maker
let's play ball
fletch
thanks
fletch
i met this guy the other day in my neighborhood
he's the son-in-law of the people who live at the end of my street
he seems like a good guy in person and looks like he's been close to trading
he's local
so i thought it might not be a bad idea to bring him in
what do you think
fletch
i have decided that i would like this product to be set up the other way around where it is quoted as comed vs cin
i realize that it will show up as a negative spread
but i have other basis
spread
locations in mind that trade over cinergy and can see how it will be confusing to some people in the industry
fletch

disregard previous reply

any truth to the rumor about johnny leaving the group
not the company
fletch
heard it down here from d
gilbert-smith
don't know where he heard it
right
but he's in the gossip circle pretty deep
seems like
if you think about it
it might not be a bad deal for johnny to get
booked out
and go run the crude group or something like that
he probably wouldn't fight it too much given those nightmares he still has about last year's second half
i printed out what you sent me earlier
have not read it yet
and can only meet after 0:0
that's the best i can do
fletch

i'd like to roll-over what i've been contributing the past few years
thanks
fletch
thank you
lloyd
i was just thinking about some of the record peak demand levels set at some of the midwest utilities despite less than record temps and slowing economic activity
and the resiliancy of the crude oil market to decline in the face of a slowing world economy
my conspiracy theory
could the u.s
government be secretly building up military arms and parts at factories in the midwest and other regions of the country
and if so
couldn't that help explain these records
it's kind of a crazy thought
but i'd like to explore it fundamentally
do we know the locations of certain plants that might engage in these types of activities
how much power they could consume if called upon to expand production of military goods
etc
i talked to rogers about it and he threw a buildup of the strategic petroleum reserve into the theory to help explain crude oil support in the face of a crashing world economy
let me know what you guys think
fletch
i left a voice mail for you regarding this
fletch
please put on my calendar
thanks
fletch

i'm sure he'll find the language acceptable since it's merely a 0-day evergreen
as for additional $'s
i personally guaranteed him $0k and gave him 0-0 odds on the 0-year contract we talked about yesterday
he's in either way
i also called suarez yesterday and left a message
but haven't heard back yet
i'll lob another call in this morning around 0am
did you receive a faxed signature copy from carson yesterday/this a.m
amy
if it's not too late

you might remember me
and wanted to see if we could begin some sort of dialog in terms of an agreement to retain your services here at ubs

i've talked with kevin about adding another term-trading position position on my desk
tva
the one we spoke about
and we're still not sure at this stage if that's the best place to allocate talent just yet
for sure
when business is up to the level it was before the crash last year
that's definitely somewhere we'll need to add
but for right now we're still assessing
as i said before
the dust is still settling
i.e
shuffling people and positions
so i still need a couple more days to see what the best fit for you might be

good morning
i talked with frank's assistant yesterday
he was out all day
and she said that they can't send an adjuster out without first filing a claim
to that end
she said it's generally not a good idea to file a claim
it goes on our record
unless we know there's damage
so
she suggested that i have a roofer come out and look for possible hail damage and
if there is damage
provide us with his estimate for repair
then we should file a claim if need be
so
i'm on the lookout for a roofer who will do that for us
if you think we should use joel
i'll call him
but
i feel like he might not provide us with an unbiased opinion
if you know what i mean
talk to you later
danielle

will ubs allow counterparties that enter into an isda with ubs to net exposure between financial gas and power positions when calculating margin requirements
if so
to what extent
and if not
why
this would be a major selling point when we're trying to establish relationships with new trading partners and trying to build our financially traded products business

any interest in getting dinner
john
hey
when are you back in town
i just had the whole it staff up here

club seats extra wide extra leg room extra waitresses
my brother was coming back from london to go so i went out and paid a fortune from a scalper for two
i really do appreciate it though
sounds good
i am free at 0:0 on thursday at my desk
i am changing the way the curve is generated starting in jan 0 to better replicate seasonal fundamentals
there are convincing arguments as to why the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time
however
in the previous methodology they blew out
for instance summer/winter in cal 0 was
0 while cal 0 was
0
i have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months of july and august over time
the formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for the month as well as for the year
these premiums are as follows
jan
0 feb
0 mar
0 apr
0 may
0 jun
0 jul
0 aug
0 oct
0 nov
0 dec
0 these premiums start in jan 0 on wednesday jan 0 settled 0.0
the 0/0 spread was marked at
0
the 0/0 spread was marked at
0
in the old methodology in the new methodology the only change in the formula is from
month x = month
x
0 year
+ lookup on year on year table to month x = month
x
0 year
+ lookup on year on year table + lookup on month premium table the seasonality premiums will change over time and i will let you know when i change them
call me when you get this
i am free to talk this afternoon if you want
please approve
andy
this past weekend we released a new version of the eol software that
unfortunately
had a bug
the effect was to lengthen the time delay between numbers changing and when they would show up on the internet to an unacceptable level that increased the number of failed trades
we made the decision to take some of the more volatile products temporarily offline until the fix could be made
i do not anticipate this to be a concern going forward
thanks for the feedback
john arnold
please approve larry may for a trader id on eol for

i pick you up around 0:0

have you ever been to bon coupe before don't knock it till tou try it
hey
any good set of 0 available for sunday's game
nope
your loss though
call me if you're in town this weeekend
dutch
the increase in position and subsequent position limit violation was due to two factors
first
a long position was moved into the long-term exotics book due to the nature of the position
i am currently using the ltx to hold longer-term strategic positions
the large increase in position is a reflection of my view of the market
second
a large customer transaction originated by fred lagrasta's group was transacted at the end of the day monday and was not able to be hedged until this morning
hence a large position increase occurred for yesterday's position and a corresponding decrease occurred today
john
thanks for taking me in last night
sorry about being drunk and stinky
my cab
that we called at 0:0
showed up at 0:0
i was so pissed
andy
just a couple of quick items that need to be addressed
first
what happens if the delta of the option is greater than the size of the hedge offered on eol
second
what strike are straddles traded at
are they set at the nearest 0 cent interval or are they mid-market of the eol quote
andy
the problem if we limit the size on options to being what size is offered on the swap hedge
we will not be able to offer adequate size on the options
optimally
i think we want to offer a minimum size of 0 across all strikes
if the swap is 0/0.0
one a day up
and someone buys half a day
making the market
0/0.0 one a day by half a day
the size offered on a 0 cent out of the money call might be as low as 0 contracts
a much smaller size than most people want to trade
if we restrict to strikes with a lower delta
we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a market in options that have open eol interest that have moved closer to the money
maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way wrapped around the eol swap mid market
thus if the front swap on eol is 0/0.0 one a day by half a day
the input into the option calculator is 0.0/0.0
0 up
in this case i think 0 is necessary because once a strike has open interest
we must continue to support it
thus i anticipate having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves
in terms of straddle strikes
i think the edge received from buying straddles struck on the eol offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for what i think the industry will view as a scam and another way enron is trying to rip people off
although striking on the mid-market is probably easier for the trader
i actually think striking in five cent increments makes more sense
it allows people to trade out of the position on eol
whereas if someone buys the 0 straddle and the market moves to 0
they have to call ene to close the trade
if the trade is struck at 0
we will have a market on both the 0 call and put at all times
secondly
i would anticipate non-volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction
jeff
sorry for my cryptic answer in regards to the lng deal on friday
i was a bit confused by the question
in terms of the gas pricing
this is a deal that should be done
market conditions are very conducive to hedging a fair amount of the gas
obviously
a deal this size would require enron to wear a considerable amount of the risk in the short term
but the risk-reward of the position looks very favorable
i am certainly willing to sign off on this deal around the $0.0 level
john
please stop sending emails to jennifer_arnold to the following email address
you have the wrong person
hey
i just got your email
call anytime after 0:0
obviously
i don't read my email very often
doug
to confirm the pricing of the lng dela
i can show a $0.0 bid for the nymex portion of 0,0 mmbtu/day for the time period jan 0-dec 0
the bid on henry hub basis for same time period is
$.0 resulting in fix price of $0.0
the bid on sonat basis is
$.0 translating into a bid of $0.0
notional volume = 0,0 contracts
pv volume = 0,0 contracts
exposure per $.0 move = $0,0,0 john
please take me off your mailing list

come by tuesday between 0:0-0:0 if you still want to see the new spreadsheet
however
it may be more valuable to talk to dutch quigley

i spoke to vlady this afternoon regarding the alternative var methodologies
i think changing to a riskmetrics historical var system is more defendable and objective
will provide more consistent results
and will create more realistic results
i understand vince has a similar opinion
john
per
can you give the campbell fund read-only access to eol
it may speed up the process if they see they can trade pre-market

as you can imagine
most information and procedures on the floor are extremely confidential
we look at the gas market uniquely and using different tools than anybody else
it is one of our competitive advantages
i'm hesistant to approve the use of any documents for external purposes
if you provide more information about what you're trying to show
who the target audience is
and what format it will be presented
i may be able to help you
john
frank
just following up on two topics
one
larry may's book continues to run at a var of 0,0,0 despite the fact his p&l is never close to that
can you check that his exotics book positions are being picked up in his var calcs
second
have you looked into applying a band-aid to the understating longer term vol problem until we change formulas
john
interesting observation
but i'm not sure i agree
i think consensus opinion is that anything under 0.0 tcf is very dangerous entering the winter
a month ago
analysts were predicting we would end the injection season with around 0.0
0.0 in the ground
with the most recent aga
those projections seem to be closer to 0.0
with supply of gas very inelastic to price in the short and medium term
you must look at the demand side of the equation
the market is trying to price out the right amount of demand
mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching
such that supplies will be stored rather than burned
each aga number is another data point as to whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a comfortable level in storage entering the winter
a low aga number indicates we haven't priced out enough demand and the market must go up
certainly
the 0 throws a curve in the bull argument
but the number may be a function of very mild weather
a four day holiday weekend
and reporting noise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supply/demand equilibrium
we'll know a lot more as the next two weeks
numbers come out
if we get two low injections
watch out
enron north america corp
frank
susan scott
larry's risk manager
will compile and send you a spreadsheet of total p&l minus new deal p&l since june 0
can you review this data and compare it to the respective var numbers for these dates
i think you will see the var numbers way overestimate his p&l volatility
john enron north america corp

the $0,0,0 extra var disappears in about a week

frank
one of the most likely scenarios for a var blowout would be a severe cold front hitting the country in the middle to latter part of the winter
in such a circumstance
cash may separate from prompt futures similar to how midwest power traded $0+ on specific days last year while prompt futures were $0
the correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong
and is indicated by the small var associated with a spread position currently
but in the winter that may change
another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is the assymetric risk presented by having a spread position on
assuming we enter the winter with normal to below normal storage levels
a position of long cash
short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&l side
while such a trade in an efficient market has expected payout of 0
the payout probabilities may look like the following

john
congrats on your new job
andy
just checking on the options
any idea on rollout date
john
thanks
anxiously awaiting
web server noticeably slow today
i'm getting a lot of bad failed trades
0-0 seconds behind when i change a price
not necessarily slower than yesterday
but definitely slower than a month ago
if j
franco wins
you win $0 if he loses
you lose $0
i had a dream that you were laid off yesterday
the day before your deal
just checking on saturday with third eye blind
hey
can you add whalley and/or andy zipper to pedrone's interview schedule
he can come in earlier if necessary
if you need to talk to him
he is staying at the omni and his cell number is john
had carlos franco just shot a 0 yesterday instead of a 0
you would have won
due to var reasons
you and i both need to sell today
vol and price are going up
implying enron can carry fewer contracts today than friday
have your desk net sell 0 today
john
is that hugs or kisses
when are we invited
does the arnolds
worldwide notoriety surprise you

can you create a spreadsheet summarizing enron's open futures interest broken down by commodity and broker
including maintenance and initial margin for all commodities
including rates
currencies
gas
crude
etc
also
can you create a list of all margin financing agreements in place and the rates we pay
thanks
john
fine
thanks
this is a project we should have done 0 years ago
john
hey
so i was thinking about your ny problem
i might have an answer
the site lists cheap hotel specials
the problem is they won't list them until the wednesday before the weekend
check it out though
they have some reasonable deals
john
must be nice to be a wall street executive
thanks
have a good time but no interest
john
dave
i was thinking about our conversation yesterday
if el paso
absent this power deal
were to give us physical gas for 0 years discounted at their wacc in exchange for an upfront cash payment from ene
is that transaction a mark-to-market gain for us
if not
what's the difference in paying them with an asset rather than cash
if it is a mark-to-market gain
isn't this a way to generate false p&l
john
ina
did you find out the info on the ena management committee> john
how about tuesday at either 0:0 am or 0:0 pm my time
hey
can you send me the file that you produced of those names so i can shrink it down a little
thanks
john
you didnt realize i was such a fucking bigshot did ya
check out the sep 0 fortune page 0 for more of the mojo
just some feedback on our eol discussion
whalley had similar thoughts about how to address the ice issue
his thoughts are that if we are 0/0 on eol
we post 0/0 on ice
if someone betters the bid to 0.0
a logic server automatically bumps up our bid to 0.0
if someone betters that to 0 bid
we immediately go 0.0 bid
so we are always the best market on ice so long as it is not inside our eol 0-way
thus the only way our best market shows on ice is if without us the market is 0.0/0.0
at which point our 0/0 market gets shown
if the 0.0 bid pulls out
so does our 0 bid
our proposal was that if eol was 0/0 we would always show ice 0.0/0.0
think about which system you like better
whalley loved fletch's idea of running tally of brokerage saved and that will be implemented shortly
i am going to call another eol meeting for everyone on the gas floor managing a product this week
the purpose will be to communicate about the importance of winning the electronic commerce game through a combination of improving 0-ways and killing the broker markets
dave
just a reminder
can you send me a list of grandchildren to my products
also
is it possible to systems-wise deny grandchildren to a specific product to ensure that the rule is enforced
john
ted
lavorato wanted me to check on the $0,0,0 var extension
is it possible to get this extended indefinitely until the west basis market settles down
we will have a good percentage of the west position rolling off over the next week as well as indices get published
please advise asap
john
thanks
yes
i have never commented favorably nor unfavorably about kase's newsletter
i think publishing independent market evaluations could be beneficial
the more interesting content that is published
the better
just fyi
whether it matters or not
but commissions in gas average $0-0 a contract
not sure about power
and you wonder why america is the most productive country in the world
frank
how do sep basis positions roll off
john
fine with me
please contact john lavorato
he will be in charge of these budgetary issues
thanks
john
she's out no bitch
can you handle this please
attached are settles tonight for seasons and years for next 0 years
dutch is working on getting historical curves
he should have it by tomorrow morning
john
did you get the magazines i sent you
glad to see you're having so much fun with this
i've been here 0.0 years with nothing and then in one week i'm in fortune and time
pretty funny
things are going well here
the big e just chugging along
bringing the stock price with it
wish i could tell you everything new in my life
but i think i just did
your long lost buddy
john
i have a membership to the body shop downstairs
can you cancel that please
the fortune article is about grassroots change within a company
it is written about the lady who started eol
but i'm in it a little
chief of natural gas derivatives
i'm not really sure what that means
i run the nymex book now but not the floor
just the derivatives desk of five people
i'm actually going to costa rica tomorrow morn thru monday
never been but heard it's beautiful
next time you're in we'll go out
please take me off your email list
cliff
i have 0 tix to the black crowes for you
third row center
where's your office now
i'll come up and say hello this afternoon if you have a minute
john
just checking up on the status of the margin project
take me off your mailing list
take me off your mail list
yea

next wednesday
please take care of
all you big boy
please schedule me for 0/0 from 0:0-0:0
i'm here

john

how about 0:0
who's the target audience and how is it being distributed
i filled in the spreadsheet

i would like to participate in the enron presentation at vandy
john
why would i be
hello
i will not be able to attend the meeting but do have interest in being a tutor in any math subjects
please advise
john

in that context
it looks good
i'm actually trying to go through all my email from the week
what a pain in the ass
as soon as i finish one
another appears in my inbox
so how's life at ucla
yep
i'm always here
if you have a minute sometime today
please stop by
john
i spoke to alfred pennisi from mg today
mg clears their own trades and maybe some for other customers
he indicated that his cost for clearing is $0.0 round turn
if this is accurate
we need to evaluate whether clearing ourselves and issuing cp every night is less expensive than paying a higher clearing rate and getting access to financing
this is a question i hope your analysis of the true cost of clearing will answer
also
fyi
over the past two days i have done two 0,0 lot efp's with el paso under the same structure i explained to you previously whereby long futures are transferred from his account to mine to lower initial margin costs
please remove me from your mailing list
dave
a couple things about the limit orders
0
when a customer opens up the limit order box
i think the time open should default to 0 hours
we want the orders open as long as possible
now
it is more work to keep the order open for 0 hours than for 0 hour
traditionally
limit orders are a day order
good for the entire trading session unless specified otherwise
0
today pete had 0,0
day on his bid because he was hit for small size
when i tried to place a limit order
the quantity had to be in 0,0 increments of 0,0
i.e
0
0
0
i could not overwrite the quantity to be 0,0
0
everytime a limit order is placed
an error message occurs on the system saying error trade
price not available
0
is there a way to modify a limit order
such as changing the price
without canceling it and resubmitting a new one
if not
this would be a valuable feature
john
greg
the guy from mg whom i spoke to about clearing was alfred pennisi
vp of operations
he's out of ny
he indicated his clearing costs were $0.0 versus the $0.0-0.0 i'm paying now
i'm in all day mtgs on thursday and friday
i'm free wednesday afternoon
jeff
man is looking for money again to hold them over for yearend
who do i need to talk to
john
thx for the spreadsheet
0 questions
what time frame does this entail and does the correlation between the trader and agg gas include that trader's contribution to the floor's p&l
in other words
is my p&l correlated with the floor or is it correlated to the rest of the floor absent me
enron north america corp
you're not done yet big boy
do either of you have an objection to using cantor as an otc broker
see you there enron north america corp
steve
sorry for the delay
i was actually out of the office thursday and friday
some enron management training seminar bs
count me as a probably for dinner on friday
i know jp well
darcy carrol's number is 0-0-0
see you this wknd john
eric
i passed the customer on to jennifer fraser and fred lagrasta
please coordinate with them
thanks
john
what'd you do to my cowboys
can you please add this
hi
the big money making floor
i don't think i like that
too much pressure
what happens if we screw up
i went to the website and clicked on the link but all i got was a mess of characteres and symbols
any ideas how i fix it
john
i'm sorry but i have plans for thursday already
maybe next time
john
mark
you've called it right thus far
let's plan to get a drink after work on the 0th
thanks
john
ben
jeff shankman gave me your name
i have assumed jeff's old responsibilities as head of the natural gas derivatives trading group
our broker
edf man
supplies us with $0 million of margin financing every night
they are trying to clean up their books for end of quarter and/or year on sep 0
they have asked if we can post the $0 million overnight on the 0th
we did this last year as well
please advise
john
thanks
this is exactly what i wanted
john enron north america corp
it's getting harder and harder to root
root
root for the home team
hey freak
so we finally had la type weather here for the past two days
highs in the mid-0's
beautiful
life's just cruising along
nothing new
i put a bid in for a condo in a new mid-rise building going up in west u that they accepted
if all goes as expected i'll move in next x-mas
so are you adjusting to the big city
got yourself a big hollywood actor boyfriend yet
john
i'm not sure what is happening on my position
it may have to do with how you shaped the forward vol and price curves at each level
my var is so dependent on spread levels and vols that a small change in the jan vols could produce that effect
the results certainly provide evidence of a need for higher var going into the winter
john enron north america corp
joe
i just wanted to run this past you
john
i really liked the commercials about specifics
i.e
weather
eol
bandwidth
the metal man was definitely at a different philosophical level than where my brain operates
still not quite sure what was going on there
ode was a bit too idealistic
the campaign in general was very different than previous
but i guess you know that and that's the point
again
i think the commercials that showed why we are the most innovative were very impressive
just telling people we are innovative made less of an impact
sorry i ruined your run
at least you weren't molested by the river oaks car thief
hello
i am john arnold
i believe you're looking for jeff arnold
hi
can you get me subscriptions to the following magazines
the economist energy risk management havard business review thanks
john
jim
i apologize for the comment after your order
i knew you didn't like the market last night so i was surprised when you were an buyer this morning
it's not your style to change views quickly as you tend to trade with a longer term view
i was out of line with the comment and it won't happen again
john
this is home.enron.com
thank you for sending this
if only you sent it a couple hours earlier
just kidding
t boone must have heard this because he sold everything today
0 contracts
john
looks good
i'm a little confused as to how many users can be on
the system needs to be able to handle 0+ users at one time
each being able to post messages any time
as far as lunch
it's a done deal
i need names of people who should be allowed
it is not for the whole floor
but rather for people who need to stay at their desk during the day
please advise
john enron north america corp
what design are you talking about
do i have pink elephants on all my emails or something
i'm very enthused that i have the skillset to be an advertising critic when i grow up
it's something i've always wanted to do
ps
i'm a little sarcastic as well
boys
i'm sorry you were not able to attend last night
i do appreciate your efforts to make this book as successful as it has been
it's not quite the same as being in my company
but take your respective wives
or swap
i don't care
out this weekend on me
try to keep it under $0 per couple
keep up the good work
john
jeff
anything ever happen with pedron
john
just an update
today i set up a front month fixed price gas daily product priced at parity to nymex
i thought the response was tremendous
it really shows that we might have an angle to put out more of the curve and become the predominant benchmark for the industry rather than the exchange
one problem i had was linking 0 syncopated basis products
i set up a new product for the prompt that was nov gd/d henry hub that was a syncopated basis of 0/0 to the nov nymex
however
since dec nymex is a syncopated basis to nov nymex
i could not set up a syncopated basis link around the dec nymex
any ideas
can you swap me with fletch
try to make all of my interviews as late as possible
john
russell
i think i should give you a little background on small ventures
bill perkins and i have a strong personal and professional relationship
he is an extremely creative individual
whalley actually commented on him today as someone
who thinks outside the box
bill actually sat in a bar four years and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth
he has been successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas
as such he provides an informal consulting role to enron
he throws out ideas and
every once in a while
he comes up with a great one
he pointed out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market
a market i normally don't follow closely
that i translated into a multimillion dollar trade for enron
in return
i have agreed to have enron intermediate his trades within reason
i want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be considered a high priority
i am willing to accept some of the credit risk exposure as a cost of doing business
bill understands his role as an independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for someone with finite capital
i place very high confidence in bill not conducting high risk trades
having said that
we certainly need to monitor his credit exposure and continue to require lc's
just understand that he is at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade counterparty
i understand there was some concern in regards to the transco z0 spread option he traded
he was absolutely right about the valuation and we
on the trading desk
knew it as well
there are a couple isolated products that enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations
this was one product
our spread options are booked in excel using option pricing models created by the research group
the problem with these models is that they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental price limitations
for instance
it is less probable
though not impossible
for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within variable cost than the models predict
thus it is necessary to apply a correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used
obviously
we have this function in our pricing models
i was not aware this methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models
this has since been changed
fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products
finally
on friday bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to enron
i gave mike maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting credit
i do not believe that i acted out of line in approving this trade considering the circumstances
if you believe differently
please advise
thanks
john
john
i have asked mike and larry to spend half an hour each talking to you about opportunities on the gas floor
please advise if the following schedule is unacceptable
i will be leaving today at 0:0
larry 0:0-0:0 mike 0:0-0:0 thanks
john
mark
let's keep the present system for the short-term
i would like to continue looking at your work for another couple weeks
we'll talk later
john
credit lines are like bandwidth
create the capacity and we'll find a way to use it
received
hey
i just want to confirm the trades i have in your book
net result
i have 0 f in your book @ 0
thanks
john
premonition
from
jennifer fraser 0/0/0 0:0 pm
mark
we are still on for drinks on the 0th
you have called the market very well since you started sending me updates
unfortunately for both of us
a couple of good calls does not a soothsayer make
thus
keep sending me your updates so i can at least get a little broader judgment of your abilities
in terms of my trading style
i take positions to make $.0-$0
not $.0
too much noise in this market to trade differently for me
can you handle this
please forward all names on the daily p&l sheet
i get a copy every day if you need
something to take a look at
thanks
sorry for not responding
i don't look at my email constantly through the day
don't have much to do in q/u still it widens back out
thanks
john
yea
the later the better
oops
i hadn't gotten to this one yet
can we do it any later
dave
we spend a tremendous amount of resources and money collecting information
further
the flow we see gives us an advantage in the market
we have little interest in distributing this info outside of the building
i hope you understand
good luck to your brother
yes
adam
good question
the exchange
nymex
and i
enron online
offer a nearly identical product
the fight is over which execution model is superior
i would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct
it's happened in europe already
the largest commodity exchange in europe
the liffe
went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry
within weeks
the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically
i still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct
the exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful
it is certainly an issue that we are trying to address
john
please call me at 0 0 0
i can do it either way but would much rather just make it the simple average of prices
0 per week
i was long 0 x @ 0
then i switched it from x to f at the same price
i switched it at 0
but it puts me into the f at a price basis of 0
sorry for the confusion
enron north america corp
yea
i'm picking up 0 tix today
hopefully
john
john
please call lavorato's secretary
kim
and schedule a time to talk with john asap
thanks
john
how about 0:0
absolutely
come by around 0:0
how's 0:0
no 0-jun 0 indicative offer is 0.0
i've got your tix
just two though
i left them in my car
can you walk down with me around 0:0-0:0
hey
i hope you know we were just kidding with you yesterday
we don't get many strangers on the floor so we have to harass them when we do
i think i am a couple of the
we are not
attributes in your book
is that going to cause me any problems going forward
john
i will not be able to attend enron north america corp
sounds good
how was the concert
i do not have high speed service yet
sounds as if you went to a better show than i did
the game was very sloppy
they tied 0-0
not too exciting
sure
yea
problem is i left at noon to catch my flight
but marc had a later flight because ny is closer to columbus than here
right after i left
the market got very busy and marc decided to stay at work and not go
so that sucked
gary
just checking to see if the trader's roundtable includes us gas boys
i would certainly be interested in attending
john
jerk
lady
c'mon
you're just one of the guys
wanna go to treasures tonight
of course
just kidding
aldo's next week
you're done
open up your checkbook baby
pira's certainly got the whole market wound up
i've seen a wave of producer selling for the first time in two months over the past two days
most selling cal 0 off the back of pira
pira certainly commands a lot of respect these days
too much
probably
the problem with all these bull spreads
ie f-h
is the thought process in natty is that if jan is strong
just think what happens when you get to march and run out of gas
the spread game is very different than playing crude
these spreads haven't moved for the past 0 point runup
you know there were guys bullish this market trying to play it with spreads and haven't made a penny
just to clarify
pira said 0 bcf y on y for z0
that seems hard to believe
oh yea
i always get those two places confused
a couple of issues
0
i'm having trouble setting a syncopated basis child of a syncopated basis child
grandchild
is this not currently allowed by the system
0
i have a lot of counterparties whom click on hub gas daily when they meant to trade nymex
although i would like the nymex filter to bring gas dailies
is there anyway to separate them a little more clearly
eventually i would like to run all my products in parallel with gas daily
but i'm restricted right now by issue #0
please advise
john
i can't get into this
any ideas
how about 0:0
yea
how about 0:0
anything new in the world of marketing
i've got a
strategy
mtg from 0:0
0:0
it's very important
i've got to strategize about things
not sure about exactly what
just things
how about 0:0 for drinks
sure
stop by and we'll arrange a place to meet
if you come by during trading hours though
i can only say hi for a couple seconds
so
what is it
and by the way
don't start with the excuses
you're expected to be a full
gourmet cook
kisses
not music
makes cooking a more enjoyable experience
we both thank you
please call her and schedule
it's funny the spreads in gas
first
in gas
you can play the seasonality game
does anybody want to buy m/n at 0 back
no
of course not
but in crude
m/n at
0 back is normal
definitely a game as you try to keep month on month spreads somewhat within reason while preserving year on year spreads and creating equilibrium for where cal 0 on back hedging and spec demand is
that's why cal 0 is as high as it is
when was the last time the most bullish part of the nat gas curve was prompt month
i can't remember w/o looking at charts
it's always the mentality of
if it's tight now what about july or what about winter
i think that's why the winter spreads are a piece
the z/f/g fly is interesting
i think z/f can and will settle backw
just a high prob it goes cantango first
still seeing sellside interest in term
definitely a result of pira
will probably get absorbed in the next two weeks as everybody forgets about them and watches the front of the curve
previous to that conference
the producers just didnt want to sell anything
tired of writing us a big check every month
so not only am i in on weekends
but they just put a computer in my house so i can work at home at night
it's really my only time to sit and think without the phones and eol going crazy
they better pay me for the decline in my lifestyle
can you find out if the tech group has scheduled installation of a dsl line in my apartment
the following are my bids for the asian option
think you're pretty clever
don't you
if only i didn't have a position today i'd be ok
0 months severence minus any errors
hello
i received this by mistake
adam
hope your interview goes well
things are going crazy in the gas market so
unfotunately
i'm stuck at my desk and can't go up for interviews
as far as the interview goes
my advise would be the same as any interview
be confident
answer the question asked
don't be afraid to say you don't know but don't make excuses
express interest in why you find enron appealing compared to the other 0 companies interviewing
the trading training program is still in the works
few people outside the trading area are even aware of its existence at this point so i wouldn't ask any questions about it in the interviews
if you receive an offer
it would probably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter the training program when you arrive
not sure about that last statement though
the training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure trading business areas
gas and power
there are still a large number of other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall under the program
that's a function of the program being developed by the head of these two businesses
not ready to take it corporate-wide yet
write me about how your interviews went
good luck
john
andy
i tried to open eol at 0 on sunday
but we had systems problems that delayed the opening until 0:0
this is the third time in four or five sessions when eol had problems on sunday
anything you can do to improve reliability would be appreciated
john
i heard he's interviewing to be shankman's right hand man
still have not received credit for funds wired 0/0
please advise
hey
what was the first cd we listened to on wednesday at my place
john
no
i thought you would have known
don't tell shank i told you
you just might never get it back
pretty much all traders
do you know my hr rep's name
brian hoskins is an analyst who rotated off the gas floor
pete keavey now reports to scott neal my aa is ina rangel enron north america corp
thanks
it just seems like all the time
don't forget you owe me dinner
not me
certainly encourage csfp to transact all volumes with us
if they shop the deal
everyone will front-run the volumes and they won't get a good price on the deal
financial deals settle 0 days after the index has been published
physical deals settle much later
my understanding is this is a financial deal
deathly afraid doesn't even come close to describing it
busy tonight
how bout tomorrow
lumber
the el orbits
eh
i've heard of them but don't remember who they are
there is a chance i've seen them at satellite i guess
my
you are nosey
i have a little date tonight
wanna come along
yea
i'll talk to them
who should i call
don't even think you're getting out of this with the
for a while
crap
just for that you can add a star to the place we're going
careful
i'm having another bad day
i didn't say you couldnt come down
just not to expect much
where's the site that i can sell my vote
my polling location is the knights of columbus hall
what exactly is a knight of columbus
very interesting
i've been looking for new activities
maybe i was born to be a knight
it just wasn't the same without you
how was el doritos
thanks
dave
can you do the same printout today of children for product #0 thanks john
that's fine
can we do the meeting today at 0:0
hey podner
where are you buying me dinner tonight

you think that's a valid excuse
whatever
no actually i was here until 0
filming a movie
yea they were doing spoofs on the rules of business
i'll tell you about it later
kind of funny
however
it took 0 hours for 0 seconds of film
what time did you get in
errol
i did not write up these access trades from friday
please make sure they are in
john
is it possible to reschedule the commercial meeting from wednesday
wednesday is the busiest day of the week for the gas floor
please advise
john
yep

thanks
john
hello
i am not able to pull up the link for the short term outlook for natural gas
can you please make sure the link is updates
thanks
john
i almost forget about your debt
but then your bmw 0ia reminded me of it
alan
i received your email
i'll make sure it goes through the proper channels
it may help if you give specific positions that interest you most as enron is such a big place
it will help focus the resume to the right people
john
get lost
best guess p&l tonight is +0
isn't market making on electronic systems fun
i'm always here so just coordinate with my assistant
ina rangle
thanks
john
hello
it is the blue men group
two friends highly recommend it
it's in the astor theatre on lafayette in the village
0rd should be good
i think you woul dhave had more flavor in harlem though
hey
haven't had the best of months
like you had some good positions but others wiped out everything
unbelievable how the whole curve moves as one for 0 months and then separates completely
the z/f/g and f/g/h flies are amazing
something definitely out of whack
hard to believe cash in z will be cantango to f and front spread
f/g
will be 0
spreads definitely implying we will see some $0+ prints on daily cash at the hub this winter
hell
already seeing it in the west
the system is just broken there
interesting to see if it is a sign of what can come in the east later
definitely more flexibility in the east so the blowouts won't occur until latter part of the winter
the inelasticity of demand continues to be unbelievable
who would have thunk it
gas can be 0 times what it was one year ago and not a significant loss of demand
market definitely trained to buy the dips at this point
continues to be a very trending market
most days finish on the intraday high or low
pira told the boys to hedge jv and cal 0 and the impact has been significant
i quote bids on term strips 0 times a day
understand they are changing their view somewhat tomorrow
wait and see if it relieves some back pressure
very surprised at lack of spec long interest in jv at 0.0 considering the scenario that's being painted
i assume means carrying equity positions
which of course the line would not be used for
john
eat shit
hey
hope you're enjoying the holidays
i don't have your cell phone #
so call me if you get bored this week
sorry i didn't return your call monday
i'll be in the big d
you can reach me on my cell or
better yet
at 0 0 0
adios amigos
john
bet voided
who were you trying to bet on
the agreement is fine
i'll mail it out
good seats sill available
please tell me he's not analyzing bollinger bands
z/f
wow
who would have thunk it
prompt gas at $0+ and z/f as wide as last year
hard to think of a better scenario for it to flip
rather
hard to think of any scenario for any z/f to be contango
if it couldn't do it this year
a lot of boys max withdrawing out of storage because that's what the curve told them to do last bid week
obviously
more gas trying to come out than is being burned
so you have to incentivize an economic player
like an enron
to inject
problem is if we stick it in the ground now
we're pulling it out in g
when you had z/g at 0 back and cash getting priced off g
cash/z looks awfully weak
thus putting a lot of pressure on z/f
storage economics will always dictate this market except maybe latter half of winter
buyers of h/j at 0 certainly hope so anyways
agree with you that back half of the winter should be strong
storage boys are withdrawing today and buying that
bottom fishing in f/g yet or is it going to zero
congratulations
appears as though the time to get in was last wednesday and everybody already missed their chance to get out
no thanks
plan drinks for any day early in the week
i'll let you know if they invite me this year
someone had a foul odor for sure
jim
your words of encouragement are greatly appreciated
i've certainly had some troubles this quarter
i do appreciate your offer but i don't want to take away from the amazing year you've had so far
maybe you should come trade this
john
don't know
think a little bit of everyone as the storage guys own it all
seems crazy
if you're willing to ride it for a few cents against you it's a great trade
who knows where they're going in th eshort term though
i think it is something we need to do
please set it up
a funny story
because access was up 0 cents last night
nymex made a trading limit of unchanged to +0
after 0 minutes of trading
we were at unchanged and the exchange stopped trading for an hour
rappaport
the exchange president
was standing by to make sure everything was orderly
obviously
the locals weren't too happy about the exchange closing
one yelled at rappaport
why don't you take your million dollar bonus and go buy enron stock
why does everybody in this company know my p&l
cant handle the pressure of big money
amazing how with cash futures at $0 and the back such a piece that f/g under such pressure
month 0 has been the strongest part of the board all year
will be interesting to see what happens when h/j is prompt
could j actually be strong
seems like of the spreads on the board the best risk reward is in f/g
a little worried about having the z/f effect again
that is
all spec length trying to roll and funds trying to roll at the same time leading to some ridiculous level at expiry
any thoughts
a couple more thoughts
certainly losing lots of indutrial demand both to switching and slowdown in economy
big 0 automakers all temporarily closing plants for instance
switching is significant and has led to cash in the gulf expiring weak everyday
gas daily spread to prompt trading at $0
need some very cold weather to justify that
this seems to be the test of the next 0-0 days
will the switching/loss of demand/storage management keep cash futures spread at reasonable levels or will it blow to $0+
not too many years ago we had a $0 print on the hub
unless we get some crazy prints
you have to question the steep backwardation in the market
funny watching the flies in the front
bot large chunk of g/h/j at $.0 friday morning
probably worth 0.0 now
crazy
people have seen each front spread be weak since forever and are already starting to eye up g/h
what's the thoughts on distillates
is it tight enough such that gas switching is the marginal mmbtu of demand and pulls it up or is the market too oversupplied to care
catherine
sorry it's been so long since i could respond
with the craziness here i am way behind on everything
#0
volume way down on exchange recently with recent volatility
volume probably averaging 0 these days
eol volume averaging around 0
very high percent of market
current market conditions shows why our transactional model of being one side of every trade is superior
#0
good liquidity first 0 years
okay liquidity years 0-0
#0
calendar 0-0 maybe 0 trade a day
0% chance enron is one side
calendar 0-0 very rare that it trades
absolutely agree
the thought is always
even if cash is piece of shit today
wait until the future
here's my question
what is the environment whereby f/g is worth $.0
is there a market scenario where this happens
yep
come by whenever
remember when you said there is a reason they call them bear spreads
bring up a chart of f/g or g/h
f/g is tighter now than anytime since march 0 when ff0 was worth 0.0 amazing
and they say it was purely coincidental the announcement came today
0 is fine
saw a lot of the bulls sell summer against length in front to mitigate margins/absolute position limits/var
as these guys are taking off the front
they are also buying back summer
el paso large buyer of next winter today taking off spreads
certainly a reason why the spreads were so strong on the way up and such a piece now
really the only one left with any risk premium built in is h/j now
it was trading equivalent of 0 on access
down 0+ from this morning
certainly if we are entering a period of bearish to neutral trade
h/j will get whacked
certainly understand the arguments for h/j
if h settles $0
that spread is probably worth $0
h 0 call was trading for 0 on monday
today it was 0/0
the market's view of probability of h going crazy has certainly changed in past 0 hours and that has to be reflected in h/j
hey
any interest in seeing cirque du soleil saturday
just called they're on vacation for two weeks
that sucks
please remind me
andy
i just spoke to a guy named neil hanover
he is a fund trader for a company in london
he asked the head eol marketer to give him a call about setting him up on the system
can you help
john
can you program my steno in the offices like the ones on my desk
any idea what amount of switching in gas equivalents does the implied demand of resid equate to
i know
the market had to get to a price whereby these guys shut down
there is just not enough gas to allow everybody who wants to to burn it
the elasticity of demand is in the industrial sector
million dollar question is have we gotten to a high enough price whereby we end the year with gas in the ground and deliverability to meet a late cold snap
shutdown of processing
distillate and resid switching
loss of industrial load
maybe we have
good holidays
john
asshole
asshole
sorry didnt respond to your message
don't know how to do that instant messenger thing anymore
volume very
very light
most of stated volume in spreads and tas
no one seems to want to be in the office this week
everyone wants to get this year over with
keep pumping in the fundamental info
very good stuff and i'm not getting it anywhere else
here is the name of an available options trader
jeremy sorkin vp
deutsche bank would fit enron culture
but have had little contact with him professionally
might be worth bringing him in
tell me if you want me to call him
please approve dutch for ice enron north america corp
the positions went over limits due to the sale of hpl and subsequent unwind of hedges associated with the transaction
attempts are being made to unwind those positions currently
wish you guys were going a week earlier
i'm going next weekend

such as when i'm out of the office
as such
i'd like to bring in john griffith for anohter round of interviews for an options trading role with your permission
john
are you free for a drink/dinner wednesday night
glad you enjoyed yourself even though you didnt get to go to ny

going to vegas this weekend to watch the football games
love you
john
what is the
correct
formula you devised for profitability on last trade is mid
i want john to interview with the various desk heads
scott
hunter
phillip
tom
i think i'm going to tell john not to mention the past
it's an issue that doesn't need to be made public and as long as lavo and myself are okay with it
i don't see the need to get individual approval from everyone
thanks for your help
john
john
i would like for you to come talk to a couple more people on the gas floor about a possible position down the road

we will be closed sunday and be offering nymex products only from 0-0 on monday
thanks
john
glad to hear progress is being made
i went to vandy but a little later
0-0
a couple of observations from here
cash/futures getting whacked
whereas last weekend cash traded $0 over g
this weekend will probably trade $.0 over
the lack of weather giving the market time to regroup
good thing because another week of cold and the system was going to break
certainly still has that chance in feb
saw utilities recently staying on a verystrict withdrawal schedule and meeting any extra demand through spot market
in effect
they said we're not withdrawing anymore so we'll buy marketers storage
they had to encourage marketers to sell it to them
so cash was extremely strong in periods of even normal demand and should continue to be if/when any weather comes again
this week demand so low that utilities can meet demand without buying much in mkt
g/h getting whacked in sympathy
probably priced 0 term deals through broker market and own originators in past two days
0 were from the buy side
it's as if pira came in and told everyone term was cheap
however
they've got the opposite view
customers just seeing gas at $0 anytime as being okay now
don't see any let up in back support for a while
front spreads the hardest call right now
g/h h/j j/k
can't decide what to do with them and from the volatility in them
appears neither can anybody else
almost think best play is taking feb gas daily against march
hoping for a cold spell that breaks the system and get a couple $0+ prints in cash
probably as likely to happen in g as h and g/h has much less downside
doing well here
actually having the best month ever 0 days in
played front short against term length
got out of front shorts today
probably early but gas has a history of getting off the canvas when least expected
will keep term length meanwhile
i've hated summer backwardation forever
agree about u/h
a little less crazy about the trade now because i think the easy money was made over the past two days
unbelievable spec demand for next winter over past week kept summer winter spread constant on rally up and crushed on move down
jv/xh went from 0 to 0.0 in 0 days while front virtually unchanged
don't know what to think of this summer longer term
certainly not as easy as it was last summer when it was obvious $0 was not equilibrium for gas
now $0 for this summer
i don't know
we're gonna have to inject the hell out of gas and keep some demand priced out for a long time
but we will feel production increase hit the market
just buy vol
i said i'm a vp and run natural gas derivatives trading and she asked if she could eliminate derivatives because then she'd have to write two more sentences about what that was
i don't ask
i think he think he'll jinx it if he talks about it
speed on eol message for monday how to move to algorithms dave or tom moran
telerate on my computer at home is not working
can you get fixed
john

john
tom
my assistant spoke to judy smith about myself and my partner grabbing an extra seat on the jet to tampa
my partner and i were invited to the game by a couple of gentlemen from new york that i do business with
unfortunately
since i run the nat gas derivatives desk and february expiration is next monday
the only way we could go is if the jet were coming back sunday night
no commercial flights would get us back in time
judy indicated it was fine if we caught a ride on the way back
so my contacts in ny booked the trip
including buying game tickets
i am now hearing that you may be leaving early sunday night
i was just wondering if your plans had firmed up
obviously
it would be tremendously helpful to me if the plane were leaving after the game
please advise
john
fine
hey
sorry i've taken a few days to respond
just the more i think about it
the worse of an idea it seems for both of us
there is nothing good that can come of it either professionally or personally
i still regard you as a good friend
nothing has changed that nor do i think we need to act weird around each other going forward
something i think we both wanted to try and we did
maybe best left there though
john

john
andy
i just briefed lavorato on the credit issues
his comment was that bradford is going through defcom 0 over california right now and to give him a week when things start to get sorted out there
john
please respond to jennifer
you're done
check with mike and dutch
can they come any earlier
thank you four you're note
i am only twelv years old so i wont bid anymore
i am sorry
contact andy rowe at 0 0 0
they are a medium term fundamental energy player
they have never indicated any interest in anything besides nymex or hub gas daily
but that may change
they have interest in trading on eol but have not gotten approval yet
i will try to get tomorrow
if not
is another day okay
i got 0 for tomorrow
we have 0 do you want them
agree guys are short h/j
hard to see a big move with cash/futures trading flat
agree that it has some squeeze potential though
started moving today as
simultaneously
march started running up and j aron won a big customer deal
customer
maybe a hedge fund
bot 0+ jv 0 puts
weather frustrating me too
a little long but it's in the backs so i haven't been hurt
sure would be nice to get some more weather and have this thing start going crazy again
seen liquids processing come back on at these levels
would guess more than 0% has from peak
industrial demand different story
industrial economy just so weak that many petchems and others are burning less because of their markets
not fuel costs
chrystler is a prime example
any switching back to gas from industrial or switching back to domestic production from overseas muted by weak economy
quit pressuring them i want to sell some too
actually sold a few at 0 on the close
i actually started writing this on thursday
got distracted and left late morning to go to vail
apparently i missed a little craziness
my point on v/x is that forward spreads
months 0/0 and back
don't necessarily trade on value
they trade on drawing a forward curve that makes equilibrium between hedging and spec demand
look at k/m
do you think k cash will average 0 cents above m
i don't really see that scenario
yet that's what it is worth because the market says jv is worth $x and to get there k/m=0
the same argument applies to v/x
i think this summer will be exceptionally strong as we try to inject 0 bcf/d more gas than last year
but cal 0 will lag the move
it's the main thing customers are selling right now because every equity analyst and even pira are telling their customers that cal 0 will average 0.0
so either the v/x and x/z spreads come in or f/g g/h h/j blow out
after this winter
who in there right mind wants to buy f/g or g/h again
my thought is that the primary juice will be h/j but v/x and x/z will be under some pressure
i'm a seller at 0 and buyer at 0-0
not much in it either way though
no
i went with matt thurell from koch
they've got some corporate townhouse out there
very nice
good to see the old days of waste aren't completely gone yet
neal
referencing apr-oct 0/0 and nov-mar 0/0
on the following volumes i am 0/0
feel free to call to transact
0-0-0
mr sturm
due to the california power crisis
enron gas trading is unable to extend sell authorization on options to enron power trading
please call if you should desire to sell any options and credit will be extended on a trade-by-trade basis
we apologize for any inconvience
sincerely
john arnold vice president
gas trading enron north america
probably not
it would have to have a lot of upside
never hurts to listen though
will do
he sends me his stuff
i like him because he's willing to take a stand
so many technicians bullshit their way
support at 0-0 but if it breaks that look for 0
if every technician put specific trades on a sheet with entry and exit points and published them every day
a lot of people would be unemployed
don't care about the front
i think its vulnerable to a good short squeeze like we saw on thruday and friday
trade is getting short in here with cash such a piece
if weather ever changes
which the weather boys are saying it might in 0 weeks
the cash players are going to be big buyers
don't really want to carry length on the way down waiting for that to happen though
backs are crazy stong
cal 0 traded as high as +0
everybody a buyer as california trying to buy any fixed price energy they can find
remove from email list
i think you're absolutely right about q/u
again just a question of when to put it on
seems as if i'm always on the offer of that spread
yesterday i had a 0.0 offer all day and i think i got 0 or so
i can almost leg it better by buying winter and selling summer and the j/q spread
i would like to see it widen another penny before stepping in and i think with the weakness in the winter and relative weakness of cal 0
on any rally that could happen
was that you on the q/u/v fly yesterday
but what's a pig
you will have 0 tix
make your plans
just sold 0 q/u at
0 that was the pop i'm looking for
this is the move i was talking about
v/x implicitly trading 0.0 right now because cal 0 is weak
some sell side deal got done there but jv is strong
you fucker that's my trade
i was trying to buy nines the last 0 minutes
all i got was scraps
0-0
i think it's a great trade
split connect
we need one more good shot of cool air to ensure complete and utter chaos for the next 0 months
hopefully this is it
you gotta love heffner
if we take out the jan 0 low there is no way anything bullish can happen
cute girlfriends
i'm in
cute girlfriends
i'm in
i think we would rally if march were the only thing traded
problem is summer and on out so weak
trade scale up seller of jv as it gets close to 0
some customer selling in cal 0
so h/j and j/k need to blow out because no other spread is moving
i'm a seller of j/k so h/j needs to blow
all other trade is scale up seller of that so it can move but slowly
it's a struggle each penny at this point
at least one spread needs to break if we're going to run and i don't see that happening
i think taking a cab is more convenient assuming we can find one on the way back
hey hon
had a great time last night
you're one ok chick
john
can you change deal 0
paribas
today to nymex from gas daily
can you change #0 and #0 to nymex
yea
imagine you have a gas well in the middle of west texas and you only have one pipeline running to your well
the guy who owns the pipeline can fuck you because you have no choice but to flow your gas that way
split connect means you have at least 0 options to flow your gas so the price the producer receives is more competitive and if anything happens to one pipeline you don't have to shut your gas in because you move it to another pipe
i'm going out with my brother and sime guys from work tonight
are you free saturday day and night
can you send it through lavo
he's suppose to pay for it
thanks
john
ina
can you change my meeting with sheriff's boys to tueday after 0:0 from monday
also
stick me on thedistribution for the enron press pack that has all the articles in which enron is mentioned
thanks
cast john arnold bill perkins dean theriot
trainer
dean
what's your favorite restaurant
john
why
are you trying to make valentine's day plans
dean
no
i'm ready
i've already bought a valentine's card
bill
john's ready too
he already has his valentine's hickey
liz
i have 0 tickets for destiny's child for you
they're pretty good seats
i'll put these on hold while i still try to get a box
john
the end of the season is typically the best month to hold
even if the first part of the summer is weak
people will be hesistant to sell the back half
same with the winter
that's why i'm long h0
it has good correlation with the front on up moves and tends to hold value on the down move
i am free for drinks after work but have dinner plans
it's one of those theoretically great trades
but those don't always work
still
i'll put it on and win 0 times out of 0
just so hard for the market to rally the backwardation is so weak
can easily see h going under if no weather appears
yesterday
aquilla sold march at 0.0 and 0.0 for hehub
please change it to nymex
i'll check
will change
please change as indicated
ina
can you get a small drink refrigerator for the office stocked with
water
lots
diet coke coke dr
pepper diet pepsi various fruit drinks thanks
john
i would do that
i tried calling but got your voicemail
try me at 0 0
andy
can you remove ice from mine and mike maggi's computer
also
do we have a list of who has it installed
i hate supporting our competition
john
both
i have it on dutch's machine just in case something ever pops up but it rarely does
we will open eol 0-0 on monday for everyone's trading pleasure
we've started breaking out separate p&l's
it's been a very difficult process so far for a number of reasons
the last processes will be separating out the p&l on the executive reports and on var
that will happen this week
meanwhile
the p&l will be retroactive to the start of the year and we are going through all the positions such that the total skew is zero or an adjustment will be made to get it there
at the end of the year there will be a number next to maggi's name that he will not dispute
his contribution to the fixed side when i'm on vacations or in meetings will continue to be a subjective process
looks good except for settlement period
industry standard and for ease to enron
a spread trade is treated as two separate trades
therefore
there will be two settlement periods for the respective legs of the transaction
the file below states settlement period is 0 days after both legs have been set
please change to 0 settlement periods
0 days after each respective leg has been set
john enron north america corp
michael
appreciate the idea
however
with my natural long
i'm not looking to really trade around the position
i believe ene will continue to be range bound
but in case it is not
i don't want to forgo 0% of my option premium
i have price targets of where i would like to lighten up exposure to ene and will use calls to implement the stategy
to that regards
i noticed i was not approved to sell naked calls
i would like that ability in order to hedge some exposure i have of unexercised vested options
please look into that for me
john
thank you
andy
enjoyed meeting with you
one more thing i did not address
my ultimate goal is to move all volume to eol
however
in addition to the nymex
we have about 0 other viable electronic trading systems
we make it a point to never support these if possible
we will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater than our bid
for instance
if we are 0/0 but have a strong inclination to buy and another system is at 0
i will simultaneously lift their 0's and move my market to 0/0
the lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the trade if i'm bidding 0 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade to him
people have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other systems because they will just get picked off
if they don't post numbers on the other systems
the systems get no liquidity and die
i mention this because i have heard that enron is a fairly large trader on spectron's system
i don't know whether it is in regards to gas
power
or metals
just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other traders
john
i think so in a month or so
problem now is that there is so much customer buying on any pullbacks and selling on rallies that the market
with such a flat curve
is going nowhere
that will change
but it's going to take a while
i like it eventually
that's not nice
are you free for drinks either monday or wednesday
monday it is
i'll call
kim
0 tix for rent this sat night will be waiting for you at will call at the theatre
bring id
if you have any problems call the ticket agency at 0 0 0 or me at 0 have fun
john
michael
thanks for putting the paperwork together
i would have interest in meeting if you can present unique investment opportunities that i don't have access to now
most of my contact with financial advisors in the past has consisted of them suggesting a mutual fund
telling me to invest in home depot
sun
and coke
or trying to pass off their banks
biased research reports as something valuable
the above services provide no value to me personally
if you can present opportunities such as access to private equity or hedge funds
or other ideas with strong growth potential and low correlation to the s@p
i'd listen
john
appreciate the opportunity to listen in
i was unable to view the slide show though
can you either email or mail it to me
thanks
john
yes i did
just a reminder about drinks monday night
not really
already have plans on thursday
are you going to the nymex candidate cocktail hour tuesday
he just rescheduled to wednesday
how about dinner on wednesday after that
who cares
how about drinks at 0:0 on thursday
i try not to interrupt work with personal business
i'm free all week right now
prefer early in the week
true
would prefer a stand alone button as sometimes the problem is i can't operate stack manager
i need the ability to force everybody out of the website so people don't try to click numbers that are old
on a similar topic
what's the status of the out of credit message
still a very frustrating problem for both counterparties and me
do i need to follow up with bradford about lowering sigma
grab me thursday afternoon to talk
good to hear from you
after a great f
had an okay g
held a lot of term length on the risk/reward play
figured if we got no weather
all the customer and generator buying would be my stop
it was
amazing that for the drop in price in h
the strips have really gone nowhere
just a big chop fest
i here your arguments
but think they are way exagerated
agree with 0.0-0 bcf/d more supply
call it 0 with lng
imports from canada should be negligible
now let's assume price for the summer is $0
no switching
full liquids extraction
methanol and fertilizer running
electric generation demand
considering problems in west and very low hydro
around 0.0 bcf/d greater this year with normal weather
means you have to price 0 bcf/d out of market
don't think $0 does that
what level did we start really losing demand last year
it was higher than 0
concerned about recession in industrial sector thats occuring right now
think gas is fairly valued here
dont think we're going to 0
but i think fear of market considering what happened this past year will keep forward curve very well supported through spring
we're already into storage economics so the front goes where the forward curve wants to go
forgot
i'm leaving town tomorrow afternoon
will be back thursday morn
we'll do it some other time
but that's my point
the demand destruction roared its ugly head beginning of jan
the price level was $0
of course there is a lag
let's make up a lag time
say one month
on dec 0 cash was trading $0.0
probably a similar lag on the way down
cash is $0.0 today
how much lost demand will there be in a month if we're still $0.0
million dollar question if you can answer that
ina
can you get this paid on a rush basis
industrial demand the scary thing
no question there are some steel mills and auto factories and plastics plants that were on last november that arent coming up now and its not due to gas prices
the economy sucks and it will affect ind demand
freak show
started at
0
went to
0 then
0 then finishing out
0
freak show
cash started
0 then to
0 then
0 ended
0
maybe cal 0
i would not describe him as the hardest working man in the energy business
i think this is the biggest chopfest in nat gas history
scale up seller
scale down buyer
reviewing my aga model and assumptions later today
i'll see if i have any new inspirations
are you free at 0:0 today to go over the aga model
i think you need to check your aga model
0.0 bcf/d seems awfully high
that's saying that had gas been at $0.0
the aga for the week would have been 0
look at the aga history for last week
this week and next week
do you really think the # would have been 0 with no demand destruction
it wasn't even really cold
that would have been the highest aga # of the three weeks by 0 bcf
our guys are thinking 0.0 bcf/d
pira is saying that feb as a whole averages 0.0-0 bcf/d
that's just destruction and does not include new production
if any
further pira estimates that march destruction will be about half of feb
assuming that gets to equilibrium
0 bcf/d demand destruction
0 bcf/d more production
0 bcf/d more gas generation demand
start with a 0 b deficit and 0 injection days gets you to flat against last years storage in current price environment
i think we are fairly priced fundamentally
but with huge customer imbalance for hedging from buy side
surprises in the market right now are to the upside in my view
course hard to imagine $0 for j
just sell vol
are you around next tuesday
so according to your analysis
had we been at $0.0 gas and we were not bordering on a recession
we would have had the highest aga number of recorded history for this week
last week
or next week by 0 bcf
seems a little far fetched to me
our analysis is saying
gas at 0.0 we would have had 0.0 bcf a day more demand
that includes commercial residential industrial switching processing
as far as 0 bcf/d power gen demand
that counts the fact that last year was extremely mild versus expectation of normal summer this year
west will be running every gas unit virtually all hours as power demand is growing maybe 0% still and hydro way down
every molecule that can will flow west from waha this summer versus little last year
east power prices really havent reached point of priceing out demand and heat rates healthy enough to where gas can go up without raising power prices to cut demand
some concern of more efficient replacing less but hard to quantify
we're trying to build the stack now to estimate
frac margins now positive for all but most inefficient processors
will continue coming back
a little concerned about 0 oil prices
bordering right there now for places like florida and actually saw fl demand rise 0,0 last week as gas got to parity
let me look into inj capability
definitely bigger when field is empty from engineering standpoint so any problems really wont arise until fall when gen demand low and inj capacity lower
my initial thoughts
bo seems as neutral as everyone else in the market right now
really inactive
to clarify
not raging bull
i like everybody want to see what the inj numbers in april look like
nobody putting a position on until that starts to clarify
just think that hedging demand is making market a little short right now making next move up more likely
would be scale up seller though not really sure why cash trades at 0-0 back
doesnt make any sense
however as more fields start turning around throughout month
the stg arb to great in my opinion to keep spread there
must close one way or the other
notice that spread tightened to 0-0 towards end of trading friday
in general think that gas is reaching the elasticity stage right here
0 cents lower and no switching
no processing
and gain back some demand
market needs to see some big stg numbers first
i think the best play right now is to start buying longer term put spreads
jan 0/0.0 look great to me
if we get back to 0.0 and don't match last year's early weather
bombs away
so my point shown a little bit right now
weather a little cooler for this week
overall normal for 0-0
jv up 0 cents
think just as customers got totally fucked last year selling into the rally
they are going to buy all the way down
differnence is last year trade very happy to take in all the length
this year trade not ready to get really short
not until healthy inj in april anyways
i think money from here will be made being short
just question of what and when
think there'll be enough hedging demand to keep curve very strong unless phys market just totally rejects price level
with amount of inj capacity available
hard to believe phys market is going to dictate prices for next couple months
i think it will be spec and hedgers dictating
spec staying on sidelines right now and hedgers buying
leads to more upside potential in short term
my point in v/x was that jv would be strong and cal0 hedging was from sell side leading to pressure on those spreads
the california term power sales have totally changed that
before
the only thing customers were selling was cal 0
now
customer interest much more from buyside in cal 0,0 solely from california
now turning neutral v/x and x/z
you have very valid points
i like q/v more though
i think you could have 0 cents of upside in that with little downside
thoughts
dinner or drinks tonight
probably because jeff's out
but let's go ahead and have it
yes
please change griffith to trading
thanks
john
not impressive
i ordered 0 different things
i thought your
wine inventory listings are updated daily
hard to believe
huh
no real bias today positive numbers sell negative numbers buy
looking into other stuff
theres only one thing i can think of
storage field turning around gives cash market completely different feel
instead of utilities looking to sell gas everday
they look to buy it
huge difference in feel of mrket
not so much actual gas but completely different economics of how marginal mmbtu gets priced
tightening cash market causes cash players to buy futures
hence the tendency for a spring rally every year
read heffner today
even he talks about it
what it's trading what i think it's really worth obviously most bearish the further out you go
however
the game right now is not sell and hold
although it will be soon
the game is where will it be tomorrow and next week and next month
the market is structurally short term gas thanks to our friends from california
where ca is buying power
williams and calpine and dynegy dont care of the gas costs 0 or 0 or 0 or 0
irrelevant
so term is not going down in the short term unless the front comes into the 0's and scares some producers to start hedging or we or el paso can find fixed price lng to the tune of 0,0 a day for 0 years
i loved them in that i thought they were going to go up
i think they still might 0 weeks ago now short term very bullish neutral medium term neutral neutral longer term neutral bearish
i dont know sounds good to me
any reaction to this
i think jv strip prices to where we price out enough demand to get to 0.0
whther that price level is 0 or 0 is arguable
i think it's close to here
but when we get to november and we have 0.0 and don
t repeat the weather of this past winter and we have 0.0 bcf more supply and people realize that we have 0.0 bcf to withdraw before there are any problems
bombs away
confused
what are you disagreeing with me in regards to demand destruction
it was almost worth buying a ticket
just a vicious rumor
my birthday's not till next year
how about benjys
what are you doing tonight
what are you doing tonight
very funny today
during the free fall
couldn't price jv and xh low enough on eol
just kept getting cracked
when we stabilized
customers came in to buy and couldnt price it high enough
winter versus apr went from +0 cents when we were at the bottom to +0 when april rallied at the end even though it should have tightened theoretically
however
april is being supported just off the strip
getting word a lot of utilities are going in front of the puc trying to get approval for hedging programs this year
sorry
have no idea
houston would be easy ireland kinda tough
heffner a little bullish
eh
agree with contango story
cash to futures pretty bullish but a picture where agressive inj now are bearish later
so curve should flatten
also back of curve
cal0,0
under a lot of pressure now
customers will be buying all the way down and will get fucked just like last year
contango has been under considerable pressure even with the front falling
any rally should result in those snapping in to 0
good scalp in my opinion
definitely seeing your side on the $0 level
surprised we havent gotten more demand back as we sit at these lower levels
off to cabo today for a long weekend
kind of exhausted at work right now so a much needed break
so argument more switching than outright lost demand
where are petro prices on a comparable equivalence
i have a very pretty back of the head cash went out around 0-0 back yesterday
today it is 0 back right now bo trying to sell j/k at 0.0 on the open
cash goes out trading +0 to +0 j/k a piece
remove me from your email list
on friday
will there be a private reception or area for us or will our customers get lost in the crowd
probably thinking 0 invites for friday
is that ok
dinner this week
i'm free mon-wed
just got it today
thanks
you'll be happy to know i get my car back today
wanna bring me back to work
heffner how
was pretty long coming into today just playing the range
sold everything on the way up
will be s scale up seller probably through options
certainly a short squeeze in trade today and i don
t think anything changes tomorrow except maybe trade gets more confident in the short at the higher level andif cash rejects higher prices
will be buying lots of puts on the way up so i guess for me vol is not toohigh
i was short vol and covered it all this morn
think we could be infor some turbulence here
andy
good to hear
there continue to be a proliferation of new systems coming online in the us
two more start in the next two months
we are pretty close to finalizing a plan to open our system to everyone in terms of accepting limit orders and posting best bid/offer regardless of whose it is
in this framework
enron would sleeve credit for free should two third parties be matched on our system
however
we would hold the book
getting to see what everyone was doing at all times
the idea is that if we can move the industry's order flow from 0-0% eol to 0% eol
we get a huge information advantage in addition to a couple trading advantages
namely we have first priority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by a counterparty before us and second
we posess a proprietary stack manager that will allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than our competitors
still working on technical issues
the decision to open eol markets would be done on a product by product basis
give me a call if you want to discuss
looks good
certainly an area we need more focus on
obviously the most important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in
what is that relative to last year
and what new capacity is coming longer term
as an aside
nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year and five year averages
it would be very useful if all fundamental analysis were geared the same way
the fact that lng shipments are x this week is meaningless
the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely useful
if you noticed in the fundies meeting
i was trying to move discussion that way
what's switching vis a vis last year
whats production relative to last year
it simplifies the fundamental analysis
debbie
if you have availability for either session
please sign me up
i was unsure i would be able to attend until now
hence the late notice
thanks
john enron north america corp
seeing no increase in physical demand from industrials
however
they cantbuy enough paper
energy customer deal flow has a conspicuous habit of buying high and selling low
seeing virtually no producer selling
stripwill continue to be well supported through early spring
last year customers sold all the way up
transferring their price risk to marketers and specs
market for most part was very orderly move up during the summer
volatilitwas in the pukes because everybody was long
now
customers are all buyingmove down should be orderly as is met with a lot of short covering from trade and volatility should come from short covering moves like today's
market waiting to see those first two injection numbers
if we are beatinglast year by 0 bcf
lights out
move down may also scare producers to dosome term selling
putting pressure on whole curve
do you have interest in having a semi formal party at the guggenheim for our ny counterparties
was thinking it might be a good pr move
how bout today at 0
sure
yes but getting haircut until 0
is it too dark then
hey
recounted
can i get 0-0 invites and would need formal invites for friday
confirm
please add
maybe a drink after work
we ahave not initiated a 0/0 gas product yet but are creating the capabilities to launch at some point in the near future
just when i'm turning really bearish you're starting to turn bullish on me
weather to me relatively unimportant
yes
it will leave us with 0 bcf or so less in storage than if we had mild weather
i think it is masking a major demand problem
think what the aga numbers would be with moderate weather
when we get into injections
i think we'll see a big push down
spec and trade seem bearish but hesitant to get short
customer buying still strong
thus even with the demand picture becoming clearer
we haven't moved down
however i think when the picture becomes clearer
i.e.-when we start beating last year's injections by 0 bcf a week
trade will get short
customers very unsophistocated
the story they keep telling us is we're coming out 0 bcf less than last year
thus the summer has to be strong
when we start inj
customers will start seeing other side of story
pira finally came out this week and said stop buying
to me
the mrkt just a timing issue
i want to be short before the rest of the idiots get short
i continue buying m,f puts
projecting k to settle 0 and m 0
yea
i think the two dumps in the market are when everybody realizes the loss of demand
which is in the first 0 inj numbers
customer buying and fear about the summer will keep may at a decent level
if my theory holds
eventually that wont be enough to hold the market up and m pukes
second puke is in the winter when 0th quarter production is 0-0% on y/y basis
demand still weak
economic weakness isn't a 0 month problem
industry realizes that not only is it ok to get to 0-0 bcf in march but you should
and early winter weather will not match 0
we develop large y/y surplus in x and z
z futures hold up because some risk premium still exists for rest of winter
by late december
just trying to find a home for gas
think decent chance f futures finish with a 0 handle
mike
which one of the hedge funds closes today
yes i dont know
both have their merits
where are you getting those numbers
will call you tonight
thanks
i'll check it out
kim
can i get 0 tix for the following games
apr 0 or 0 vs
st louis jun 0 vs texas jun 0 vs texas thanks
john
as long as i own enron stock
the desks are my colleagues
feel free to share the info with hunter and chris
wow
what a week so far
beauty of a short squeeze early on
even some of the biggest bears i know were covering to reestablish when the market lost its upward momentum
unfortunately
my boat is too big to play that way
takes too long to put the size of the position i manage on or off to play that game
just had to sit back and take my lumps
couldnt have been a more bearish aga # in my opinion
got one more decent one and then watch out below
amazing that we've had more demand destruction recently
the economy is the 0 pound gorilla that is sitting on nat gas and it aint getting up
i understand you are out of one of the wines
please fill remaining order
thanks
john
thanks
ina
can you set up a 0 minute mtg with me and all of the assistants and runners in regards to what we discussed this week
in regards to gas
what signals do you for in determining your view
what resources do you use to formulate a price view
give example of complex transaction you've structured for a customer
where is storage now relative to history
what is the highest and lowest level we've been at in past 0 years
what are your short
medium
and long term views of gas market
what major basis changes have occured in the market over the past 0 years
what do you expect in the next 0
how should a storage operator decide whether or not to inject on any given day
in regards to derivatives in order of difficulty what are delta/gamma/theta
if you buy a put spread
is your delta positive
negative
or zero
is swap price equal to simple average of futures contracts
if interest rates go up what happens to option prices all else equal
what is the value of a european $0 call expiring in 0 months if corresponding futures are trading $0
what happens to delta of an option if volatility increase
fyi
bo is a big put buyer and fence seller today
though he is trying to defend j
you're right though
it seems like bo and i are always on the opposite side of each other
i may have some u0 tix for tonight
wanna go
no not necessarily
just sick of her at the moment
i've realized i'm too old to stay up til 0 on a school night
are you in for the game
congrats
thought you were headed to aig
how long til you get to short natty again
i talked to fred today
i think he's in so lets assume it's a go
when is the last day to cancel and get our money back
unfortunately
mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do
the question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of correcting for violations of the black scholes model
in my mind
there are three big reasons for skew
one is that the assumption of stochastic volatility as a function of price level gets violated
commodities tend to have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and elasticity of the demand curve
nat gas tends to be relatively stable when we are in that historical pricing environment
however
moving to a different pricing regime tends to bring volatility
an options trader wants to be long vol outside the trading range
believing that a breakout of the range leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium
supports a vol smile theory
in addition
in some commodities realized vol is a function of price level
nat gas historically is more volatile at $0 than at $0 and more volatile at $0 than $0
thus there has been a tendency for all calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative skew
the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off in a declining market and increase in a rising market
to test
regress 0 day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation
second reason is heptocurtosis
fatter tails than lognormal distribution predicts
supports vol smile theory
easy to test how your market compares by plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected distribution
third
is just supply and demand
in a market where spec players are bearish
put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance premium to add incremetal risk to the book
if you have a neutral view towards market
or believe that market will come off but in an orderly fashion
enron can take advantage of our risk limits by selling more expensive insurance
crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak call skew as customer business in options is nearly all one way
producer fences
if you believe vol is stochastic in the region of prices where the fence strikes are
can be profitable to take other side of trade
if you want to discuss further give me a call 0-0 pm houston time
hope this helps
john
maybe
hydro situation dire in west
think water levels are at recent historical lows
problem is from gas standpoint
west is an island right now
every molecle that can go there is
so will provide limited support to prices in east
hydro in east is actually very healthy
would assume your markets are targeting eastern u.s
so i dont know if hydro problem in west is that relevant
please add
good to hear
met john galperin today
give me a call soon to dicuss how to most effectively use the line
planning on going
which night are you inviting guys for
also
heard there were some issues about contract negotiations
don't know specifics but if you want to discuss give me a call
might be able to mediate this a little bit if you want
mike
two questions regarding fees
0
what will you charge for placement fee on a 0,0-0,0,0 type investment into the hedge funds
0
i understand your cost structure is a little higher than fidelity
however
i was charged over $0,0 on my option trade for a transaction that fidelity charges $0.0
is there any justification
please understand that my basis for developing an account with paine webber is dependent upon an agressive fee structure
i don't want to see my above-market returns compromised by high fees
thanks
john
i read this as though 0.0 bcf/d of more switching takes place in the summer versus today
is that because of the forward curves are backwardated for 0 and contango for natty
do you still have the magazine and if so can you send it to me
arrive some time friday night
leave some time sunday
are the diamonds still available for tonight's game
assuming we're driving the car to dallas tomorrow after work
assume we're driving the 0 up to mom this friday after work
got tix for tonight
good to me
get prices for the different types of rooms
agree
what's your view of crude from here over next 0-0 weeks
took the wrong checkbook to work friday
will call your courier on monday hopefully
john
hey
just wondering if you're still up for sailing lessons and if you've found out anything
fuck you
yes
australia definitely sounds cool
might be a little tough though
i'd be in for keemah if you want to do that
i went to get the tix this morn and couldnt get them
i'll probably go to dinner
sorry
looks good to me
have you sent for materials yet
may = 0 the rest is the same
0.0
but yea
what kind of odds
the market is saying it's 0:0 chance
i'm saying there is a much better chance than that
i think it's 0:0
the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 0 or so bcf less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks
so yea
my curve is a touch higher
but it doesnt change my longer term view
most of the move this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat market
a little concerned about heat
but also saw products very strong going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure
not convinced this rally in products is different
dave
i need a favor
i'm trying to create an internal only cal 0 product for our power guys
product controls is saying it will take a week from monday to get it created
any way to speed it up
average volume is 0,0-0,0 on nymex of which about half is spreads
so around 0,0 outrights trade
we trade more than that on eol
today's conditions 0 lot market would be 0-0 cents wide
have executed trades as large as 0,0 across a longer term and 0 lot clips in the front frequently
the implied market on that from put spreads is 0.0:0
i'll take 0:0
that's all the juice i'll pay
i dont remember if we fixed these yet
fuck you
fuck you
fuck you
eat my shorts
schedule 0 min to sit down with me either mon or tues after 0
if you want to get info
sending out an email survey is not the right way
much easier to respond to a question in voice rather than typing it out
fuck you
fuck you
fuck you
eat my shorts
i'll take 0:0 this morning
fuck you
the 0 mm loss was due to a booking mistake that could not be corrected before the books were posted and is being corrected tonight
i'll take 0:0 this morning
fuck you
mike
just want to confirm you received my money and forms
also
checking to see if i am set up to sell naked calls on ene
may be looking to do something this week
probably 0-0 contracts
john
that's what i'm talking about
that's what i'm talking about
i really need the docs on both phantom stock and options
please please please john
please send it to me
john
mike
please resend the forms needed although i may have sent the necessary docs with the courier that delivered the check
do not believe we've seen the worst yet
will not be looking to put more money to work on the long only side for a while
even with the rally today i do not believe we've seen the worst yet
please send it to me
john
you think i'm going to put this in ellectronic form
no way
you think i'm going to put this in ellectronic form
no way
do you mind if i go out with the boys from work tonight
hello
i noticed you carried several of the 0 zoom zins
any chance you have the 0 year old vines version
please advise
john
do you mind if i go out with the boys from work tonight
fuck you
fuck you
yes
yes
awfully close
thanks a lot
can you send jean a list of her seat numbers
my numbers from mar 0
would raise jun-augy by 0 cents because of the supportive weather we had from mar 0-apr 0
awfully close
thanks a lot
can you send jean a list of her seat numbers

don't know
some industrial shutdown is not gas price dependent
some will not come back at the same prices it went off
residential conservation i think is underestimated and has a severe lag effect that will not come back as prices fall
as far as switching i dont think #0 is the floor some people think it is
maybe #0 is the floor
0
you know my outlook for xh
with slightly above normal weather jan goes out at 0.0 and that is not constrained by a #0 floor
next jv
too far away to really run the numbers but think natty reestablishes itself as a $0.0-0.0 commodity
0
the obvious 0
yes
believe if we end at 0.0 in the ground
the current nymex forward curve may be fairly priced
my belief is that at the current prices we will end up with much more than 0.0 and that $0 is not value if we have 0.0 in the ground and gaining y on y
circular argument that leads to my belief that prices must fall
0
not necessarily
will loss of demand with normal weather cancel the fact that there will be much less demand destruction
probably
are we first
if not
when does the road show start and/or when does the basic theme get distributed around the industry
sure
how about thursday at 0:0
would like to get update on ene's lng projects as well
may be looking to sell some naked calls soon
can you check that i would be approved to sell 0 of either 0 or 0's expiring somewhere between jul-jan
also
if i sell naked calls with a tenor of more than one year that expire worthless
do the gains get counted as lt cap gains
sure
any interest in accompanying me to maggi's bd party sat nite
sure
any interest in accompanying me to maggi's bd party sat nite
check this out
check this out
can you get me the number of our contact at the delano
i have a personal favor to ask them
john
would like to meet to review to make sure i understand
may only take a couple minutes
are you free at 0 on tuesday
jean
i think the location i talked about before is actually better for you
the area towards the edge of the building borders the northeast gas group
long-term originators
and mid-market orig group
not exactly who you need to be around
the location in the center is much closer to the east gulf group
specifically sandra
and the same distance to the central and texas trading groups
most importantly
it provides room for both your group and the trading group to expand
call me if you want to talk further
thanks for the article
john
can you take care of this
my email as far as i know is jarnold@enron.com
not on msn though
i made space for your 0 people as well as ferries
roberts
and the other person
you requested
come down tomorrow and i'll show you the layout again
john
remind jim how the h/j/k spread acted this year
granted it won't behave that way again until close to expiry
but i like the j/k outright much moreso than the condor
can you take care of this
stranger
any interest in getting a drink or dinner tuesday
havent seen you in forever
no
almost forgot about you
will take care of
we'll keep you guys together close to the traders
no
jeff
to explain the p&l of
0,0
we executed the trade when you gave the order
the delta anyway
first thing in the morning
the market rallied 0 cents from the morning
with the back rallying about 0.0 cents
on 0 pv contracts
curve shift was
0,0
the balance
$0,0
is almost exactly $.0 bid/mid
which i think is pretty fair considering the tenor of the deal and that it included price and vol
cal 0 straddles
for instance
are $0.0
$0.0
looking out for you bubbeh
john
do you know what my user id and password are
yes i will
this is my idea of vacation
will see you there
most probably
only if you promise to post regular updates on the trucking market
call chris gaskill to get the password
absolutely
though i'm not sure how you do it
call chris gaskill and he should be abl to help
do you know what my user id and password are
i like that feeling
as long as someone doesnt punch you in the gut
i'm going to san antonio at lunch today to play soccer so i just took the day off
catching up on 0 weeks of email
i know how to relax don't i
yes i will
this is my idea of vacation
hey adam
sorry for the delay
just been very busy
congrats on joining enron
think you made the right chioce
i would recommend structuring
it's a good way to understand how enron works
how we look at and manage risk
and you get close to the trading component
a friend of mine
ed mcmichael runs the gas structuring group
try emiling him probably at emcmich@enron.com
keep in touch
john
will see you there
most probably
your guys are probably seeing this as well
but
0 cents higher our customer biz was 0/0 from buy side
now it's 0/0
can almost smell blood among the producers
only problem is trade is sooooo short they cant see straight
were the market still not so fundamentally overvalued right now i'd be looking for a 0 cent move up
just can't see that happening at this level though
none
that night i had so much brain damage i couldnt function
as opposed to
jennifer
i don't think we have much interest in doing this interview since it primarily pertains to our views of the market
i would speak in such generalities that it probably wouldn't be a good interview
john
none
i guess i have to keep my 0 price target
just nothing bullish in the near term except crude
and that's not enough now
need to get to a new price regime to pick up more demand quickly
wanna get sauced after work
is that with or without two snoozes
how about we celebrate the near completion of your deal and have tickleless pay for it
maybe we need a closer in that seat
drinks on tickleknees if you do
you i guess
i'm just kidding
i'm getting a haircut from 0-0
i'll call you when i get out
is there a password or just knowing the address
wanna get sauced after work
is that with or without two snoozes
maybe we need a closer in that seat
drinks on tickleknees if you do
you i guess
is there a password or just knowing the address
it's an aquired taste
maybe they're for more sophisticated palates
hot like wasabi when i bust rhymes big like leann rimes because i'm all about value
i think the velocity of the down move will be much less severe from here
still dont think this is equilibrium
need to see aga coming in lower than expectations for a couple weeks signaling that we've moved down the demand curve
think a lot of spec shorts are looking to take profits as we get close to the psychological 0 target
market needs producer selling to get us through there
have seen some as williams is starting to hedge barrett
hence the weakness in the back of the curve recently
still going lower but it will be a tougher move from here
i couldnt do it
it took 0 minutes for my alarm to wake me up
it's an aquired taste
maybe they're for more sophisticated palates

for extra credit
if the company is worth 0% more under management a rather than 0% more
does your answer change
appreciate the offer but i won't be able to get out of work
david
do you have a simulation set up that will allow me to simulate trades by pushing a buy or sell button and will move the two way so i can try simulating actual market cicumstances
i need significant lead time to prepare for boots day
please advise earlier next time
no crap
what's your bid
rules to a game
you flip a coin
if you get tails you win 0
if you get heads
i give you $0
keep flipping until you get a tails
at which point you walk away with the money
however
each heads you get after the first you double your money
so if you flip heads 0 times and then tails
you get $0
what's you bid/offer on playing this game
would you pay $.0 to play
$0
$0
what you charge me play against you
and your offer
me thinks you missed a 0
have you taken any finance courses yet
what's good
fill in
are you prepared to defend your answer
yes
no
i think its a jv with the trading side mostly staffed by goldman folks
i think it's 0
= infinity
probability * payout
don't make me type the math on the computer pooks
huh
yea
appreciate the offer but i won't be able to get out of work
kim
i will not be at the may 0 management mtg as i will be in ny on business
no crap
what's your bid
and your offer
me thinks you missed a 0
have you taken any finance courses yet
what's good
fill in
are you prepared to defend your answer
yes
no
i think its a jv with the trading side mostly staffed by goldman folks

probability * payout
don't make me type the math on the computer pooks
most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's psychological $0 price target and that everybody and their dog is still short
next sellers need to be from producer community
saw a little this week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats indicative of the rest of the e&p community
short covering rallies will get more common here
velocity of move down has slowed significantly for good
except maybe in bid week
my concern is if we go to $0 and people want to cover some shorts
who's selling it to them
might feel a lot like it did when we were trying to break $0
huh
yea

you doing anything tonight
too bad about pavel
everybody liked him
who's next in line
i felt fine
i ate a breakfast bar before i went
normally dont do that
wont be doing that again
wanna do something tonight
what time do you get out of here
yea
we'll get them for you
when are you getting out
we've got reservations in the chathambarsinn.com

poolie
what's the value of the company to you
that's what it gets for being a cat
for what it's worth
i liked your answer to the california attorney general comment in the journal
what a freak that guy is
i snoozed from 0:0 to 0:0
it was great
how about 0:0
are you on msn messenger
i think i'm set up with it
i think i've got yahoo somewhere on my computer
i'll try to find it
expecting 0 today
still think we're not at fundamental equilibrium but scared that
as much as i hate technicals
the wave 0 is over and we can do some serious chop here
if we didnt have expiry in 0 days i'd be worried about a short covering rally
however
i think the market is going to have a hard time placing the baseload gas this month
the storage guys are all above their targets right now and expect them to back off relative to last month
seeing very little buying from end users
some longer term selling from producers
have had one guy who sold about 0 month cal 0,0,0
just gets soaked up in the market though
some buying is from more generation guys
duke bot 0,0+ lots of cal 0-0 last week
also think some guys buying cal 0 so they can sell more in the front
el paso sold delta equivalent of probably 0-0 a day yesterday
got soaked right up
mar/apr way overvalued but so hard to bring in
just a function of cal 0
cal 0 been weak as seen a lot of m/m q/q v/v spreads recently
guys trying to buy the front
hard to believe m/m is flat
just goes to show how overpriced cal 0 is in my mind
sure
can you get her tickets to one of the games
me thinks you both are a little imbalanced
of course
info here goes nowhere
we've had trouble discerning where the switching takes place because the economics get very blurry
credits
ldc costs
transport
taxes
restrictions on # hours plants can burn resis are hard to account for and are different for everybody
also some noneconomic factors
convenience
inertia
multi-month fuel purchases
hedges
accounting procedures
resid in storage already
it's a big blur in my mind
i look at general levels and for anecdotal evidence
have seen zero anecdotal evidence so far
will also watch aga's for the indication
but so will everybody else
putting on your shirt to go to the bathroom in the dark
what's tomorrow
i'll get it changed
yes
i'm leaving at 0:0 today
from saturday-monday
did 0 trades
exactly half internal
how'd george do
biggest question in my mind is we assume resid is a fixed target or if resid needs to keep market share and as natty drops so does resid to maintain its market
relaxed
how was it
maybe
i don't even remember anymore
the numbers are running together
best of all
reduced my risk 0% today
i think i had better weather in massachusetts than you had in mexico
very relaxing though
if i lived in the northeast and had 0.0 kids and 0.0 dogs i would definitely get a summer house around there
i called and you were off the desk
jan 0-dec 0 settled a little high at 0.0
referencing a bid of 0.0 on the strip
we are 0.0/0 on the $0 call
$0,0
they're not shy
misti
i assume you are responsible for publishing the management reports
i cannot access these reports past may 0
have they been published since then and if so
any idea why i can't get them
crazy day
this day took a week off my life
plans tonight
yea
for now at least
we'll run it until a hurricane emerges overnight and i get run over for 0 cents
liz
are any of the diamonds available for jun 0-0
no idea
thanks
i'll be there today
hey babe
any chance there are copies of the nightline and/or frontline shows lying around
definitely did
you have to be a pretty boring person to not have fun in south beach
looks fine to me
john
agree
still not at supply/demand equilibrium
unfortunately
market lacks a catalyst for sharp move down from here until bid week
i think continue to see slow erosion
think we are slowly running out of places to put gas
discretionary storage guys have their belly full
can see cash/futures just keep widening from here
q/v spread
even though it widens every day
still has a long way to go
think you get to v and there is nowhere to put the gas
could see v/x going to 0+
i buy every cantango spread i can
when market moves up the winter goes 0 for 0
when the market goes down you make money
strongest product in the gas market are nymex futures
everything else is a bloodbath
socal basis has gone from $0 to $0 in the past month
canadian storage balances are ridiculous
imports are going to blow away last year
new lng coming in late novy
rig count is like open interest
a straight line up
gas is behaving very price inelastic
just like it did on the move from $0 to $0 last year
see little hope
h/j is the craziest spread on the board
it is not a fundamentally priced spread though
for several reasons
the industry uses that spread primarily to link the front of the board to the back
think the front will keep drifting lower and the back will find some customer buy support as we get cal 0 down to 0.0 ish
thus
h/j has to come in
i think
plus i have the fundamentals on my side
come on up this afternoon around 0
send
tomorrow's fine
did you call
are you going to tell me or do i have to guess
second
third
and fourth that
please delete previous message
it was meant for david oxley
liz
wondering if you've had any luck in securing tix for this saturday's game
also
are the diamonds available for jun 0
thanks
john
not after today
late night yesterday
i told you we should have sold cal 0-0 yesterday
yea
i interviewed him
i gave him a thumbs up
why do you ask
my plan worked
kim
at the start of the year
i requested tix for this friday's and sunday's games
just checking to see if they have my name on them
no
but i didnt even know you guys were going
any thoughts about next weekend
i still want to go somewhere
this is killing me
how about south america or is it too far
take me off your list
heard of it but not sure exactly what it is
here she is
the deal got booked to oil-ng-hedge-spec
it should have been booked to in-upstream-st***
that resulted in an error in my position as well
where did you get this info from
have not seen the generators who hedged before selling out
mostly just seen calpine selling
pooks if you get this call me
the way i read it was the 0 something contract signed are good but ones under negotiation from there are either being renegotiated or talks terminated
i cant commit
i'm 0/0 so say no
will send bat on next continental flight
it was fine this morn
starting back up today
funner than provincetown
lots of producer selling cal 0 and front strong so h/j still blowing out
no
they were just good sellers in the cals
irregardless of the rally in the front this morn
cal 0 didnt move
i thought i was joining you
because i am so kind

kid how
interested in a night of pizza
wine
us soccer
and belize planning tonight
screw the english jersey
just wear red
cost about 0,0-0,0 our internal estimates were in the 0-0 range
so no
i think pira overestimating the gas gen burn for the week
problem is there is no real good burn for at least two weeks going forward
we've dropped $0.0 in a couple months and havent picked up an mmbtu of demand
that's a big problem
at some point it has to or we're going to shut-in economics
that may be the answer
economy starts looking better when energy costs fall 0-0%
prompt month vol is moving from 0% to 0% cob today
should increase capacity for front month by 0% for anybody who wants them
wanna get toasted tonight
i guarantee it
you're not still pulling that leg thing
are you
we don't work out again until wednesday
i'm going to run to needless markup real fast
that have a big sale starting today
if you don''t want to go
i'll pick you up after
0 minutes
let me think about it for a day
can you give access to the fundies site to margaret allen 0-0 thanks
john
what
where is that
i have no interest
quickly running out of places to put gas
at least appetite to put gas in storage at same rate
need some supply/demand dynamics to change else price $0 is no resistance
how is subscription rate going for eol versus our expectations
sure
send it over
as the investing contrarian i am
if everybody else is getting out of late-stage vc
i'll take a look
i don't have a problem with that
the 0 factors i ask in releasing info are
0
do customers even know the info is available or useful
0
is the info publicly available
0
is the info easily obtainable
in this case
the answer is yes to all three
so i don't care
if the answer is no to one or more of the above
a judgment call has to be made
hey
haven't spoken to you in a while
let's get a drink sometime soon
i'm taking a week and a half off starting july 0 but after that
maybe we can go a astros game
congrats on connor
hope everything is well

what's you're new phone #
kim

john
kim
can i get mark's on the jul 0 and john's on sep 0 and 0
thanks
john
just calling to see if you have anything ingenious to say about this market
i've covered most of the shorts starting 0.0 all the way down
agree market probably not at equilibrium just dont really want to press it right now
the easy money's been made
want to have a few bullets just in case hot weather or storm takes this thing up to $0.0
selling some upside calls just in case that never happens i'll still make money
been an incredible run so far
have half a mind to pack things up and go on vacation for the rest of year
however
i'm just doing it for a week and a half starting tomorrow
will talk to you when i get back and we'll figure out what to do then
he's going to start trading a cross commodity vol book
concentrate mainly on gas and power
maybe some weather and products
identifying any high risk/reward longer term vol trades we should be doing
he'll be sitting with and reporting to me
director
it's going to take complete rejection of phys molecules to get solidly under $0
i expect some really good chop for 0 weeks
have enough people waiting for sub $0 to buy back all their shorts
don't think it's that easy from here
puts i assume
for what months
take-out
wine
and movie
yes
how bout i bring it
how about you get the food
i'll get the movie and wine
my suggestion is something from central market but i'm easy
john
here is my analysis of my guys
mike maggi
0
p@l for first half a bit misleading
up till today
he has run and taken the p&l for 0 days
0 days were in the first half of the year and 0 in july so far
running eol is a law of averages
some days you get killed some you do well
the second day he got massacred
t boone sold 0 contracts as well as the floor selling on an illiquid day followed by gap down the next day
p&l for that day was
$0
the four days in july have been really good
probably +$0-0
so i look at his p&l for the first half of the year as jan 0-jul 0
that p&l of $0 is around my expectations
runs low var
pretty good at running eol when i'm not there
a little too reactionary but hopefully more experience will help
makes most money in market making
probably slighlty negative in greeks and negative in curve shift
would like for him to turn both of those positive
a bit hadicapped because present format doesnt allow him to fully get physical info
required to spend all time in front of computer
needs to develop john griffith to allow him to get off the desk more
good contrarian trader
often has opposite position of floor
willing to stop out and is nimble
needs to take more of a macro view of vol rather than ending up with everybody
elses positions
vital for me to have him as a bbackup right now
cannot function without one of us on the desk
computer causing problems
will email with other guys later
any chance you can go to the game tonight
i've got the good ones
interest in diamonds tonight
anybody want four good tix to tonight's baseball game

did api's indicate that there may have been switching from resid back to gas
0
did the 0 crude traders that left quit or get fired
under new rules instituted this year by commissioner bud selig
an umpire can automatically eject a pitcher if he believes he's throwing at a batter
he does not have to issue a warning before an ejection
fletcher did not warn mann for hitting gonzalez or cordova
the umpire said bartolo threw the ball at his head and that's an automatic ejection
said manuel
but the ball missed his head by three feet
it tipped off his bat
colon said he wasn't trying to hit servais
i will protect my teammates
said colon
speaking through bullpen coach/interpreter luis isaac
i can hit anyone i want at any time
that's why i feel bad
i wasn't trying to hit him
the ball slipped
fryman defended his pitcher
at no point
do i approve of throwing at someone's head
said fryman
but that pitch did not surprise anyone in the ballpark
bartolo should not have been ejected
there should have been an immediate warning to each bench
i took a week and a half off during the same time that bo collins of el paso left so naturally i am going to el paso
i'm not going anywhere unfortunately
i'm in for july 0 if you've got them
i have no good thoughts about the market
everybody wants it to go down to 0.0 so i covered my short at 0-0
cash very strong at these lower levels with some gen load
should act to flatten curve as good producer selling in back
playing range and selling vol
think aga may surprise lower than expectations
had phone problems
lost my charger
it was good
i may be the most influential in the world of finance in the past 0 years
those certainly were the good ole days
i really have no idea
probably lower just becasue of the trend and overwhelming bearish view of the market
what happened to you last night
couldnt get ahold of you on your cell
flat
i had my lowest var in over a year this morning
that's fine
the later the better but definitely after 0:0
i'm big seller of interventions
they tend not to work
if the gas market wants to go lower
enron coming out and buying 0,0 contracts is not going to stop the market from going down
maybe in the short term
but that's it
same with currencies
ecb can come out and transfer some of its foreign reserves from dollars to euros
but they are limited by their currency reserves unless they want to act in the futures market at which point they have to exit that position at some point
i think it is more psychological than anything
i think overall market interventions have been extremely ineffective
remind me of that bet again
me thinks the currency market has seen enough failed interventions that it shrugs off any intervention and may view it as a sign of weakness
me also thinks that until foreigners quit plowing all their money into the us the dollar should remain fairly strong
however
if all the hedge funds are short which i assume they would be
the turnaround will be very quick
how about your local bank
selective memory maybe
if you're around stop by around 0-0 today to talk about all this stuff
big plans tonight
with
yea
talk to john griffith about getting this info
if you want to get a sense of my position
stop by monday afternoon
i didnt mean to get so run over
yet his price forecast from last week is 0.0ish for next summer
is that the struggle between bullish next summer but coming out of the winter with a lot of gas in the ground
what's your longer term 0-0 month view of heat
thinking about buying against short natty for next summer
think trade reluctant to sell here until they see aga on wednesday and knowing that tropical activity will develop at some point
however
think the failure from 0 last thursday will weigh on people
think that nobody wants to own above 0
only as very short term trade to sell to someone else 0-0 cents higher unless aga is very bullish
if the number last week was right
then that looks possible
however
0 weeks ago the # came out higher than everybody thought so all the models were jacked up
aga is certainly much better than the api but still cant put too much into one number
not really
i actually don't think the market's going to move too much even though the range of expectations is huge
there are enough people on the sidelines to mute a move either way
me thinks below but won't really move until closer to expiry
i'm just here to do my job and not worry about prestige
or something
i probably would have told you within the first 0 months
hey
surprised to hear from you
jeff is in charge of nat gas operations and reports to sally beck who is in charge of all back office ops
as of this morn
he is still here
i've heard some wacky enron rumors before but this one is pretty good
where'd you hear this
0
i would guess notional value $0-0 bil per day including financial derivatives
0
probably doubled market share in gas since eol 0
probably 0% of our trades are intl
can i assume we are ready to test the limit orders
i would still like to conduct the test
we may have 0-0 internal orders at a short interval after aga
thanks
thanks for doing that interview for me
can you reply to this
exaggerations
word travels everywhere doesnt it
how'd you hear
me thinks everybody short and everybody wants the market to go down
i'm relatively flat and would love to squeeze all the fuckers out so i can sell them 0 cents higher
i think there are so many shorts that some of the weak guys are squeezable here
not all and not massive short covering
just think the boys will be buying in front of next week's number
best trade is to be long now and sell right before number
you're right about the email address
thanks
as i said
if your product allows enron to reach more customers
we would have interest in participating in the structure
john
someone's got too much time
i just cant get too enthused about the short side
why did cash go out trading +0 for a weekend when there was zero power gen demand
the easy answer is that pipes were short and everybody playing catchup from this week
fine
what's it going to trade next week
the gas daily swap implies flat
but it's lagged the actual spread all month
i think cash surprises by trading positive next week with no power gen
this market is not trading like we run out of injection space
so either the market is wrong
maybe but a dangerous assumption to make
or i don't see why sep is so overvalued relative to the rest of the curve
you can certainly argue that the winter and cal 0 are too high
but those certainly don't seem to be going down very fast
march is off 0 cents since jun 0
so if the market wants to say that march is worth 0
then why is sep too high at 0
yea
i'd be willing to take a look at any of these ideas
hey
thanks
we already have the front 0 spreads out
u/v,v/x
do you think there would be interest in the strip spreads
yea
will every programmer involved on this project be in this building working this weekend
i found this searching for gas stuff if you care
wanna chew on my toenails
yes
how can i help for the video
wrong email address
i have a meeting with heath schiesser

thanks though
your welcome and thanks
sure

are you going to blow me off for dinner again tonight
cause you played hooky this morn
what do they mean when they have a cold summer scenario results in a $0.0 price
these guys are freaks
with the daily chaos that ensues on this floor
sometimes communication is sacrificed
fortunately
we have the message board to facilitate real time sharing of information
i think all of us
including myself
underutilize this tool
i want to encourage everybody to keep the board open on their computers all day long
in addition
i want everybody to post at least one message every day
this can be an interesting trade that just happened
what counterparties are trying to do
new information you uncovered
etc
information we learn can be very valuable to other desks and it is only fair that if we're taking info from the board
we should be contributing as well
with skilling gone i move up one spot
from 0th to 0th
this market sucks
right back where we were before the # last week
i have so little interest right now
just glad i held onto the short straddle position
wish i had something intelligent to say but i don't
in regards to the stock
tell me about it
flat price me thinks we go nowhere for a while
think the next push down doesnt come again until late october
im buying z 0/0 put spread for 0
still looking for 0.0 by end of season
probably 0.0-0.0 for nov 0
who wants baseload gas for dec in that scenario
aga's
think high 0's is neutral the market
if it comes out 0-0 you can shit on vol
that'd be good for me
hard to say odds on a revision
don't think aga would make a revision
but an individual stg field could
another option is that a stg field that realizes they fucked up just fades the number over the next several weeks such that each number going forward is bigger than expected
wrong addressee
we're going to have a mandatory eol trading simulation session today at 0:0
can you email all traders on the floor and make sure the desk heads know
also
postpone my 0:0-0:0 mtgs until after 0 or tomorrow
thanks
got this one
greg
i just realized i'm out of town thursday and friday of next week
any chance we can meet with bo wednesday afternoon
i'm planning on it
how bout we split the moolah
for what
wrong wrong wrong you're talk no action
want to get a fancy dinner tongiht
let's say thursday
were you counting in ac
any interest in catching the us soccer game tonight
me thinks it starts at 0
how about those dutch
or dutchesses
i just mean to flip/flop the traders and orig so they are still sitting together but the trading is next to financial and texas rather than the orig
yes
we've made budget this year
what do we need more income for
0
on family vacation how bout sep0-0 0
already bot a second bed

i'm blaming my p&l on you today
tammy

convenient huh
so i do not have service as of 0 days ago
thank you
you make me so jealous
bob
work with me on this
i'm looking at the doc now and will have comments later today
john
jeff
the trade did go in yesterday to book
oil-price-spec
if this is not the right book
email or call
john
we have the whole curve out
the nymex is just another trading platform that is inconsequential to markets we make except for arb opportunities and for the fact that our swaps settle against the nymex settlement
our volume is pretty normal at this point
i've been selling
was long 0 and selling out
everybody will be expecting the crude draws
they dont matter
think this is tremendously bearish all energy demand
supply shocks are the only question
but i dont think us will end up fighting a war against the middle east
who cares if we nuke afghanistan
all i hear is that all the funds are going to get squeezed as soon as the nymex opens
fuck
i don't know
but i'm not going get long crude hoping to squeeze the funds
lost that game too many times
huh
the nymex is so technologically incompetent that they have no idea
after working on it for 0 months they're trying to buy are technology now
if cash/futures is 0-0 then oct will have a very weak settle
they are trying to use the regular access system on the internet which was supposed to come out two weeks ago but they delayed because the firewalls and security issues hadnt been solved
scary how we have the same sense of humor
havent told anybody yet
so i have a favor to ask
whether we never talk again
just become good friends
or grow old together with 0 kids
please never,ever refer to me as the energy guy
you can refer to him as that
just not me
officially tired of watching the news
actually there is very little new about it
channel 0
the local viewpoint
cnn
the national viewpoint
cnbc
the business viewpoint
espn
the sports viewpoint
pat robertson channel
god's viewpoint
the politicians all hold news conferences and talk for 0 minutes and say nothing
we interrupt the state dept's news conference to bring you the justice dept's news conference where we expect there going to say
no comment at this time
frequently
i have a tv on my desk at work that is on constantly just in case something happens
but meanwhile it's driving me nuts
just found out another girl i knew is missing
i was supposed to go out with this girl a couple years ago on a blind date but it never went through
i met her after that
so let's talk about something better
we'll start shallow
what kind of music do you like
john
i don't remember him but it is my understanding nobody has been heard from that worked in the carr office in the wtc
please call me in the morning so i can 0-way with an eol technical rep to find out happened
one looked at it this afternoon
and according to his preliminary analysis
the order was placed at 0:0 and never canceled
obviously that is counter to your knowledge of the transaction
let's straighten this out first thing in the morning
john
hey
by the way
did you ever find your cell phone
network traffic very heavy right now so you might not get this until tonight
john
sorry for the extremely late response
despite the fact that eva referred you
we would have interest in meeting with you about emplyment opps
i was planning on going to ny in a couple weeks but at this point
i don't know
i would highly recommend that you follow the formal recruitment program in addition to any talks we have
although i can recommend to make you an offer
it is much easier if it is done in parallel with the associate recruitment program
after the current events calm down
we can talk via phone about my experience here and why i think there are some good opportunities here
done
bid it up on low volume
thanks
this is a summary of my position and trading goals today
advise if you dont agree
yea
what are you doing after
post midtown square
seems to me trade guys are getting royally fucked in crude
happy b-day by the way
hope everything's going well
we're having network problems again so i hope you get this soon
i had to cover some
too much risk
rode most of it back down
i think this whole event is bearish energy
nobody important
good point
your welcome
i'm going home
have fun tonight
talk to you tomorrow
i see i've made quite an impression on you msled
i created 0 new deals that reversed the deals mentioned
so
well
i was thinking
um
you know
uh
never mind
but actually
i was wondering
cough,cough
that
well
ok
i'm just gonna say it
are you you ready
ok
here it goes
would you like to get a drink some time
p.s.--whew
i was never good at asking girls out but i think that went pretty smoothly
agree with the first paragraph
bets get tougher from here
not so obvious and require much larger size to get same juice
generally not a good position considering the current world order
or disorder
not much juice in gas basis either
this is where we see whether we are good traders or just great fundamentalists
hey
0
theoretically we could agree upon a trade and cross it on ice after hours when the risk that someone else gets inside is remote
this is a prearranged trade and is illegal on nymex
but it is my understanding it will be legal on ice assuming ice uses the ipe clearing platform
where prearranged trading is legal
agree about liquidity
i dont think this really helps ice's volumes
nor liquidity
funds want liquidity so they will not flock to ice in the current state
0
my guess is not intercommodity
but maybe intracommodity
for instance
a gas daily swap against front month futures may have lower margin than the 0 trades additive
important note
ice is our competition and i am very,very wary to support their system
unless absolutely necessary
p.s
can you bring me some free samples of the bladder control medicine
it'll save me some money
please change my address of record to john arnold houston 0 thanks
john
you working out today
i'm running out the door to go drinking with the boys at front porch
right next to my apartment
i don't think your dad would like me so much
will explain later
sorry about your day
maybe you can find some happiness in the book of prayers
maybe you can find more happiness in the money
talk to you later
wow
how did our guys do
yea
that was for oct a couple hours before expiry
dont have a whole lot of interest being fundamentally long crude
maybe for a scalp buy if we get overdone which we might be this morn
t boone how
are you going to the game 0 nite
it wouldnt be fun if i were fair
lucky sob
yesterday was just a little crazy
crude had it's biggest fall in 0 years so that translated into a very busy day
plus my best employee was just offered a job across the street for a big chunk of money
at least i made money
i should be getting my phone line at home today
of course they've been saying that for 0 days now
at which point they can install dsl
thatll make it much easier
went to the bb game again last night
love them stros
how'd you're presentation go last night
did the doc talk good about your drug
have a good one
cold 0-0
oct expires tomorrow
is it real
nobody from the first tower made it down
right
whats the name of the
priceline
type site that gives you an hour to buy the ticket
0 yard line 0th row in my hands
just got them
thanks a lot
i have 0 tix sec 0 row 0 for tonight if you or anyone in your group wants them
thx for the update
funny how the banks will deal with us and ospraie won't
oh well
nothing we can do
god i hope so
stop sending me these
do you and brad have a minute to sit down today
see you there
seems a little out of whack but as we seen time and time again
fundamental relationships don't have to hold in the short term
bbb+ credits dont go bankrupt overnight
we can get downgraded overnight
though
put a clause in the contract that if we get downgraded below inv grade there is some sort of orderly liquidation of the swaps
talk to credit about how we handle this with others
how about next wednesday
i actually went to go talk to him yesterday but he was already gone and he's on vacation today
i'll talk to him next week
probably better for him to hear the benfits from my mouth
we do need to talk to him before we get too far
eol working very well as of late
there are few scenarios whereby that spread comes in except if you take it to settlement
if dec is strong
jan is strong too
if dec is weak
jan retains some risk premium
me thinks so
yep
what are you doing later
no thx
i think they worked this out
john
why is george down
thank god i got out on friday
had a much better month trading crude than gas
yea
you coulda sent me this 0 months ago
not necessarily looking for predictive power
that's a 0 year project
just for market making skillset
the work that dave forster did was just for front month
that creates month 0
then
similar logic has to create a month 0/month 0 spread to create a month 0 outright market
same for month 0
month 0 to create month 0
there might be 0-0 individual markets to create a forward curve
sometimes month 0 has correlation to the month 0
month 0 spread
sometimes it does not
must create a system that is mechanical but very easy for a human to add bias
funny that they say mixed response to new ceo's
someone in my group or myself will attend
got your running shoes on
mike maggi resigned this morning to take a job at a competitor
he is under contract
lavo has been advised
what do i need to do
not really and no
ended up getting in late last night
monday night football turned into tuesday morning football
sucks to be mediocre
huh
elpaso
same thing want to trade options
outright long
a long time from now
looks like with cold weather curve is going to reshape
front up
back nothing
hey buddy
heard you're in town
any interest in going to the bb game tonight
have some right field homerun catching seats
hello
wondering if we can meet to pick up the tix
i work and live in downtown
please advise or call me at 0-0-0
just got some tix in right field for tonight's game
any interest
why is anybody giving you scoop
i think cash gets much stronger over the coming weeks relative to nov
first inclination when cash comes up is that futures go up
however
there is an 0 cent spread between cash and december
cash can easily go up without dec moving
just bot them
i'll save one for you
just let me know asap
any interest in going to bb game tonight
crude reunion
jt
racecar
and me
tix in hr #0 catching territory
sounds good
i have cash
i work at the old enron building
just give me a call when you're close and i'll meet you on the street right in front of the building
maybe we just hold all the gas until next winter
we'll worry about that problem next september
novy expiry can go anywhere
too early to say
probably around $0 though as i cant imagine who is a baseload buyer of gas in november when the us is a net injector the first 0-0 weeks barring cold spell and the pipelines are trying to start withdrawing
can you meet this guy if i'm off the desk
for anybody that doesnt know
maggi resigned today to go to el paso
i will be sending out an email with a broader distribution this afternoon
please keep this quiet until then
plan to meet at 0:0 today to discuss the ongoing structure of the desk
i'm going to put out an email this afternoon
you suck
how pissed will you be if the guy next to me catches 0
call me before you leave tomorrow
can you find out the scoop on ravi thuraisingham as far as reviews
rankings
etc
thinking about hiring him
me thinks people are trading the headline and not the story
ene
the india story
i lok at it and say we sold india
then realize we the gas
not the assets
no
waiting for a rally to sell
if dont get one will stay out
no
have had 0 late nights in a row and it doesnt get much better rest of the week
had to get an extra hour of beauty sleep
can you tell
i went to the front porch after the crappy game and then went back to my front porch with billy white
he wouldnt leave
stayed until 0:0
get the feeling he doesnt get out much
actually a terrible game
bonds didnt get a ball out of the infield in the air
granted we werent exactly pitching strikes to him
not enough
come on up tomorrow afternoon
yea
i would pay $0 for the tix tonight
i feel ripped off for the crappy game i had to sit through tuesday
yea
can you meet me at enron again
pull this up and click on hit chart your tix are sec 0
row 0
seats 0-0
on the aisle of sec 0
at least i made $0 for my services
can you email lavorato maggi's address
nope
going to the game
i'll be at the front porch tomorrow
depends on the legal outcome
thhere is still a possibility we get all of our money back
although a roe of 0% for 0 years
still
a better roe than broadband investments
can we meet at 0:0 instead
because we're $0 off the lows or because you think we're overvalued
what do you think now
you doing anything tonight
no need
the drinks will be warm by the time i get back up to the 0th floor
yes
he'll be at work on monday
can you have docs ready sometime during the day
by the way
these are crappy pics
the prediction company says you go 0-0
you're a hack
eddie gaetchens
marty
and kevin from man are coming down wednesday if anybody is up for dinner or drinks
want to play hookie and go to the bb game tomorrow at noon
no way
we're still paying $0 for new employee referrals
they're giving away a porsche boxster or a cardboard boxcutter
my little junior league girl
so sweet
let's leave around 0ish
she starts at 0:0
sure
just call me when you get out
jeans
i'm wearing a shirt too
maybe after the game
i never knew your fantasies
do you want to drink beer
i'll work on sneaking a bottle of opus in otherwise
not so impressed with david goldman
for a guy who has worked in derivatives for 0 years
couldnt answer some simple questions
very poor financial derivatives knowledge even though he worked at crt for a long time and a lyonnais for a while
the only value i see in him is that he worked at bp for a while and might have some knowledge as to how they work
that was pretty funny
do not still have the double date thing
i need a favor in return for interviewing your boys
remember mark findsen
he's looking to get back into the business
possibly from the trading side
i actually think he might make a better orig guy
he has been in the crude and products markets for 0+ years
has no experiece in trading energy but has been day trading equities for past year
he asked if he could get a round of interviews at enron
could you set up a round for him
maybe
some specialization is beneficial though
sounds like it's clean from your side
i hate swaptions
if these problems are not being addressed as they should be
call me and i'll get on it
this is unacceptable
sorry,sorry
sorry
havent had internet access at home for past 0 weeks
much easier to write these at home as when i'm done trading i don't want to look at my computer
for november
very neutral
cash is impressive
agree shutins
switching
and some weather are making market look more like equilibrium
think with cash/futures at 0 cents
x/z looks crazy
as soon as z becomes prompt
the fear factor/risk premium of it will decrease and the whole winter will come off
like your h/j trade
hard to see it really being worth 0 cents at settlement
been buying a lot of y/y cantango as i think next summer will be a piece but longer term gas story still very real and customers know it
wouldnt be surprised to see 0/0 go to 0+
i think x has some room to go up
but not a lot
dont want to play the market from the long side as been burned before trying to get long a market that is still in a downtrend
seems like the curve will just keep rolling down with each expiry
all the winter months might settle 0.0
as such
the best thing to be short is jan
loser
what's brian's last name
johnny
i'll get mark findsen to call you
can you have at least 0 trader interview him as well
thanks
john
any chance we can introduce limit orders to spreads
sushi on thursday at the new place in the village
going to the game
cancel above
we'll do it next week
got whalley's for today at noon
can you go
are you there
i've 0 extra tix if you anybody we like
yea
i just found a taker
sorry
i'm in
can you make a reservation for 0 at vallones at 0:0 today
sorry
just got your msg
cant go today
by the way
you're a lousy friend
don't worry about it
i'm sure he'll come down whenever we ask
should i tell him to get his butt down here and show us the love
your welcome
it was really good to see you again
maybe we can so something again before 0 months
all good
he should call you today or tomorrow morning
i do not have a list of interviewers in mind
i would like bill white to talk to him though
thanks
hey
that's one hell of a bd celebration
don't think i can hang in you guys
was definitely a little sleepy yesterday
went to the bb game and then had a biz dinner last night
i was almost asleep driving home at 0:0
at least i was sane enough to yell buy and sell at random points during the day
i assume you're going to let people select news categories such as us energy news and avoid articles about paskistani oil fields
any time tomorrow afternoon around 0 or 0:0 to discuss
just following up to see if the recruiting season has started and to make sure everything is going okay
if you need anything
just say the word
i've got a mtg from 0-0:0ish so either before or after
if you have blackberry
keep me informed about pira
ng lows in place but q0 forecast $0.0
don't understand
also
what's longer term forecast i.e
past mar 0
you goofball go to www.snopes0.com
click on rumors of war
and then go to the first entry about halloween
yes
what is our flight schedule for monday
any substance to their argument or just their beliefs
the y/y spreads have come in decently over the past week and a half
the 0/0 spread has moved from 0 to 0
it may be a good time to move the 0-0 to a cal 0 trade
pira just gave their seasonal conference in ny and they are very bullish long term gas
forecast nymex regardless of what you think of pira and long term price forecasts
the rest of the market does listen
they have a tremendous amount of respect in the industry and affect how customers and producers hedge
the flow
which has been buyers over for the way backs
i think will get more pronounced
especially if the front goes down
in the past week
i've sold duke 0,0/d cal 0-0 and 0,0/d cal 0-0
i've sold pge maybe 0,0 day cal 0-0
the only seller has been el paso whom i believe is hedging production
he is trying to pressure the y/y spreads as a spec trade that i think was/is being done to front run the corp hedges
i've used it as an opportunity to put a lot of spreads away for inventory down the road
if you want to buy this strip back in the next 0 months
i think it's going to be much easier/cheaper to roll it closer
which way
arnold
john
we're working out today at 0:0
i hated it
0
i'm going to see t boone tuesday 0
fine me for var for friday
i promise i'll buy on monday
how about 0:0
joey
can you round the price of following eol deals from 0/0 with cargill to four decimals while keeping the spread price the same
john
no clue
not a movie buff
what money
i don't know what you're talking about
i'll get it at lunch
damn
thought you forgot
exactly
you got robbed
it's the one thing that could really hit the market
there are a lot of gas hedges on against those trades
if they are torn up
a lot of gas in the back gets sold off hard
plus
the dynegys of the world lose $0 on their hedges
me
me

you girls are all the same
do you have any time today around 0
darren
i think dutch quigley spoke to you about an individual who is trying to get set up with eol for his personal account
the person is tony annunziata from the smith barney aaa fund
he meets the suitability tests as far as net worth and knowledgable investor
he is also willing to post via lc or wire
i gave him your number
i would appreciate if you could expedite his credit application
thanks
john
stg adjusted means factoring in cost of carry and taxes stg curve looks more realistic in market areas when you add basis on

liz
just wanted to thank you for the astros playoff tix

but that was actually a really good bottle
sat out on my patio last night drinkning wine and eating cheese and fruit
thanks
louise has no problem as long as approved by legal and credit
since i have no idea what you're talking about
i guess i was a little drunk
can you buy 0,0,0 more please
do you want to go to learn what happened or do you want to go yell at those guys/see those guys get yelled at
daniel
can you include me in the nymex nat gas advisory panel meeting today

not mad at you
i''ll be drinking either at front porch or little woodrows
veronica
deutsche bank asked me to ask you to call their maintenance margin person
john jones

i think they are trying to margin us
john
can you arrange a mtg between the desk heads as soon after 0:0 as possible
i am sorry you lost the trade but this is not a matter that should be worked in the broker market nor should anybody be looking to profit off the situation
it is being handled directly to ensure the integity and liquidity in the market that is beneficial to all
that kid is hilarious
do you know what his last name is
there will be a desk head mtg tomorrow
sunday
at 0:0 on the 0rd floor per lavorato to discuss positions and strategy

and previous day with volume differentials in percent relative to 0 day average
for instance

who wrote the market commentary are at the bottom of this and who wrote the rest
although tennessee was a very good time not long ago
it sure seems like a long time ago
how are you with the following counterparties for this transaction
coral
duke
dynegy
reliant
not much from customers lately
customers waiting for market to stabilize before doing any hedging
bmo wants to do this sleave trade
duke
dynegy
coral
and reliant have offsetting positions
who's best for us to do this with
also
what's our current balance with bmo
should i demand for the trade to be offmarket
can you have the back run a new position report as of yesterday and include j aron
he was contacted directly
why
are you trying to find a good one
expect some producer selling if/when mrkt stabilizes
what production data are you looking at
understand
are you good with bank of montreal out that far
how about j aron
tell them to calm down
i'm going to start clearing amro
tfs
and carr trades through them as well
i will do a new xpit to offset some of the new positions that will lower the margin in the short term
are we proposing to pay refco for order flow
like a tick per trade
or are we going to give them our prices and then they widen them to add their juice
talk to geoff storey
he is handling a transaction that will reduce the majority of exposure to us wednesday morning
jeff
if you talk to greg trentham
will you ask him to call me
i have not had a chance to talk to him yet
thanks
john
does my boy marc findsen have a chance
can you get me an itinary of events
banc one
how about monday after work
or monday lunch if we're all fired by then
sign me up
i'll have an answer by 0:0
please stick him on
understand
enron has been man's biggest account for years and during that time we have paid them a lot in commissions
they approached us on wednesday to try to increase the margin required
even though we were below the credit threshold that had been established in the contracts written 0+ years ago
i refused to agree to change the margin calculations
it became clear that man was uncomfortable with the exposure to such a big account given that man is a relatively small shop
i agreed to xpit some positions such that they would get more comfortable with the outstanding risk in the account
at the same time i told them i was transacting business as usual and if they couldnt handle/didnt want the clearing business i would clear somebody else but that was a permanent decision for them to make
clear our business always
or clear it never
paribas has stuck with us throughout and i intend to clear the majority of future biz with paribas
i agreed during hours of phone calls wednesday that we would xpit specific futures positions on thursday
which we did
but the rest of the position would stay there
they agreed
we specifically stated the rest of the positions and the options would stay and we would work out those positions over time
@$ them if they are trying to go back on that
will you wire the money immediately when this is done
yes
i replied and asked mike if he'd wire the money today if i agreeed
waiting on his response
we have already done the aug 0
how many may 0 do you want us to do
being done as i write this
we just finished doing the xpit that they asked for
they have agreed to send the money immediately after that was done
we should be getting the money very soon
hold off on the letter right now
please notify me as soon as the wire has been sent
i assume you are working on this right now
can you confirm when we get it
i thought i had pulled one over you
i don't envy your job
the trade guys do a good job of ganging up on you
ready any time you are
according to whom
we have until thursday i believe

okay skilling
tell them that margin will be posted as normal

he should be very comfortable that we can pay our bills
the positions will roll off through time until the position gets very small and then we will x-pit everything out of man and close the account
anything different and all dealings between man and enron in energy will be terminated in both otc and futures

going home to the big d
everybody and their mom is short

a lot of people think the z/f is too wide so either the front needs to go up or the back down

the reason i asked is
this sounds bad
but right now the cheaper you are the easier time i'll have finding you a job
is it okay to leave around 0:0

if/when we get the operation started again
i'll bring you up for a tour
still have new years open

bill
to get hard to find tickets
go to the plaza hotel
borders central park near fao schwartz
entering through the front door
proceed ahead around the big lobby/tea area around to the right and find a woman in a closet sized booth
literally a closet
cast members turn tickets over to her to sell that they are given for their shows
she is completely independent from the hotel and i'm sure she pays huge rent for the tiny space that she has
they are always wonderful seats to and usually run around $0+ for each ticket
it is always a worth-it splurge if it is for a play you want to see
i used to have her card
but it is long gone by now
you might be able to call the plaza and inquire as to her name and number and call ahead
otherwise
just stop in as soon as you get in town
rent is ok
but if this is your first and maybe only trip to nyc for a while
i would certainly recommend seeing other plays first
i agree with john
your best hotel bet is the marriott marquis
which is very nice for a marriott and the location is the best
don't forget to eat lox and a bagel for breakfast
keep us posted
kim
fyi
kim
theresa

he went home on the same day and was only off work for a couple of days
will you be able to start a rehab program/routine after surgery
is your doctor comfortable with you traveling to italy this fall or will it be a wait and see situation to see how you are doing post surgery
keep me posted
thanks
kim
gary
i just wanted to get back with you on the salt dome storage question you asked earlier

the following is a list of things that we need to discuss and they are in no particular order of priority
to the extent that each of you could volunteer to come with some or all of the information on the following items
it will expedite our discussion
just let me know that you would like to begin pulling this information
price spreads for rofr contracts to articulate our resubscription strategy
imbalances on oba's analysis of i to i spreads
review past fixed rate transport deals and compare to the historical spreads
would we have made more money
is it reasonable to carve out a percentage of our capacity portfolio and always sell on an i to i rate
update map
coordinate with darrell
facility planning and nng
west texas leg
discussion on our preparation for the facility planning/marketing strategy meeting
arizona strategy
including sun devil
pooling
analysis of our business sold and utilized
ft
alt
points
it and contracts sold for specifically for flexible delivery points
on this item
we can discuss the type of analysis we would like to look at in our staff meeting prior to pulling any information
weekend on call schedule

replacement for jeff's position
frequency of our staff meeting
industry conferences vacation schedules also
please let me know of additional items that you would like to have discussed in our staff meeting
i would be happy to include them
thanks
kim
sasha
great
sorry
i didn't see the scroll bar
thanks
if you would just coordinate an assortment of pizza's
that would be great
i believe morgan may have a couple of people in his group who are vegetarians
so we should keep this in mind when making some of the selections
i would order plenty for our hearty crowd
someone could always take the leftovers home and eat it for breakfast the next morning
also
will the mad potter provide the wine
beer and soft drinks
is there anything else that you can think of
thanks
kim
sasha
i forgot one thing
let morgan and i know if you get any declines for our session
thanks
kim
good morning kirk
i hope you had a nice weekend
i have been working on the interconnect agreement for the big sandy project and i would like to schedule some time for a telephone conference with you as i have a few
blanks
in the interconnect agreement that i would like to discuss with you so that our draft is as complete as it can be
would you have some time on tuesday am or wednesday am
i would also be available on thursday 0:0-0:0pm
i'm thinking we need about a half an hour
also
i can update you on the remaining capacity on our red rock expansion which could be used to serve the plant
thanks
kim
paul

thanks
kim
steve
i just wanted to let you know that i have been playing telephone tag with a couple of the questar folks
for the most part
they were out of the office several days during the last two weeks
of course i was out of pocket a couple days
too
i've left another message with gary schmitt
who apparently is out of town yesterday and today
but i did hear from mary kay olson
who was also in our office when gary came in several weeks ago
mary kay is tracking down the status of the western leg information that kevin requested
i also let her know that we are interested in the eastern leg as well
she will begin pulling that information together
too
i expect to hear from her either later today or tomorrow with a status and timing of the data
she will also connect up with gary when she sees him
i will keep you posted as i hear more information
also
jodi starley
who is also in the questar marketing department
is looking for me to begin the interconnect agreement for the san juan hub connect with southern trails
do you have a problem if i begin the paperwork
however
i have several other interconnect agreements that are higher priority at this time and it may take a while to get to this one
i recognize that this is a delicate balance
thanks
kim
audrey
i took 0/0 day vacation on friday
july 0
thanks
kim
fyi
kim
does this mean that we are no longer limited on the volume that we previously were limited to on pnm
i'm very glad that this passed
thank you for your help
kim
greg and maria
fyi
here is a report for the july capacity releases on tw
pg&e
sempra and texaco all released on an index to index spread and are above max rate
elizabeth has the history of tw capacity releases if you think it might help in the preparation of our strategy for negotiated rates
thanks
kim
ramona
gosh
something always seems to come up every year that we want to make a change to our existing systems
lindy will be back tomorrow and i will discuss this with her
we are evaluating how we currently administer and market pools
if we decide to make a change i suspect that it may require a system change
but it is too early to make a decision just yet
i also think that we should think about how to link eol transactions through the entire contracting process
i know that nng is probably a little further on this than we are
but it is reasonable to think we should have this ready for us next year
i will continue to ponder this and discuss this with lindy upon her return tomorrow
thanks
kim
michelle
was this the company you just took derivatives class from
thanks
kim
fyi
kim
vince
i'm so glad that you can recommend him for our commercial job
he has some skill sets that our department is shy on
in fact
i am bringing him back for my boss
steve harris
to interview
i too
think that he would be a good fit
by the way
krishna and seksan have been very helpful in coordinating some technical analysis of california prices
we appreciate the support and certainly enjoy working with your group
perhaps you
krishna and i can book a lunch together in mid to late august and catch up on the business issues
thanks
kim
hi kirk
i got your
out of the office
message the other day when i emailed you

we are still confirming whether or not tw has had other i to i deals negotiated in the past
so far
tk
lorraine and michelle don't think that we have any
but i will talk to lindy tomorrow
here are some nng i to i neg
rates that have been approved during the past year
i will keep you posted
kim
by the way
i don't think i finished my thought when we were talking about this earlier today
yes
you are correct that pnr revenue was only $0,0 in july
due to higher swings in the socal window causing higher line pack
parks were not made available most of the month
tk continues to challenge our ability to accomodate pnr's
the daily balancing report is helping us to recognize opportunities for this service
thanks
kim
lou--while you were on the lake
thanks
kim

per my conversation with you earlier today

if tw cannot sell all of the mavrix capacity within 0 days
then will tw then take the financial risk after this time and not hold mavrix responsible for the difference
this may be ok as we may wish to re-sell the capacity in different packages of time
kw
hey kevin
thanks for the message
in fact
i talked with glenn hass about this earlier today
i also talked to questar about this today as well
gary schmitt was somewhat optimistic

k
lorraine
when you get back in the office
let's talk about the new interest to connect into the sj hub
i
too
have a few customers who are interested in connecting into the hub
we should generally discuss this from a big picture perspective so we can understand the total limitations of the hub and lay out our strategy for moving forward
also
fyi
in your edg comment below
our pipeline profile has all the lat/long locations specified if that helps identify the locations best for power plant sites
thanks
kim
jean
all is correct except that steve harris should get two flat screens instead of michelle and me getting a third panel
however
i did want to mention to you that i would like for michelle to have a third flat screen since she handles all of our eol transactions thereby giving her a screen for dashboard/pipeline profile
outlook and eol
is there an extra one around for her
many thanks
kim
fyi
kim
i do not believe that i am familiar with this company
kim

as a follow up from our meeting on august 0
we all had the question about what
if any
price risk we had on the fuel portion of the index to index deals
here are my thoughts
for purposes of this discussion
let's just talk about how the dynegy
san juan to socal needles firm transport for 0,0 mmbtu/d for calendar 0 could impact our fuel risk
dynegy will not be giving us fuel in-kind for this transaction
all fuel needed for scheduled volumes on this contract will have to be provided by tw
in a normal year tw over collects approximately 0,0 mmbtu/d in fuel
because we will now need some of this over collected amount to provide the fuel for the dynegy deal
we actually have something less than the 0,0 mmbtu/d for the total 0 fuel over collection
to make the math easy to follow for purposes of discussion
let's assume after all of the index to index deals for 0
we will only have 0,0 mmbtu/d of over collected fuel on the system
we will need the remaining 0,0 mmbtu/d as fuel for the index to index deals
let's also assume that we have hedged or plan to hedge
by means of the whole calendar year
seasonally or monthly
the 0,0 mmbtu/d of 0 over collected fuel
the remaining 0,0 mmbtu/d of over collected unhedged fuel is what will be used to provide the fuel for the dynegy deal
it is my thought that the price risk question surrounds the 0,0 mmbtu/d of the remaining over collected fuel that is not hedged
on any day where dynegy would schedule the full 0,0 mmbtu/d to flow
the fuel actually burned on that day for dynegy would have the same value as all other shippers who provided in-kind fuel on that same day
the other shipper's in-kind fuel
i'm referring to the 0,0 mmbtu/d that is not hedged
is what is actually used to provide fuel for dynegy
on this particular day
we do not have additional adverse price risk
however
on any day that dynegy does not have the full 0,0 mmbtu/d scheduled to flow
we have an opportunity loss on the value of this fuel
if dynegy does not flow all or any volumes on their contract on any given day
there is no fuel burned
this means that we now have extra gas
that was not previously hedged
in the pipe provided by the other in-kind shippers that we do not need for dynegy on this particular day
now we are subject to selling this extra gas at current cash prices verses having the ability to hedge this volume ahead of time at a price that we felt meet our fuel hedging strategy
thus creating an opportunity loss
would you agree that our risk is when dynegy does not flow
would you agree that there is no additional price risk when dynegy does flow
thanks
kim

another message
thanks
kim
hey guys and girls
janell has a sheraton on the outskirts of town booked on the front end of the trip
i sent 0 faxes this morning to hotels in the city center looking for something closer to our sights
i received an immediate response from the hotel condotti
they have 0 standard rooms available
i believe it is a 0+ star hotel
i'm guessing from the prices they charge
from the article in my book
they have recently remodeled
they are located near our hotel firenze between the spanish steps and plaza del popolo
the rate is 0,0 lire
approximately $0
it's $0 more than the sheraton but we won't have to taxi between the city center and the outskirts of town which gives us more flexibility to easily scoot back to the hotel as we fade with jetlag and eat dinner in town after a nap
they also have a 0 hour cancellation policy
there could be a slight fee to cancel
their fax just says they have a 0 hour cancellation fee
if we are ok
i'll confirm this cancellation with our reservation
i think we should go with this
i'm not sure how fast i'll hear from the others
if at all
please let me know your thoughts asap
thanks
kim
0:0 in the lobby sounds fine

here is a previous email from the travel agency regarding car and ferry info

approx $0 for each car

dorothy called me yesterday and wanted to know how our plans are coming
she and tom are very sad that they will not be able to join us

she is doing well and hopes to return to the office in about three weeks on a part time basis
also
john and i are confirmed in a rome hotel for the 0th-0th which is only about 0 blocks from the train station where we will return the cars
we can put everyone's luggage in our room when we return to rome and have a nice dinner before you guys taxi to the airport to return home
i will keep you posted as we hear more
thanks

jan and i may be late for this meeting since we are taking her to lunch to celebrate her 0 years of service

we want a recap on any stories or jokes that you tell

many thanks
kim
it is that time of year
please complete your list of accomplishments by the end of november
also
please complete your 0 objectives by december 0
your objectives will need to outline your specific marketing plan for each customer
project and idea you may have for adding/increasing value to transwestern in 0
as discussed earlier
we will get together in mid-december to review account loads to see if we need to do any shifting
your 0 objectives will be helpful in determining whether your load is heavy
light or just right
i will be happy to visit with each of you individually if you have any questions or would like to discuss these items
>
thanks
kim
mark
this looks fine
kim
paula
i can make myself available this evening or tomorrow evening to discuss this and other topics as your calendar permits
i actually think that we should not be pressured by anyone to fill this position in the next few days
if jim would like to resign effective the end of the month
or some other date
i think that would be fine
it is completely reasonable that the board take some amount of time
whatever is necessary
to select the right candidate
let me know when you would like to rally
thanks
kim

the mlp discussions have been on using northern border

mark and i met with them before xmas to see where they were on the rate
they have not presented anything to their management team for approval beyond our original proposal
i believe that stan is looking for the status of the game plan
we are looking to lay out the game plan on how we would finance the project
if we project finance i think stan and danny are looking at securing enough money at the same time to do the sun devil
trans pecos and pg&e 0 mile line all together
define what the project return requirement is
determine the comfort factor of the project costs
staying in concert with kmi and making the final proposal to pemex

we are still working on all the details of the proposed interconnect with questar southern trails in the blanco hub and will send you a copy soon for your review
since the interconnect is fully reimbursable
questar is proposing to pay us according to the attached payment schedule vs
paying all of it up front
please take a look at this attached schedule and provide me you comments
if we allow them to pay
along the way
i am interested in making sure it at least matches the timing of our cash outlay of building the interconnect
the total estimate of $0,0 includes the tax gross up
which may or may not be applicable
so each of these amount may be reduced by the tax amount
does anyone have any concerns with the timing of the payment schedule

here is the pricing information on the dtn feed
i recommend that we sign a 0 year agreement so the initial fee of $0,0 will be waived
the minimum dtn fee is $0 monthly

do you want to see the real-time feeds
it looks like the total monthly fee will be $0 for six users
please let me know if you have any concerns
otherwise
we will implement asap
also
there will be no additional cost to have this on the 0 floor and move it to our final destination
there used to be a large fee for moving locations
kim
thanks
we'll make room for the three of you
we are looking at moving either to 0 or 0
we have tentative floor plans for both
when the floor decision has been made
we'll come to you for your consensus on the placement of your three slots
we'll be back with you soon

here is a note from gaylen at questar
we would like to have this interconnect in place by may 0
the interconnect agreement is anticipated to be executed this week
i will let you know when it is officially signed
if it would help us meet our may 0 timeframe
please remember that questar is more than willing to help order equipment
to our specifications
if our vendors cannot respond as quickly as we would like
please let me know if you need additional information
thanks
kim
fyi
kim
hi jeff
yes
this interconnect will be managed by our e&c group
earl chanley will be the project coordinator
thanks for your quick reply
kim
earl
we are looking at putting the metering facilities on their row
also
i think we will have to purchase about 0ft of row from elpaso to get to questar's property
as you look at this
if for some reason we cannot obtain elpaso row
we will have to look at plan b which would be to put the metering on our row
our in-service date is may 0
if you think that may 0 may be difficult due to receiving the parts/materials on a timely basis because of the issues that vendors may have with us because of recent enron events
please let me know
questar has already informed us that they would help obtain parts/materials to our specifications if it helps achieve an in-service date of may 0
thanks
kim

that they do have availability
the rate is euro 0.0
according to the conversion rate i think this is about usd $0

they will need credit card info if we want to confirm
i have not heard from the hotel conditti
which is the hotel we had reservations for back in september and is located closer to the spanish steps than the hotel firenze
and hope to hear from them soon
i have also not heard back from the marincanto hotel in positano
i'll keep you posted
i thought we would give the hotel conditti another day to respond before making our decision
if conditti does not have space or is too pricey
are we ok with booking the hotel firenze
i have not checked into other rome hotels

i have just received a fax from the marincanto hotel
positano
they do have availability for us beginning may 0 for 0 nights
they have at least one standard double room
sea view
for euro 0
approximately $0 usd
and one superior double room
also sea view
for euro 0
approximately $0 usd
the only difference between the rooms that i can tell from their fax is that the superior room has a jacuzzi bath
i do not know where in the room the jacuzzi is located
this hotel has a private beach
i think i read somewhere in one of my books that there was a small nominal fee to use the beach
with a private descent
wahoo
they also have private parking at the cheap price of euro 0 per day and only a thousand
uphill each way
steps to it
is this hotel still ok
i do not know if they have two standard room and two superior rooms or just one of each type available
please let me know what your preference is
i can clarify in my next fax
if both our preferences are for the same type room and they only have one of each
shall we draw straws or have a pizza eating contest
also
there was one other hotel in positano that i looked into before finding hotel marincanto for our sept
trip but they were full
i may look them up tonight and fax them tomorrow just to compare
please advise
thanks
kim

we also have a fax from hotel firenze in rome that we are confirmed for june 0

tiny sent me this note when he heard the news
this recipe is from my paris cooking class
it is supposed to be wonderful served chilled
when we cooked it in class
we served it warm
be careful not to add too much cream since chilling it makes it a little thicker anyway
also
after you puree it in the blender
marie blanche
our cooking teacher
recommends that you strain all of the chunks out with cheese cloth
she says the reason for this is so that the guests will have a harder time figuring out all of the ingredients
it is part of the parisian mystery of cooking
good luck

the deal number in sitara was changed because of an internal book name change
it had nothing to do with the monetization status of the deal
if this has caused a problem
let me know
i didn't think that just changing the deal number would have this effect
thanks

richard tomaski wants one more physical book set up under the enovate name while retaining the other books already set up
this counterparty name enovate is replacing the midwest energy hub
but wants to be able to differentiate deals done as solely enovate with deals done as enron midwest
call me if you have any further questions
or if this presents a problem

congratulations
welcome back
i sent you a note and a spreadsheet with the deals we have booked in our system
i was trying to reconcile them to your list of deals
i could not
but i think the best thing to do is to simply start over and book the deals you tell me to
i just need the exact terms
i know it's your first day back and you are probably swamped
but when you get a chance
please give me a call
richard wants me to have these deals valued by the end of this month's p&l

i'm with you
i told my wife i thought it would be a 0 touchdown game
but a 0 point margin is unacceptable
i was at the game and it was as if the texas coaches got a bunch of guys from the frat houses this week and put together a game plan on saturday morning before kickoff
they were out of position
slow
unmotivated
and flat out not prepared to play
i like brown and actually think he is a good fit
but at some point you actually have to coach
i lay this all at his feet
obviously the coordinators bear some major responsibility as well
i really don't know what to expect for the remainder of the season
they obviously are not as bad as they showed on saturday
but the fact remains that they are capable of playing that poorly on any saturday
and i really did not think that with this defense they could be humiliated
i was very wrong
something has to change
the fact is they are 0-0 in the last 0 games
and were favored in all but one
lack of talent is no longer an excuse
i think the entire remainder of the season hinges on this saturday
if they play as poorly as they have all season
they have beaten 0 terrible teams
and lost to a bad one
against colorado
they will lose and i could see them finishing at 0-0 and even 0-0 not out of the question
for this reason
i think that this could be the biggest game of brown's tenure at ut
what do you think
mike
how goes it
i was thinking about you guys this weekend
we were in town for the game
if you want to call it a game
we ended up staying at a friends place
i think that is the first time in quite a while we haven't seen you on this particular weekend
we are still plugging along
how about you
i thought i heard you were buying a new house
is that right
well
i just hadn't talked to you in a while and i saw you email address on a message from sean
we are going up to ku for the texas game again
i can't believe it has been 0 years since we were up there
take care

the reason my mistake was not caught on the benchmark signoff procedure is that the postid in question did not have a net position
the procedure rahmann showed you is where we check germs positions to the position reports we run using excel queries
if a postid has a net position and is not officialized
it will be caught using this procedure
it will not
however
if the postid does not have a position
i understand the importance of officializing postid's
as does the entire west desk

here's what happened
i think it will be a very close game
except for the fart against colorado
you just don't bet against the aggies at kyle field
ou is obviously a very good team
but i think more importantly
they are just playing great football
they make plays when they need them
and i know it sounds like sour grapes
but frankly
they are also getting lucky
when the qb heaves a pass 0 yds downfield off his back foot and it goes for a td week after week
the football gods are smiling on you big time
but regardless
you've got to admire stoops and the job he has done
they have proven for three consecutive games that they can score almost at will against some of the best defenses in the country
and as far as the horns are concerned
i still think they are just an above average team
they have beaten no one of any
and i mean any
significance
they were completely outclassed against the one
albeit right now
the best team in the country
good team they have played
and lost to a bad stanford team
but the optimist in me says they are winning at home and that may result in a t+0 win
but right now
i think the aggies have a better team
but if they start thinking about atm
they will lose to both tech and ku
they are not good enough to play poorly and win against decent competition

i am afraid i have not made that much progress on my assignment
i talked to ml ruffer about the $0.0m basis swap
she does not specifically know about the deal
but does know she gave between $0m and $0m to the west desk out of a reserve behind the scenes
i don't know for sure
but this has to be how the $ got in the west p&l
it is booked on 0/0/0 which is between ec0.p
the annuity getting the unamortized $0m into the west desk
and ec0.s
the annuity getting the $0m from corp into the west desk
i hadn't paid attention until just now
but suzette emmons booked the deal
she ran the transport book at that time
the physical buys from canada
ec0.0
ec0.0
and ec0.0
are booked correctly in sitara
ec0.0 was changed by kathy reeves from ending in
0 to ending in
0 on 0/0/0
however
the end date remains
0 in sitara
i don't know why the term was changed

from $.0 to $.0
on this deal will be unwound and this income
approx $0m
will fall out in the west desk ec0.f
buy from canada of 0,0/day thru oct-0 at malin for index + ec0.k
sell to aec of 0,0/day thru oct-0 at malin for index + $.0 as of now
these deals will remain unchanged in the system because aec will not let us out of the firm contract ec0.b
buy from canada of 0,0/day thru oct-0 at malin for index
ec0.b
buy from canada of 0,0/day thru oct-0 at malin for index
these deals will be unwound
but discussions between philip allen and
will reveal details not known at this point in time
bid/offer
transport model
kingsgate to malin capacity of 0,0/day beginning nov-0 thru oct-0 this deal will have to be unwound or killed
currently the deal is valued at approx $0m in the west desk after unwinding these deals
the west desk will be kept whole
the remainder will be granted out in orig

i want to run something by you
it sounds like we have some sort of budget for friday night
i would like to offer everyone the opportunity to bring someone with them but also explain that we may not be able to pay for it all
i guess the reason is i would like to have kristi come with me
but am willing to pay for her
i would like to do the same for everyone else
but don't want to offend anyone with the possibility that they may have to pay a little $$
let me know what you think
thanks
dg 0-0
i just would not want to be the only person to bring someone
so if we don't offer this to everyone
i won't bring her
i don't have a problem with it
just wanted to see what you thought

the automatic bridge to sitara and tagg will save us an extraordinary amount of time
especially during bidweek

so please let them know we appreciate their hard work as well

ngi-pge/topock is an internal curve used to value transport and is equal to ngi-socal
this curve will probably show up every month because the west coast is very volitile
the change is due to a change in the market

the change is also due to market changes that drove up the curve

many of the speaker packages use 0 small speakers and a sub
but i suggested larger front l&r speakers to scott for playing music

i think risk can do two things to improve the process
have more of us involved in the process so they actually see the implications of booking deals incorrectly and actively following up on recurring problems
this last one i am particularly bad about
i will see a variance that is rather small and just take it without looking into the underlying cause more carefully
i think the oa group in general should take a more active approach in preventing problems rather than just identifying them
but i know that is easier said than done

in my opinion onkyo is just a better quality product than kenwood
thus the price discrepancy
i
and this is just me
would not buy a kenwood
i would buy onkyo
denon
yamaha
or harman kardon
these are more expensive
but i think better than sony
kenwood
jvc
technics
and pioneer
the onkyo 0 is a great receiver
and i know you can beat the crutchfield price
the sites i would check out are onecall.com
soundcity.com
jandr.com
hifi.com
you also need to look at audioreview.com
you can see other peoples opinions of products they have actually purchased
it is a great site
they will also indicate where they purchased the equipment and how much they paid
on those sites to buy that i mentioned
you need to call and talk to someone
they will give you a better price than advertised on the internet
give me a call @ 0-0-0
i leave for chicago later this afternoon
dg
it's good to hear from you
the game is november 0th

we are pretty wet here
i've heard you are as well
we got back from disney world last week
things are ok here
the kids are excited about summer
they will probably get in the pool everyday
more to follow
try and stay dry
dg
i'm sure you know by know
but houston got it pretty bad over the weekend
we were ok
but the flooding was unbelievable
we were at lake conroe
k's parents live on the lake
on friday night
it rose at least 0 feet
and it's a big lake
in a matter of 0 hours
my boat is on a lift out of the water
in the morning it was floating
their dock is underwater
i've never seen anything like it
i hope everyone over there is alright
have you seen the newest edition
we hope to get down your way sometime this summer
until then stay dry and take care
dg
kristi wants to know if you are still willing to have the kids for a week in july
if so
we need to make plans

after our conversation on the phone yesterday
i confirmed that we are not able to provide delivered gas at the citygate for a competitive price
therefore we do not wish to make an offer of this package at this time
thanks for your consideration
sincerely
i may be in austin later this summer
i'm in no hurry to get the tickets
if you will
please hang on to them and i'll advise at a later date
thanks

how goes it
i hope good
i just found out that enron is making sprint broadband direct available to us at a discounted rate
isn't this the group you are working for now
they will install the equipment for free and charge $0/mo
$0/mo if you sign up for sprint long distance
do you have this
if so
how do you like it
did you hear about jessie
anyway
i just wanted to ask you about this
i have dial-up now and it really sucks

spoke to the pharmacist

does it work
why yes
he answered
can you get it over the counter
she asked
i can if i take two
he answered
it looks like we won't make it to austin before the 0st
i'll probably just ask you to leave the tix under your front door matt on the day of the nmsu game and we will stop by to pick them up
i will verify this with you next week

i just got the tickets
thanks for sending them
i paid for 0 ou tickets
could you only get me 0
let me know
i also wanted to ask you about the possibility of getting 0 additional tickets for next season
i know you get quite a few each year
but don't know if you have extras available
thanks again
dg
i believe it was $0
that was
0x$0
+
0x$0
the two i have are sec 0 row 0 seats 0&0
i meant season tix
but would probably also try to get ou as well
i guess i'm wrestling with the idea of getting them in my name
but i know the seat location would not be very good
i really would like to have 0 season ticket seats together
i have been getting these through you for 0 years now and don't have a problem with just continuing this arrangement
i also wouldn't be opposed to helping with the contribution to the foundation if you think it would help
let me know
dg
i didn't think about it from your point of view and if some day i decide not to help anymore then you get hurt because your contribution falls
so just disregard that suggestion
i guess i'm trying to feel you out about the possibility of continuing this current arrangement long-term
because i will commit to purchase the current two
and would like to get two more for a total of 0
from now on
it really would be better for me to continue this arrangement rather than get them on my own
because like you indicated
i would have to really pony up alot of $$ to keep similar seats
i'm just not sure what your plans would be for my current tickets and if at some point you would like them back for yourself
how did you end up with so many
is mark still getting the two next to mine
just curious
don't worry about the ou tix
i will find you on saturday
thanks as always
dg
i am happy with my seats
i just wanted to make sure you were willing to continue allowing me to buy them through you long term
see you saturday
they should be pretty good this year
but i've certainly heard that before
dg
you're welcome
it's really no problem at all
i want to see them succeed

innocent civilians have been killed in a brutal attack on our country and our way of life
if that is not worth fighting for
then what in your opinion is
i will admit
i am a conservative and therefore our opinions will usually be polarized on many issues
i am glad that life in our country allows for dissent
but i think that this right is worth the ulimate sacrifice
i honestly believe that if we do not respond
and with calculated deadly force
that we ultimately lose
and i am not talking about losing a war
but our freedom
i agree with you that war will bring unintended consequenses
but these consequences in my opinion
are the price we must pay to defend our way of life

it looks like crosstimbers had a phys trade with us at nwpl rox + $.0 and they also had fin trades
nymex and basis
we combined them to essentially make jan0 a fixed price deal
it appears the customer is questioning this
why they are 0 months after settlement date
i have no idea
i already spoke with carole about this and she has the deal tickets but if you have any questions
just ask
megan
anne should be able to explain this to you

we essentially terminated vu0.0 and vz0.0 on 0/0/0 and paid them $0,0 on 0/0/0 which is in vz0.0 twister gas services

we terminated vl0.0 and y0.0 totally
we partially terminated vn0.0
oct-0
nov-0 only
vu0.0
oct-0 thru dec-0 only
and y0.0
oct-0 thru dec-0 only
they were terminated on 0/0/0 and they were paid $0,0 on 0/0/0 which is in y0.0 i sent a fax to 0-0-0 of the termination agreement they have for a prior deal
they want one similar to this for these two deals
please call if you have any questions
i appreciate your help
dg
i leave thurs morning and return friday night
i don't know why i typed friday
dg
about a third
that's why i'm being shipped to ok

that sounds very bad
did i read that correctly
it basically says that the series is on the brink of collapse
dg
thanks
we had a great time and are already looking forward to jazz fest
dg
the current exemption is $0,0
so that means that the first $0,0 of an estate is tax free
anything over that is taxed at 0%
but you are allowed deductions such as debts
probate fees
funeral expenses
and any state estate or inheritance taxes
so the effective rate will be a little lower
the increase to $0 million will not take effect until 0
this is very basic information
estate planning should be handled by a professional to minimize the tax liability
obviously
if the estate is not worth much money
then no taxes will be owed
i'm sure these professionals are highly compensated because they have the ability to save millions of dollars to some of their clients
chris loves it when you are at his games
he was pretty proud of his play at second base
maybe you should stump for president of the series
actually
that would be a great job
you couldn't do much worse
it seems
dg
i don't mean to hound you
but the customer is asking
any luck on completing this
please let me know
thanks dg
thanks
dg
i have to leave the office early for a trip with bryant and won't be back until monday

the payment we made on 0/0
$0,0
corresponds to all five
three partial and two full
terminations
dg
thanks
did you get it signed
dg
looks like this was made more difficult than it needed to be
the customer wanted a termination letter and because of this we need to kill these deals
i should have just killed the deals in the first place
sorry for the extra work
dg
are you still planning to come down
i need to get a head count because tickets are sometimes tough to come by
let me know
dg
will you please ask this person doing diane's work if the termination letter was completed

enron's nymez offer for the following volume is $0.0

i think phillip is dead serious about trying to start a business
enron's stock is down sharply again today
it's trading at $0
remember in march we got out at $0
my options are now $0 out of the money and it will be at least 0 years before they will approach breakeven

don't worry about the $
i don't like nd

it is better whent the home team wins

the deal is valid and enron will honor its terms
i will get a confirmation sent to you
thanks dg
these are the three that came to mind
i had trouble with my email from home
let me know what else i need to do
thanks dg i managed all back office issues of an asset management deal with brooklyn union gas company
it was a two year deal in which enron was assigned all of the utilities
assets
supply contracts
transportation contracts
and storage contracts
and then became responsible for providing 0% of the gas requirements of bug
i was involved in the negotiations to sign the deal
mostly working with the supply group of bug doing due diligence on their contracts
i created a complex invoice model and worked with our trading group
our logistics group
our risk management group
and gas accounting group
in addition
i made monthly trips to new york to manage the customer and take care of any issues
it was a $0mm/year deal
i was the point person on this deal and worked on it for a year and a half before handing it off to someone else when i moved to risk
i was involved in another asset management deal with peoples gas company in chicago
i also did due diligence work and was involved in negotiations on the deal
i also created invoice models
i did not do the day to day work because i was on my way to risk management
we started a joint venture with peoples in chicago
i set up the risk management department and managed all mid and back office issues of the joint venture
i managed two book administrators who worked in the chicago office and made monthly visits to address any issues
this office made $0mm in its first year and we had no issues from a risk management or accounting perspective
i took over managing the west desk in risk when there was a $0mm flash to actual variance in the region
flash to actual is the difference between the reported p&l and the gl
within 0 months i had identified the variances and cleared them
on a going forward basis i kept the variance at zero
i identified problems in scheduling that were causing these variances and took proactive steps to fix the problem
after managing the desk for 0 months
i was able to have everyone cross trained on other books
this resulted in me being able to reduce the staff by one
saving the company approx $0k/year
where are you now
good luck

dg
i'm in
i'll be shredding
till 0am so i should have plenty of time to make it

this is it
it should be self explanatory
there are values for jan0 and feb0 in the file
the value increased a little more than i expected
i didn't have time to compare the numbers from my last run at it in december
i will in the morning
i also still need to find the true value on the weather deal
dg
this is it
i am leaving the office for the rest of the morning
i will return after lunch
dg
his list does not include any of the transport positions
it also includes some deals with the chicago office that should not be included in the deal value
dg
please take notice of the red cells
these tagg numbers were incorrect and i have changed the cells to the correct tagg deal number
all of the deals on this list have been moved to the bankrupcy book
dg
sorry
i've got a ubs meeting all day
catch you later
i was looking forward to the conversation
dg
here is the file
it contains only financial trades in the active ng-price book
also these are only price
basis
index
and gas daily values
they don't contain any options
i will get another book set up so we can move only positive net value deals with counterparties
let me know if you have any questions
dg
the file was too big to email
it contains all financial deals
p,b,i,gd
in the active ng-price book
it does not contain any option deals
i will set up the new books so that we can move the net positive deals by counterparty
let me know if you have any questions
it is saved in o:/_dropbox
dg
susan
i need to set up some books for the estate
ed mcmichael wants to separate some of the existing deals into two books
please let me know if there is anything else you need to complete this
i need these as soon as possible
thanks for your help
dg
i just got an out of the office resopnse from susan
will you please begin the process
please let me know if there is anything you need from me
thanks dg
nevermind
we are just going to use an existing book
thanks
dg
attached is a long list of counterparty names to move from ng-price into ena-wt-socal
please move only financial deals only
please let me know when this is complete
thanks
dg
cecilia
in addition to moving the deals detailed in my previous email
please move only financial deals with the same counterparties from ng-pr-opt to ena-wt-socal
i realize it's a big list
but how long will the entire process take
if you have any questions
please let me know
thanks
dg
done dg
these have been moved to the bankruptcy book
dg
send me a final list of who will be trading on your desk
thanks
dg
thanks dg
i put storey for all of ruscitti's products
dg
this is done
dg
elena
yesterday's list of in the money cp's did not change
we will forward a list of out of the money cp's shortly
we will also send it the list so that they can begin moving them to another book
there are appox 0 cp's so the move will take some time
dg
better watch out for hunters dg
well
have you been taken care of
dg
i just got the latest and greatest
storey lewis williams assuming this is accurate
i would like to get from you
as soon as the decisions have been made
what products/regions each trader will be assigned to
this is not only for eol setup
but also for curve files and p&l/position reporting
there will be two people
not including myself to run the central books
so i also need to begin thinking about who will be running each book
thanks
dg
no gulf coast
dg
kristi and i planned on going also
is that ok
we got a dog this weekend
a mutt at traders village
the kids named him titan
they are pretty excited
how was you're weekend
the gd options
both calls and puts
are booked year round
they are all in n0.0
n0.a
n0.b
n0.0
and n0.0
i will begin looking at the unwind problem
dg
as long as accounting doesn't have a problem with it
i don't see why not
the p&l will probably need to be redone for the 0st
jan
and 0st
feb
it just depends on what deals change
if it is only annuities
then only last day will need to be recalced
dg
this is the last file i sent dierdre
it has four tabs
one summarizes the monthly cash flow into two columns
peoples deal and perc deal
the monthly values are pv'd
the perc tab is the lagrasta deals
the peoples deal is broken into two tabs
baseload sale and transport
the baseload sale includes all of the price fixing deals as well as the index
$.0 deal
transport is just that
i hope this helps
dg
everything is lumped together
meaning price
basis
and index
in that file
dg
i wanted to communicate further about a refinancing loan i submitted
thanks
transaction id 0 product id 0 did not book correctly
it is a two leg deal
the first leg is a gd index deal and the price component has the wrong book
it has ab-pwr-st-gd and should be fb-cent0
the second leg is a f0f deal and it put the wrong value in the price component and basis component
previous nights price settle should be in price and $.0 should be in basis
the deal has $.0 in price and $.0 in basis
dg

hello you guys
well i hope you have dad doing some of the cleaning
you know how he always has an opinion but yet no participation
anyway i hope you're doing fine
i'm fine and about to depart to dallas tx for the weekend
i'm meeting some of my old military friends for a big party this weekend
i'm really looking forward to this party
it's due to a college football game
oklahoma university vs the university of texas
and has been going on for about six years now
the guy throwing the party is working hard to make it a tradition and so far he has done a very good job
the party gets bigger every year and i think this year will be the biggest
there are people flying in from all over the country
flying now after everything that has happened isn't scary to me but now the waiting period for both check in and security has increased substantially
it's a big pain but obliviously needed
i'll talk to you guys soon
go ut
paul ps we haven't found a place in vail
but we are still looking
what weekend
i will be in san antonio
tx from 0/0-0/0
so if it's this weekend i'll be out of town
but
if not let's party
here is the updated version
i think that chick gave me something
i serious
updated hot list
i totally agree
i was extremely stupid
i'm not kidding
i already have a funny sensation just like i used to get when i was back in okc
what was i thinking
my mom is having a party
she has this party every year
the average age of the party goers is about 0
at least i can get drunk on my mom nickel
and you know at that age those girls put out
unfortunately it's their hip that puts out
or should i say
gives out
i'm sure you guys know about clay basin
anyway kitchen just called and said we have 0 days to get all the gas out of the interruptible storage account about 0,0
so get your f@%&*+ing gas out of the ground
paul
that's funny i saw that original picture and was wondering what the hell was ging on
we thought it was bs
now i know
what have you been up to
we buy san juan
but we do not have any gathering
my pick for this week is the vikings
when are you setting me up with your hair dresser
bill
look this diagram over it may be a little confusing so if you have any questions give me a call
paul
when i first saw the picture i did think it had a chance of being real
until everyone else said it was a knock off
i was a little puzzled as to how anyone found the camera
so at least i had my doubts
so you want to stay in calgary another year
hello
i'm back in the office today
well i see you have to eat crow
i didn't get a chance to watch the game but i saw cu play kansas st
and cu looked good
i even think cu has a good chance of beating ut in austin this weekend
as far as petrogulf goes
in the mean time before the great expansion
do they have the right to go to questar or any other interstate pipeline delivery points
i think they can take their gas in kind at questar/bird canyon
but i'm not sure
and finally
are you still available for dinner wednesday night
i just got paid so i'm looking to take you some place nice
yes
i am bribing you
paul
the deal was done with field services and we should change our deal ticket
counter party
to reflect that
thanks paul
paul
i do not know where dead horse is but as far as glen rock is concerned
i believe the index market to be around cig index minus $.0
we are currently trying to do these sort of index deals for the winter and one year time periods
anything after that is anyone's guess
if you need anything else don't hesitate to ask
hope all is well
and watch out for cu
paul
bob
what about me picking two winning teams last weekend
can you send me the latest updated version of the pool
also what about lunch later this week so i can get you your money
tell larry we are going to party friday
so he better go along
paul
i will call her
i need to give my hair about two weeks to grow out
has she started to date again
i thought she had given up on men after her divorce
when are you going to get your hair cut
i've got a date with karen this week
well at least i think i do
have you talked to larry about friday
excuses
excuses the reason you lost was that your team scored less points than the team you were playing
it's that simple
anyway as for dinner
what about staying downtown and meeting around 0:0 pm
if that's too late we can meet earlier
the only thing i know that is healthy is sushi
which isn't my favorite but i'd go if that's a big thing for you
or
we can come up with other ideas
i'm wide open
i'll eat anything except for thai
the lady i'm dealing with at petrogulf is clueless
the guy i used to deal with is gone and she is new to this area of the business
since i'm so nice and receptive to her feelings
i decided to help
but i'm sure you already know this about my personality
i'm really not trying to bs you with my emotional side
i will tell her i can buy the gas into questar
if you believe that to be the case
all those other delivery points need processing arrangements
don't tell richard stewart anything about this conversation or your buying dinner
that's funny
yes i'm still alive
and if you want let's think about lunch next week
i just got back in town last night and i'll be busy all week
if lunch dosen't work out next week
we are having a happy hour on the 0th
i don't know where yet but tell everyone
how are things with you
that party on saturday night sounds fun
i've got plans friday but nothing on saturday
is this the friend that was dating all those guys while she is married
yeah that party sounds fun
count me in
where do you live and what night is this ipams reception
please look this deal over throughly as we are getting very close to closing with these guys
i will be giving both of you a call this morning to answer and final questions you may have
thanks paul
what time should i meet you at your house on saturday
i'm not going to the reception tonight
shoot me back directions to your house
here is what about we have been showing kennedy oil
let's look to try and meet early rather than later
but who knows
also what about lining up properties between $0,0 and $0,0
then weeding them out based upon age and number of bedrooms
0
if you can shoot us the listings first so mark and i can narrow them down to around 0
thanks paul
0:0 isn't that early
what kind of a party will this be
will there be a lot of people
and what time is it over
please disregard all previous emails this is the right one
i hope
please send them again so we can line them up
ok
i'm in
should i just show up at your house
at 0:0
i'm looking forward to saturday
thanks for inviting me
since you don't want to be the first person at the party you can kill time by giving me a tour of your house
i printed the email that has all the information
so i'll plan on calling you sometime saturday and then meeting you at your house at 0:0
let's talk saturday
here's my home phone number
0
0-0
and my cell
0
0-0
should we bring anything
beer is fine with me
so you have to drive greg around all day saturday
that should be a perfect time to talk to him about his wife's fondness with other men
and since russ is going to the party will there be a fight
this party is going to be exciting
ruth
here is the amendment to the purchase contract
please look it over
it contains all the transportation options we have talked about and provides us the flexibility we need to re-price the cig index piece if there are additional future opportunities
i will be giving you a call to make sure you have received this amendment and to answer any questions you may have
paul
bob
this week i pick the colts
i'm meeting karen tonight for dinner
so i'll tell you how that goes
she made a comment about you yesterday
your name came up and she said
that bob
i said
i thought you and bob were friends
and she said
oh that bob
so i figure she's mad at you for
you know the
twins
anyway i won't say anything
so don't worry
we moved the happy hour to next friday 0th
so you better be there
maybe even
cool river
paul
i'm glad you had a good time
i did also
yes
keep me posted on your happy hour
i talked to bob this morning and explained your frustrations and that you have him on your s___ list
so he said he would like to talk to you
so you see
once again i have served you well
p.s
i was kidding about bob
i want your adrenaline to flow
i thought it would help wake you up
gotcha
gerald
eric
in structuring
has this question on the wording of the kennedy amendment
i told him you
the master of wording
was ok with it
what do you think
paul ps i hope it closes today
hey you back
i'm sorry that i made you feel that way
don't take it for anything other than i was very busy
i have no problem being friends and even getting together
whenever
right now i'm in a position in my life where i just want to do what i want to do
i know that's very selfish but truthfully that's how i feel
i think after you get through with all the bs that's going on in your life you will understand where i'm coming from
so for now don't take anything i do personally
and feel free to call whenever you want
and

did you get my voice mail about the logistics of tomorrow night
yes you are
so does that work
for me to meet you at the restaurant at 0:0
here is the latest on our search for a new condo
search over
due to the recent drastic fall in the enron stock price
$0 in jan
to $0.0 today
we have postpone our search
so we will have to look for a place to stay
rental rates may be too expensive in vail
so we may have to look else where
we are off to a late ski season this year
it's november 0th and it is very warm here
i'll start looking for leads on housing
i also have a paid trip to cancun in february the 0st
0th
keep me posted on everything
hey jack needs to only talk to me
and
what color are you wearing
i would hold on enron stock for now
i think it is a long term buy but i don't see anything good on the immediate horizon so i think you may get a better price if you wait
are you wearing jeans tonight
yes i'm going to the luncheon today
i also brought jeans
but i too am wearing a skirt so i won't deprive you of a look at my legs
hello
how are you today
i talked to alicia she is going to talk to you then provided everything is cool
which i think it is
she'll buy the tickets and i'll pay mark
so
i've got you covered
what do you have going on friday
want to come over to my house and play
i'll be out the majority of the day but write me back
paul
what is the plan for tomorrow for lunch
do you want to meet me downtown
i'll be out the majority of the day
talk to you soon
paul
i'll forward you these emails when i get them
the concert was great
we had box seats so we drank for free
which is always a plus
as far as enron goes we definitely need this dynegy deal
what's up with you this weekend
we are going to the wine tasting thing on saturday
right
what about friday night want to play doctor
debra
i haven't been involved in these final rounds of contact changes so please get with gerald so we can get this contact out the door
paul
gerald
can you get with debra on this contract i don't know why she is still jacking with this
how's everything else going
oh
i called darrin on those credit figures that will be needed for that amendment to the kennedy oil contract
has he called you
paul ps our trip to vegas isn't looking great right now
i briefed scott
+0 into wic
+0 cig wind
both at the mid
i'm thinking about the 0 a0
they start in the low 0's
i think i'll take out a loan and secure it with enron stock and stock options
this is a test to see if you receive this email
good luck
do you want to meet for lunch wednesday
then spend the night
or at least until you have to leave
we can hot tub
i was meaning for you to come down wednesday night
i have lunch plans already
sorry
is that ok
hey
where are you
did you get my last email
paul
i was wondering where you were
i've got tickets to the broncos
game on sunday
would you want to go
also
i need to get back to working on buying gas delivered off the jonah system
so can we talk about delivery points and rates
hey what are you up to today
are you still planning on meeting me for dinner
paul
yeah baby
that hits the spot
i'm looking forward to it also
i may not do the ski training class tonight
i'm worried about my ankle
so
if i don't i'll be ready around 0:0
i'll keep you posted
let's talk later
when you get a chance call me
dear abby says
call her
hunt her down
if you don't want her i'll take her or at least i'll take her after you
the latest at enron is business as usual
at least that's what they want us to believe
i think we will be effected eventually
but it will take time for dynegy to figure out what they have
i don't think anything will change for us until at least the middle of next year
hopefully they send some of these enron directors to jail
nothing new with me
i've got pictures of robin
she's the girl you met at the rock bottom in broomfield
i think you should see
i promise
in fact why don't you and bob take us to the rio on friday so we can drink
i mean forget about our troubles
plan on 0:0
studlet
i received this email from karen taylor at duke field services
i have been working with her on gathering deals whereby ena could purchase 0rd party gas on the jonah gas gathering system
as you can see
a numerber of our larger trading counterparties are not willing to trade with us
but are unwiling to tell us directly
i hope this is a short term problem
as most of the larger counterparties account for the majority of our transactions
i've included the second part of the email to show you both that i am willing to extend myself in whatever manner to bring value to the once mighty enron
ps i haven't been able to close any deals with karen
but i feel that i am very close
hey thanks for the thanksgiving invitation
i thought i would die from exhaustion if i had to drop one more hint
i'll either whip up one of my famous gourmet dishes or stop off at the liquor store for wine
and if i do bring wine it will be the very best box wine 0/0 has to offer
but in either case i will not be bringing any of my hotties
i'm having them all sent out for chemical bathes so they will be clean for the holidays
thanks again paul ps at dinner
see if you can seat me next to nadine
i'll owe you
hello yourself
i did fall back asleep
in fact i even overslept
but i feel good today
real good
i'm in
what will felicia be wearing
well at least that was all you guys buried
i know you don't like these types of jokes
but i couldn't resist
did he or didn't he
you decide
it was a little boy sucking his finger standing next to a dog whose tail is straight up and his butt is hanging out
the caption read did he or didn't he
how do you feel today
sore
i hope
i want to be the man
please let me
really
ha ha ha
i thought that part about the teeth out was interesting
here's one that's clean
craig
can you please get with john cogan on our need for all wire transfer backup
we will need the detail of all wire transfers sent to ena for payment on the cig and psco assets
you can reach me at 0 0-0
thanks paul
mara
this is updated
i'll be using this hot list
thanks paul
i know i whant to find that girl
good morning
i do feel better today
i think being outside yesterday brought out the worst in my cough
good luck in your talks
hey
what's up with you
i have been out all day so i just got in
what's new
who is telling you that they
love you
now wait a minute i think your getting in too deep here
i have always or at least have reserved the right to see other people
so
don't freak out
or i'll spank you
paul
that's good
is that at the broncos
game
did i upset you
i hope i didn't tell you anything you didn't already know
this is a gas daily call deal
the deal is still alive and underway
the volumes have been taken to zero due to the fact that csu has not called on any gas
lately
please get with tyrell harrison on the confirmation as this deal is still valid
thanks paul
as you all understand the state of our trading condition
this email is to inform you of another two counter parties who have explained to me why they cannot do business with us at this time
dominion e
p and england energy will no longer sell us gas
until they see clear direction and can accurately predict the outcome of the dynergy/enron merger
they both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved
i'm sure you both are seeing this type of thing first hand
i feel like i'm back in high school trying to date without a car
they said it then like they say it now
it's not you paul
we just feel we would be better off if we found someone new
paul ps i have signed the document and have fed ex'ed it back to houston
test
yes
completely crippled
he had to leave his car and take a taxi
the existing position with these guys is that we have been buying gas month to month
0,0/d from england energy
and 0,0/d from dominion e&p
i'll keep you posted on additional conversations
that was funny
i laughed my ass off
sorry i didn't call you
i left my cell phone at the office
have a happy thanksgiving
yes i had a good weekend

steve
does anyone have the exact volume vented
thanks
lynn
gary is right
but if ngts is the only contract
they will take the swing
or is pioneer saying they want to take the swing
if pioneer wants to do the swing
maybe they could do a contract to cover the swing volume only

thanks
lynn
wanted to give everyone an update on the status of the new report format for the morning meeting
the report is completed for all information except
storage operational capacity current and accum imbalances the group working on this feels they will have all pieces of information available and the report completed by june 0
0
the above referenced fields have been a challenge to get the data base populated as needed
but this group has done an excellent job in striving to give us an accurate report and not giving up on possibilities
as you are aware
gary and darrell have already started using the report and we have changed how we report outages and allocations
storage will change once the new report is completed
don powell and dale ratliff have been an excellent resource and very helpful to ensure we get the product we need
if you have any other questions or any concerns about not getting the new report before june 0th
please let me know
thanks

an update on our change for the storage allocation
several questions have come up over the weekend
the weekend crew is documenting the questions
i have left mike bodnar and john buchanan a phone mail message to research the questions and concerns on monday
then we will group with storage and determine what changes need to be made
one change we talked about on the sunday morning call with storage is to be able to use sbs on the non allocated portion of storage
ie
if we are allocating injections
then withdrawals should still use sbs
if we are allocating withdrawals
then injections should still have access to sbs
mike bodnar will pursue this enhancement further
thanks

we reviewed the attached recommendation and wanted to pass on an idea to you
on nng
we are trying to ensure new or existing meters do not come on without a schedule volume to ensure proper billing
since tbs
on nng do not always have a scheduled volume tied to it
we may need to ensure the volume is covered at the zone level by the shipper
do you think this is something the measurement desk could help the field with
we certainly would be glad to help in any way on the scheduling side
this is especially important for new meters as we go through the billing process
just a thought
thanks
lynn
it's a surprise
we had a choice of 0 different sizes and ava is checking on some info for us
thanks
lynn
mike

i reviewed our analysis of the swing for july 0th this morning in the meeting
high level recap is
0,0 due to building line pack from monday's gas day 0,0 day to day payback and i/c shortages
the bulk of this was to repay norval and valero sprayberry about 0,0 from the previous day
0,0 due to market area overtake
this includes 0,0 of mid am imbalance plus 0,0 spread over abc
d and ef
in looking at lsf
we were not able to determine that any one zone over pulled
it looked to be pretty evenly distributed
0,0 due to 0% tolerance on power packs
0,0 the total swing was 0,0
the difference of 0,0 is a combination operational adjustments
hopefully this helps to identify some of your concerns
if you have any questions
please let me know

to answer #0
kim hardman and/or delaine kurth may be added to the cc on the letter
the reason i mention delaine is jerry knight
who works for delaine
is the person that has been calling robert benningfield asking for the status of the 0
0 adjustment
thanks
lynn
fyi
thanks
lynn
ranelle
john and michelle
thought i would send this statement to you and see if this helps simplify our answer to your question
the question is
how is mdq used in the nomination system to ensure we do not double up on mdq volumes when we have split paths
i.e
nom on same contract from
0
mid 0 to bushton inlet and from
0
bushton outlet to demac
for nominating purposes
mdq of contract = primary firm + alternate firm up to the mdq
anything over the mdq will be overrun and charged at the it rate
point mdq needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point
example
if the field mdq is 0,0
then we will
0
total the reciepts nominated on the contract
0
compare the total nominated to the contract mdq
then the shipper will get firm
primary and alternate
up to their contract mdq
anything over will be overrun at it rate
if anyone has any other questions
please let me know
thanks
lynn
is the volume at the inlet and outlet of bushton factored into any mdq total
gerry if you are not the person to help us on this
please let me know who
also in talking with mary darveaux she said if you use the same contract at the inlet and outlet of bushton
you do double your mdq
therefore
if you have 0,0 mdq you can only nominate 0,0 to inlet and 0,0 at outlet
gerry
can we run a quick report to see if there are any contracts that are identical on the inlet and outlet of bushton
if she is right
then we have not had anyone nominate on the same contract
if i have confused you
let's discuss
thanks
lynn
richard
can you check this out for me
did the team drop the ball on this one
thanks
lynn
we need to discuss asap this morning
legale
would you be available at 0:0

i scheduled a meeting per drew's request with my team that deals with the bushton area
drew is going to review with them how we need to be careful about using the term
ptr calculation
for measurement error adjustments
we thought it would be good for you to attend as well
i want the team to understand how important it is that they are communicating accurately when talking about bushton issues
hopefully you can attend
although i think the meeting may be scheduled to 0:0 a.m
instead of 0:0
hopefully that works for you

thanks
lynn
terry
please plan on attending next wednesday's meeting for the demonstration on the handheld devices
thanks
lynn
i would like to recap my understanding and the
to do's
from the meeting yesterday
0
after november 0
measurement would no longer adjust any tbs physical volumes unless there was a ppa directly influencing said tbs
0
measurement would check to see if they had a deduct meter they were using in the end user process
since the meeting we have discovered that the deduct meter is in gva
therefore no checking needs to be done
0
gas logistics would check with it on possible enhancement
if necessary
for negative volumes to the tbs
we have talked with it and this would be a major enhancement and have to be done with the new system
0
procedures need to be documented to handle negative numbers created by the ldc giving measurement an end user actual volume greater than the tbs connected to nng
0
measurement and gas logistics agreed that all measured volumes including end user point volumes would be
housed
in pgas
after further discussions in gas logistics
our recommendation is that neither measurement or gas logistics accomodate a negative number
if the ldc gives measurement an end user volume greater than the tbs the following should happen
0
measurement should either
a
call the ldc and let them know they cannot accept a volume at an end user point higher than their tbs
b
or measurement can call jodie floyd on the gas logistics measurement desk and jodie will call ldc with the same info
0
if measurement does not get an answer before measurement close
then measurement will use the number equal to the tbs for the end user point
gary and ellis
you may want to have more discussions on this topic
i would be glad to regroup if you want
i have put a call into marketing to talk to them about our concerns on this issue
also raetta and jodie are going to go ahead and call wisconsin gas and get their explanation of why an end user point would be greater than the tbs
hopefully it is just a measurement error
we will let you know the outcome
if there is something i missed
please let me know
thanks
lynn
joni
we will see if there is enough interest in doing a make-up session
we will certainly be glad to
thanks
lynn
deb
yes i need to know who is attending and how many

please update my email lists
thanks
lynn
we have reviewed the assignments jean sent out earlier in the week
at this time i think the split is ok
i would like for you to put in writing for me the following
who is your back up on critical reports
etc when you are out
i would like for that back up to be someone that was not on your original team
this may help us address the issue of the two
old
teams merging
for example i am assuming if one rep has the shipper business and another rep has the operator business for the same company
then those two reps should back each other's desk
randy janzen is backing up jean adams desk on lamar power plant since he has aep which is shipper that does business at the lamar plant
scott and kathy support each other's desk since kathy has elpaso as a shipper and scott has elpaso as operator
harry and joe support each other on oneok since harry has bushton and joe has the gathering the areas of concern in relation to day to day business are below and need specific back up reps
gpm monthly pricing report lamar power plant true ups pvr report oneok gathering reporting nng administrative contracts sps power plant true up conoco power plant true up mops daily report the high profile shippers/operators that need specific back ups are as follows
reliant west texas gas if there is any confusion with the email
please do not hesitate to call terry or myself
thanks

if you get comfortable with the direction these emails are going

penny and michelle
i met with larry berger
terry kowalke and raetta zadow this morning to review yesterday's meeting on the concerns for ddvc's at
small customer delivery points
on the southend of nng's system
through our discussions
here are a few ideas including some of yesterday's discussion
these ideas may be somewhat out of the norm
but we thought we would at least throw them on the table
0
if oneok cannot supply these deliveries
then oneok should agree with us to lift the requirement that the supply has to be upstream of the delivery in the bushton universe
it can still be required in the
bushton universe
just not as restrictive as it is today
0
if oneok cannot supply these deliveries
then oneok should allow us to do storage true ups at 0:0 a.m
at the end of the gas day to eliminate ddvc
0
if these deliveries are on firm contracts
can we sell them sms to cover these small volumes even though they are in the field area
0
richfield storage point
i am not sure it is even active
could we get oneok to agree to allow true ups if we are supplying the true up with gas coming from the richfield storage point
i am sure this alternative would need to include the storage group
we would be glad to participate in any future discussions
thanks
lynn
we rely on the information from the process responsibility meeting to post weekend coverage to the web
the coverage is posted by tuesday morning on the web
which is a commitment we have made to our customers
please ensure you do not change any coverage after the process meeting
you should have the right information going into monday's meeting
it does not look good to continually repost this information
if you have any questions
please let me know
thanks
lynn
ava

do you still want the report terry is doing each monday for the tw socal and west of throeau numbers
we started this report after switching to allocations before confirmations so we could track any possible
holes
in the pipe
so far the new process is working well and we were thinking about discontinuing this report unless you need it for stan's meeting
remember we give you the socal window and scheduled volumes as well as the west of thoreau scheduled volumes on the weekend notes

thanks
lynn
just to clarify britt's comments
harry is using nng's numbers for total imbalance
to split the imbalance among the third party shippers
we will continue to use oneok's allocation of actual volumes
the variance between oneok and nng will go to the oneok imbalance to tie to nng's ultra sonic measurement
thanks
lynn
shelley
i would appreciate any comments or feedback on the attached
i am trying to formulate my thoughts to be positive and get our message across

after talking with gerry
here is my second try at answering greg's question trying not to get to detailed
what do you think
jo
i apologize
your right
the imbalances are short to the pipe
to be sure we are all on the same page
all the deliveries off of nng on this report took more gas than scheduled and the receipts gave us less than scheduled
thanks
lynn

tracy and steve weller on the eppi issues

thanks
lynn
should we be talking about make up when we are allocating belleville
i had a question from alliant
you
nng and anr both have room to deliver gas to anr
even though you are doing an allocation
why can't you schedule more delivery at anr
wouldn't that help the system
i think it would be hard to explain that we are doing make up
allocating and not letting a shipper increase deliveries all at the same time
what do you guys think
thanks
lynn
frank
where are we on the review you were heading up after our conference call with dave and measurement

i hope that is ok
thanks
lynn
mary and dari
here is my answer
are you comfortable with it before i send it to the shipper
thanks
lynn answer
if an interruptible shipper is bumped in the intraday 0 cycle
the shipper will keep 0/0 of their scheduled volumes
shippers schedule becomes their actual unless they are the operator of the point
therefore
they would not encounter a ddvc penalty
if the shipper is the operator
nng looks at total scheduled volumes vs total actual delivered volumes and determines if a ddvc is appropriate
the ddvc is based on the difference between total scheduled and the actual delivery at the point
if you have any additional questions
please do not hesitate to give me a call

gary and caroline
as of today
we have emailed a list by station
0 and/or 0 day charts
to the measurement group which needs to be read for ppa's to correct the daily volumes fro the following shippers
midamerican
0 stations
it is my understanding you have already 0 of the 0
interstate power
0 stations wisconsin power and light
0 stations in order for gas logistics to keep track of the ones that need to be corrected
we would like for measurement to send us updates on the following information asap
0
which station numbers have or have not been corrected for october
0
how many october charts have been received and how many are outstanding 0
provide status of november chart information
gas logistics needs the october corrections in the system by december 0th
which is the time frame for the first prior period run
this is important for us to be able to review the prior period invoices
as you find there are missing charts
if we can be of assistance in calling the field
please let us know
this way
the measurement group can concentrate on reading the charts
we appreciate your assistance and help in tracking these prior periods and helping each of us to keep focused to get these prior period corrections done by the next months billing
if you have any questions
please let rick or i know

we have looked at an automated way to take care of this issue
so far we have not found an exceptable change
it is a timing issue with true ups from the previous day which are not completed before the current day calcuations are done
it is an item we are manually monitoring today
but we are continuing to look for a better method

could you check into having a business objects report done for all groupings with the following information
previous cyclce nomination current nomination confirmation schedule confirmation piece is not critical if that prolongs getting the report
the reason for the report
gas control needs to know what changes have taken place and this will prevent the teams from doing a manual report
if we already have access to something similar to this
let me know
i would like to be able run this report during cycle
i think i am probably asking for the moon
but that would be the best time for gas control
thanks

she was not excited about the monthly cash out requirement
i told her if we could come to agreement we would make it effective 0/0/0
if we could not come to agreement
we would continue the same methodology as we have today
which is oneok picks one of the transportation contracts at the cargray tailgate to take any variances

it is ok to let the deposit rollover on #0 if there is no interruption in rent
the file is updated and renamed as gas basis mar 0
$0 for the yard seems like enough for up to 0.0 hours
how long did it take him
i think $0 should be enough
use page setup under the file menu to change from portrait to landscape if you want to change from printing vertically to printing horizontally
also try selecting fit to one page if you want your print out to be on only one page
use print preview to see what your print out will look like before you print
the truck might need new sparkplugs at around 0,0-0,0 miles
a valve adjustment might do some good
it has idled very high for the last 0,0 miles
but it has never broken down
glad to hear about the good deposit for this week

if we add both balances together the total is $0,0
i can spread it over 0 or 0 months
0 month payout would be $0/month
0 month payout would be $0/month
your choice
i would like it if you could work 0/hrs each friday for another month or so
does $0/hr sound fair
we can apply it to the loan
phillip

do you need mary to come in on any more fridays
i think i can guess your answer
i might stop by this friday
phillip
scott
i emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company
i think i know the answer to your questions but i want to get the exact details from him
basically
they will offer energy online at a fixed price or some price that undercuts the current provider
then once their sales are large enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit
the risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage the price risk
this is my best guess
i will get back to you with more
phillip
no
is your voice healed or are you going to use a real time messenger
what is gis info

what do you think about selling jdsu and buying sdli
also can you look at eog as a play on rising oil and gas prices
thanks
phillip
mac
thanks for the research report on eog
here are my observations
estimated gas prices $0,0,0/0,0,0= $0.0/mcf actual gas prices are around $0.0/mcf higher and rising
recalc of eps with more accurate gas prices
that is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices
i think crude price are undervalued by the tune of $0/share
current price 0 nat
gas 0 crude 0 total 0 can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate
to me this looks like the best stock to own also can you send me a report on calpine

the rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better
see if you can add these modifications
0
use a formula in column e
add the value in column c to column d
it should read =c0+d0
then copy this formula to the rows below
0
column h needs a formula
subtract amount paid from amount owed
0
column f is filled with the #### sign
this is because the column width is too narrow
use you mouse to click on the line beside the letter f
hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider
0
after we get the rent part fixed
lets bring the database columns up to this sheet and place them to the right in columns j and beyond

just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development opportunities
i stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street
that were built by reagan lehmann
0 units were sold for around $0 million
$0,0/duplex
i spoke to reagan and he indicated that he had more units under construction that would be available in the 0's
are the units he is selling significantly different from yours
he mentioned some of the units are the 0 floor plan
my bid of 0.0 million is almost $0,0/duplex
as far as being an investor in a new project
i am still very interested
call or email with your thoughts
phillip
jeff
you would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood
i am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which i might become involved with creekside
are you in the business of brokering properties or contacts
is your position based on a legal or what you perceive to be an ethical issue
did you propose we look at developing a project from scratch
i am not prepared to pay more than 0.0 for sagewood yet
phillip
why is aeco basis so low on the list
is nwpl mapped differently than aeco
what about the correlation to nymex on aeco
the reason the benchmark report shows net selling san juan is that the transport positions were rolled in on 0/0
this added 0 shorts to san juan and 0 longs to socal
before this adjustment we bought 0 san juan and
jeff

what is up with burnet
phillip
george
here sales numbers from reagan
as you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot
the 0/0 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the units you are selling
at 0.0 mm
my bid is
0/sf higher than his units under construction
i am having a hard time justifying paying much more with competition on the way
the price i am bidding is higher than any deals actually done to date
let me know what you think
i will follow up with an email and phone call about cherry creek
i am sure deborah yates let you know that the bid was rejected on the de ville property

below is a list of questions that keith and i had regarding the westgate project
ownership structure what will be the ownership structure
limited partnership
general partner
what are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what capacity
regarding ownership and liabilities
who owns the land
improvements
who holds the various loans
is the land collateral
investment what happens to initial investment
is it used to purchase land for cash
secure future loans
why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement
when is the 0,0 actually needed
now or for the land closing
investment schedule
investment return is equity repayment the return of the original investment
is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits are distributed
debt which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral is associated with each loan
improvement construction are these the only two loans
looks like it from the cash flow statement
terms of each loan
uses of funds how will disbursements be made
by whom
what type of bank account
controls on max disbursement
internet viewing for investors
reports to track expenses vs plan
bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses
what is the relationship of creekside builders to the project
do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a general contractor and paid gain out of profits
do you or larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits
design and construction when will design be complete
what input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units
what level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting
does creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors
vendors
and other professionals
such as always getting 0 bids
payment schedules
or reference checking
are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to use
names
these questions are probably very basic to you
but as a first time investor in a project like this it is new to me
also
i want to learn as much as possible from the process
phillip

what is the latest with pg&e
we have been having good discussions regarding eol
call me when you can
x0 phillip
nymex expiration is during this time frame
please reschedule
liane
as we discussed yesterday
i am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the el paso san juan monthly index
a single buyer entered the marketplace on both september 0 and 0 and paid above market prices
$0.0-$0.0
for san juan gas with the intent to distort the index
at the time of these trades
offers for physical gas at significantly
0 to 0 cents
lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation
additionally
these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for san juan
we have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from september 0 to september 0
these are the complete list of trades from enron online
eol
enron's direct phone conversations
and three brokerage firms
amerex
apb
and prebon
please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary
we have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of san juan based on several spread relationships
the two key points from this data are as follows
0
the high physical prices on the 0th
0th
0.0,0,0
are much greater than the high financial trades
0.0,0.0
on those days
0
the spread relationship between san juan and other points
socal
northwest
is consistent between the end of september and october gas daily
it doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different
i understand you review the trades submitted for outliers
hopefully
the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 0.0's and these trades are outliers
i wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index
it is enron's belief that the trades at $0.0 and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index
it is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business
please contact me anytime i can assist you towards this goal
sincerely

regarding patti sullivan's contributions to the west desk this year
her efforts deserve recognition and a pbr award
patti stepped up to fill the gap left by randy gay's personal leave
patti held together the scheduling group for about 0 month's by working 0days a week during this time
patti was always the first one in the office during this time
frequently
she would be at work before 0 am to prepare the daily operation package
all the traders came to depend on the information patti provided
this information has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size of the west desk positions
please call to discuss cash award
phillip
andy
i spoke to john l
and he ok'd one of each new electronic system for the west desk
are there any operational besides ice and dynegy
if not
can you have your assistant call me with id's and passwords
thank you
phillip
andy
please assign a user name to randy gay
thank you
phillip
bob
patti sullivan held together the scheduling group for two months while randy gay was on a personal leave
she displayed a tremendous amount of commitment to the west desk during that time
she frequently came to work before 0 am to prepare operations reports
patti worked 0 days a week during this time
if long hours were not enough
there was a pipeline explosion during this time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on patti
she didn't crack and provided much needed info during this time
patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr
specialist
based on her heroic efforts
she deserves a pbr
let me know what is an acceptable cash amount
phillip
george
the san marcos project is sounding very attractive
i have one other investor in addition to keith that has interest
some additional background information on larry and yourself would be helpful
background questions
please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in creekside
please list projects completed during the last 0 years
include the project description
investors
business entity
please provide the names and numbers of prior investors
please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on recent projects
with regard to the proposed investment structure
i would suggest a couple of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between creekside and the investors
preferable investment structure
developers guarantee note
not investors
preferred rate of return
0%
must be achieved before any profit sharing
builder assumes some risk for cost overruns
since this project appears so promising
it seems like we should tackle these issues now
these questions are not intended to be offensive in any way
it is my desire to build a successful project with creekside that leads to future opportunities
i am happy to provide you with any information that you need to evaluate myself or keith as a business partner
sincerely

we linked the file you sent us to telerate and we replace >0 equals $0 to a 0.0 heat rate
we applied forward gas prices to historical loads
i guess this gives us a picture of a low load year and a normal load year
prices seem low
looks like november np0 is trading above the cap based on nov 0 loads and current gas prices
what about a forecast for this november loads

the back office is having a hard time dealing with the $0 million dollars that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped from the office of the chairman
is your understanding that the west desk will receive origination each month based on the schedule below
the office of the chairman agrees to grant origination to the denver desk as follows
this schedule represents a demand charge payable to nbp energy pipelines by the denver desk
the demand charge is $.0/mmbtu on 0,0 mmbtu/day office of the chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense
let me know if you disagree

steve
i am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail
if you need to call with questions my home number is 0-0-0
as far as recommendations
here is a short list
0
examine ldc's incentive rate program
current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost
the result is that the ldc's sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index
this creates a shortage in later months
0
california has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand
investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally
specific questions should include
0
why in march
0-may
0 weren't total system receipts higher in order to fill storage
0
why are there so many examples of ofo's on weekends that push away too much gas from socal's system
i believe socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand
they repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than their injection capablity
but injected far less
0
similar to the power market
there is too much benchmarking to short term prices
not enough forward hedging is done by the major ldcs
by design the customers are short at a floating rate
this market has been long historically
it has been a buyers market and the consumer has benefitted
call me if you need any more input
phillip
jeff
everything should be done for closing on the leander deal on the 0th
i have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out tomorrow
when will more money be required
escrow for roads
utility connections
other rezoning costs
what about property taxes
the burnet land lost its ag exemption while i owned it
are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this property
can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes once the property is rezoned
do we need to find a farmer and give him grazing rights
what are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and annexing
i am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and american multifamily walking on this deal
so i just want to make sure we are pushing the process as fast as we can
phillip

i would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project i described to you last week
the project is a 0 unit apartment complex in san marcos
there will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a couple of other investors involved
as i mentioned last week
i would like to find interim financing
land
construction
semi-perm
that does not require the investors to personally guarantee
if there is a creative way to structure the deal
i would like to hear your suggestions
one idea that has been mentioned is to obtain a
forward commitment
in order to reduce the equity required
i would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this nature are normally financed
specifically
the transition from interim to permanent financing
i could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be important to banks
i am faxing you a project summary
and i will have the builder/developer email or fax his financial statement to you
let me know what else you need
the land is scheduled to close mid january
phillip allen
gentlemen
i continue to speak to an attorney for help with the investment structure and a mortgage broker for help with the financing

questions about 0/0 rentroll
there were two deposits that were not labeled
one for $0 and the other for $0
which apartments
0a or #0
utility overages for #0 and #0
where did you get these amounts
for what periods
what is going on with #0
do not evict this tenant for being unclean
that will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money and time remodeling
i would rather try and deal with this tenant by first asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like leaky pipes
if that doesn't work
we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor
then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property
this tenant has been here since september 0
i don't want to run them off
i check with the bank and i did not see that a deposit was made on tuesday so i couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank
is this right
has the deposit been made yet
a rentroll for jan 0th will follow shortly
phillip
frank
did you receive the information about the san marcos apartments
i have left several messages at your office to follow up

here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages
there are alot of overages
it will probably get worse this month because of all the cold weather
you need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap
this needs to be handwritten on all new leases
i am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet
we also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap
i will write something today
wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start collecting
phillip
george
here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit
check my math
but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation
at permanent financing $0.0 would be paid
leaving only
0 to pay out in the 0st year
since almost 0% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment
i feel the 0/0 is a fair split
however
as i mentioned earlier
i think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract
just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas
0
fixed construction profit of $0.0 million
builder doesn't benefit from higher cost
rather suffers as an equity holder
0
+0% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan
$0/sq ft
phase 0 complete in november
+0% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
0% equity for over budget and behind schedule this way if things go according to plan the final split would be 0/0
but could be as favorable as 0/0
i realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon
feel free to call me at home

here is a rentroll for this week
i still have questions on #0,#0
and #0
lucy
#0 and #0 are fine
#0 paid weekly on 0/0
then he switched to biweekly
he should have paid 0 on 0/0
two weeks rent in advance
instead he paid 0 on 0/0
he either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the middle of his two weeks
he is only paid one week in advance
this is not a big deal
but you should be clear with tenants that rent is due in advance
here is an updated rentroll
please use this one instead of the one i sent you this morning
finally
can you fax me the application and lease from #0

that is good news about leander
now for the stage
i would like to get it sold by the end of march
i have about $0k invested in the stagecoach
it looks like i need to get around $0k to breakeven
i don't need the cash out right now so if i could get a personal guarantee and jaques craig can work out the partnership transfer
i would definitely be willing to carry a second lien
i understand second liens are going for 0%-0%
checkout this spreadsheet
these numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes
however
i am very concerned about the way it is being shown
having lucy show it is not a good idea
i need you to meet the buyers and take some trips over to get more familar with the property
my dad doesn't have the time and i don't trust lucy or wade to show it correctly
i would prefer for you to show it from now on
i will have the operating statements complete through december by this friday
phillip
george
keith and i are reviewing your proposal
we will send you a response by this evening
phillip
lucy
what is the latest
write me a note about what is going on and what issues you need my help to deal with when you send the rentroll
phillip
jeff
before you write off the stage
a few things to think about
0
operating expenses include $0,0 of materials for maintenance and repairs
plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs
there are only 0 units a lot of his time is spent on repairs
0
what is an outside management firm going to do
a full time onsite manager is all that is required
as i mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning
another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care
if you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite
0
considering #0
#0 $0,0 noi is not necessarily overstated
if you want to be ultra conservative use $0,0 at the lowest
0
getting cash out is not a priority to me
so i am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash
a 0% note actually attractive
see below
my job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property
this property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort
sales price 0,0 transfer fee 0,0 cash required 0,0 cash flow 0,0 cash on cash 0% these numbers are using the conservative noi
if it comes in at $0k then cash on cash return would be more like 0%
this doesn't reflect the additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years for a higher price
do you want to reconsider
let me know
phillip
testing
sell low and buy high
nice
how much
are you trying to keep the economy going

that's twice as valuable as your car
can't you get a used one for $0
george
the probability of building a house this year is increasing
i have shifted to a slightly different plan
there were too many design items that i could not work out in the plan we discussed previously
now
i am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center
one wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 0 kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs
the other wing would have a garage + guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs
this plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living
i am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west
the center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts
i am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building
i don't know if you can imagine the house i am trying to describe
i would like to come and visit you again this month
if it would work for you
i would like to drive up on sunday afternoon on feb
0 around 0 or 0 pm
i would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we didn't have time for
i can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan
call or email to let me know if this would work for you
phillip allen ps
channel 0 in houston ran a story yesterday
feb
0
about a home in kingwood that had a poisonous strain of mold growing in the walls
you should try their website or call the station to get the full story
it would makes a good case for breathable walls
got your email
i will let jacques know
i guess we can work out the finer points next week
the bank here in houston is dealing with their auditors this week
so unfortunately i did not hear from them this week
the are promising to have some feedback by monday
i will let you know as soon as i hear from them
phillip
susan hours are out of hand
we need to find a solution
let's meet on monday to assess the issue phillip
i would like to go to this meeting
can you arrange it
lucy
please fix #0 balance by deleting the $0 in the
rent due
column
the other questions i had about last week's rent are
#0 only paid 0 of their 0 on 0/0 then paid nothing on 0/0
what is going on
#0 looks like she was short by 0 and still owes a little on deposit #0 switched to weekly
but paid nothing this week
why
i spoke to jeff smith
i think he was surprised that we were set up with email and msn messenger
he was not trying to insult you
i let jeff know that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the property
occasionally
a buyer might stop buy without jeff and you can show them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is
regarding the raise
$0/week plus the apartment is all i can pay right now
i increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet but i think your wages equate to $0/hr and that is fair
as gary and wade continue to improve the property
i need you to try and improve the property's tenants and reputation
the apartments are looking better and better
yet the turnover seems to be increasing
remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants
it is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move in that are not on the lease
when the manager has a houseful of guests
i realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and your daughter being a teenager
but you need to put in 0 hours and be working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running an errand for the property
i am not upset that you asked for a raise
but the answer is no at this time
we can look at again later in the year
i will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend
phillip
susan
raised your issue to sally beck
larry is going to spend time with you to see if he can live without any reports
also some it help should be on the way
phillip
jeff
i am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 0st lien on the stage in 0 years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 0%
there are several reasons that i won't commit to this
exposure to interest fluctuations
the large cash reserves needed
and the limited financial resources of the buyer are the three biggest concerns
what i am willing to do is lower the second note to 0% amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to 0 years
the existing note does not come due until september 0
that is a long time
the buyer may have sold the property
interest rates may be lower
i am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note
guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far
can you clarify the dates in the contract
is the effective date the day the earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete
hopefully the buyer can live with these terms
i got your fax from the new braunfels buyer
if we can't come to terms with the first buyer i will get started on the list
email or call me later today
phillip
jeff
my target is to get $0 back out of the stage
therefore
i could take a sales price of $0k and carry a second note of $0k
this would still only require $0k cash from the buyer
after broker fees and a title policy
i would net around $0k cash
you can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $0 or higher with the terms described in the 0st email
do you want to give the new braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal
phillip
send it to ina rangel she can forward it to appropriate traders
there are too many to list individually
jacques
can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract
the key business points are
0
investment is a loan with prime + 0% rate 0
construction contract is cost plus $0.0 million 0
the investors
loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid
0
all parties are gp's but 0 out 0 votes needed for major decisions
0
0/0 split favoring the investors
with regard to the construction contract
we are concerned about getting a solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes costs
then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses
keith and i would like to oversee the bookkeeping
the builders would be requred to fax all invoices within 0 hours
we also would want online access to the checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing but invoices were not being submitted
let me know if you can draft these agreements
the gp issue may need some tweaking
phillip allen
i will email you an updated operating statement with nov and dec tomorrow morning
what did the seguin doctor think of the place
how much could i get the stagecoach appraised for
do you still do appraisals
could it be valued on an 0 or 0 cap
lucy
here is the rentroll for this friday
sorry it is so late
there are a few problems with the rentroll from 0/0
0
i know you mentioned the deposit would be 0.0 which is what the bank is showing
but the rentroll only adds up to 0
the missing money on the spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below
0
#0 did he pay the rent he missed on 0/0
0
#0 did he miss rent on 0/0 and 0/0
0
#0 missed on 0/0 and has not paid the 0 from 0/0
my guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 0/0 rentroll
you may have sent me a message over the
chat
line that i don't remember on some of these
i just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the bank deposit
will have some time today to work on a utility letter
tried to call wade last night at 0:0 but couldn't reach him
will try again today
i believe that a doctor from seguin is going to make an offer
did you meet them
if so
what did you think
phillip
lucy
here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject to caps
i wrote it as if it were from you
it should come from the manager
it is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there unit is when they move in
this needs to be written in on their lease
when you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up
have my dad read the memo before you put it out
you guys can make changes if you need to
next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and refrigerators
we have to get this done next week
i will email you a form to use to record serial numbers
the prospective buyers want this information plus we need it for our records
something to look forward to
it is 0 pm and i have to leave the office
please have my dad call me with the information about the units at home 0-0-0
he will know what i mean
talk to you later
phillip
colleen
i checked the transport model and found the following extrinsic values on january 0nd versus february 0
if these numbers are correct
then we haven't increased the extrinsic value since the beginning of the year
can you confirm that i am looking at the right numbers
phillip
thanks for the website
no
i am on msn messenger
lucy
here is the 0/0 rentroll
the total does not equal the bank deposit
your earlier response answered the questions for #0,0,0,0a
and 0
but the deposit was $0 more than the rentroll adds up to
if the answer to this question lies in apartment 0,0
and 0
can you update this file and send it back
now i am going to work on a rentroll for this friday
i will probably send you some questions about the 0/0 rentroll
let's get this stuff clean today
phillip
lee
my fax number is 0-0-0
please fax me a loan application that i can pass on to the buyer
phillip allen
lucy
thanks for clearing up the 0/0 file
moving on to 0/0
here are some questions
#0 it looks like he just missed 0/0&0/0 of $0
i can't tell if he still owes $0 on his deposit
#0 i show she missed rent on 0/0 and still owes $0
#0 try and follow up with tomas about the $0
hopefully
he won't have a bad reaction
#0b missed rent
#0 has she paid any deposit or rent
#0 missed rent
forward reg dickson's resume to ted bland for consideration for the trading track program
he is overqualified and i'm sure too expensive to fill the scheduling position i have available
i will work with cournie parker to evaluate the other resumes
phillip

here is the application from spb
i guess they want to use the same form as a new loan application
i have a call in to lee o'donnell to try to find out if there is a shorter form
what do i need to be providing to the buyer according to the contract
i was planning on bringing a copy of the survey and a rentroll including deposits on monday
please let me know this morning what else i should be putting together
phillip

jeanie
lavorato called me into his office to question me about my inquiries into part time
nice confidentiality
since i have already gotten the grief
it would be nice to get some useful information
what did you find out about part time
leave of absences
and sabbaticals
my interest is for 0
phillip
george
please send the latest cost estimates when you get a chance this morning
phillip
after meeting with george and larry
it was clear that we have different definitions of cost and profit
their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials
then there is a layer of
construction management
fees of 0%
there are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money
but i think the majority of it is profit
finally the builders profit of 0.0 million
keith and i were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit
after all
if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors
we were definitely not intending to insert an additional 0% fee in addition to the superintendent costs
george claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using
i reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but i don't think the construction management fee is included
george gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard
i will review and let you know what i think
the gp issues don't seem to be a point of contention
they are agreeable to the 0 out 0 approval process
let me know if you have opinions or sources that i can use to push for only true costs + 0.0 million
phillip
yes please
that would we very helpful
thanks
phillip
the spinning bikes are so much better than the life cycles
would you consider placing several spinning bikes out with the other exercise equipment and running a spinning video on the tv's
i think the equipment would be used much more
members could just jump on a bike and follow the video any time of day
let me know if this is possible
phillip allen
tomorrow is fine
talk to you then
phillip
you can fax it anytime
but i saved the spreadsheets from the previous estimates
what will be different in the fax
george
the numbers on your fax don't agree to the first estimate that i am using
here are the two files i used
phillip
george
i can take a day off the week i get back from vacation
any day between march 0th-0th would work but friday or thursday would be my preference
regarding the differences in the two estimates
i don't want to waste your time explaining the differences if the 0st forecast was very rough
the items i listed moved dramatically
also
some of the questions were just clarification of what was in a number
let's try and reach an agreement on the construction manager issue tomorrow morning
phillip
lucy
here are few questions regarding the 0/0 rentroll
#0 has she actually paid the $0 deposit
her move in date was 0/0
it is not on any rentroll that i can see
#0 explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #0 and when she will start paying on #0 #0 since he has been such a good tenant for so long
stop trying to collect the $0 in question
#0 missed rent
are they still there
#0 i see that she paid a deposit
but the file says she moved in on 0/0
has she ever paid rent
i can't find any on the last three deposits
#0 have the paid for february
there is no payment since the beginning of the year
#0 you email said they paid $0 on 0/0 plus $0 in late fees
but i don't see that on the 0/0 or 0/0 deposit
the last three questions add up to over $0 in missing rent
i need you to figure these out immediately
i emailed you a new file for 0/0 and have attached the last three rentroll in case you need to research these questions
i will not be in the office next week
if i can get connected you might be able to email me at pallen0@hotmail.com
otherwise try and work with gary on pressing issues
if there is an emergency you can call me at 0-0-0
phillip
please find attached the pro formas for the project in san marcos
thanks again
don
i was out last week
regarding the montana supply
you can refer them to mark whitt in denver
let me know when you want to have the other meeting
also
we frequently give out quotes to mid-marketers on fred lagrasta's desk or enron marketers in new york where the customer is ees
i don't understand why your people don't contact the desk directly
phillip
i have not received the aircard 0 yet
phillip

did you put frank hayden up to this
if this decision is up to me i wouldconsider authorizing mike g
frank e
keith h

what do you think
phillip
i was not going to do the ms this year
thanks for the offer though
all is well here
we went to colorado last week and the kids learned to ski
work is same as always
how are things going at new power
is there any potential
phillip
daryl
here is the file that includes the proforma
unit costs
and comps
this file was prepared by the builder/developer
the architect that has begun to work on the project is kipp flores
they are in austin
thank you for your time this evening
your comments were very helpful
i appreciate you and greg taking a look at this project
phillip allen
i faxed you the signed amendment
i just refaxed
please confirm receipt
reagan
here is the cost estimate and proforma prepared by george and larry
i am faxing the site plan
elevation
and floor plans
phillip
darrell
today i let the builder/developer know that i would not proceed with his excessively high cost estimates
as he did not have the funds to take on the land himself
he was agreeable to turning over the land to me
i would like to proceed and develop the property
my thought is to compare the financing between bank one and fha
i would also like to compare construction and development services between what you can do and a local builder in san marcos that i have been speaking with
making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to be in order
i am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural work to date
once again the architect is kipp florres and the engineer is quattro consultants out of buda
let me know if you have an opinion about either
i look forward to working with you
talk to you tomorrow
phillip
lucy
here is a rentroll for this week
what is the outstanding balance on #0
it looks like 0 + 0
this week
0
i don't think we should make him pay late fees if can't communicate clearly
#0 still owe deposit
#0 what day will she pay and is she going to pay monthly or biweekly
have a good weekend
i will talk to you next week
in about two weeks we should know for sure if these buyers are going to buy the property
i will keep you informed
phillip
george
i didn't receive the information on work completed or started
please send it this morning
we haven't discussed how to proceed with the land
the easiest treatment would be just to deed it to us
however
it might be more advantageous to convey the partnership
also
i would like to speak to hugo today
i didn't find a quattro engineering in buda
can you put me in contact with him
talk to you later
phillip
jacques
george finally sent me some information
please look over his email
he wants us to buy him out
keith and i think this is a joke
we still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to determine if it has any value going forward
i don't believe the architect work will be of any use to us
i don't think they deserve any compensation for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were proposing was unsupportable by the market
my version of a buyout is attached
i need your expert advise
i am ready to offer my version or threaten to foreclose
do they have a case that they are due money for their time
since their cost and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract
i wouldn't think they would stand a chance
there isn't any time to waste so i want to respond to their offer asap
call me with your thoughts
phillip
here is the buyout spreadsheet again with a slight tweak in the format
the summary presents the numbers as only $0 in concessions
gentlemen
today i finally received some information on the status of the work done to date
i spoke to hugo alexandro at cuatro consultants
the property is still in two parcels
hugo has completed a platt to combine into one lot and is ready to submit it to the city of san marcos
he has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey
in addition
he has begun to coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the smaller parcel
as well as
beginning the work on the grading
hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete
the total cost of his services are estimated at $0,0 of which $0,0 are due now for work completed
we are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land
if we can continue to use cuatro then it would be one less point of contention
hugo's number is 0-0-0
i thought you might want to contact him directly and ask him some questions
i spoke to him about the possibility of your call and he was fine with that
now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by kipp flores can be used
keith and i appreciate you meeting with us on sunday
we left very optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project
call me with feedback after you speak to hugo or with any other ideas about moving this project forward
phillip
lucy
somehow my email account lost the rentroll you sent me on tuesday
please resend it and i will roll it for this week this morning
phillip
thanks for the information
it would be helpful if you would send the detailed worksheet that you mentioned
i am surprised to hear that the only restricted shares left are the ones granted this january
i have always elected to defer any distributions of restricted stock
i believe i selected the minimum amount required to be kept in enron stock
0%
are you saying that all the previous grants have fully vested and been distributed to my deferral account
thank you for looking into this issue
phillip
i also need to know the base salaries of jay reitmeyer and monique sanchez
they are doing the same job as matt
lucy
here is the rentroll
my only questions are about #0
#0
and #0 missed rent
any special reasons
it looks like there are five vacancies #0,0,0a,0,0
if you want to run an ad in the paper with a $0 discount that is fine
i will write you a letter of recommendation
when do you need it
you can use me as a reference
in the next two weeks we should really have a good idea whether the sale is going through
phillip
jacques
i think we reached an agreement with george and larry to pick up the items of value and not pay any fees for their time
it looks as if we will be able to use everything they have done
engineering
architecture
survey
appraisal
one point that is unclear is they claim that the $0,0 in extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like earnest money would be applied
i looked at the closing statements and i didn't see $0,0 applied against the purchase price
can you help clear this up
assuming we clear up the $0,0
we need to get the property released
keith and i are concerned about taking over the bishop corner partnership and the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities
on the other hand
conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was clean
what is your inclination
call as soon as you have a chance to review
phillip
i realize you are disappointed about the project
it is not my desire for you to be left with out of pocket expenses
the only item from your list that i need further clarification is the $0,0 worth of extensions
you mentioned that this was applied to the cost of the land and it actually represents your cash investment in the land
i agree that you should be refunded any cash investment
my only request is that you help me locate this amount on the closing statement or on some other document
phillip
jacques
still trying to close the loop on the $0,0 of extensions
assuming that it is worked out today or tomorrow
i would like to get whatever documents need to be completed to convey the partnership done
i need to work with the engineer and architect to get things moving
i am planning on writing a personal check to the engineer while i am setting up new accounts
let me know if there is a reason i should not do this
thanks for all your help so far
between your connections and expertise in structuring the loan
you saved us from getting into a bad deal
phillip
ina
can you help me approve this request
phillip
jacques
here is larry lewter's response to my request for more documentation to support the $0,0
as you will read below
it is no longer an issue
i think that was the last issue to resolve

just a note to let you know i will be out of the office wed
0/0
until thurs
0/0
the kids are on spring break
i will be in san marcos and you can reach me on my cell phone 0-0-0 or email pallen0@hotmail.com
i was planning on stopping by to see hugo elizondo on thursday to drop off a check and give him the green light to file for replatting
what will change if we want to try and complete the project in phases
does he need to change what he is going to submit to the city
i spoke to gordon kohutek this morning
he was contracted to complete the soils study
he says he will be done with his report by the end of the week
i don't know who needs this report
i told gordon you might call to inquire about what work he performed
his number is 0-0-0
we spoke on the phone about most of these issues
talk to you later
phillip
larry
jacques has been working with claudia
i will check his progress this morning and let you know
phillip
steve
try bmckay@enron.com or brad.mckay@enron.com
jacques
the agreement looks fine
my only comment is that george and larry might object to the language that
the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the project
technically
that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required
did i loan them $0,0,0
i thought it was less
regarding exhibit a
the assets include
the land
architectural plans
engineering completed
appraisal
and soils study
most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants
i have been speaking directly to the architect
engineer
and soils engineer
i am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants
the obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above
do we need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset and give consideration of $0,0 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor
phillip
keith holst sent you an email with the details
greg
something that i forgot to ask you
do you know if hugo is planning to replatt using an administrative process which i understand is quicker than the full replatting process of 0 weeks
also let me know about the parking
the builder in san marcos believed the plan only had 0 parking spots but would require 0 by code
the townhomes across the street have a serious parking problem
they probably planned for the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms
phillip
reagan
here is a photograhph of the house i have in mind
specific features include
stained and scored concrete floors downstairs wood stairs two story porches on front and rear granite counters in kitchens and baths tile floors in upstairs baths metal roof w
gutters
no dormers
cherry or maple cabinets in kitchen
baths solid wood interior doors windows fully trimmed crown molding in downstairs living areas 0x0 wall on west side undecided items include
vinyl or aluminum windows wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room exterior stucco w
stone apron and window trim or rough white brick on 0-0 sides i have faxed you the floor plans
the dimensions may be to small to read
the overall dimensions are 0
x 0
for a total of 0 sq ft under roof
but only 0 of livable space after you deduct the garage
are there any savings in the simplicity of the design
it is basically a box with a simple roof line
call me if you have any questions
0-0-0
phillip
john
mike is fine with signing a new contract
subject to reading the terms
of course
he prefers to set strikes over a 0 month period
his existing contract pays him a retention payment of $0,0 in the next week
he still wants to receive this payment
phillip
please provide a temporary id phillip
greg
here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates
cost per square foot seem too low for construction $0.0/sf
gross
$0/sf
rentable
what do the cost for on-site general requirements
$0,0
represent
will you review the builders profit and fees with me again
you mentioned 0% why is profit only 0%
why are the architect fees up to $0k
i thought they would be $0k
what is the $0k of profit allowance
is that the developers profit to boost loan amount but not a real cost
total closing and application costs of 0k
that seems very high
who receives the 0 points
how much will be sunk costs if fha declines us
where is your 0%
are you receiving one of the points on the loan
what is the status on the operating pro forma
my back of the envelope puts expenses
after debt service that would only leave $0k
the coverage would only be 0.0
talk to you this afternoon
phillip
jacques
would it be ok if i signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and architect
they have both sent me agreements
the only payment that george and larry had made was $0,0 to the architect
i have written personal checks in the amounts of $0,0 to the architect and $0,0 to the engineer
i was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the partnership
i would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the partnership not with me
should i wait until the partnership has been conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership
let me know what you think
phillip
larry
jacques has sent a document to claudia for your review
just dropping you a line to confirm that you have seen it
phillip
reagan
thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence
below is a list of questions on the specs
0
is the framing lumber #0 yellow pine
wouldn't fir or spruce warp less and cost about the same
0
what type of floor joist would be used
0x0 or some sort of factory joist
0
what type for roof framing
on site built rafters
or engineered trusses
0
are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound
what type of insulation in floors and ceiling
batts or blown
fiberglass or cellulose
0
any ridge venting or other vents
power or turbine
0
did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 0 sides
i didn't know the difference between an apron and a stool
0
do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking
double plywood or hardi board underlay
0
on the stairs
did you allow for a bannister
i was thinking a partial one out of iron
only about 0 feet
0
i did not label it on the plan
but i was intending for a 0/0 bath under the stairs
a pedestal sink would probably work
0
are undermount sinks different than drop ins
i was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths
0
0 or 0 a/c units
i am assuming 0
0
prewired for sound indoors and outdoors
0
no door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets
0
exterior porches included in bid
cedar decking on upstairs
iron railings
0
what type of construction contract would you use
fixed price except for change orders
i want to get painfully detailed with the specs before i make a decision but this is a start
i think i am ready to get plans drawn up
i am going to call cary kipp to see about setting up a design meeting to see if i like his ideas
phillip i
no problem
cary
here is the picture of the house i have in mind
i was going for a simple farmhouse style to place on 0 acres near wimberley
a few points that might not be obvious from the plans are
there will be a double porch across the back just like the front no dormers
metal roof
0/0 bath under stairs overall dimensions are 0 by 0 what i am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen
more cabinets
maybe a different shaped island
and a way to enlarge the pantry
reagan suggested that i find a way to make the exterior more attractive
i want to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks
but i was thinking about bringing the left side forward in the front of the house and place 0 gable in the front
that might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco
also the front porch would be smaller
i have 0 bids from builders all around $0,0
i am ready to go ahead and have the plans done so i can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder
i just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work
as i mentioned my alternative is $0.0/ft
i thought that since i had a such a detailed sketch
you might consider the job for less than the $0,0 that reagan allowed
phillip allen
reagan
i am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts
are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap
what role would you play in obtaining financing
any experience with fha 0
d
loans
although your fees are lower than george and larry i am still getting market quotes lower yet
i have received estimates structured as follows
0%
onsite expenses
supervision
clean up
equipment 0%
overhead 0%
profit i just wanted to give you this initial feedback
i have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project
as you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate $0,0 of cash flow for a return of 0%
i am not thrilled about such a low return
i think i need to find a way to get the total cost down to $0,0,0 which would boost the return to 0%
any ideas
i realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you local connections
i am not discounting those services
i will be out of the office for the rest of the week
but i will call you early next week
phillip
jacques i am out of the office for the rest of the week
have you ever seen anyone miss as much work as i have in the last 0 weeks
i assure you this is unusual for me
hopefully we can sign some documents on monday
call me on my cell phone if you need me
phillip
my location is eb0c
jacques
the assets and liabilities that we are willing to assume are listed below

land preliminary architecture design-kipp flores architects preliminary engineering-cuatro consultants
ltd
soils study-kohutek engineering
testing
inc
appraisal-atrium real estate services liabilities
note to phillip allen outstanding invoices to kipp flores
cuatro
and kohutek additional consideration or concessions forgive interest due reimburse $0,0 for appraisal and $0,0 for partial payment to engineer let me know if you need more detail
phillip
do you have a distribution list to send this to all the traders
phillip
thanks for the response
i think you are right that engaging an architect is the next logical step
i had already contacted cary kipp and sent him the floor plan
he got back to me yesterday with his first draft
he took my plan and improved it
i am going to officially engage cary to draw the plans
while he works on those i wanted to try and work out a detailed specification list
also
i would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and speak to 0 or 0 satisfied home owners
i will be in san marcos on friday april 0th
are there any homes near completion that i could walk through that day
also can you provide some references
once i have the plans and specs
i will send them to you so you can adjust your bid
phillip
john
regarding the employment agreement
mike declined without a counter
keith said he would sign for $0k cash/$0 equity
i still believe frank should receive the same signing incentives as keith
phillip
jacques
the amounts needed to fill in the blanks on exhibit
b
are as follows
kipp flores-total contract was $0,0 but $0,0 was paid and only $0,0 is outstanding
george
larry paid $0,0 for the appraisal and i agreed to reimburse this amount
the total cash that keith and i will pay the sellers is $0,0
$0,0 appraisal and $0,0 engineering
i couldn't find any reference to this cash consideration to be paid by the buyers
let me know if i need to do anything else before you can forward this to the sellers to be executed
phillip
reagan
i sent you an email last week stating that i would be in san marcos on friday
april 0th
however
my closing has been postponed
as i mentioned i am going to have cary kipp draw the plans for the residence and i will get back in touch with you once he is finished
regarding the multifamily project
i am going to work with a project manager from san antonio
for my first development project
i feel more comfortable with their experience obtaining fha financing
we are working with kipp flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings
your bid for the construction is competive with other construction estimates
i am still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local relationships
i will get back in touch with you once we have made the final determination on unit mix and site plan
phillip allen
jed
thanks for the response
phillip allen
thanks for your help
lucy
here is the rentroll from last friday
the closing was to be this thursday but it has been delayed until friday april 0th
if you can stay on until april 0th that would be helpful
if you have made other commitments i understand
gary is planning to put an a/c in #0
you can give out my work numer
0
0-0 phillip
bruce
thank you for your bid
i have decided on a floor plan
i am going to have an architect in austin draw the plans and help me work up a detailed specification list
i will send you that detailed plan and spec list when complete for a final bid
probably in early to mid june
phillip
lucy
the spreadsheet looks fine to me
phillip
larry
it sounds like claudia and jacques are almost finished with the documents
there is one item of which i was unsure
was an environmental report prepared before the original purchase
if yes
shouldn't it be listed as an asset of the partnership and your costs be recovered
phillip
i will try and get my dad to take the appraiser into a couple of units
let me know the day and time
phillip
here is a simplistic spreadsheet
i didn't drop in the new generation yet
but even without the new plants it looks like q0 is no worse than last year
can you take a look and get back to me with the bullish case
thanks
phillip
i will email you with the insurance info tomorrow
the insurance company is
central insurance agency
inc policy #cbi0 contact
jeanette peterson the actual policy is signed by vista insurance partners
please try and schedule the appraiser for sometime after 0 p.m
so my dad can walk him around
i will be out of town on tuesday
what else do we need to get done before closing
phillip
how am i to send them the money for the silent second
regular mail
overnight
wire transfer
i don't see how their bank will make the funds available by friday unless i wire the money
if that is what i need to do please send wiring instructions
ina
can you please forward the presentation to mog
phillip
jeff
i am in the office today
any isssues to deal with for the stagecoach
phillip
the topic will the the western natural gas market
i may have overhead slides
i will bring handouts
chad
call ted bland about the trading track program
all the desks are trying to use this program to train analysts to be traders
your experience should help you in the process and make the risk rotation unnecessary
unless you are dying to do another rotation is risk
phillip
ina
can you please forward the presentation to mog
phillip
i still use this service
i still use this service
johnnie
thank you for meeting with me on friday
i left feeling very optimistic about the panel system
i would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design i showed you
in order to make it feasible within my budget i am sure it will take several iterations
the prospect of purchasing the panels and having your framers install them may have to be considered
however
my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor
i realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale
i just want to assure you that i am going to build this house in the fall and i would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built
please email your cost estimates when complete
thank you
phillip allen
i think chad deserves an interview
andrea
after reviewing bryan hull's resume
i think he would be best suited for the trading track program
please forward his resume to karen buckley
phillip
i think chad deserves an interview
have him send his resume to karen buckley in hr
there is a new round of trading track interviews in may
send his resume to karen buckley
i believe there will be a full round of interviews for the trading track in may
frank
the implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position
whatever the risk was prior should not matter
since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset
if the var calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted
phillip
it works
thank you
griff
it is bidweek again
i need to provide view only id's to the two major publications that post the monthly indeces
please email an id and password to the following
dexter steis at natural gas intelligence
dexter@intelligencepress.com liane kucher at inside ferc
lkuch@mh.com bidweek is under way so it is critical that these id's are sent out asap
thanks for your help
phillip allen
i just spoke to the insurance company
they are going to cancel and prorate my policy and work with the kuo's to issue a new policy
it works
thank you
are there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting
is there the potential for a surprise announcement of some sort of fixed price gas or power cap once the open meeting finally happens
gary
here is a photograph of a similar house
the dimensions would be 0'wide x 0
deep for the living area
in addition there will be a 0
deep two story porch across the entire back and 0
across the front
a modification to the front will be the addition of a gable across 0
on the left side
the living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the front porch
i don't have my floor plan with me at work today
but will bring in tomorrow and fax you a copy
phillip allen
ned
regarding the waha storage
the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value
the following assumptions were made to establish our bid
0% daily injection capacity
0% daily withdrawal capacity
0% fuel
injection only
0.0/mmbtu variable injection and withdrawal fees
also an undiscounted june 0 to january 0 spread of $0.0 existed at the time of this bid
bid for a 0 year storage contract beginning june 0 based on above assumptions
$0.0
mmbtu/month
$0.0/year
demand charges only
i am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not
please call or email with comments
phillip allen
i would look at properties in san antonio or dallas
ray
is there any detail on the gas cost proxy
which delivery points from which publication will be used
basically
can you help us get any clarification on the language
the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in california
phillip
gary
i have also been speaking to johnnie brown in san antonio to be the general contractor
according to johnnie
i would not be pay any less buying from the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within his region
assuming this is true
i will work directly with him
i believe he has sent you my plans
they were prepared by kipp flores architects
can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from the distributor
if you have the estimates worked up for johnnie will you please email them to me as well
thank you for your time
i am excited about potentially using your product
phillip allen
i would look at properties in san antonio or dallas
send to karen buckley
trading track interview to be conducted in may
tim
can you authorize access to the west power site for keith holtz
he is our southern california basis trader and is under a two year contract
on another note
is it my imagination or did the sarr website lower its forecast for mcnary discharge during may
it seems like the flows have been lowered into the 0 range and there are fewer days near 0
also the second half of april doesn't seem to have panned out as i expected
the outflows stayed at 0-0 at mcnary
can you email or call with some additional insight
thank you
phillip
send to karen buckley
trading track interview to be conducted in may
alan
you should have received updated numbers from keith holst
call me if you did not receive them
phillip
jim
is there going to be a conference call or some type of weekly meeting about all the regulatory issues facing california this week
can you make sure the gas desk is included
phillip
reagan
just wanted to give you an update
i have changed the unit mix to include some 0 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 0
kipp flores is working on the construction drawings
at the same time i am pursuing fha financing
once the construction drawings are complete i will send them to you for a revised bid
your original bid was competitive and i am still attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts
phillip
traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip
especially if you have to prepare a presentation
i would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings
i would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary
as far as the business meetings
i think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not
too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn
the meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format
my suggestion for where to go is austin
play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's
flying somewhere takes too much time
tim
mike grigsby is having problems with accessing the west power site
can you please make sure he has an active password
thank you
phillip
can you guys coordinate to make sure someone listens to this conference call each week
tara from the fundamental group was recording these calls when they happened every day
phillip
the west desk would like 0 analysts
the west desk would like 0 analysts
jeff
jacques craig will draw up a release
what is the status on the quote from wade
phillip
let me know when you get the quotes from pauline
i am expecting to pay something in the $0,0 to $0,0 range
i would like to see the quotes and a description of the work to be done
it is my understanding that some rock will be removed and replaced with siding
if they are getting quotes to put up new rock then we will need to clarify
jacques is ready to drop in a dollar amount on the release
if the negotiations stall
it seems like i need to go ahead and cut off the utilities
hopefully things will go smoothly
phillip
here is our forecast
here is our forecast
thanks for the update
this is very useful
jeff
i received the fax from velasquez masonry for $0,0
he is proposing to do work on nine buildings
from the memo from the city it sounds like 0,0,0
and 0 are the units that are at risk for collapse
i don't want to pay for any discretionary work
also
i am still waiting for a quote from another mason
i am willing to offer $0,0 toward the repair and removal of rock in return for the release prepared by jacques
with regard to the utilities i want to have them transferred on monday the 0st
that will be one month that the utilities have been in my name
it needs to be clear that i will net that month's electric and water against the $0,0 for the rock
if she is willing to take the money for repairs we should be able to wrap things up immediately
if not we will have to continue negotiations
but the utilities still need to be transferred
phillip
tim
thanks for the update
that is fine
jim
i read through the data request
we cannot provide several of the items that they requested
we do not break out our california deals into separate transport and commodity components
also the majortiy of our buys and sells net out without exchanging actual transport contract numbers
i know in the past becky c
has worked with our back office to pull the data directly from the system
let me know if i need to do anything to assist gathering the data
i would like to review the final product before it is submitted
phillip
kristin
have you seen any studies associated with the opinions that the $0b is not enough
i would like to see some calculations that multiply the net short by the power cost and compare that to the amounts collected through rates
phillip
adrianne
last night i spoke to two potential candidates for the trading track
emil carlsson and thomas considine
emil is currently tutoring at hofstra after leaving an option trading position
i would recommend bringing emil to houston for further interviews based on his technical knowledge
the biggest drawback was his current situation might show a lack of motivation
thomas was working as an equity market maker
he is interested in making a change to a job where he can develop more expertise
he is seeking to develop a better understanding of the market he trades
the trading track would be an excellent match for his desires
i would also recommend bringing thomas to houston for further consideration
phillip
john
managing var limits is essential and p&l penalties are a great way to achieve this
however
we need to find a way to impliment this method while minimizing negative side effects such as
0
discouraging aggressive trading
and
0
significant morale reductions caused by penalties which do not fit the crime
i still disagree with the $0 million fine for such a minor violation of our var limit
the punishment does not fit the crime
what message are you trying to send
the message being received is that we should trade less aggressively and leave several million dollars of headroom at all times
also locations such as socal
malin and pg&e should be avoided due to limited liquidity and potential volatility spikes
i know these are not your intended messages
i realize you have given the west desk significant leeway in the last few months regarding var
we have been making excellent progress towards var reduction in an environment in which the var calculation and tolerance are constantly changing
my suggestion for implementing a var control system that provides for penalties but gives traders room to probe for maximum var utilization is a warning for minor breaches
<$0,0
and penalties for violation of two or more consecutive days or initial violations greater than $0,0
the amount of the penalties should be documented in advance and should increase with the amount of the violation
please consider these suggestions
we want to play by the rules
but the rules need to be fair and known in advance
also
we are willing to accept these policy revisions retroactively and forget about the $0 million from this morning
phillip
sue
tim belden forwarded this message to me
can you please add mike grigsby
keith holst
frank ermis
and myself to your email distribution list
we are all holding significant gas positions in california and are greatly affected by any gas or power developments withing the state
with regard to socal's comments
do you have any additional information
this is quite a 0 from the presentations that socal has been giving to the cpuc and at other forums
until now they have been consistently stating that they will have plenty of gas
phillip
please remove from email

the release that jacques prepared provides for the payback of any utilities that i have been paying since 0/0
you might mention to them that we need to get the utilities settled up before we pay the $0,0
it might be a good idea to go ahead and have the utilities transferred so we can get the final amount since 0/0
also may 0th was supposed to be the 0st payment on the two notes
but i have not received payment on either
let's try and wrap this up this week
phillip
is amf willing to put up the additional earnest money and acknowledge june 0th as the day they were supposed to close or do they believe they are honoring the contract by closing on july 0th
of course
i would prefer to close as soon as possible
i received the fax from the stagecoach
i am willing to pay any small expenses like the phone bill incurred prior to april 0th
what is the status of the release and the utility transfer
phillip
do you want to send someone to this
tim
i know you looked into this before but we are still having issues with mike grigsby's access to the west power site
he can view some parts of the website but cannot view the heatrate information under the testing tab
does he have some sort of reduced access
our it
collin
looked at mike's access but claimed that it must be on the portland end
sorry to bother you with this again
but can you help
phillip
stephanie
i need to be able to trade us gas spreads
specifically the new west region products spreading malin and pg&e vs
socal
please make this change and call me back this morning
thank you
phillip
please send me their resumes
karen
can you tell me when matt smith and jason wolfe are scheduled to move to new rotations
also what are their next assignments
i would like to move matt smith into an assistant trading rotation and have jason move in to matt's current rotation in the fundamentals group
phillip
greg
i typed up this resume from scratch in 0 minutes
will it do
if you work for the same company for 0 years your resume tends to get dusty
let me know if i need to beef it up or if i need to include any financial information
i wanted you to review it before i sent it to montez
if it is ok please forward to montez
jeanie
please change janie tholt's ranking to a 0
jeff
i don't understand what you want me to do with this letter
regarding the utilities
you and i know that i have had the right to shut off the utilities to a property i don't own for sometime now
i did not do that because i wanted to stay on good terms with the kuo's while negotiating the release
i had the utilities taken out of my name yesterday
the city of seguin informs me that the meters were read yesterday and the final bill will be mailed to me next week
then i can compute the amount that the kuo's owe me for utilities and send them a check for the rock repairs
please let pauline know that she needs to go down to the city and take care of the deposit by friday or the power may be disconnected
the utilities are already in her name
in my mind the utilities were never a bargaining chip
rather
you and i are paying the $0,0 in exchange for the release
regarding the transfer of ownership into a limited partnership
i will most likely be agreeable to this but i want to review all the loan documents with jacques and ensure that there is still a personal guarantee on the two notes
i expect to have that done by friday
i would like for her to sign the release today
but if she won't sign until i consent to the limited partnership then the release will have to wait until friday
as far as the utilities go
i made the transfer for two reasons
0
i need to know the amount that i have paid to net against the $0,0 and 0
i had the right to take the utilities out of my name and i didn't want the balance to get out of hand
i will call you when i am comfortable consenting to the limited partnership
phillip
faith
two changes need to be made to the list
first
jason wolfe is a trading track analyst on the west desk
second
matt lenhart should be an associate as his duties and responsibilities are identical to monique s
jay r
and randy g
i don't know if this change can be made administatively or if i need to bring this up during prc
please let me know
phillip
jeff
here is a short letter that indicates i will give consent contingent to the items we discussed
i didn't make any reference to why i took the utilities out of my name
i left that for you to explain to her that we need to have a cutoff date so we can calculate the final amount
i hope you can make her understand that i have not been obligated to keep these in my name for some time
since my attorney is out of town until monday and i doubt that she has all the documents in place to actually place the property in a limited partnership
certainly not the 0st lienholders consent
we will have to work together next week

thanks for the update on the foundation design

carlos
can you help me with several 0 exchange questions
i spoke to your office and they thought it best that i address my questions to you directly
here is my situation
i purchased a 0 acre tract in leander about 0 months ago
i have a contract to sell the property which should close around july 0th
i expect to realize a gain of around $0,0
see calculations below
sales price
0,0,0 purchase price 0,0,0 profit 0,0 the cash generated at the sale will be close to $0 million after repayment of a loan
i am interested in protecting this gain through a 0 exchange
i am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that might qualify
first
there is a 0 acre tract that was purchased by bishops corner
ltd for $0.0 million six months ago
i lent the partnership the cash to buy the land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily project
we could not come to terms for the development
so the partnership was conveyed to me
the loan still exist
i am an 0% limited partner
another investor is the other limited partner
we have set up a corporation to be the general partner
we intend to develop the property
is there a creative way to use the land purchase in a 0 exchange
second
i have a small tract in new braunfels under contract for $0,0
i am applying for fha financing for a 0 unit apartment complex and hope to receive an invitation letter prior to closing
i would need to place this property in a limited partnership eventually
but is there a way to buy the property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the irs then move it to a lp
if neither of these deals qualify
i would still like to find another piece of property
my two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding property in my own name
is there a way to insure during the 0st year then move a different entity
thank you in advance for your help

i understand you spoke to jacques craig about the consent and assignment documents
maybe the attorneys can work this out faster than we have
i spoke to the city this morning and the final bills are to be mailed out today
so i should have an amount on wednesday
i will email and fax the amount and the supporting bills as soon as possible
maybe we can close out the release this week and consent to the assignment pending 0st lien holder approval
i have a favor to ask you
i received the check from pauline that was due may 0th
however
i have misplaced it
can you ask her to put a stop on her 0st check and send me another
net of any costs for the stop payment
if you would prefer for me to call her myself
i will
it seems that communicating through you is working well
thanks for all your help
phillip
i will send checks directly to the vendor for any bills pre 0/0
i will fax you copies
i will also try and get the payphone transferred

i spoke to john mckay about sumas
his views seem well thought out
he is short the summer due to the prospect of another 0,0+/day of supply coming back by july 0st
see attached spreadsheet
in order to displace aeco gas coming down to kingsgate his target for sumas value is aeco
0.0
but since his forecast for aeco is that they will have 0 bcf left in storage at the end of march and current cash is trading down 0.0 or wider versus a rest of summer curve around down 0.0
he is expecting the aeco curve to widen to down 0.0
therefore
his ultimate target for sumas is down 0.0 versus the current market of down 0.0 his winter sumas shorts are based on his analysis of total supply capacity versus peak demand
see attached spreadsheet
sumas still commands the premium of an isolated market during the winter but the supply numbers don't support that premium
in conclusion
i think i will sell some more summer sumas for my book
0
i will stay after the meeting to talk about mike g's issues
is there any chance that the request to gather data on financial trades is implemented
our understanding was that the commission had no jurisdiction over financial markets
is the problem that the energy dwr purchased is above market and not needed by core or just above market
if the energy is needed by core wouldn't the deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and qf supply
if the energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that recoup that amount over time
once again there would be a ctc type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered

here is the recap of the utilities i have paid since closing
i am going to send the original utility bills to the kuo's
i have attached a summary of the utilities i paid since the 0/0 closing
the total is $0,0.0
do you need to incorporate this number is the release or can i just net this amount against the $0,0 and pay them the difference
do they have an executable copy of the release
i would like to settle up on the repairs
utilities
and the release now
i don't want these issues to get bogged down with the 0st lienholders approval of any assignments

thank you

have you received the assignment letter from marcus kolb
this letter makes it sound like the assumption is just between the kuo's and success real estate
don't they need something signed from southern pacific bank
i certainly don't plan on signing any assignment documents before the release is signed and settled
has their attorney contacted you with any revisions
is the ball in their court

i noticed in the san macos record that some zoning changes were underway
first
i wanted to make sure our property would not be affected
second
part of the land that is being rezoned is targeted for
seniors
i would like to explore the possibility of developing a seniors project
not assisted living
maybe we could look at the property mentioned below
as i have mentioned
my goal is to invest around $0 million in real estate over the next two years
at the current rate that amount would cover the equity requirements for 0 projects assuming i continued to have minority interest partner like keith
here is the article
sector 0 plan geets boost from council by murlin evans
staff reporter home and landowners in northwestern san marcos will soon have a revised future land use plan to consult for development in the area
the san marcos city council on first reading unanimously approved changes to its sector two land use plan
changes over a year in the making and covering a 0.0 square mile area
intended to encourage development that is both acceptable and appropriate for the region
significant to the revisions are those affecting a controversial tract owned by resident jack weatherford at the corner of ranch road 0 and the newly named craddock avenue
bishop street
weatherford filed suit against the city earlier this year as a result of various city commissions declining to approve re-zoning plans the landowner says were in synch with land uses deemed acceptable in the current sector two plan
proposed changes to weatherford's 0 acre tract
which have no direct effect on existing zoning
deletes the 0 acres of high density residential allowed in the current plan and adds instead two additional acres of commercial
one additional acre of medium density residential
and seven additional acres of low density residential
in addition
the total eight acres of the weatherford tract proposed for medium density residential is suggested limited to town home
single-family
or multi-family senior housing development in the revised future land use plan
the total 0 acres of commercial allowed on the property is proposed limited to
community commercial
a yet to be established zoning district
loosely defined as to ensure more compatibility with existing residential neighborhoods complete with buffering and landscaping
a 0 foot greenbelt buffer is also proposed to separate the commercial areas from residential ones in the revised plan
however
a curb cut envisioned to access this property from rr 0 drew some concern from council members over the potential traffic hazards it may pose on the busy state highway
proposed are two curb cuts
one accessing the proposed weatherford commercial area from rr 0 and one from craddock avenue
while the state highway department and city would have input into the plans for where the eventual curb cut would go
city planning director ron patterson said the allowance of the two curb cuts was a compromise between the wishes of area landowners and weatherford
council member jane hughson supported the idea of removing the rr 0 curb cut allowance from the sector plan
but evaluating a developer's plans for possibly locating one in the area as development proceeds
i'd rather say
no
and if someone comes us with a really good idea
look at it then
hughson said
councilman ed mihalkanin expressed similar safety concerns over the final placement of the curb cut
it seems to me we're asking for a bunch of accidents to happen there
mihalkanin said
a motion by hughson to amend the plan to exclude curb cuts from rr 0 into the property failed on a 0-0 tie vote with san marcos mayor david chiu and council members joe cox and paul mayhew voting against the move
council member martha castex tatum was not present at the meeting
curb cuts or not
the sector two plan earned support from several residents and neighborhood representatives
who said the plan was a good compromise
oak heights resident john mcbride
who has been an active critic and participant in the sector two revision process
especially concerning the weatherford tract
said the revised plan better served the interests of the city as a whole
this is not a victory for one side or the other
said mcbride
alluding to a fallout between neighborhood groups opposed to weatherford's initial plans for his property
but a victory for the city of san marcos
we started out with all r-0
we've come a long way

i sent a copy of an article discussing oil and gas stocks

glad to hear their attorney contacted you
i agree that we will not consent to the assignment unless the release and utility issue are resolved
but i would prefer to get the utility and release resolved without waiting for the 0st lienholder to consent

i finally got in touch with the department that handles stock options
unfortunately
they are committed to paine webber for the foreseeable future
the two primary reasons they gave for not wanting to explore a new relationship were an exclusive contract with paine webber and the reporting and tax interfaces that are already in place
they are less concerned with the services that paine webber doesn't offer the employees such as lending against vested options
it was worth a try

the key to analyzing media stocks is
automobiles
yes
it's true
suggest sg cowen media analysts ed hatch
peter mirsky and eric handler
in this week's media money manager
automobile advertising is the largest category in domestic consumer media spending and accounts for about 0%
or $0 billion
the stock studiers say
using data from competitive media reporting
by early fall
the analysts expect the car companies
to ramp spending back up to support new model introductions and to regain market share from the imports
such an event
says the sg cowen crew
could mark a significant catalyst for companies that depend heavily on tv advertising

san marcos will have over 0,0 units
if the 0 excess units in 0 were distributed over the entire population that would push occupancy down by 0%

thank you
phillip
this is a list of common mistakes
however
as the group works together to create exercises and scenarios for the simulation many additional ideas will be generated
i don't want to hold up this document
i just want everyone to be aware that it is not all inclusive
phillip
kirk
this document is fine
kirk
i would modify this document slightly
the first section is titled
introduction to risk management
and the second section is
hedging instruments/risk management products
however
many of the bullet points in the first section are describing hedging instruments that belong in second section
i would limit the introduction to types of risk
identifying risk
and examples when risks are not hedged
then the second section should contain all the details of hedging tools
definitions of derivatives and how they can be used to manage the risk in the first section would be in this section
the third section would include the roles and accounting basics
you might want to include the commodity 0 info here
at least gas and power

i like these homes much better than the one from earlier this week
i like the steeper pitched roof and the high glass windows in the top of the gables
plus these seem a little bigger
i like the floor plan of the hoover plan better than the van gendersen
the kitchen should be bigger
you could take some space from the sewing room and add an island to the kitchen

i went to the title company yesterday and as instructed by irwin i signed the deed of trust
the promissory note for 0.0
and the subordination agreement
can the loan amount be adjusted based on new costs estimates
what will happen at closing
is the major problem with the appraisal that since the land was only appraised at 0,0,0 we would be required to contribute an additional 0,0 in equity
if so
that is not good
you mentioned that the we are firm on the construction numbers given to me previously
can you send those numbers again so i can be positive i am not looking at old numbers
also
i would really appreciate a schedule of true costs and expected loan
thank you

can you call me to discuss the panel quote for the allen residence issued to johnnie brown
in april you worked up a quote for $0,0
the dimensions of the house have not changed
the quote given last week was over $0,0
have raw materials and labor increased by over 0%
i need help understanding this increase
phillip allen
richard
i spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with sip's
i am planning to build a home in san marcos as soon as i can decide on a builder and materials
i already have my blueprints completed
what i took from our conversation was to use the sip's with 0.0
roof panels and use a metal roof
i have been working with johnnie brown
a builder from san antonio that is also a creative panel rep
the problem is that i have a budget of $0-$0/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget
i don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house
i was wondering about alternatives
would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-cfc spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than sip's
for example
i just spoke to a sales rep for demilec
he will spray foam insulation at $0.0/sf
that would be approximately $0,0 compared to over $0,0 additional costs for the panels
but would the foam insulation be as effective
do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money
i am trying to get a bid from wink with premier based on you reference
thank you for your help

i interviewed agustin leon and zoya raynes
here are my comments
agustin leon
has a lot of experience with quantitative and technical analysis
programming and language skills
if not a trader could be an asset to research group
zoya raynes
has already been through salomon's rotational program
her interest lean more towards marketing than trading

it is my understanding that the account balance will be treated as ordinary income
what about social security and medicare taxes
i thought those were already deducted
also
the are no earnings on the deferrals i have made
on the contrary
there are losses
is it possible to recoup any taxes paid
thanks for you help

thanks
these are fine

here are my comments
section 0b
it is my understanding that the utility lines are currently under construction and should be finished by late february 0
can we reference the work that is being performed by the contractor
jc evans
i want to avoid any ambiguity regarding the
utility lines
also can we make the same distinction in the utility construction escrow agreement in section c
section 0
please change to purchaser can extend closing for 0 successive periods of 0 days each for $0,0 per extension
not applicable to purchase price and non-refundable
also
i would prefer to sign the first amendment and the utility escrow documents at the same time since they reference each other

thank you for digging in to the issue of deferred phantom stock units
it is clear that the payment will be made in shares
however
i still don't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares
the plan document under vii
amount of benefit payments reads
the value of the shares
and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of enron corp
common stock on the january 0 before the date of payment
and such payment shall be made in shares of enron corp
common stock
can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account
thank you
phillip allen
richard
i checked with wink and his prices were slightly lower per square foot but the builder was not keen on the panels wink is selling because the dimensional lumber to frame windows and doors is not included
so that reduces some of the savings
either way it still appears that a panel home will cost close to $0,0 more for a 0 sq ft home
even if i assume my energy savings will be $0/month
it would take approximately 0 years to recover the upfront cost assuming a 0% interest rate
cost is a major concern
but i am also concerned with the comfort level of the upstairs
i am under the impression that the panels will prevent the upstairs from feeling significantly hotter than the downstairs as most two story homes do
what are some other alternatives that would also be effective
radiant barrier
more attic ventilation
thank you for your help
phillip allen

can i place the replacement property into a limited partnership

the cash to be escrowed is approx

take a look at this spreadsheet
i tried to calculate the irr on the port aransas and roma post offices
is this how your clients usually evaluate these properties
the roma deal looks much better

this sounds better than the limitations you were describing in the meeting
we should be able to work with this
phillip

i received your email on the killeen post office
i am still having a tough time making the math work
can you prepare a spreadsheet that would show why the post office is such a good investment
maybe the assumptions i am making about interest rates
expenses

the application for the variance states that i applied for a permit on october 0th and was rejected

i need help determining how much margin the short options require
my account has a value of around $0,0,0
that includes 0,0 of us treasury notes
i am ready to build a bond ladder of muni's
i need to know how much i can purchase with the funds in this account
obviously
i don't want to margin the account to invest in fixed income
please get back to me soon

have you considered reducing the scope or terminating the accenture project to conserve cash
where are we in terms of %complete
phillip
i would like more detail about how much margin my open positions require and how the muni's are treated with regard to margin
the call's i am short are way out of the money
the only positions that are changing very much in value are the enron shares i am long and the enron puts i am short
i would consider closing those positions
i would like to put the maximum possible into muni's
please forward this email to steve

when can we reschedule the meeting regarding phantom stock deferral
any day except thursday would work

i would like to achieve a yield of 0%
i am expecting an average maturity date of 0
since the treasury is only paying 0.0% taxable at 0%
isn't the effective yield only 0.0%
why wouldn't i move this money to muni's
phillip
i am still using my home nortel vpn access
what are the specifics of those bonds are they insured what are they rated
can you work up a ladder from 0-0
shouldn't i buy more than just one or two issues
let's start with $0 million
bob
i turned in the application for a variance yesterday
the hearing will be on january 0th
in order to get on the calendar for the dec 0th hearing
the application had to be in by november 0th
i was under the impression that yesterday was the deadline
sorry if i dropped the ball
on another note
i spoke to joe edwards yesterday and he had some useful suggestions about the addition
it might be possible to move the addition forward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the new space
you could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and use the new space for your game/play/music room
then you could close off the existing play room to replace the bedroom lost
part of the play room that is bordered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could be used for a built in desk with a couple of computers
this way you would not have to add a second staircase
the walls needed to convert the playroom to a bedroom should be minor construction
in the back you could slope the roof until you were within the setback
then you could place a large dormer facing the back of the property or bring a wall straight up
from the driveway the addition would have the same elevation as your drawing but intwould be brought forward with a covered parking area below the addition
the kitchen and dining room windows would still open to the driveway but they would be more shaded
that is the west side of the house so that might not be a bad thing
your ideas about opening up the kitchen to the living room or dining room would still be possible
personally
i think opening the dining room would be the better idea
i don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested in exploring anything except your original plan
but i wanted to suggest something in case the variance was not granted
let me know if you want me to try and sketch out these ideas
phillip
the spreadsheet you sent will not open up and calculate any yields
can you resend
i will not be in the office on thursday
can we meet on friday at 0 am
try to get a room off the 0nd floor
jim
i realize you are excited about these post offices
but i really need help analyzing the numbers
phillip
please send me an email describing the zero option so i can pass it along to the other sme's
phillip
jeff
can you resend the info on the three properties you mailed and the one you faxed on tuesday
i was out of the office last week
phillip
david
for clarity
wherever you cite section 0.0 in your response i assume you mean section 0.0
your response does not address the key points upon which i based my interpretation of the plan
the beginning of section 0.0 states
notwithstanding any other provision of the plan
this implies that section 0.0 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution
i disagree with your translation of
a single sum distribution
as meaning all at once instead of a single amount
i would like to meet to discuss or appeal to greg w
or john l
in addition
your response does not address section 0.0
this appears to be the relevant section if the psa is to be paid in shares
additionally the q
a section in the plan brochure
pg
0
works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value
this is the methodology described in section 0.0
tom martin and scott neal share the above concerns
please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further
phillip

tony
rather than fill in the design selections
i have attached a spreadsheet that estimates the costs
since i have spent so much time researching the house
i think my numbers are pretty close
i would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis
i don't know if this would be agreeable to you
take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think
if we could work together on this basis
i will complete the design selections
i will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors
we are torn between two good locations
however
we are leaning towards kerrville
the lot in kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in san marcos
so we are really stretched to make this house work financially
we have decided that if we can make kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead
if not we will fall back to our plan to move to san marcos
i don't know how many jobs you have going currently
but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately
phillip allen
are we scheduled to meet tomorrow at 0 am
if yes can we change to 0 pm
phillip
the project coordinators believe they can reach a solution with accenture in which enron pays no additional fees but the project is completed in a slightly scaled back form
this allows accenture to have a completed project and no more cash goes out the door
the effort from the sme's should be complete by christmas
please push forward with the review of the knowledge layer
phillip
jim
your spreadsheet shows the same type of return i was calculating
your insurance and repair numbers seem very low
also
assuming that the options to extend at higher rates will be exercised is a huge leap of faith
i don't believe these properties cost any where near the $0+/sf that they are being offered at
based on the optimistic back loaded returns
i would not be comfortable purchasing a post office at this time
thank you anyway
phillip

here is the completed worksheet
i also attached both a plumbing and an electric worksheet

this is exactly what we need
would it possible to add the prior day for each of the dates below to the pivot table
in order to validate the curve shift on the dates below we also need the prior days ending positions
thank you
phillip allen

did you attach the file to this email
why is the body shop being closed
why can't it continued to be operated on a reduced staff with out exercise classes
jeff
jp morgan is comparing a file of calculated daily curve shift to actual p&l
gas p&l for 0 was 0.0 billion but the theoretical curve shift was
0 million
this is from a file assembled by david port which is attached
the biggest difference is 0/0
$0 million
this is probably money coming out of reserves
besides that day there are many smaller differences
can you help me by pulling the p&l packets from some of the larger days
the answer might be that the file from rac is bogus
phillip
jeff gosset is going to pull the p&l packet from the days with the biggest discrepancy and we will go from there
sounds good
this email address goes to my work

greg
i plugged the data on colonial oaks into your format
the actual noi for 0 is around 0,0
but there is not a professional management company
subtracting $0,0 for management costs the noi would be $0,0
however
i increased the taxes and a few other expenses to bring total expenses up to $0,0/unit
this would yield an noi of $0,0
comparing the rents charged to the other 0 properties
it doesn't look like the rents have a great deal of upside
the asking price is $0,0,0
using $0,0 would make this an 0.0 cap
using the seller's noi of $0,0 would be a 0.0 cap
the cost per unit is $0,0 for a 0 project
the cost per square foot is 0.0
the numbers would be better if the property was offered at $0.0 million
jeff smith claims that $0.0 million is as low as the seller will go
this property has not been on the market
so i would like your input of what the market would pay for it
if $0,0 is a reasonable noi
then i would thing it would be sold fairly quickly for $0.0 million
it does have the benefit of all brick exterior and elderly tenants
plus the location is by far the most convenient
financing is the other consideration
i am assuming 0 year
0%
and 0% down
what do you think could actually be achieved
can you put me in contact with a lender
i will follow up with a phone call
thanks
phillip
jeff
i reviewed your revised offer sheet
i am ok with the effective income of $0k
her records show basically no other income
$0/month
so i subtracted $0,0 from your number
the expenses just need to reflect $0,0 more property taxes and the numbers should be right on
$0 less $0 would be $0 of noi
i spoke to jim murnane this afternoon
he feels this property would most likely warrant 0.0% and a 0 year amortization
see the attached spreadsheets
here is lakeside in your format
looks like 0% cash on cash plus whatever principal is paid on the note
my biggest concern is that actual vacancies and concessions have been higher than in the pro forma used to underwrite the offering
also expenses were higher
why would we be able to do any better than the existing management
i would like to come see it again on wednesday
i would be bringing 0 or 0 others
could we see it in the morning around 0:0 or 0 am

i talked to dave last week and he indicated it was no problem
i have a meeting with him today at 0:0
let me know what i need to tell him
also
what is the latest with the late nominations
i talked to jason and he told him it was due to producers changing their noms
i have not talked to george about this issue

there is a hidden pocket in my computer bag and i had placed my phone and flight info in this pocket
thank you for continuing to look for the phone
i am embarrassed
i had a meeting with beth today
i feel that it did not go well
i asked for an it person that would work in our group and would be expected to learn the fundamentals
i also indicated that i would like everyone in the group to learn it and that we would hire someone to sit on our desk and produce the front-end
she did not like that idea
her proposal is that an it person can sit on our desk and decide what it resources we need and she wants front-end production to be handled by her group
we ended the meeting with no resolution and we will meet again tomorrow
it seems to me that if we don't have free access to the website or database
the group will suffer
i will follow up tomorrow
agreed
we will need to do it after work sometime
let me know hunter
what is eta and pa
thanks
can we create a link to a chicago hub eol site
if so
can the chicago hub site have new pa's and eta's
dave can you redo with day + 0 products only
also can you display the data without placing multiple data in a given row
i have attached an example
the first row in this spreadsheet is how i would like to see the data
this way i can sort the data in any fashion
thanks hunter
i talked to louise and she said that mark taylor had the following idea
if the chicago office signs an agreement that binds the chicago office to every
midwest hub
deal on eol then we could avoid the pa and eta
i believe the chicago office is on the network so the stack manager should not be a problem
louise said that she would have someone call laura luce
laura manages the chicago office and is the person that would authorize the above agreement
thanks hunter
laura dave forster from eol may be calling you
i am trying to get the hub online and i am having trouble because enron does not own more than 0% of the midwest hub
an eol lawyer may have found a solution
i have asked dave to call you
i wanted to give you a heads up

i believe that my exact statement was
if you are not profitable the next months we are going to have another talk
after thinking about it afterwards
this statement is probably too vague
do i need to clarify this statement
should i define the exact amount of profit
should i explicitly say that i will ask her to leave the group
your help would be appreciated

before we publish this we need to calc the index for a few days
we need to feel confident that the index is calculating correctly
you can reach me at hunter
i think that if a product does not trade for a day
we do not post the product the index or product description in the index page
i think the index calculation hours should be 0:0 a.m
to 0:0 a.m
how fast can the index page be calculated and posted
i would like to see the composite
i think my home computer has logon access through the firewall
has someone in networks looked at this issue
thanks hunter
i don't know if you read your email so i am forwarding this to you
the page is missing the gas flow date and the numbers require only three decimal points
we need to add canada numbers
also is it possible to make the basis column more straight
should we have an explanation of index calculation
it may build more trust in the numbers
i think i have a meeting that starts at 0:0
please let them know that i can attend from 0:0-0:0

we need to consider having one product for parks and loans
i think we should make a market in this product
let me know what you think
has laura decided which organization will flip the deals
where did you get your copy of green markets
hunter
eol and peoples
eol and peoples transaction explain year and quarter
the biggest reason is eol
i think the month to date numbers are up because we are experiencing an increase in eol trading in the gulf coast region
let me know if you need more info
hunter
thanks
has anyone notified eol of our flip-out choice
i think the product would work like this
chic
peoples june one day withdrawal
july ratable injection
0 bid
0 offer chic
peoples june balance of month withdrawal
july ratable injection
0 bid
0 offer i think the rest of month would be more popular but we should give both a try
also we need to work on an auto hedge feature for the chicago office
call me
the two canadian points
dawn and niagara
are quoted in us dollars so a basis can be calculated
we also need to add nit
aeco
john mckay manages this product
he should know the hours of trading and which day should be selected for index calculation
hunter

i can not think of anything to add
i will talk to her as well
has the deal between you and patrice been booked
i don't remember if i told you that fletch and i will be playing golf on saturday morning
thank you hunter
how did this go
tim i thought i would give you a simple overview of the gas market
this may help you prepare for thursday
everyday roughly 0 billion cubic feet of gas is produced
the bulk of this production is in texas
louisiana
and oklahoma
in the winter
the us daily load is greater than 0 bcf and in the summer
the daily us load is less than 0 bcf
therefore
storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal differences in load
texas and louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas
however these states produce more gas than they consume
most other states consume more gas than they produce
therefore pipelines were built to solve the regional imbalances
most of these pipelines originate out of la and tx and move gas to the areas of greatest demand
our goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if the daily production is growing or shrinking
very simplistic
but maybe it helps
hunter
the guys are not listed

i would like to pursue this with jay webb

jay
does your group have space
expense reports
did you grab bennett's internet favorites
i do not know
i thought we were combining power and gas fundamentals it
let's try this time on for size
i would like to have the dollars subdivided into pools for each of my direct reports with about 0% of my pool reserved for my use
can you help me with this
i also understand that we are doing a handoff from ben to shanna for my support point
therefore i am sending this to both of you
for ben
where are we on the job description i sent
do you have the same for the income side
fyi
this close date is of large significance to gpg as we are going to be asking management to wait an extra week for monthly info that ties out to the financials
this variance from what we thought was a
common design
is a huge deal
in fact the agreed upon close timing was a major consideration in getting agreement within gpg to go forward as it was an improvement that we could see had value
i agreed to and
stacked hands
with all on the
common design
yet somehow there has been a failure to deliver the
common design
i just want to make sure that the two of you are aware of my position on this issue
i haven't heard back from rebecca on this
but i'm sure she is busy
do either of you care to answer my question below
i didn't forget
do you still have the instructions for the wire to compass bank in the files
i would like it wired there
here is the info
bank
compass bank for credit to the account of roderick j
and kathleen r
hayslett thanks
i would like this done as soon as possible as i will be needing the funds at the end of the week
rod hayslett
consulting group that may be able to help with sap stuff
we will have to do project economics by pipeline as well as in total
a way to allocate costs however is to do so according to the benefits received
that way no one can argue that they didn't get the same deal
if the deal makes sense from a group standpoint
then it should make sense from an individual pipeline standpoint
project economics need to be looked at in 0 ways
0
the project economics on a stand alone basis and then 0
the more accurate approach of what does the project do to the entity
the with and without approach
the accounting return in the second approach has become actually the more important measure of success
in order for me to effectively represent you at the ets prc and for some of you at the accounting and finance prc's i will need some information from each of you
please send the following to kathy campos who will put it together for me in a book
0
copy of your goals for 0 and the latest status
0
a list of accomplishments/things you are proud of this year
specifically indicate any involvement in the associates/analysts program or the recruiting program
0
copy of a self evaluation you completed in the pep system
0
your supervisor will provide me with a copy of a preliminary evaluation
i will need these by the 0th of november for those in the accounting and finance ranks
for all others i will need the input for the 0th of december
fyi
all ok>
please provide whatever assistance you can in getting info to tracy to respond to the attached request
a reminder of what was in the enron goal presentation and what we did last year
fyi
please approve and forward for payment
thanks
i guess i would only request that we get some review put in front of ets
new risk management officer and his crew
jerry peters
i also understand that this is a part of the revenue management project
i would think we can do the same as we do in florida
which is similar to your suggestion
we did create a non-regulated affiliate to do the business in the name of
but that leaves the revenue in the venture and solves the fiduciary problem
i still have a prc tomorrow am
but will let kathy know my status as i get closer to lunch
fyi
this is a work in progress
forgot the attachment
here it is
hi felicia
i would like to have one
0
amex gift certificate for $0.0 processed as soon as possible
thanks
rod
what is the deal
we are still working on the plane
and the answer is that the plane will be billed to the rc reserving it for the flight
if commercial wants to take it to a lower level than that it will be up to them to do so
it will take some actual doing on our side to make this happen
but it can be done
the budget will be taken care of in planning as we go through the year
from an ets point of view all of the plane is in commercial or executive
stan
and so it should not be a problem to track the budget
tracy has the point on this one
jim saunders
what do you know about the other comments
fyi
you got it
morris and elaine are responsible for this area of the ets world and as such should be there and hopefully will know what this is about
i have seen nothing on this proposal and probably will not be available
as i have a prc on that date
out of the office
ultimately more definition
but for now
it's a good start
i'm fine
i would like to see the results of that method before we just agreed to do so
brasher excellent clements strong fenstad satisfactory these are my thoughts based upon general knowledge of the year and some specifics for the last few months
a short discussion with phil might lead me to believe that he would think i might be being too generous on dave
what are your thoughts
fyi
the cash flows for 0 are currently locked
but if we get a chance to adjust for carry forwards we will
worst case is that the dollars will have to be reapproved as outside of the budget
likely that we will be able to do some internal moving of dollars to compensate for this
but not guarenteed
any idea on when i can get your info
for kathy
how many have been submitted
fyi
this was the detail provided to sarabeth
fyi
brasher excellent clements strong fenstad satisfactory morris brassfield
what were the individual participation rates by entity
this is an fyi
but i think that insurance probably fits into jerry's world
i can't make it
i have another prc to do
will he be having one the first tuesday of january
0/0/0
i will have both jim saunders and jerry peters in attendance
fyi
approved
approved
we won't have a permanent place until sometime after the end of december
service agreements and construction jobs
as well as capital expenditure
obligate enron and as a result the rules for rac approval for commitments apply
please get denis or james involved on all appropriate deals
thanks
rod
fyi
it is not necessary
other than tracy
he would be the only one of the accounting and finance people there and stan is trying to limit the attendance to the group necessary for the discussions
i have been in discussions with them as well
and i don't think they have that flexibility
who has actually been working on the move for you
i will have pam daily from my admin team contact you for specifics
cash
first of all
why can't we do a deal with northern plain's
a wholly owned subsidiary
sally
where do i go inside enron to get straight what it is that i need to do in order to be able to use the curves i am told that we need to be using
rod hayslett
i understand now
thanks
what's the first day you have free for lunch
yes
my mistake
i missed you again
sorry
its for the am
can you make it
that would work well if i was trying to do projects
but i am trying to be able to utilize the curves in the business to measure var
we now use them for nng
tw in the caminus system
and want to do so for our other pipes as well
thanks
i am in agreement with tod on #0
it's your call
but you should make the call on whether or not we will integrate it into enron
if we do
then we will get adam the help he needs
but it will be more efficient than providing stand alone support
what is/was this meeting about
too bad i can't be there
i have a staff meeting to run
not before you scheduled the meeting
only as a result of it
i would like morris brassfield and carolyn centilli to play this role
are you aware of where this is coming from
do you have a candidate
i would argue that we are looking at a process review
so anyone who can do a process review could do this
do you have a document signed by stan authorizing the amount of dollars you need to spend
ok
but make sure the documentation of the email follows the invoice for the payment
otherwise we will have to go back to him to appriove the payment
on the otherhand
there is no reason that a dash can't be used for non-discretionary approvals as well
and if it doesn't have to go to rac
then it doesn't
i think we should have this discussion at stan's staff meetings next monday
thanks
the date will probably have to move since the most recent events have some of us kind of hopping
i understand that you have raised your forecast of the 0th qtr
significantly
that's great
looking forward to the simple explanation

can you 0 help her out on 0
0
tracy
please handle 0
fyi
we have done it before
in fact it was the way all of the pipes were originally built
but not for short term stuff
gavin russo can probably help us with his property tax background
lou
please try to get hold of gavin or whomever he believes should take part in the discussion
i am going to begin discussions with the banks as soon as we get the phase 0 financing locked down
i would expect that we could have it in another month
unless i run into some kind of a buzz-saw out there
and i'll let you know as soon as i do
these would be in the debt tests performed for the lenders
do you know the answers
i am assuming that by now you know that i am pledging my receivables into the secured deal dan boyle is working on
does this cost center get allocated or direct charged
please get back to morris for me
fyi
i think kathy has a new one out for the 0th
in the covenants of the debt agreements
if it's not a test in the lenders package
then it is not in the deal
need to get you 0 talking to lori
i don't see much of a problem in going along with the eott valuation
it's their asset now
please fix
great start
the first problem is finding the time and money to do something and given everything else that is going on
right now is not the best time to be spending some money
to get the outside contractor taken care of we would have to let gss find us a party to do the work
so you might want to be thinking of other parties who might be qualified to do the work
i guess i need some more definition
if i am creating a new group and i have nobody in it
this doesn't make sense
can i get some definitions to go over this with stan
i am having some trouble with this concept
i guess
as it doesn't appear to make any sense
why wouldn't we give these groups 0 authority since we don't use them
i also think we need to make some changes to the rest of the schedule
especially at the top
what is this about
fyi
peters and saunders should probably be in attendance
but not required
i will be attending
this is a test for the blackberry
rod hayslett
rod hayslett
thanks
rod hayslett
we will need a unanimous consent to make kevin an officer of the pipes
title should just be vice president
i think given the discussions over the weekend it would be good to do so effective last friday
thanks
rod hayslett
i have a dsl connection and sometimes it takes as long as 0-0 minutes to load the page
is there anything that can be done to improve the speed
rod hayslett
thanks
what is the purpose of this meeting
are we still waitning on some info here
if i could get something as simple as lost time
vehicle accidents
or such i would appreciate it
i have asked corporate where it will be reported in the 0th qtr
if it's not going to be reported as wholesale then there is no real reason to bother wes
what is the purpose of this meeting
i may not be able to make it
fyi rod hayslett
don't count on me
where do you intend to have that meeting
i am getting ready to announce that i am bringing kevin howard into egs as vice president of finance and transaction support
thinking about the current organization
do think it appropriate to consider putting ms fischer in his organization
the kind of things she is doing for you currently are similar to the kind of things we are going to have kevin working with corp on
i will be putting into his organization the economic analytic talents and special projects people from the pipeline group as well as some others
we will not be charging out these costs into the specific commercial units
but instead expect them to generate the ideas and value to pay for themselves
his group will be providing services to all
but i am willing to carve out some priorities
rod hayslett
its fine
moved to the 0th
i will keep it on the calendar but cannot promise anything at this point in time
will keith marlowe be in attendance
not as far as i know
don't know
fyi
looks like there may have been a little confusion here
but it appears that the deal is still working as before
not at this time
i think as long as enron is performing
i'm not sure why there is all of this noise
i have already approved and forwarded
yes and yes
but it will take me another day or so for the announcement
i think the biggest problem is that where are we going to get the funds for that
fyi
let's forward to the ets officer's for review/comments to be discussed monday am
i think the real problem right now is that until the current crisis is over we need to reduce all calls for cash of any type to only those necessary to make cash today
and we will give you something stating or reaffirming our deal
if that is deemed to be necessary
it will be worth the paper it is written on at the moment it is written
but means nothing 0 second later
and that's the problem with these kind of things
i guess my concern is what good will it do anyone
i don't think it's a problem to get
however i do believe we would want to get v&e's opinion at the time we wanted it
that it was necessary/required
probably need additional review by someone now
given the current situation
what do you think
agreed
by the way we are very close to a deal and therefore a press release shortly thereafter
can you please get with roger and make sure we understand what needs to be done
i am trying to get a decision
but i think we need to maintain flexibility
if at all possible
still want to try and get it done this year
per stan this am
cash is king for now and we need thepricing to get the rest of the cash
if it has to be pushed to next year
that works
but if it can be done it needs to be
fyi
i have forwarded to kelly
i will handle this afternoon
understood
thanks
what can we do about getting this done
fyi
i am not sure
i just am being a little overly cautious about making changes that someone at corporate may not be aware of
can someone send us a synopsis of the changes in the plan and what the expected impact on np and nbp services comapny is
do you have a history with hughes
understood
that's what i thought this was
fyi
fyi
how do we get this loop closed
is this a meeting
let warren and tom know that this is a critical
i would be happy to do so
do you have a preference
or lawrence do you have a preference as to how this is handled
should someone from the pipes be in the bank meeting
for moral support
if not for the steel
do you have his number
was there a plan here
like you guys decided to not pay
or was this just overlooked
fyi
are these any of our floors
explain what you are looking for
agreed
make sure they are current
fyi
as you can see we are working to get our floors covered
sally
can you help me figure out who i need to talk to to get the deals we did with you as ect back in 0
modified
here is my shot at it
jim should call with aphone number so that i don't ave to over there please send me an email to let me know
thanks
hole is unlikely
but is a real weak point in any sales discussion
please forward to kevin howard
call luitgard fischer
cancel me out of lunch and any other meetings tomorrow
rod hayslett
agree
fyi
can you give me a quick definition of the frequency rates
formula please
thanks
i'm here
i agree
let's go
who will sign theses
i agree with jim
ferc has not issued an order yet
i am just now leaving the office
i hope
rod hayslett
to the best of my knowledge
there are no market studies or other documents that have been prepared that appear to meet the requirements of 0c drew
can you think of anything we may have done while you were in omaha that might fit this request
i think there is still the possibility that
just like has happened to el paso
that enforcement could still open the case since ferc is still out trying to find a way to get us
it is true that the alj did not help them out
but that decision is not binding upon the commission
neither stan
drew or i are comfortable yet that we have the win
we are pleased with the alj decision
but know that the alj did not get to the answer the commission intended
has cheryl seen the stuff
need to get her and jerry on board as well
just catch cheryl up then on the changes
that works for me
i will attempt to answer some of heather's questions as well
reclass both please
what do you think
yes
you might say that we are lending the money to enron and therefore are now looking further than nng and tw
just send the package to kevin
we just need backup
not pesentations
unless you can think of a reason why not it makes it simpler
i think
where are you
can you help
i think that is the right answer
i will not make the cio mtg at 0
i am un available for the 0 pm meeting
i like nick and everett
please send to gary smith
bring whole thing if this is the notee agreement with ene
i am in 0m if you need me
still tied up
when do we review with el paso
need before board meeting
no
all three
can you guys take care of this part
do you want me to attend the meeting at 0:0 in 0c0
rod hayslett
on the other deal
they are back to total capital expenditures and not just expansion dollars
i will need you to resurrect your language on the gas for mitch tomorrow
there is no fair value
there is fair value
and you can figure it out by comparing the form 0 with the gaap financials
see comment below
i will attend
that was the discussion late last night
robert guthrie
can you help me out here
i don't know what the purpose of the language is but i think from a purist point of view that it is accurate
fyi
drew is correct
but we can tell them where we want the money wired
if you want us to pursue getting this cash directly to ene we will be happy to try
none that i am aware
we will get it handled
can you send out the notice that the dates are changing and we will have to reschedule before you leave
i am up with stan if you need me
you're right
if it keeps going the way it is now there is a possibility
all spending that can be delayed needs to be delayed
i want to make it clear that items for health
safety
security and reliability that need to be spent will be spent
if necessary
but all other spending needs to be slowed down as much as possible and delayed until further notice
this is a directive i have just received from stan
rod hayslett
what was the original question
this message was sent earlier today to the finance/accounting/operational support people in the group to make them aware that we are in need of slowing down the cash outflow
your assistance in this regard is important to the success of preserving capital at this critical time
ok
got me to thinking
how are you guys doing
where are you in the cash management world
i know you were tight before
is the situation any better
i nee to go to stans office apologize to steve dowd for me
on my way down
please handle
the enron situation has slowed down the process as we have not been able to get a clean ok from the sec to go forward as yet
i will work with her and dan to try and figure out a better solution in the short term
now that some space is available from the moves to the new building
it is possible that there is a better place to move to for a period of time
call stan when you get in probably closer to 0 our time
comments below
sounds like they have a deal already
what do you think we should focus on for the crew
attached is a data sheet that i would like to keep up as things change
rod hayslett
was it an actual downgrade or just that they wouldn't agree not to do so
basically yes
will get back to you
fyi
the $0 of debt that is in the calcualtion assumes we borrow the 0 next week
otherwise there is only 0 or so there
fyi
i apologize for the confusion but the interviews are being cancelled at this time
thank you for your patience and assistance in getting us ready to go
do you have
or bob
copies of nng's debt agreements
current
please do
i'm in 0c0
i think there are 0 deals
not currently under consideration
in fact would be a problem
tracy and jim are trying to track down 0 more copies
could you see where this stands
we are in 0c0
don't know
0ravis is in charge
can you bring these to 0c0
not yet
please call
0
thanks
may as well cancel
only kevin and his assistant
no one else
fyi
fyi
which company
where do you stand on this stuff now
for everyone
if we are going to get this done
we need things taken care of
if there is a problem you need to let us know asap
rod hayslett
what gives
ok
would you 0 think about those who helped us so we can attempt to get some award to those who really helped us out here
i had specifically taken this deal to jeff for approval
and he had decided to not go forward at that point in time
i would like to get a review with stan and jeff to decide
rod
brokerage accounts
do you have copies of the agreements
both tw and nng
i would like contact info on you and your key players
just in case
i don't think i will need much accounting help before monday
thanks rod
fyi
i'm ok
deal is not quite announced
hope you are having a good time
do you have volumes and rates info to go with the nng current estimate and the 0 plan
if not you
can you get for me
any news
what's going on
thank you
have you talked to somerholder
agreed
we plan on reviewing with stan on monday
previously he had left it up to jeff who had said no to
kathy
i love you rod
it,s an entity set up to handle nng's and tw's cash
through this account cash flows to corp
joel will handle this
i have a request
aa has asked if we can repay the notes to the pipes
not actually
but realistically from business unrelated to the pipes
they may want to discuss with you
yes
they want us to record the amounts loaned
normal loans
as a reduction of equity
if ene does not currently have the ability to repay from either cash or other assets or credit capability
they do not want to count the 0.0b or the bank loans since they will simply increase the size of the notes
they are specifically concerned about the current intercompany notes
the party at aa is roger willard 0 0 0
the party at aa is roger willard 0 0 0 if you feel up to trying to convince him
rod
why is there a note showing nng as a borrower from enron
we will keep trying
fyi
there is no need to get into a discussion with aa at this point
any updates
there are definitely issues here and we will have to deal with them for sure
i will let you know when there is document to review so that we can get moving
i have none
we are following the issue and i believe ingaa is going to be filing somethiong that we have had input on
fyi
are you aware of any
i'm not
maybe the language should be
redeem
i would like to but we may have to put it off until next week
i am currently working weird hours trying to get the $0b of debt closed and funded
i will get back to you
approved
are moving our it support into our world
will nick need to replace him
i am ok
as long as the budget dollars are available to do it
we will propose to stan and see where we are at that time
if it was this week
the answer would probably be no
i am only concerned about moving it types into our world that were previously in nick's world if the job responsibilities move with them
sounds like this is not the case
so i am ok
here it is
it is not yet in final form
maybe overkill
i would rather send them an email talking about the problems
and they have to let you 0 know when they going to use a space
and how they can coordinate stuff with you 0 instead of dictating
i am little touchy right now about how to approach people
so we need to be careful
i am open to more discussion on this
just would like to soften the tone a litlle
let me talk to stan when he gets back to town
lou and i need to discuss with him
and we are a little occupied with the credit agreement stuff
fyi
what do you think of this
can you help us here
for mariella and jeff
has this divestiture been to rac
it will need to go
and probably sonner rather than later
lance schuler will help us deal with board issues related to the merger
we need your help asap
i think it would be ok
but you might want to check with stan
i have
ok
does this really have to be done
it's probably too late now
but we really do need to watch our spending for awhile
i would like to coordinate moves through our move people either ruth ann frausto
0ac
or pam daily
eb
so i can keep up with space as well as costs that are coming down the pike
fyi
are you still going to be making a presentation
this staff meeting is monday at 0:0 in 0ac
i don't know but i need you to call me
i'm at work
and check your email for one i just sent out
does this make us feel better
i would like each of you to help take ownership of this project to be fully able to explain the trends on these sheets
i would also like to begin to add 0 0rd ce to this discussion as soon as possible
accounting quite possibly has the answers
but i want to get this documented as soon as possible so that we understand the changes and don't have to go back and do this again
this is not a project that will be complete by friday
but it does need to get complete this year
i think i feel better
but i would like some comfort from the lawyer in the crew
be on the look out
yes i did
approved
we're there given his response
won't be able to make it
sorry
stan called back and explained
we need to do 0% and begin to look at dollars that could be saved
this is an estimating process to figure out if we can effectively reduce our spending and by how much and then what portion of that benefits enron
no
but thank you foroffering
if you need me i'm in the cafeteria for 0 minutes
are you aware of this
is this a place that is big enough to handle some extras
i was actually thinking only about the people in morris's brassfield's crew
but he should now about already
as he supports phil
no
i'm working on the credit agreement
thanks
talk to steve
but i think he is working on a reliability issue that probably needs to handled
but may be able to be done over a period instead of all at once
i really don't know
but he will
i believe so
it's an informal get together that shouldn't last more than about an hour
i want to make sure you all have access to info and we can share concerns etc
i think what the partnership values it does not have to have a relationship to what we value it at
jim
thanks
great job
do you have any critical people that you are afraid you will lose because of the merger
how about a group
rod hayslett
the meeting will at the most last a little more than an hour or 0
nothing special to prepare for
no reason to be other at this point
where did you get this
fyi
i will approve the posting subject to the condition that it be internal only at this time
i will submit that that may be the case today
i am only concerned that when the situation changes that we will not be willing to discuss the opposite and the question still remains as to what the form 0
regulatory
will require
i'm about to return to the office to see it
about 0minutes
listen to voice mail forwarded from jim
this is fine
how about sending it out from me
is the same true for the current estimate
that is understood
he will be taking glisan's position which had the same restrictions on it
i don't plan on giving him any data other than daily cash positions and forecasted cash positions
there would be no purpose in giving him e&f data
by the wya
kevin needs to do the marketing affiliate stuff
aren't you being a little rough on her on a problem that really doesn't make any difference to dynegy
fyi
per you request
also make sure that jeff sommers added his name to his list
there is a separate wind retention program
i am not aware of the eeos situation currently
keith marlow has been out of town
management rod hayslett* jim saunders* tracy geaccone* john cobb* bob chandler* lisa sutton+ patty wiederholt* dan fancler+ tim bayles+ frank carriere+ jennifer lev+ financial system support greg lewis* staff kim bragg+ daniel pham+ debbie moseley+ mark walton+ rudy elizondo+ vince strohmeyer+ traci rainbow+ joe villela+ maria cisneros+ allen joe+ donna burns+ greg schlender+ *very critical +critical
if necessary i can go
i will need to be in houston on wednesday am
i'm on board
no
because they are in networks
fyi
i understand jim needs tom meers to review # 0
are you ok
i want to make sure that we are looking out for our people at this point in time
if there is someone who is having a particular problem
now is a time to be comforting
i also want to make sure that we are doing everything in our power to reduce spending
if you have a vacancy
now may be the time to consider do you really have to fill that job right now
rod hayslett
as to p0
it is in the budget for next year
but we want to start this year
timing is never perfect
do we want to tighten these up somewhat
sounds reasonable to me
great ideas
talk with jim
can you 0 help her out here
i believe the footnotes probably cover it
but to the extent you have more
it would be helpful
i am at the lake
0 0 0
if you already have forwarded the memo please pass along the warning and ask them not to forward again
are you sure i don't need to be there
ok
if i leave here i will call your cell so you know how to reach me
better than most recently
that is one of the things we are working on
at this point in time dynegy will be responsible for this debt
if theyexercise their rights under the preferred stock agreements
which would leave them with common pledged to the lenders
the price they paid recognized the debt was there
if it is not there
the price will be higher
suffice it to say all of these things will be tken care of before it funds
yes
when things get speculative the language always gets scary
i am leaving the lake
use cell for next 0 minutes and then use home if you need me
remember blackberry doesn't work so well at home
hi
i'm sitting in the airport waiting on the plane
going to new york tonight and will be home tuesday night
hope you guys are doing fine
sure was good talking to you this am
love
dad
thanks
good morning
i am staying at the w hotel room 0 i have my cell phone and my
lackberry so i can get email
i should be back in te office on wednesday
rod
can you please review and get back to tim
where do you want to meet to walk over there
do you want to eat lunch somewhere before
i willnot be able to attend
where do you want to meet to go over there
is it far
we're on the way
probably can handle monday pm
will get with you wednesday but feel free to schedule anything after 0:0
not yet
there are still some remaining issues to be sorted out
got it
no
at least not to my knowledge
if you need asignature fax it to the hotel
do you know anything
as you can see not everybody is always on board
i intend to distribute something this week
should be fine
can you send me an invitation for the 0 meetings on monday in outlook
i ca then accept and get it on my calendar in the office
the issue is that in order to sell the units there is a public disclosure of the units being in rawhide which may have some more issues
a 0d filing is required
if we want to sell then we need to file and wait
i'm on my way back there to do so
love
your welcome
i would think that if they pay in advance it should not be a problem
great job
what will happen to this project
alaska
what is going on
anything exciting going on today
we are proceeding witha great reception so far
we did 0 meetings yesterday and have 0 more today and one more by phone tomorrow
going well here
yes i will be back tonight
thanks
what is the mood
things are ok
have a happy thansgiving
i'll try
probably willbe working
ok i'm fine
however you would have to agree that we have some level of control over the gp
no
he is in fact commercial doing deals negotiating transactions of significant size
0.0 b this year alone
go for the dollars
ok i asked gary to have you decide on michael
i think he is utility player that can fil several roles
but if your team won't need help
i'm not sure if i need him
i wasanswering janet's comment
gp is general partner in nb
any news
i agree
i told gary you could make the call
i'm on plane
if you need me to call tonight leave me an email or phpne mail and i will call when i get in
hi
fyi
did you get mine
let me
as well as others
know the outcome
since we are no longer using maverix
that guarantee can be done away with
are the rest all really with enron
in the underlying deals do we have any ability to ask for better than a guarantee if enron is downgraded
fyi
outside of normal business lines is outside of the pipelines and therefore is not subject to being an issue here
this would be an enron deal
and we just have to get over the hurdles here
before we can sell the units need to be registered
fyi
can you help us out here from what you know
i do not believe you can loan money to enron
have you filed to be able to make the special dividend
just forget about it
the company will not be reimbursing for attendance this year
you need to begin thinking about what we could do here if we were asked to reduce staffing to save money
i do not intend to approve reimbursement by the company for attendance
if we have already signed up and can,t get the money back then spread the word that is ok
i agree with morris
i agree with morris
little value to the pipes
not very good
there will besome better news later today
call bob butts
is there any way to just reduce the expenses for now
can you do the gallup contracts as well
need to watch closely
i'm back
let's make sure we have all bases covered and telephone tree in place
i need your home cell or whatever
fyi
great job
yes for sure
the same to you and yours
i have forwarded to stan and agree with your perspective
could you begin to think about who those people might be if we decided to do something
assume afudc as 0% debt at 0%
do you have this data
thanks
the data is actually aggregated and netted
the specific deal data is not provided
the detail he described might be the aggregate of 0 deals at that point none of which may directly relate to transportation deals
see the bolded data below
the example given basically says i am in a position of having more gas at ventura in january 0 than i have commitments to sell by 0 mmcf/d
did you understand that
i received these comments this afternoon from jpmorgan
i need to have some help putting together a story to counteract the basics of this story from cera
rod
approved
remember this is for the equity piece and thery are looking at it for the longer term
this is very confidential at this point in time
do not forward
be prepared to discuss the job that each does and what we need to do to be able to transition early monday am if not before
call me
this is what i am trying to reach you about
the assumed time frame for this is next week
my numbers are as follows
try this one first
0-0-0 or my cell
0-0-0 happy thanksgiving
rod
fyi this is the list we are currently working on related to eeos
probably a monday meeting of some of our marketing types to work on this one
red rock capacity is 0,0
here is the message
i haven't heard back from steve at all
do you have anumber for him
we will be doing a confernce call tomorrow am @ 0:0 our time with jp morgan 0-0-0 passcode 0 to answer some of the questions
especially the cera questions
we have the data
ok with me
is kathy here
i will not be available
tell her to get my expense report done
what happened to the guy with the paper to sign
she just came
fyi
fyi
fyi
can you give me something that can be used to estimate the fuel available for sale
here is the basic info on the other projects discussed on the phone the other day
probably need rob and mary kay by phone
be right there
probably need to check with h r group providing services
what is the purpose of this
what do you think about tracy and jim
more tw info
info on generating plants in cal and southwest
fyi
i'm in stan's office
what is in the plan
stan,s office
capital for red rock between 0 and 0
canyou get me detail then on the capital for the 0 years
do you still need me to sign something
what would you like me to do
i think you got an old list and should have taken my name off
can you attend this one for me
they are working on the sale of our interest in the trailblazer pipeline
sounds like a reasonable deal to me
fyi
probably
please call kathy campos to get on my calendar
the margins for 0 and 0 are not the same and i didn't think we had 0 in the other model in detail
existing includes gallup
and it will be nearly imposiible to identify it as separate because there have been some changes to the original contracts for gallup
you can try
but now you are talking about getting into parts of contracts
you have to remember it was an expansion
not a separate system and therefore there is no way to track the flows after the fact
what do you have to backup the 0 and 0 revenue projectoions for nng
they took bids and i think have an offer of about $0 mm or so
michael
what do you know about this one
i have asked kevin to sit in on this one for me
trailblazer on wednesday am
i am having trouble getting this to you
so i am trying again
also do you have any inventory that could be sold that is not encumbered already
trying to think about what could be done to improve your cash in the short term
i have asked and will let you know the answer later today
the bigger question is that they can not loan money to enron and can only dividend
so if they can do something to raise the cash
they still can't get it out any more out than they can by dividending
the other problem is that they are running into cash problems themselves since they were in the process of going to the bond markets when all of this occurred
and were advised to wait
their receivables from california are part of the problem
more update later
is the cost center in question allocated or direct charged
the corporate enron corp business controls cost center
you can use my office but i may not be here
why do our numbers look so high in the 0th quarter and then fall off so much
we have to get a better handle on all of this and fast
i could probably do by phone and may be here
either robert guthrie or greek rice
the deal with the banks is being held up by paribas to get a cross-netting agreement with enron
i understand we have agreed and the documentation could be done as early as today
bill bradford is working on this one
so it's up to enron to fix the problem at this point in time
paribas releases and we get the agreement in place and we can start moving these lc's
this position is truly needed in omaha to provide support as patty suggests
i only wish there was a way to move someone from here to there
what is the next step at this point in time
no
we probably need to get this stuff in the hands of a few more people to make this work smoothly
do you have anyone from accounting
saunders
the 0 of you should probably listen in on this stuff to make sure you don't have some of the info needed
ok
you should plan on attending the meeting then tomorrow with kevin
it's 0-0 in stan's office
can not do a 0:0 unless we can get done before 0:0
you need to attend this one
kevin
you may also want to attend
they put it in the system as me
but i've told them it was you
how soon can you add things like payroll to the picture
i believe at this point in time i can support this request
i also believe that jim does not have the capacity currently to absorb
you may need to attend for continuity reasons
i will need someone to cover eeos
can you do that or should keith
what about portland
we are getting it
it is in omaha
steve
can we speed this up
i called him
dana is printing out from the data base
and it will probably take an interpreter
get with dot
what enron entity owns the eott gp
sounds fine to me
check and find out forme
is that eott or the company that owns it
for tw
can you help me here
i have not reviewed
but need you to get into this
please feel free to call tracy 0
if i needed to change the account that bills were to be paid into for this necxt billing cycle can it be done
for tw and nng
rod hayslett
is 0:0 in 0c0
next time ask jim to call me
i think that we are already well underway on tw's red rock and were not expexting to use external capital for
no other major projects underway
that are impacted by enron's situation
sent to 0
this is the crew
this is the crew
do we know what we need
we are also doing a due diligence all day thursday with dynegy on nng
i think you need to coordinate with kevin howard and drew fossum
i will be out of the office tomorrow
can't we identify the impacts of the non nng stuff in the financials
good to know that the ferc cares
explain vs redo
make sure you keep dot and drew in the loop on this stuff
i meant to try and explain
not to redo
only as a last resort<ould we wantto redo
for what reibursement
i guess
i will need to have my memory refreshed
agreed
don't make it harder than it needs to be
itwas in a yellow interoffice envelope
real yellow
not the regular manila colored
just sitting around
what is te stock price doing
has there been any announcements on the dynegy deal
i will likely not be available
just make sure you work with kevin he made need assistance
please send tomy direct reports
while i am out of the officetoday please keep kevin howard up to speed on what you see and hear
he is leading the effort in our areas during this time of stress/crisis for me
i just told kathy to send an email tomy direct reports
i will resend to you
tell everyone to calm down and get their work done
then they should go home
i know it doesn't help much
but i'm not sure what you can tell everyone at this point
not even in yet
well i guess from what is taking place that dynegy has backed out of the deal
if the reimbursement doesn't show up then there is no offset and the dollars spent should end up in rate base
isn't that about the way it could happen
you too
make sure you tell paul i said hi
kevin
i need your la address
i'm sure i have it some place but i can't find it
how's everything going
how's rena

i love my new job
i'm trading gas up in the midwest market area
illinois and michigan
things have been incredibly busy
the wedding plans have changed considerably
as i'm sure you can relate to
the stress of planning combined with the input of so many others have made us decide to have a wedding with only our folks there and not even have a reception
we figured we could put the money toward a house and save a lot of anger
frustration and stress
how's the job
new house
and terri doing
have you been to many bears games
the scarlet knights have been so inconsistent this year
i think a lot is due to their youth
let's talk soon
kevin
great to hear from you as always
it'll be great to have you back in the states
by the way
i attached a copy of the boys
i hope it comes across ok
talk to you soon

dave
it was great getting a chance to finanlly meet the other night
hope you enjoyed dinner
since then
i've been thinking abt some of our conversation re
the pbr
i have a quick question
why wouldn't you under withdraw in feb and over withdraw in mar if mar is currently higher than feb
you could lock this in by buying mar forward
also
what happens if you withdraw in mar and the summer peaks higher than what you withdrew at
how is this accounted for
i'll talk to you after you get back from houston
kevin
congrats murli
sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you
i'm glad you accepted a job at enron

we'd love to go to the opener
let's talk monday
i don't know if i'll be able to get downstairs by 0:0am
so let's work something out
kevin
chump
long time no hear
sorry it's taken me so long to touch base with you
between work
the wedding
and the fact that we just purchased a house
pending inspections
i've been pretty stressed
as far as the wedding goes lisa and i have decided to scale down considerably
we're only going to have immediately family and the folks in the wedding party
for me that includes you of course
moller
kampy and peremes
even though she won't be in the wedding
don't tell her though
she's the only one i haven't mentioned anything to
i'll make sure you and moller get to share a room
i feel kinda bad about not inviting lowery since i was in his wedding
but i don't feel like dealing with kim
she's really annoyed me the last few times i've seen her
we still plan on having it at the b&b in long beach island
we'll have a catered dinner for about 0 folks
it should be more manageable and cheaper this way
do you have the exact date when you'll move back to the states
i'm psyched you'll be a lot closer
you could swing over to houston and check out the new house
by that time we should have it in decent shape
we bought the ugliest
most beat-up house on the block
it definitely needs a lot of work
we'll be busy for the next year working on it
i think when it's done
it'll look pretty cool
anyway
send me an email and let me know how everything's going and when you'll be back
take care and tell marie we said hi
kevin
that would be great
let me know so i could get tix to a ballgame if the astros are in town that weekend
i'm going to the game next monday to see mcgwire and the cards
glad to hear everything's going well
i got a call from peremes on saturday
she heard i got engaged and was pissed i didn't tell her
i think she's smoking serious crack
cause i told her when i talked to her about 0 mos
ago
i guess she just chose to ignore me as usual
talk to you soon
kr p.s
we just closed on a house this past friday
it's in need of some serious work
hopefully it'll be habitable by the time you see it
kelly
i spoke with my friend and he mentioned that michael was already talking to 0 firms and he didn't want to recommend a third at this time

i am saddened to see such a great x-philly treated so poorly
i often look back with wonder at how much ground stocker would cover at the shortstop position
not to mention his tremendous power for a man of such small stature
he could only be compared to x-philly and future hall of famer

you're best bet is to send a resume to chris gaskill
chris is starting a new fundamental analysis group
i know he is looking for a few more people to get this group off the ground
if you're interested in trading
it's probably the best way to get involved in this side of the business
i'm not sure if you have a long term interest in trading or if you're just looking for a rotation
give me a call also after 0pm and i could provide you with some insight into the area
until then send chris an email with your resume attached or you could talk to me first if you'd like
kevin
i could meet today after 0pm
give me a call at x0-0

we'll all miss you very much

it meant a lot to lisa and me that you were able to spend the entire weekend with us
i honestly can't remember the last time i had so much fun
i hope you felt the same way
talk to you soon
kevin
the one thing i remember is that they are incredibly expensive and somewhat troublesome to maintain
depending on how old it is
i definitely wouldn't recommend it as your primary car
hope you had a good time at the wedding
it was one of the best weekends i've had in ages
talk to you soon
kevin
thanks for the congratulatory message you left on our voicemail
it made us feel great
we actually didn't go on a honeymoon
we will take one sometime next year
we've just been swamped with the house we recently bought
we bought an old small bungalow in the city
what a money pit
hope everything is going great
tell everyone we said hi
thanks again
kevin
hope all is well
i haven't forgot abt the hawaiin electric position
i'll try to get in touch with my friend today
i've been out of town for the last few days
kevin
sorry it's taken me so long to reply
but i just checked my email
we were out of town the last few days
it sounds like you've been doing a lot of thinking and reflecting
i think it healthy to analyze one's actions in order to better understand oneself
this better understanding
i find
typically leads to self improvement and greater control
and ultimately
more happiness in life
however
do not let it lead to any form of regret
that would be unfair
we all have regrets
but these regretted actions typically make us stronger and better people in the long run
i forwarded your email to patty kampmann
not patti campi
as you might imagine
i got a kick out of that
talk to you soon

one of the perks of working for uncle sam
i'm sorry for the short notice but we just decided to do it a few days ago
if you could make it
we'd all love to see you
if not

what planet did gray davis come from
what's the perception of this guy in california
hope all is well

i've emailed you after both of your messages
did you fail to get them
let me know

what's the deal with this gray davis guy
what's your opinion on him
he's pretty much out to lunch on this whole energy crisis thing
i was wondering how the citizens of california viewed him
hope everything is going well with kim
kendall and yourself
talk to you soon
send an updated picture if you have one
kevin
i did get your email and my work number is 0-0-0

mr
b
lowery
first of all
you sent me a picture with the head cut off
i couldn't even see kendall
i don't know if something happened with the translation of the file
but try to send it again if you can
in regards to california's energy crisis
i think that california is screwed
big time
i think it has the potential to cripple the state's economy
if
like you said
noone really talks about it much in socal
i would bet that will change soon
it has the potential to affect every person in the state
not only will consumers end up bailing out the utilities
socal edison
san diego
gas and electric
pg&e
but it will likely prevent many new companies from setting up shop in california
after all
who would want to put millions of dollars in an operation that will be subject to power interruptions while paying the highest utility bills in the country
i think that the only way california will come out of this ok
is if it has the least energy intensive weather for the foreseeable future
i don't think this is a problem that will be resolved within the next couple years
but remember
that is just my meaningless opinion
when do you start coming to texas
let me know so we can try to hook up
i'll talk to you soon
kevin
brett
i thought i had your home phone #
but i only have your work #
as a result
i didn't call you this weekend
send me your home # so i can give you a ring
by the way
happy 0th birthday
i hope you had a good one
kevin
the house thing is a tough call
it's hard to say
if you're not in any hurry to buy
the summer should give you a good indication of continuing energy problems
i personally think that the problem will come and go for a while
but a lot depends on how california's legislature deals with the situation
i have no idea what they'll end up doing
they've acted pretty poorly already
what's your time frame on a house
if you're only concern is that prices are at their highest level in the last decade
i wouldn't worry too much about that
it's impossible to time the market
who would've thought san francisco's housing prices would be at these current levels
there are also a lot of intangibles associated with home ownership as your aware of
i would be concerned about the energy situation
so just try to keep abreast of it
also
you could call me if you have any questions
i'll try to help the best i can
take care and tell kim and kendall i said hi
kevin
correction
i don't think thinks will blow over this summer
i think things could blow up and actually be a lot worse than they are now
in terms of longer term
i think a lot depends on how the state tries to resolve the problem
it will be interesting to see
i feel that the summer will be very interesting
especially if california gets the kind of heat they had last summer
stay in touch

glad to hear some positive news

the following article appeared in today's chronicle
enron rating setup irks many workers tongues are wagging at enron corp
and it's not because of the bonuses they're expecting next month
employees are irate about a new performance-review ranking system that pits them against each other
under the system
nicknamed
rank and yank
employees will be put in one of five categories
0 percent will be identified as
superior
0 percent will be labeled
excellent
0 percent will be called
strong
0 percent will be labeled
satisfactory
and 0 percent will be called
needs improvement
or
issues
an insider said
needs improvement
means
you have one leg hanging out the window
and
issues
is enron lingo for
you're gone
the rankings
whose names reportedly took enron officials hours to come up with
are not based just on performance
instead
they compare employee against employee
it is possible
therefore
for someone to perform at the same or higher level compared to prior periods
yet receive a lower rating for the current period if other employees
performance raised the bar
according to a memo from chief of staff steven kean and executive vice president cindy olson that was distributed this month
while employees are competing against each other for ratings
they're also expected to be team players
according to the memo
`horse-trading
of rank denied the problem
according to someone familiar with the new system
is the horse-trading that goes on when the rankings are divided up
managers trade rankings like baseball cards
explained the insider
offering to downgrade one employee if they can get a better rating for another employee
an employee's ranking is more a function of the negotiating skills of the manager he is working for
the insider said
olson
who's over human resources and community relations
said no horsetrading is going on
the rankings
due out this week
aren't set in stone
she said
only 0 percent of employees were rated in the bottom category while 0 to 0 percent were labeled superior
she said
but olson said she can see how employees might be worried about the prospect of bargaining
she speculated that one reason employees might worry is because it's a new system for about 0 percent of enron's employees
in years past
only the wholesale energy services group was ranked this way
some human resource managers expressed surprise that enron
which is known for hiring superstars
apparently feels that it must get rid of so many employees
or at least put them on notice that they're not doing well
it doesn't say much about the confidence of your recruiting system if you're getting rid of 0 to 0 percent of your work force each year
said a human resource manager in houston who asked to remain anonymous
some may not fit in some people
as smart and talented as they are
just don't fit into enron's culture
olson said
it's a company that doesn't tell people what to do
you have to know what adds value
she said
some folks just have a hard time in that environment
after thinking about it for a moment
olson added that maybe enron's recruiters aren't doing a good enough job weeding out the people who wouldn't do well in an entrepreneurial environment
forced ranking systems were popular several years ago
but they fell out of favor
in part because they were seen as damaging employee motivation
several years ago
houston lighting
power put in a forced ranking system
dividing all employees into four groups
with
0
the top group and
0
the lowest
employees were so angry with the system that some work crews had t-shirts printed
don't ask me
i'm a 0
olson said she doesn't see a problem with motivation
people like to know how they stand and will work hard to reach the top category
she said
but many of the employees
at least the ones who rate above satisfactory
won't know how they're rated
managers don't have to reveal the ratings
and as for figuring out what it takes to be superior
you've got to reinvent your job
add new business lines or create something totally new
employees understand that when it's explained to them

great to hear from you
early congrats on your graduation
everything has been going well down in the lone star state
i got married in september down the jersey shore and everything has been going well
we bought a house back in may
it needs an incredible amount of work
we own the ugliest house on the block
by far
how are things in indiana
are you and paul still together
how is he doing
when is the last time you were back in jersey
we went back over christmas but only for a couple days
i think next year we'll go back during new year's instead of christmas

wow
what a gracious thank you
i'm speechless
hope everything's been going well lately
i'll talk to you soon
by the way
are you going to any events during gas fair
kevin
thought you might appreciate this
brian
unfortunately i won't be able to make it
but thanks for the email
hope everything is going well with you
have a great time at the party and tell sweets i said happy kevin
bl
have you experienced any blackouts yet
i think you'll see a lot this summer
what does everyone think about the situation
do they think it's a threat or not
i think the state is in for a horrific summer
i hope it doesn't turn out that way
but it'll be incredibly difficult to avoid
hope everything's going well with work and with the family
when's the next time you'll be in dallas
let me know
kr
great to hear from you
looking forward to meeting in houston for a baseball game
conway will be in corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend
we should start construction on the house in may
what an incredibly long process it is
i definitely would not do it if i had to do it over again
one redeeming factor is that we bought on a good block
we definitely have the ugliest house on the block
we should get a pop in real estate also when all the california companies start migrating to texas
joking aside
unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer combined with a lot of rainfall
you're summer will suck
there is no doubt that the ca economy is going to suffer a great recession
you have a shortage of supply so the only way to ease the problem is to reduce demand
this usually occurs when prices reach levels where the price sensitive buyers cut back
however
with your boy grey davis pushing for price caps
this won't happen
the next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave
so this will probably need to happen to an extent for the problem to ease
the other factor
of course
is that you could have an increase in supply
new power plants
but being that the amt
of time it takes to develop and build a power plant in ca is about 0 times as long as in most other states combined with the fact that ca hasn't had a new power plant in the last 0 years
an increase in supply doesn't seem likely in the short term
again
this is only my opinion
so you could take it with a grain of salt
talk to you soon
kevin
that state will never be the same
my prediction is that the state will be bankrupt within the next 0 years unless the federal gov't bails it out
i hope lowery has held off on buying his house
talk to you this weekend
i blew off the montana trip so i'll be home
kr
did you go to any parties last night
i was lame
i didn't go to a single one
i heard there were some decent ones
how's life at duke been
i haven't talked to you much since you've become a big ice trader
talk to you soon
kr
i don't think many buying opportunities out there
the economy is going to get crushed this year
there's only one place to put one's money now
and that is in cash
the manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an increase in plant shutdowns and company layoffs
the fed could continue to lower rates but there'll be little capital investment if consumer spending dries up
i feel we've just seen the beginning
i think the dow will be trading under 0 by the end of april
psychologically
the california crisis will add to consumer fear
the crisis is not a short term problem
as a result
barring any federal bailout
you could kiss that state's economy goodbye
let me ask you a question
if you were paying
0
the highest real estate prices in the country
and
0
the highest energy prices for the least reliable power
in
0
the midst of a hi-tech meltdown
what would keep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state
if you own any ca real estate
sell
the only way to solve the ca energy crisis is to reduce demand or increase supply
since ca doesn't want any power plants in its backyard
the supply issue likely won't be solved anytime soon
so
how do impact demand
you have to price energy
power/gas
so high that the discretionary user
household
manufacturer
commercial store
conserves by closing its plant
cutting back on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off-peak hours
california will see this reduction in demand over time
if the blackouts subside it's because so many businesses have closed their doors for good or moved to another state
without this
the blackouts will get much worse
if the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity and gas
i would bet it will go bankrupt within 0-0 yrs
could you imagine the impact on the national economy from the bankruptcy of the u.s.'s most prosperous state
obviously this is only my opinion
but i would keep my eyes on the energy markets
that's where the key to the turnaround lies
take care and thanks for the email
kevin
glad everyone had a good time at sweets
i hope he had a blast
in terms of your email reply
you can have calpine
how are they going to make money long term if price caps are instituted
this obviously would be the stupidest policy
in addition their exposure to the ca crisis must be pretty significant
when and how are they going to get paid
i wouldn't want to bank on the energy market in the most regulated state in the country
plus
if the state backs energy purchases
it's going to get to the point where who wants to own ca credit
pg&e and edison international are doomed
as they should be
the state of ca is going to go down the tubes unless they find some good leadership
unfortunately
noone out there seems to have the least clue on how to solve the problem
the politicians are a complete joke
it is incredibly disheartening to witness the absolute stupidity of the ca politicians in addressing this issue
they seem to be much more focused on finger pointing than coming up with a viable solution
i honestly think they are incable of solving the problem
kr
you're correct
enron doesn't get too involved in these conventions
i don't know why
it seems that some of the desks have some functions but mine never does
my desk seems to be pretty apathetic
probably not a good thing
i think we've relied
more than any of our other desks
on the financial and e-commerce sides of the business
probably not a great thing
anyway
lets get together for a cocktail or dinner sometime within the next month
did you guys move to the galleria location yet
let me know
we'll go get a big steak at morton's or ruths
chris
i assume a country boy like you is into some good red meat
kr
we'll just be doing some house shopping
i think we're going to postpone the upgrade to the existing house and look to buy a new house
this would eliminate the need to move out for 0 months
i'm dying to live in a house that is complete
anyway
besides this we don't seem to have much going on
i'll just need to go into work for a few hours on sunday
let me know what you want to do

of course
after you assemble the chair
what was lowery doing in san antonio

there's a girl on my desk that makes it in 0
so it'll probably take you 0
didn't you say mapquest said it takes around 0 hrs to get to houston from corpus
the interconnects are primarily in michigan
ohio and wisconsin
of course your dad would be invited to anything we do
but if you'd rather spend the time alone with him that weekend we could always make it another weekend
the only problem with the 0th is that we'll be consumed with the move the entire weekend
let me know what works for you
we're flexible after the 0th
kr
the 0th isn't good for me b/c we're moving
any other weekend should be ok though
kevin
easter was great
how
bout yours
it was just me
lisa and a friend of mine
how's everything been with you
how are the wedding plans coming
have you seen bruce lately
how
bout my brother
kevin
thanks lee
i appreciate it
kevin fyi aquila was a decent seller of jun and jun-oct ngpl/la today
not much action on the nov0-mar0
i'll keep you informed
feel free to call me at x0-0 if you have any questions
friday may be tough b/c we just bought a new house and we actually move the next day
however
let me check with lisa and i'll get back to you for sure
talk to you tomorrow
kevin
where are you moving to
how's the little one
hope everything is going great
we just bought a new house ourselves
we are moving in the 0th
this weekend we're hitting jazz fest in new orleans with capt frank p
conway
talk to you soon
kr
chris
what's the status of this product
i haven't heard anything in a while
kr
thought you might find the article interesting
he's the man
i saw that
unbelievable huh
the sad thing is that the folks i work with never heard of jack kerouac nor
on the road
probably not surprising considering most are from texas
how's everything going
did you get an opportunity to call kampy
how's the job search progressing
before i forget
was there a guy in our mba class named chris sevrson or something like that
an email was forwarded to me and that name was on the forward list and it sounded familiar
any big plans for the weekend
we're just hanging around houston
it seems every weekend for the past year+ we've been doing some type of house work
hopefully one day it will slow
talk to you soon
kevin
i need to hear the rest of the red neck weekend story
send me an email or give me a call
also do you have lowery's and t.j.'s email addresses
they were deleted from my system when our email system was upgraded
kr
the reason i asked about chris sevrens is that he was on the list
you'll see
of this email
i don't know if you heard about it but the author of the email got fired shortly after it circulated through wall st
anyway
thought you might find it amusing
start from the bottom of this email and work your way up
it's interesting to see the path it took to so many people
you'll see sevrens name near the bottom
kr
stephanie
could you please give me access to trade physical canadian products on eol
thanks
kevin ruscitti
thanks
don't know if you talked to conway
but it looks like i'm going to cancel my trip in a couple weeks
i really don't feel like flying right now with all the shit going on and the impending military strike
anyway
hopefully we can meet up soon
hope everything's going great
kr
conway
do you have t.j.'s new email address
i want to let him know i won't be out there in oct
give me a shout
how's everything going
my miata broke down this past weekend
i didn't think it would be that soon
it looks like i'm forced to buy a new car
i'm not looking forward to the process although the internet should make it less painful than it was 0.0 years ago
wow
i can't believe i've owned the miata for over 0 yrs
i'm going to see bonds play on wednesday night
hoping he'll be going for the record that night
either a tie or to break it
i scored tix in section 0
prime bonds territory
check out the section on the houston astros website
talk to you soon
kr
how's everything going
i assume great
how's the baby and patty doing
how
bout that barry bonds
you must be in heaven
0
baby boy
0
yanks win the division
0
bonds goes for record
i think bonds is going to break the record wednesday night in houston
guess who'll be sitting in section 0
check it out on the astros website
waiting for # 0
look for me on tv
kr
sweets
the flight was cancelled so we just drove to new orleans for the weekend
man was it a ghost town
how's everything with you
how's liz and the kids
how's the firm going
talk to you soon
kevin
beautiful baby
good job patty
i was at the game last night sitting in home run territory
section 0
it was one of the most disappointing games i've ever attended
the astros don't even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play
the manager's an idiot
intentionally walking bonds with guys on 0st and 0nd with 0 outs
anyway
in terms of the miata
the dealer recommended abt $0 worth of work
of course i told him to just get the thing running
$0
the problem is the blue book value is only $0 so i can't see putting another grand into it
i'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's
which is really big in texas
or donate it to charity and take the tax write off
we haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaning toward the bmw 0i
it seems to get great reviews
the main downside is that it's a little small
but still sporty
we'll go for test drives this weekend and should buy or lease
still undecided
something in the next couple weeks
how's everything on your front
less classroom time and more flying time
that faggot lowery was in austin this past weekend
i don't expect him to call of course but it shows how easily he could've gotten to houston while he was working for 0 mos
in dallas
later
what do you think about the 0
isn't it basically the same thing as the 0 except it's bigger
if so
does it handle as well with the added size and weight
did you watch the astros
giants game last night
it was embarrassing
i've never seen such a cowardly performance by a baseball team
of course i'm talking abt the astros
when do you ever walk a guy with runners on 0st and 0nd
your team is down by 0 run and there is 0 outs
answer
never
according to dierker
the critical walk was the one with runners on first and second
dierker said
we did that because jeff kent was 0-for-0 against williams and had struck out the last five at-bats
against him
so he showed some dominance against him
obviously
you don't want to put another runner on base and move the runners another base in scoring position unless you have a very compelling reason
and we did
how's long's this clown been managing
i guess he hasn't followed kent the last few years
it wasn't like he was walking bonds to get to ivan dejesus
he doesn't even have the sack to admit he fucked up
i've never seen fans boo their home team so much since the days of michael jack
have you and patty been getting any sleep
how's jack
kr
thanks for the advice
much appreciated
we plan on test driving this weekend
the bmw has a racing track in the back of the dealership
i heard it's pretty sweet
i have a feeling we're going to lean toward the 0i just b/c everything i've read rates it the best in its class
i feel like the 0 series will be too big for us right now
w/o kids
but we should get a better feel this weekend
i'll keep you informed
thanks again
kr
you'll never believe it but i turned it on at 0:0 so i guess your interview was over
if you have a copy
please send me a copy and i'll pay you for it
how's everything going
hope all is well
talk to you soon
kevin
i think the only difference btw the 0ci and the 0i is that the ci is a 0 door
had a choice btw wed and thur game
chose wed
not that disappointed though as the astros proved to be the biggest bunch of pussies in the ml
they were more concerned with not giving up a homer to bonds than with winning the game
now they stand a chance of not making the playoffs at all
if you ask me they don't deserve it and the mgr should be fired
it was great to hear the fans booing the home team every other inning
i'm sure they lost a lot of fans over those 0 games
anyway
what's up on your front
are you still going out to cali to visit hop and denise
how's flying
kr
it didn't down here b/c i watched it from 0:0
0pm unless it actually came on 0pm down here with the time difference
i bet that's what happened
kr
i'd like to but i'm tied up doing house stuff all day
have you found a group in houston
how's the search going
tell matt i said hi
we have a lot of things to do saturday or else i would
believe me
we'll have to get together the next time
let me know if i can help any more with your search
kevin
sounds good based on 0 condition
you and ml do not pick up everyone's dinner
we'll just go out to dinner and a show and we'll all split it
sounds like fun
good idea
must've been ml's
kr
great to hear from you
glad to know everyone's doing well
did you know moller was going to be on tv or were you just channel surfing
how did he do
work's going ok
ene stock has been getting destroyed
a lot of negative press abt management
i would sell your shares if you still have them
it's $0 right know but i have a feeling it's going lower
tell dave also if you talk to him
news has been coming out that i wasn't aware of
anyway
lisa's job is going great
she's really happy
we haven't been up to a lot lately
just hanging around the neighborhood
the anthrax scares and the terrorist stories are really scary
what a bunch of nuts we have living in this world
i have a feeling it could get worse before it gets better
don't open any letters from unknown companies or counterparties
take care of yourself and gloria and tommy
tell them we said hi and we'll talk to you soon
kevin
i'd sell all of the ene
kr
steve
hope everything is going well
unfortunately i won't be able to attend the reunion
hope you have a great time
talk to you soon

not a lot
just working and watching my company's stock get the shit kicked out of it
i did get married last year
but everything else has been pretty quiet
how
bout yourself
what have you been up to
who have you kept in touch with
kevin
i'm not going to be able to make it
i talked to lisa and we're heading back to nj for her friends wedding
i'm hoping to make a trip to ca sometime next year
i hope you have a great time and tell lulenski i said hi
kevin
i think enron is going to $0
i've been quite concerned for the last month+
it looks like a number of the senior execs have done some questionable acts
it's been quite the moral buster
they need to clean shop and get rid of the ceo and entire board for letting these types of actions occur
we will never regain investor confidence until this occurs
the problem with ene is that we make an incredible amt of money on the wholesale side of the energy business
natural gas and power
but we have thrown money at a myriad of bad businesses that lost lots of money
azurix water co
broadband
residential marketing
they need to get someone in here that will eliminate these losers and focus on the core businesses
in my opinion
some of these execs
former and current
should go to jail
it's amazing how a group of guys could ruin a great company
i'm sure there will be a grad school case study and a book written about this
i'm sure it will be a best seller
anyway
let me get off my soapbox
i'm glad to hear you got a new job
that would be great if chris gets the package and looks for something more enjoyable
congrats to you brother and make sure you tell your folks i was asking about them
lisa and i haven't finalized any plans to nj in jan but i'll let you know as soon as we do
we're both looking forward to hooking up with you guys
conway won't have to go overseas
he said he's the last one they'll activate
his cell phone # is 0-0-0
i have to look for his email but i'll let you know when i find it
take care and good to hear from you
kevin
are you taking any resumes
i need to start the process
i don't know what the future holds here
i don't think anyone does
we don't know if there will be more mgmt surprises

no problem

haven't heard from you in some time
what's up
you're not in afghanistan are you
only kidding

you could call me at home if you like at 0-0-0
kevin ruscitti
no
there's been a lot of shit happening with my company and frankely
i don't know what's going to happen over the next few months

we decided to wait at least a few months until our financial situation is better known
glad to hear everything's going well

the flow of info around here has been horrible
i have no idea on what's happening
a bad situation to be in obviously
we're just reading all the news on the wires
