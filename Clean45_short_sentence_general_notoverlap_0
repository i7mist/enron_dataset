west gas trading
i created the term gd basis products for waha
perm
sj
opal
and malin this weekend
call dale or melba to activate
keith and i briefly discussed how we would handle the new responsibility
i am fine with managing the prompt month gd basis
while you guys manage the term
i will be back in the office this week and we can talk about the products
would we handle the monthly the same way
when do we plan to phase the monthly out
have phillip manage the perm and waha basis until i return
dale is also working on the baja and redwood on/off system spreads
we can roll these out for all terms as well
see you this week
i am sure that you are aware of the move to daily basis from monthly
the west desk will be trying to phase out monthly for daily in the next month
we have created term gd basis vs
the hhub gd through apr-oct 0 for all index points
please contact keith holst if you should have any questions regarding the new spread products
please let him know when they are completed
i will be out of the office until wednesday
thank you very much
mike grigsby
can we create a san juan phys for oct bidweek
what did we decide with this product
swing only
if we do
i would like to link it to the basis plus nymex
or to the fixed price gas daily
fixed price gas daily will be rolled out during bidweek this month because of our risk in gd basis going forward
i want to roll the inside ferc phys points out during bidweek 0-0
as defined by inside ferc
last trade is mid
the ngi index points will be out 0 to 0 during bidweek
as defined by ngi
we will plan on sending the data to both index publications
time open to market
time of actual trade
counterparty
price
etc
this will be considered their last opportunity to be accurate or we will decline to participate until their numbers are audited
thanks
mike
when do we expect to hear back from ngi on the sep index
let's continue to go long sep swing on socal
i am willing to as long as we can each day
the plan of getting short for oct bidweek no longer applies because of reduced basis risk in oct basis
thanks
let's continue to buy socal for the rest of the month
i would like to sell rockies
and remian neutral on permian and san juan
unless it looks like the maint on washington ranch will have a bullish effecst on the basins
i will leave it up to you to determine
i will call later
mike
can you put a tab together for our phys index positions nov-mar
thanks mike
keep buying n-m socal gd index up to plus
0
i will buy as much as they want to sell
talk to amerex
mike
steve
start buying n-m citygate index this week
pay as much as necessary to get resonable size
i am thinking 0,0/d for the winter
thanks for the update
try to stay flat on all gas dailies tomorrow
our length is good for now
let's stay flat for now in the oct index
i will be working from home in the morning

dear tom
enron would be interested in getting together with other trading partners to discuss listing other index points at the socal border
i think the market requires other postings to reflect the fundamental changes in the market with respect to transportation constraints
the market has clearly seen a divergence in the summer spreads between pg&e and socal interconnects
the marginal generation load in sp-0 and southern california this summer has proven that socal gas is short delivered gas and is incapable of meeting daily demand with flowing supplies
and will be incapable of injecting gas during these months
because of this
supply being transported from the southwest supply basins can only find a home going into pg&e
this places downward pressure on pg&e topock gas and upward pressure on socal topock gas
remember
socal is an island
not because of the delivered capacity to the border via epng and tw
but because of the limited capacity of socal's interconnects
demand exceeds the supply interconnect capacity
there is also a divergence between ehrenberg and topock because of liquidity
topock is a more liquid market because of the upstream transport contracts on epng and downstream buying patterns of certain socal markets
the market is more diversified at topock than ehrenberg
the overwhelming demand pressure on socal gets exposed at topock
although ehrenberg is the marginal point for gas into socal
there is more of an imbalance in upstream capacity
epng and tw
to downstream capacity
socal topock 0,0/d
at socal topock than at ehrenberg
the socal ehrenberg interconnect has 0.0 bcf of capacity and is primarily sourced by one market transporter
ehrenberg simply gets placed at
market prices
because of varying objectives
one transporter may place gas to larger buyers to ensure flows
while smaller buyers on socal may not approach this transporter for supplies
this illiquidity has led to a spread existing between topock and ehrenberg
picture the market
san juan gas is trading well below the permian and waha basins
which happen to be the marginal supply points for the west
because of the of the limited capacity going into socal topock
every transporter on epng and tw wants to fill their contracts with san juan gas first
these molecules compete for buyers at a limited delivery interconnect
likewise
all buyers reach out for supply coming through a limited delivery interconnect
topock
the san juan then trys to find an outlet going east on the sj east leg of epng
this transport leg simply displaces permian gas going into plains north and allows permian gas to head west to ehrenberg on the epng south mainline
while the socal market peaks in the summer
so does the eoc demand
permian west
keystone west meter
cannot satisfy both the eoc demand and the socal demand
so for the first time ever
we saw epng waha west at maximum capacity to source transport contracts on the epng south mainline
this tells the entire story
when demand exceeds all available historical supply points
and begins to reach to waha to meet ehrenberg demand
you have a paradigm shift
this eliminates any correlation that may have existed between the supply basins and the market area
when keystone west reaches maximum capacity
the rule of market spreads not exceeding the max rate transport rate then dies a fast death
there is simply no available capacity at the keystone west meter to allow a shipper to buy max rate transport on epng and ship it to socal
if you asked the market what the maximum interconnect capacity at keystone west is
0 out of 0 would not know
this leads to blaming market participants for wide spreads that are above historical levels
it is like al gore blaming
big oil companies
for the high prices of gas
when all refineries are at maximum capacity
there simply isn't the capacity to meet demand
the supply exists
but there isn't enough refining capacity available to meet demand
fundamentals rule the market in all cases
i would like to propose the following index points for the southern california border
the market would be better served with supply being included in these index points
one
socal ca production/socal storage/epng ehrenberg
two
topock tw and epng
three
krs/wheeler ridge
the market will be experiencing more changes with respect to the socal restructuring in the future
we will then address the different interconnects and propose an index for the socal citygate as well
call me on monday to discuss the enron online download

we do not wish to participate in a closed market
call me later
mike grigsby

thank you very much

but shouldn't the products be listed as follows
gd/d pg&e what you think
how would the legal description read
thanks
mike
please read the following email from eol
i have asked them to assist the west desk in mailing out an ad to all of our customers
utilities
producers
industrials
and some ipps
notifying them of our plan to reduce the minimum volume accepted on all of our eol products
start thinking of which customers should be on the list and try to think of a creative way to present this to our customers
eol has asked us to provide them with the text of our message
also
let's go ahead and reduce the min volume on our products
primarily all phys and gas dailies
this week
we are attempting to capture all of the odd lot flow in the market
i would see this service as a clear advantage over the other web platforms
let's get together on friday afternoon at ninfa's to discuss our ideas
thanks
mike
hello
the west gas desk would like to send a mailout to our eol customers regarding the new opportunity to trade
odd lots
on every physical product
eol has been instrumental in providing liquidity to previously illiquid physical delivery points in the west for standard volumes of 0 mmbtu/d and greater
but we would like to notify our customers that eol will now accommodate odd size lots
in 0 mmbtu increments
this will allow us to trade the
non-standard
volumes with all of the market
do we have a creative team that might be able to assist us in our efforts
we were thinking about a one page mailout with a clear message
we would like it to be very upbeat and funny
thank you for your assistance
i can be reached at x0
sincerely
mike grigsby director
west gas trading
let's begin rolling out the cash products at 0:0 am
we should also get back to the cash strategy of the desk each morning
let's start testing the market
find the support and resistance each day
it would be nice to have eol change the stack manager so that we can switch a product from manage market depth to last trade is mid with the click of a button
and not go through the product properties
i'll call them tomorrow
let's also decide on a time to close the products each morning
we want to send the message of reliability
but also allow our ops group to balance and nom
i want to begin trading the next day cash by 0:0 am every day
this would stay active until 0:0
the push is for physical
our edge over the market will be phys
from risk to the ability to nominate and invoice
the other platforms will never see it coming
what are the chances that ice and espeed will deal with el paso flows
if information is the reason for eol
then this will provide it
it all seems so simple
fixed priced physical
just when you thought it was old economy
the reliable indices to big position trading to eol market share
all benefit under the new mantra
mike
great
can you come to trading floor around 0:0 am on wednesday
i am located at 0c
sincerely
mike grigsby
we will launch as soon as we get the mailout to our customers
mike
the gas daily basis issue should be worked out between your desk and the monthly basis desk
we are making markets on gd basis for every term and index point
this creates a nice market for term gd index
let us know how you guys would like to cover the gd basis with us
the real opportunity for gd basis is at socal
where the monthly index is so unreliable
mike
nice job on the postcard
i will get you an answer on the mailout tomorrow morning
let me know if you hear anything from eol regarding the new version
thanks
mike grigsby
after continuing to play musical chairs with the west eol products
i think we have decided on a plan
keith and frank will handle the prompt and term basis
this includes the monthly basis
daily basis
and gd index for sj
rox
scal
cg
and malin
they will make certain that the gd index products are out there for all terms
cary metz is managing the perm products
i will handle the prompt month physical fixed price and index for all of the index points
the term physical index will be coming soon
the rest of the group will continue to manage their cash index points for the next day trading
while adding the bom physical with a basis link to monique's gd bom products
i would like to get the cash products out on eol by 0:0 each morning
the early info will come in handy as we approach winter
let me know what you think
steve and matt have started a pilot program in the nw for rolling out their next day cash products after 0:0 am each day
we will look into rolling out the sw in the future
we are in the process of sending out the
odd lot
notice to our customers regarding all products on eol
we will change our product minimum to one mmbtu in the next week
you may want to discuss this with your direct customers before the mailout
with the addition of olivia newton-john to my scour selection
it is no secret that we have a new commitment to physical in the west
if you review your customer contact sheet and discover an old customer that we haven't contacted in some time
then call them and visit
we will be using eol and the brokers for physical volumes
but nothing beats the direct phone call for the baseload phys
thanks
mike
let's plan on mailing this out to the us customers only
call me today to discuss the eol new version
thanks
mike
please sweep the products in phys non-tx<0 month and phys index non tx<0 month
also
i need access to view restricted products in product manager for non-tx phys forward and index<0 month

i like this report
can it be put into the same format as the other
access
reports
thanks for all of your work on this project
you are doing a great job
mike
this is the data that we will use to build our socal growth estimates
take a look at the file and then we can discuss how to combine this with current pipeline capacity and future expansions
mike
hey guys
let's try this
take the data from 0 and change the following
take keystone west volumes to 0,0/d rateably
then add the new gen numbers posted below
you will need to add this demand to the eoc s ml demand numbers
is salmayuca included in this number
we should use the 0 waha west volumes for now
you should end up with reduced ehrenberg volumes for the reduction in keystone west volumes and the addition of new gen demand
run the storage balance at 0 socal in this scenario
we will then plug forward with waha west volumes to balance socal in 0
also
add columns to adjust
0%
0%
0%
etc
the burns for new gen in sw
we should then look to adjusting socal demand down for the high hydro/increased nw imports to ca scenario that could happen
use the sp-0 0 gen numbers and then back out the avg of 0 and 0 power imports
i would like to avoid averaging 0 and 0 socal gas demand
use a 0,0 heat rate to reduce gas demand
have jay adjust eoc demand for normal weather
we may have to refer to the load sensitivity data from west power to reduce the sw electric loads and then back out of gen numbers using a 0,0 heat rate
we will then be exposed to epng and the ops increasing keystone west volumes between now and next summer
run the 0 with this possibility as well
take key west to 0.0 bcf
let me know where my errors in approach may be
this should give us a picture of the socal deliverability for 0
thanks
mike
please create the following monthly for daily swap
if gd/d cig
n sys
the gd index is listed under cig

the clark family will have me traveling to abilene on this day
i hate to miss the highlight of the x-mas holiday
let me know what the plans are for new year's eve this year
will you guys be in houston
i hope dallas is treating you well
we can't wait to see michael
clark and jake are doing great
no attachments included
my address is 0 meadow lake 0 and my home phone is 0-0-0
the horns looked great last week
chris simms is alive
the best quarterback performance i have ever seen in memorial stadium since peter the great
just think if we had phil brown running the ball
grigs
we will need to discuss how to adjust physical risk to match the flow constraints on epng
the currrent capacity cuts in the sj and socal topock delivery points are 0%
i would like my p&l to show this risk
please find a way to adjust the positions according to a daily flow curve that can be set in newcurrentday by either myself or monique
also
we will need to set up a new physical curve for mojave topock
our transport is currently being reallocated by epng for deliveries to mojave instead of socal topock
i would like to show the transport on epng value as sj plus cost to mojave and have the value roll out each month
if any
the risk is showing the value of sj to socal topock
currently wide spreads for 0
on the transport when it actually has less value delivering to mojave sincerely
mike
the position sheet from yesterday afternoon
close of business
is quite different than the position posted in newcuurentday for 0/0
what do you think the difference is
the sj
perm
and socal don't match
are we booking them correctly
let me know
ask anne to reconcile each day with comments on the prompt tab
thanks
mike
are we confident that the gda priced positions are not being represented in my newcurrentday position sheet
i know that phillips triggered their volumes back to gda equivalent and that matt lenhart bought some gda malin gas
how do we keep these from showing up in the physical risk
mike
thank you
can you also address the question about gda physical volumes not showing up in my position manager
let me know
mike
ina
will you please add the following fax number to the fax memory button that pete keavey uses to submit daily prices
the ngw fax number is 0-0-0

starting tonight
will you add ngw to the monthly bidweek email and index postings
send the documents to sspeaker@energyintel.com thanks
mike
the pg&e basis position in tds does not match the feb/mar position
the baja spread was executed as a nov-mar position months ago
the only real changes were to socal basis over time
there is no telling when this might have changed in error
will you please research the position to see when this position was reduced
i am guessing that a park and loan was executed by frank ermis at some point and the basis risk was allocated to gd new by mistake
thanks
mike
okay
i think the tds tab in newcurrentday was wrong
it is showing a jan pos of 0.0 lots
but tds is showing 0.0
false alarm
we will fix mike
anne
we need to delete the two trades listed under rockies that are priced 0.0 and 0.0
please move these trades to sumas and resend the data to the publications with an explanation
the index for rox should be 0.0 after you make the changes

did we send the odd lot trading postcard to all of our customers

our rc number is 0
thank you
mike grigsby
what do you thnk about amazon gift certificates of $0.0 to the group
let's put the
tick
on selling mojave index for feb-oct 0
heavy orig if he can find a nice market
let's put ina on the west desk trip for feb
we should book it now to send a nice message to the group after our last cancellation
good morning
with the energy crisis in california at this time
we will need to be extra careful with nominations at socal and throughout the west to ensure that we continue to provide the excellent nomination service that we have been providing to our customers
you guys are doing an excellent job and we understand that you are under quite a bit of pressure with limited staff
our contracts state that we must notify every customer of pipeline allocations 0 hours in advance
we all know that this can be almost impossible on epng
but because of the current price levels at socal and the basins
enron needs to call each customer and notify them of their cuts with an explanation of the pipeline cuts each day to avoid any potential penalties
we also need to document when the call was made
in regards to the atm nominations on socal
ones that we can't monitor
enron will be requesting full pipeline summaries of the nominations from our counterparties
please try to think of any nomination gaming that may take place at these historical levels
we need to remember that our counterparties may not act as they have in the past due to the market price implications on their p&l
we should not rely on prior business conduct in regards to
standard epng allocations
when dealing with our customers
i would expect that the market is going to overreact to any cuts that may be above the
pipeline average
let's discuss how we are going to monitor the flows of nominations out of our control
how do we prevent collusion with respect to the socal nominations that we can't see
are there package numbers on each baseload contract to ensure that they don't simply reshuffle gas according to price
let me know which companies are not providing enron with timely allocation reports at socal and i will call their senior trader to discuss getting this operational information sooner
sincerely
mike
any word on the sw bell charges for dsl service
also
will you have houston cellular activate my voice mailbox
thanks
mike
anne
we would like to know the p&l for trading california gas this year for physical only
please run a report summarizing the p&l at socal topock
pg&e then need to notify john lavorado of the results
thanks
mike
please send the sources of our ferc ca analysis to becky cantrell
she needs to include the sources with the filing
please add carey metz to our bidweek index survey spreadsheet
thanks
mike
i would like to add electronic index descriptions to the database
please refernece gas daily publication
page three for the location of these indices
we can simply insert the location of the electronic index where we currenly have the gas daily index survey language in the gd swaps in the database
i would like to have electronic gd swaps for the following points
el paso permian
el paso
non-bondad
kern river/opal plant
socal gas
large packages
we will need to add electronic to the product title to differentiate between the two gd swaps
thanks
mike grigsby
let's discuss the following
making markets on gd swaps and managing the risk hiring a new analyst to track our spreadsheets
create our products and get them ready to trade each morning
your access eol reports
get it to a level that ina might be able to download the data each day
talk to susan about joining the group
mike
i have been thinking about the cash book idea for group and i think we need to discuss this in more detail
i would like to continue to use the physical for large prompt positions going forward
i am afraid that the baseload volumes may not continue on their current trend if we break out the books
we need to discuss how the cash books would lay off risk
i.e
intra regional spreads with gd swap legs or spreads with other cash points and then booking out at gd mid to the internal counterparty
janie managing sj and laying off risk on steve's opal
i know that the cash books would be a good idea for dailies
but i am not sure how to do this without giving up the cash risk for baseload as well
what are your thoughts
i would also like to discuss the staffing issues
matt smith and susan scott to analyst
jay to the rox
etc
it seems like ken s
has shown more interest in the west fundies lately
should we keep his services
the basis products need another book
who can we add to the mix
i think that we should look into having frank focus on prompt month only
he has a great interest in cash and fundies and this should serve him well in managing tight two ways for all products on the prompt
keith can do term with another book
monique is going to take over the gd swaps for kern
sj
and perm
i will continue to manage the ca products
this should allow us to provide tighter two ways across the west
i will continue to manage all index products and prompt month phys fixed price
operations needs more labor as well as an analyst or two to monitor flows
the analysts will monitor flows by price and hopefully find creative ways to nom the market
eol
keith has a great idea of opening up all products to the desk so that you may insert a bid or an offer inside of the manager's markets
we should propose this to eol
this would allow for tighter markets on all products and prevent the desk from working markets through the brokers
ca cash products
let's call a meeting about how to offer more socal physical products
i would like to have pg&e topock and socal ehrenberg before the summer
mike
please activate all draft products in finswaps
and nontx phys and phys index
all terms
including restricted sj
thank you very much
please call me when they are activated
mike grigsby
barry
i would like to focus our deal flow on apr-oct or 0 yr san juan and rockies supply
our fundamental investment is mainly in the rockies for 0
let's get together with mark whitt
paul lucci
and others to set our supply goals for the mainly the apr-oct period
i would like to work on buying every mmbtu of opal
and all points included in the if nw rockies index
our goal should be to purchase at least 0,0/d of rockies supply and 0,0/d of san juan blanco and bondad
we have been buying these phys index points at +.0 in the rockies and +.0 in the san juan
you may need to coordinate with fred lagrosta's group initially to get all of their producer contacts
thanks

mike
patti
will you please review each of the sw gas deals on this spreadsheet and let me know which deals they penalized us for
we are looking to see if they have been penalizing multiple deals or one deal in particular
they claim that all one month deals fall under an it contract that cannot be penalized
i want to make certain that they did not penalize one month deals
thanks
mike
dear jeff
i am interested in summarizing all of our contracts in the western region and identifying any problems
i.e
penalty language
notification deadlines for ofos
etc
that may need to be addressed
we have experienced a few problems with sw gas corp
recently
they have been penalizing enron for cuts on epng
but when we pursued penalties with them on a baseload one month deal last month
they claimed that all one month deals have been booked on an interruptible contract and cannot be penalized
this was news to me
can you help me identify what types of contracts we are using to transact business with our customers in the west
i can honestly say that these contracts have not been reviewed by the west desk for some time
phillip allen transferred the desk to me in august of 0 and i have not spent the time to review all of contracts
let's get together and discuss exactly what i may need
sincerely
mike grigsby
ina
please have the it group delete all copies of ice and altrade from the west desk
i think randy is the only one
thanks
mike
jeff
did you allow me access to all gas reports on executive reports viewer
let me know

socal from southern california border average
this new index excludes krs fixed priced trades
please let the brokers know about the changes to socal basis going forward
please change basis and gd swing swaps
fp and index
in eol
also
frank and matt should set up basis and a gd swap
fp and index

pg&e
this will be the index for pg&e topock
this index will be effective for april 0
i will have the physical product out there as soon as possible
let me know when they have been changed

i will submit the move request for the west desk on monday
we should have anne fill this spot
i would like her to keep track of new current day and all new deals that flow through the desk
she can coordinate tickets to your group and make sure that they get booked throughout the day
she can also put physical deals in sitara
let me know what the desktop pc will need to be loaded with
start thinking of other tasks that she might be able to accomplish so that your group may get home at an earlier time each day
you can keep this desk for your own use and rotate people through as needed
thanks
mike
let's start thinking about transitioning sj to 0% flow
i would like to discuss all of the issues and costs of presenting such a product to the market
think about what we might need in the form of northwest transport
storage
operations personnel
etc
i realize that this will be risky and that i may experience some financial downside with this endeavor
but i think we should press forward
will we need intra-day traders to place the gas
do we need to establish intra-day relationships with sj producers
utilities
etc
will the allocation on el paso in april alleviate some of the cuts
let's discuss in detail
mike
what is this for
will you please set up the 0% flow sj product
i would like the title to be just like the current ep product
no mention of 0% flow on the title
i would like to avoid making this a separate index posting
let's make this available to the entire market
thanks
mike
let's set up the new indices on tues
pg&e topock and socal border
matt and frank will set up new products for gd swaps and basis
i am working on the phys index
keith will change the socal index from southern ca border average to southern border
socal
this new index excludes krs
grigs
please let me know when our new socal and pg&e index descriptions are available
also
please activate the phys index producst in draft
one year terms 0-0
thanks
mike
anne
on the last day of the month we need to send in the index before noon
we ar so proud of you
mike
yours
i hate golf
thanks for thinking of me
i would like to take a quiet stroll with you in a dark alley
thank you
will you please show me the detail from yesterday's difference and today's difference
mike
let's have matt start on the following
database for hourly storage activity on socal
begin forecasting hourly and daily activity by backing out receipts
using iso load actuals and backing out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption
and then using temps to estimate core gas load
back testing once he gets database created should help him forecast core demand
update socal and pg&e forecast sheets
also
break out new gen by epng and tw pipelines
mike
matt
your new responsibility for 0:0 meeting will be to go over all gen outages in the west by region and fuel type
and to discuss the previous days gen numbers and load forecasts
including pricing info and heat rates from the portland guys and/or megawatt daily will also help
effective on thursday
thanks
mike
dear john
i had a meeting with phillip after our morning discussion about p&l and it seems that there may be some issues regarding how i run my book
it was my mistake about whether or not the put options for april socal were booked properly
the options were booked properly by larry may and my book runners and the profit was realized for 0/0
my apologies for declaring that the options were not in my position
also
the tolls curves are not treated as schedule c
i will adjust the tolls curves to account for basis curveshift as needed
my p&l did not match the socal position because of physical index curveshift and an adjustment to transport
the discussion and feedback from phillip regarding your conversation with him concerns me
i am confident that i run the most accurate physical and financial trading book within enron
i will stand on the fact that no one within the market has a better understanding of his/her position better than i
the physical/financial risk in my book is managed to a standard not seen at enron since i have been here
few people realize the great lengths i go to to manage the risk in the im west trading book
i am transitioning from my role as a trader on the west desk to one that it is responsible for communicating with you directly
let's get together and discuss exactly what my responsibilities to you will be going forward
it may be that i relied to heavily on my subordination to phillip allen up until this point
this may have contributed to my miscommunication with you
i will see that this will not happen in the future
thank you for all of my added responsibilities
sincerely
mike grigsby
pablo
will you stop by when you get a chance to do the following
0
set up network connection to laptop 0
download passport and gasselect on desktop and laptop 0
level the monitors thanks
mike
melba
please set up the souther border
pg&e and southern border
socal inices in the database
we have new risk coming in april that needs to find a market soon on eol
we can have ngi send you the new index posting if you need it
also
please acitvate long term index products of one year
there is also a pg&e topock phys product in the one month category for april that needs to be activated
i look forward to hearing from you monday morning
sincerely
mike grigsby
you guys have no chance of building a strong presence here at enron
susan and i will make sure of it
stick to the galant night and blancos
melba
thank you for your assistance
these look good
mike
please check the gd swap cheyenne positions for march
i am confident that i have cheyenne short positions on this month
but they are not showing up in the intraday tab
please check to see if they are booked as kern/opal by mistake
thank you
mike
mark
please describe in detail
the downstream capacity available to transport this gas
how does the cig capacity being sold to coastal impact this point
if you can make the case for this gas flowing without constraint
then i see no problem in making a fixed price bid for the full volume
a rough sketch of the gas location and its downstream flow options would be nice
thanks
mike
let's talk to matt about the forecast sheets for socal and pg&e
he needs to work on the tw sheet as well
also
i would like him to create a sheet on pipeline expansions and their rates and then tie in the daily curves for the desk to use
mike
the index products look great
can you have the same constraint language included on the pg&e topock location for creating the phys forward
fixed price
product
let me know when that is done
thank you
mike
frank
the new procedures for trading basis are working well
we still need to get the desk comfortable with submitting orders to you guys
but overall i am pleased with the new procedure
i need to work on staying out of the basis market entirely going forward
can you also try to work all basis at socal through keith
let keith and mo see all of your socal/malin spreads in the future
i think i gave you an order to work apr-oct 0 socal/malin at the same time keith was trying to sell a-o 0 socal basis
i will let him know in the future so that we do not cross him in the market
thanks
mike
we have created the new southern border index products for socal and pg&e topock
please create your new basis and gas daily products for these indices as soon as possible
mattt will need to create the gd index products as well
let the brokers know about the new indices i have the back office setting up new curves to book these deals
you will have two curves for socal now
the curves will show your risk on the old index
as well as the new index
the new socal index is the same as the old except that excludes krs
i will be taking these phys products out on eol as soon as possible
thanks
mike
steve
let's discuss all of your new rox products for eol
i would like to know which products to roll out on eol for april bidweek
i would also like to discuss creating a south of muddy creek product for kern gas
i would assume that it would fall under the if kern index
thanks
mike
melba

thanks
mike
can we scrub the transport model p&l for yesterday
did the transport being switched to pg&e topock show any losses
let me know the breakdown
thanks
mike
please review the transport positions in sitara for next month
we should have the baja transport included
0,0 short for pg&e topock
0,0 long citygate
and 0,0 long krs
the sj to socal transport should be broken out to like 0,0 topock
0,0 mojave
and the balance to pg&e topock
also
please check on the kingsgate to malin and stanfield to malin for next month
what about sj to waha
patti
please run a report showing all of the sitara transport deals
thank you
mike
i made some big changes to the index curves tonight

i will need to let john lavorado know about the changes to the curves before we decide to book these tomorrow
please run a report from the transport model so that i may see the changes to the delivery points
thanks
mike
frank ermis claims that this deal was priced at index
he was the trader on this deal
please call him to discuss
sincerely
mike grigsby
anne
can you look at this deal and check to see how it was priced
ken called yesterday and we bought 0/d april from him at 0.0
he said it could be either milagro or el paso sj
please call him and confirm the receipt point
thanks
mike
anne
we will need to add a message to the email that we send out to the publications this bidweek
let's get together to discuss the text
we have added new products that will need to be matched with their respective index postings
thanks
mike
the information is correct
please settle with the customer
thanks
mike
the rockies index language looks good
we need to separate the southern border pg&e trades from the southern border socal and socal trades
all socal trades
except krs
which we have none at this time
go under socal and trades go under the southern border
pg&e wacog
please make the change to the sheet and forward a copy to me before emailing
thanks
mike
please write up a ticket transferring my cig and wic april physical positions to im denver
i will be selling cig index to jay at cig index flat and buying the 0/d at cig index minus
0
also
run a report of all my term index positions at cig and wic for the summer
so that we can transfer these to jay as well
thanks
mike
jay
what are we doing with questar positions
are you managing this index point
i have an april position and mark whitt is working on a term deal
thanks
mike
anne
can we add pg&e topock and mojave topock index points to the ncd locations
i think we discussed that they can't be added because of their association with socal curves
let me know
also
can we add the new rockies index locations to the ncd sheet
it would be nice to see these locations broken out in detail
mike
we now have a pg&e topock basis product on eol
the curve is currenlty mapped to socal with the differential to socal being calculated in the physical index curve
let's work on setting up this curve on tuesday so that it shows the accurate value for fin deals
we can have the curve calc off of a discount to citygate in keith's spreadsheet
mike
please call me
i believe i ordered a bloomberg machine only
does it some with its own operating system or is it offered through the network
please let me know before coming to install
i already have two computers
thanks
mike
we need to talk about the contract language for holly sugar
please see kim ward about some of the language we have used for full-req customers on pg&e
thanks
mike
anne
what was this converation about
let me know what they wanted
thanks
mike
please sign me up for the new parking garage
thank you
mike grigsby
please include me on this trip
have ina reserve a plane flight for us if you don't mind
thanks
mike
i will use this pc for bloomberg only
i already have two pcs
one for normal networking and one for eol
my login is mgrigsb and my password is mike0coco
my lotus notes password is mike0coco
please feel free to install the pc and monitors on thursday or friday
thanks
mike
yes
please forward me the login and password again
i would like to be included in enron's corporate wide license
thanks
mike grigsby
anne
can we add the new pg&e topock curve to the basis transport tab
also
the lt transport section is showing the transport positions through 0
which is incorrect
please review the transport deals in the model and delete the positions
thanks
mike
anne
it looks like the socal position for socal is incorrect
the position looks much smaller than it did today
please check to see if patti made changes to deals in sitara
mike grigsby
thank you
thanks
i don't think that there should be a fin gd swap position of 0 lots in the mojave index column
please check to see how the deal was booked
thanks
mike
that was the main factor
the cash market also had a difficult time trading higher than 0.0
the basis curve was on its way to contango
when it has lived in backwardation for some time
this created resistance on the basis curve
the pg&e announcement pushed it over the edge
market is back up today on stronger cash and the socal edison announcement
mike
i will be coming back on this flight
please disregard my request to go directly to las vegas
i will need a flight to las vegas on the following friday and returning sunday morning
thanks
mike
monday at 0:0 would be great
thanks
mike grigsby
please make the return on sunday earlier
before 0:0 would be great
thanks
mike
anne
i would like to check the index positions in the physindex tab in ncd
please have all of the positions in the basistransport tab
section transport model
added to the phys index position totals
please look at the pg&e cg positions for may-oct
i added the transport positions already
i would like to add a krs row in the physindex summary to account for the 0/d transport that we have
also
please have the new transport index positions at socal that we are booking tomorrow included in the new krs column in the physindex tab

matt smith
tomorrow
mike
anne

mike

please get together with me and the fundies group to work out a report
thanks
mike
i will volunteer for interviewing candidates
thanks
mike grigsby
thank you for the summary
where can we find a detailed summary of the gas cost mechanism
are we confident that it is an average of all border points into ca
if the real time price is capped at the least efficient generator
then what happens if this genertor can only buy socal daily gas
this avergae ca gas price will lead to a tighter heat rate for the generators
since the spread between malin and socal has reached $0.0 at times
thank you
mike grigsby
what was the 0 million diff
physical book
thanks
mike
the proxy price will be gas daily and cantor fitzgerald for ca deliveries
how do we submit prices to cantor fitzgerald
anne
we will need to come up with a cash report
much like our monthly index report for the publications
our data submitted will be under scrutiny at some point in the future
it is important that all of our cash
one day
deals are reported accurately each day
thanks
mike
you all have done an excellent job with the gas daily products
i have been asked to follow up with you guys to ensure that the products are rolled out on eol at the same time each day and that they be managed in the same manner that you manage your cash products each day
we have been asked to have one a day up at all times with a relatively tight two way and to provide market depth
you may provide market depth
offset to last trade
or use last trade mid functions
let me know if you have any questions or concerns regarding this request
thanks
mike
cantor fitzgerald will be used along with gas daily for ca gas prices under the ferc proxy price
are you guys familiar with cantor's pricing publication
how do we submit prices to these guys
let me know if you have any idea
thanks
mike

we have heard all of the typical low price rumors of rockies shut-ins at a dollar

nice work
these attachments do not work
i would like to set up a spreadsheet to enter each deal that i transact
internal and external
i would then like columns set up that allow monte to enter post ids for all hedge strips for prior day and new day
we should then sum the net change of the two and balance against the columns summing the new deals that i enter each day
this method should give us another way of checking if all new deals are being booked properly
please meet with keith holst to discuss how to set up the sheet
he has a similar process of checkking new deals
once this is set up
please have each bookrunner adopt the same prcatice with their trader
i would like anne to be responsible for seeing that this new process is in place for next week's business
i understand that the standard for most deals is 0/d and that this can lead to booking 0/d at this volume
we need to have anne set up a trader deal sheet that lists the volume and price in a clear and legible format for all bookrunners
thanks
mike
i would like to set up a brief meeting in the afternoon this week or next
to discuss increasing the liquidity in west basis on eol
it would be helpful for our desk to sit down with john arnold and john lavorato to openly discuss the importance of continuing to increase liquidity on eol
i would also like to put to rest the notion that increasing liquidity leads to negative p&l and that a trader's support of eol liquidity will go unrecognized at year end prc
please email me with a response of when we could set up such a meeting
sincerely
mike grigsby
should we reschedule when scott neal is available
i love the
club
quote
because they really are
it is a good old boy network that colludes against every day and every month
in this case
the
club
is reliant
williams
duke and others who own tw transport to sj from ignacio
our tw transport expires in dec
so for enron to bid firm 0% flow in the sj
we have to price it at a discount because of the cuts through bondad on el paso
we could bid higher if it was average flows or we had tw firm transport
don
i remember him as being a passive guy
he is very conservative
level headed
and fairly organized
i would test his ability to handle new businesses and stress
by the way
he worked at coastal when i was there
mike
texaco has short paid us by 0.0 million for socal cuts
i believe that they claimed a penalty on the net out for the amount
we do not agree with this short pay and stand by the description of the socal product in which it states that there will be cuts due to operational constraints on the upstream pipelines
i would like to return the short pay favor to texaco
please let me know how we should proceed
mike grigsby
we have decided not to pursue jim
do i need to contact hr
please let me know
mike
please notify hr that we will not be pursuing jim
have them call his executive search rep as well
thanks
mike

thanks
mike
we are looking at this
thanks
mike
your west desk cut us on the revised flex volumes of 0
none of it flowed
i am confident they will have an excuse
but they have to know what their market is before final noms
we need to do something to protect our reputation in the west
the west is difficult enough to schedule when you are selecting your counterparties
but with eol
we have become the physical
cut clearinghouse
in the west
any internal nom errors just make it more difficult to transact reliably on eol
thanks
mike grigsby
thank you
we are including this language in our nightly bidweek summary to iferc
i am having trouble dialing your number

jeff said that he spoke to you
i requested that they restate p&l for yesterday
one issue is that i set the gd index curves and phys index curves as usual
but anne failed to pull in index
she pulled in only price and basis
she will fix this going forward
reitmeyer's p&l was an issue with logistics
his transport tickets were not put in until 0:0 yesterday
too late to capture
we will talk to superty about this
his p&l will be
0,0
a 0.0 million increase
frank ermis is still looking into his issues
i will call you after cash trading
mike

mike

no need to republish this sheet this morning
thanks
mike
sounds good
will you give us a speech when we go over
topic how
where do we stand with texaco
this attachment details cuts by texaco at pg&e topock
we would like to use this as a potential offset to their penalties in the event they do not waive their 0.0 million charge
mike
the p&l was stated incorrectly again
the new numbers just went out
we were down 0.0 million on the day
most of that coming from the transport book that falls next to phillip's name
we clearly have issues with our book runners
gossett is trying to fix it
but the surprises keep coming
let's set up a time to discuss the desk
mike
thank you
let's get together tomorrow to discuss the west

was elizabeth shim on the list
i can't remember
mike
please place her at 0 or below
she is under a performance review plan and has been removed from trading track
zack mccarroll started with the west desk two weeks ago
do we need to add him to the list
thanks
mike
he came over from broadband
we think this guy is great
we would like to rank him high enough to keep
try 0 and higher
thanks
mike
the video says www.bloomberg.com
we get the video source through an application called ip tv viewer
i am not sure how enron provides this service to us
no classes available
mike
has phil found the supply for mexicana
in light of the current circumstances with the company and the concerns that our counterparties have at this time
i would like to leave the upstream business in denver
moving this business would lead to confusion with our customers and to our denver based employees
let me know if you have any issues with this
if you would like to go up there for coordination and training
then feel free to travel to denver
thanks
please make five copies of this report for the meeting
thanks
patti sullivan informed me that the logistics group performed a prc last week and ranked elizabeth shim to be fired from enron
i do not believe elizabeth shim is there employee to rank for termination
until last week
elizabeth shim was in the trading track program on loan to bob hall and logistics
if they were trying to meet quota by terminating elizabeth
then i think they need to look elsewhere
the trading group should be making the decision on whether or not we fire trading track employees
we just put elizabeth on a performance plan and ranked her in the associate/analyst prc on monday
let me know
mike grigsby
go in and view the open positions
we will discuss getting quotes in a few minutes
steve south will be coordinating our efforts to screen print ice every 0 minutes

i am not sure how to approach this
i appreciate your comments
but the ultimate decision will be made over the next few weeks
if you would like to resign
then let me know
mike

we prepared resolutions regarding the opening of brokerage agreements
the ones dated 0/0/0
which authorized cassandra to be a second signatory
however
the problem arose when we tried to get kate cole in the corporate secretary's office to certify a certificate of incumbency for cassandra
cassandra has never officially been elected to the office of vice president of risk assessment and control
a division of enron corp
so as far as the corporate records are concerned
she is not officially a vice president
this will be resolved at the enron corp
board meeting in august and her appointment will be retroactive to november 0
0
until such time as this has occurred
she cannot be a second signature on our brokerage documents

i'll take a look at it and run it by one of the other lawyers

i have been asked by our corporate paralegal to assist him in cleaning up the ena corporate database as those individuals who have been appointed agent and attorney-in-fact to sign confirmations in connection with financial transactions
mary cook has a copy of an e-mail in the file to brenda herod setting forth the procedures and telling her that you verify the requests and notify legal of any changes
in this e-mail
apparently brenda asked that mike moscoso's and kristen hanson's appointments be revoked and that lisa mcclendon be added
will you let me know of any changes that should be made at this time
thanks
marie
i already did
thanks
yes
i have to get money
no problem
i'll get them to you shortly
kim
we are in the process of cleaning this mess up
sally beck and rogers herndon are both given power of attorney to sign confirmations and they are both officers of ena
so they can already sign documents
go figure
if it's not too much trouble for you to verify those who should be removed then i can double check against my list
i don't want to remove someone who should be left
nor do i want to leave someone on who should be removed

okay
i don't blame you
obviously she's not dependable and her heart isn't in it
not to mention the fact that she doesn't know what she's doing and i don't think she wants to learn
that was pretty obvious when i was training her--she never seemed to be interested in the job
otherwise she would have tried to learn all she could and would have at least taken some pride in her work

sara shackleton just left for vacation until after labor day
but asked me to respond to your e-mail regarding sending us your completed isda schedule
our credit department has said that enron corp
will provide a parent guaranty for ect investments
inc
however
they would like for csfb to also provide a guaranty since csfb
europe
is not a rated entity
or provide independent financial statements for csfb
europe
our credit department did not provide us with a cap for the enron corp
guaranty
you can send your isda schedule to my attention and we will proceed with reviewing same
thank you

hopefully
better
mark gave me my review thursday and i kept a copy of it to show you
kristina managed to get her digs in
but
fortunately
mark saw right through them
our contractor is going to start work on our house the week of labor day
so we are having to pack as much as we can to move upstairs
we thought it would be perfect if we could find fabric to recover our furniture so that maybe we could send it out while the construction is going on
if your offer's still good
we would like your assistance in looking for fabric
we were hoping to take a day off to look for fabric but didn't know how that would fit into your plans
would you let me know
also
we need to schedule a lunch with erica and jane
what is best for you
talk to you later
mare
don't worry
that's why we're here--to keep you on your toes

please process it for signature
thanks for your help and if you have any questions or need anything else

what's the big deal in csfb not sending us their form of schedule until we send the form of enron corp
guaranty and said that ect investments will collateralize its trades
marie
tanya
you'll love this
alcoa has sent us an amendment to the isda
that was signed 0/0
and wants to amend the
threshold amount
in part 0 so that it corresponds to the current credit rating of the applicable party as indicated in paragraph 0
i think we are mixing apples and oranges
obviously they didn't understand the difference when they signed the isda in
0
and it's the same lawyer sending the amendment who negotiated the master
marie
mr
giordano
attached are the final blacklined drafts of the isda master agreements for catequil overseas partners ltd
and catequil partners l.p
which incorporate your comments sent to us on 0/0
with respect to
valuation and timing
we just inadvertently left that comment in
but have now deleted it
please let us know if the final comments are acceptable to you and
if so
we will finalize copies for execution
thanks
oops
sorry
thanks
veronica
brent hendry is going to call you about todd perkins
e-mail
we don't want to enter into an isda with an agency arrangement as it poses problems as far as netting and other matters
brent will call todd and tell him that we will either enter into 0 separate masters or one master with southern and then they can internally back to back trades
so
i would not do anything until brent speaks with you and todd
marie
oops
sorry
here they are
marie
great
hopefully
we will be able to sign them up soon
thanks
marie
we can look at your documents

let me know if you have any questions or need anything else

i spoke with roeline hudson at torch just a few minutes ago
she is having a medical procedure today and probably won't be back in the office until monday
she answered my question
so i will finalize drafts of the assignments and give them to one of the lawyers for review
the lawyer may want verification from torch as to the appropriate entity that is the counterparty to the transactions being assigned
specifically the dynegy trades
which evidence of authority roeline will have to send when she returns to the office on monday
roeline stated that she has not received the additional documentation from uom so she is not aware of any urgency in finalizing these assignments until all documentation has been delivered to us to finalize documents
we will want to see the additional documentation from uom before we send the drafts out for review
please let me know if you have any questions
marie
i had a sneaking suspicion that it just might be you

you can only see the master agreement database
the brokerage agreement database is separate and cannot be viewed by anyone outside legal
the bear stearns agreement you see listed is there in error
it should be in the brokerage agreement database
we do have listings for morgan and goldman
sara wasn't aware that you couldn't see this database when you spoke
marie
you should have received a fax from me by now
have you not received it
yes
hi

it is our understanding that in connection with the opening of the referenced account
bear stearns has agreed to allow ect europe to sign the same form of institutional account agreement that enron credit inc
signed in april
0
please forward execution copies of such agreement to us and we will obtain execution on behalf of ect europe
additionally
we are in the process of adopting resolutions on behalf of ect europe allowing for the opening of brokerage accounts
will bear stearns be able to open the ect europe account prior to receiving the corporate documentation
we have been advised by mary kay lemont that bear stearns will not open this new account until they have all corporate documentation in place
ect europe finance
inc
does not have resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts
so we are currently preparing corporate resolutions to circulate for signature
will the authorized traders in this account be those authorized to trade on enron credit's behalf
if so
will you provide me with a current list
additionally
is this the only position that will be in this account
thanks

let me know what you hear from them
let's try to get together after the 0st
i know it's going to be too busy this week and next

hi
mari
i have prepared the separate phone list for each bidder room and am going to place five copies of each on the tables by the boxes in each room
let either genia fitzgerald

or me
x0
know if you need anything
we will have our assistants bring coffee
etc
so if you will let us know when the groups arrive at the data room
we will take care of that
thanks
marie
i don't think we'll have anything for you today
i know you'll be so upset that you aren't needed today
thanks for asking
marie
thanks
happy new year to you too
yes
this deal should go to aep with the hpl transaction
the reason there are no forward volumes booked is because they have a monthly election to nominate baseload gas daily priced gas or wait and nominate daily volumes priced at gas daily
at any rate there is no way to know in forward months what they are going to take subject to contractual maximums
if you have any further questions let me know
thanks
tom
i received notice today that elsa villareal
gary lamphier and ed gottlob have accepted jobs with aep as part of the sale of hpl
not to leave until closing
this means that my staffing needs after closing are as follows
0 lead physical trader 0 physical trader 0 basis trader
or at least an asst
trader
0 supply middle marketer/originator i met with jeanie slone and the internal recruiters today to start the external search process for an experienced physical trader and industrial marketer
i am hoping the other positions can be filled internally with associates and/or internal commercial personnel
i delivered employment contracts to janet wallis
jim schwieger
stacy neuweiller
eric bass and daren farmer
they all wanted to review the documents and talk to me next week about it
janet did not give a good feeling that she would be willing to sign it
i know that she has been contacted by companies other than aep about job opportunities and i know other enron units have talked to her as well
although we met jim's numbers he is still hung up on the super vesting language for options
i'll keep working on him
the others i did not get any read on
but i will talk to them next week
given the severe shortage of talent that my desk is going to experience from the hpl transaction i want you to consider realocating experienced talent from other trading and middle marketing desks to the texas desk
i will follow up with you when i return from vacation on monday
march 0th
thanks
tom
jim and i will be on vacation from march 0th thru march 0th
jim took a lap top computer with him and is reachable by cell phone
kim has our pager and cell phone numbers
i will be calling in to see how eric is doing and to see if any of my folks have any questions about their employment contracts
i asked philip to keep an eye on eric as well
eric sat in the morning meeting today and will fill for me next week
thanks
tom
attached are the rates for april
i know the king ranch and agua dulce rates to hsc are a mute point with the work on the a/s line
needless to say we will be a seller either during bidweek and/or on a daily basis on a/s south
thanks
tom
fine
tom
if you recall there was a physical term supply transaction done at thompsonville with eex during the time you were trying to get the letter of intent with aep done
i thought that there were some unique financing issues that required enron to retain the transaction
it appears that is not the case and since this supply is at a split connect location with hpl it should probably go with the sale
i just want to make sure that the swap is done correctly to keep enron whole
any thoughts
tom
thanks for the info
i wanted to pick your brain about cars for mom and dad
my initial research of large cars and luxury cars in consumer report did not yield a lot of obvious choices to me
i only considered cr
recomended
cars
there are a few options in the $0,0 to $0,0 range for example the ford crown victoria/mecury grand marquis
but i do not believe the cars in this price range will give them the same luxury and comfort that they are used to
the only car in the $0,0 to $0,0 range is the buick park avenue which i think will be a pretty close fit to what they are driving now but i'm not sure they want to spend this kind of money
of course the really nice luxury cars that will sure to satisfy them for example
the lincoln town car and cadillac deville are in the $0,0 to $0,0 range
dad said he spent $0,0 for his olds 0 in 0 and would like to have something that rides as quite and comfortable as it but not spend big bucks
my plan at this time is to focus on the crown victoria/grand marquis and the park avenue first and see if they come close to meeting mom and dad's needs
any thoughts
love
tom
i am generally available in the afternoons after 0:0
have your assistant schedule some time either this week or next so we can talk about the wellhead book
thanks
tom
yes if they are for las vegas
there was a team building trip approved by john at the beginning of the year
are you planning to put together the monthly eol volume actuals versus performance targets as described in the 0 plan
thanks
tom
i have asked dave to set up a meeting with you and barbara on this subject
i thought there were exclusions relative to eol transactions and points that do not directly impact hpl
the problem for me is that if i want to do terms deals in these locations now i want to be able to keep them as ena and not transfer them with the hpl sale
let's talk as soon as possible so i can have clear understanding of the rules of engagement for ena now and after the close
thanks
tom
everything other than the ldc business has been done in the name of hpl even if not physically located on hpl
i want to start intiating transactions that are not physically on hpl in the name of ena so they would not have to transfer as part of the sale
ie
waha
katy tailgate and carthaqe hub
i understand dave baumbach has arranged a meeting with you and jeff hodge to discuss
thanks
tom
pagers
cell phones
etc should be cancelled as of closing which i believe to be june 0st
i will let you know if there are any changes
when i arrange for new traders i will need computers for them
i have talked to ed and brian and they have agreed to give me 0 computers back prior to closing
i anticipate needing 0 of them prior to the end of the month
how much lead time do you need to have them brought down here
did you get the message out about customer entertainment
thanks
tom
i am in ena gas trading
i believe i am getting e-mails for martin thomas
if that is who you are trying to communicate with please check your name selection
this is happening a lot
if know others that may be trying to communicate with martin thomas please pass the word

her recommendation is to look on the enron job seeker website to see if there are any specific jobs that may be of interest to you
call me if you after you look at the website and let me know if there are any opportunities that make sense for you
tom
sorry we have not talked again recently
i have been trying to get a better handle on other personnel movement on the gas floor that has an impact on my needs
i would like to talk further with you
maybe we can get together next week after work for a beer and talk about what your interests are and i can tell you more about my needs
i am open tuesday
thursday
let me know if you can get away
if not let's try to set up some time to talk in the afternoon
thanks
tom
lauri
here are the rates for may
again the a/d long haul rates are irrelevant for most of the month
call me if you have any questions
thanks
tom
since i anticipate that we will be trying to inject and katy is the only location that helps
i am trying to give us a little extra incentive to get gas in the ground
i don't anticipate buying much clear lake gas other than the short that we have there
0,0/d i think
tom
bryan
yes
i would like to talk to you
i think it will make sense to have an analyst in some capacity
i didn't realize that you would making this decision so soon
maybe we can talk after bidweek
early next week
if that timing does not work let me know
i am still not sure if or when lavorato is going to give me a trading track analyst/associate
but i still would like to talk to you before you make a decision
tom
jeanie
i have enclosed sherrie trigg's resume
she is interested in a recruiter position
job # 0
traci warner supervisor
she is also interested in a specialist/sr
specialist position in hr
job #0
laurie miller supervisor
her experience has been in marketing
human resources and recruiting
if you can do anything to help i sure would appreciate it
thanks
tom
i received a call back on the hpl on eol subject from ed and it appears that aep intends to replicate what we have done on eol via ice
tom
tommy
i agree
the traders need access only to the physcal trading systems
they are only trading next day physical gas for the remainder of may
so they do not need access to any other systems
thanks
tom
john
i will need 0 senior analyst and possibly could fill some of my cash trading needs with an additional associate
i have talked to bryan hull
third year analyst
about a one year rotation at our desk
he spent his first rotation in the texas risk group and did a great job
his second rotation has been in the eol marketing group
he is interested in trading and is a sharp guy
i would like to see some of the other folks coming in just to compare against him and to see if using an associate is a viable option for my cash trading needs
tom
yes
dave's reporting relationship and cost center has not changed
his is just physically moving down here since we have the space
tom
john
my suggestion is to have the offsite to be social in nature
i am sure that many of these people do not know each other and an environment where the group can mingle and enjoy some fun activities would be a great way to become more familiar with each other
if we must have meetings/presentations
have them done by outside speakers so the group does not have to prepare presentations
as far as where to go
austin
san antonio or galveston are nice and will be reasonable for a group this size
if you are ok with spending more the golfing
fishing and spa activities in florida
miami
key west
tampa/st
pete
are great
also golfing
rafting and spa's in colorado would be good too
i don't have a strong preference for where we go but i do believe that people would appreciate a focus on fun and getting to know each other
tom
jim
noon brunch would probably work better for me considering matthew's nap time and that monday is a school day
i will handling the kids solo since lyne will be at md anderson with elaine that day
so i hope everyone is patient with matthew as sometimes he can be a little rowdy at restaurants
he has been known to inflict fear in waiters
waitresses and owners alike
remeber those days
tom
works for me
tom
no she has not called
thanks
you always seem to know the right thing to do
thanks for covering for me
tom
please forward the information to eddie leschber and laynie east
i know the origination was classified as gas assets but their transaction count was included in our budget since all of their pricing is structured in our group
if those transactions are not included in our count then our middle marketing transaction targets for the 0st and 0nd quarters need to move to gas assets
ask eddie and laynie how they want to handle it
thanks
tom
sorry for the delay
there will will be four from my family
including matthew
we will be there
thanks
tom
maybe we should meet
i am not sure what dave has told you but my intent is for at least the near term that his responsiblities not change
my objective in moving him on the desk is to provide an opportunity for him to have a better perspective in what we do
i told him that as he has time i could utilize him for analysis or other projects but not at the expense of his current job
the bottom line is that dave is very good at his current role and he has expressed interest in trading
i viewed this move as an opportunity to evaluate his trading potential while he is given the opportunity to see what trading is really like
but i have no immediate plans to move dave into trading
if the time ever comes that i would like bring him into trading i will certainly coordinate the transition with you
i was under the impression that dave cleared all this with you before he moved
it appears that he may have made this physical move more meaningful than it is and certainly more than i intend at this time
how do you want to handle thistom
brian
don't worry about comprimising our trading position because i think aep via the hpl employees already have a general idea of what we have been doing with storage
plus they will need to know as of close anyway
tom
barbara gray has informed me that you have been inquiring about modifying the texas eol physical products to ena as the counterparty for june
the products you have to be concerned about are waha and exxon katy tailgate
the other physical products are hpl related and will no longer be used
there is a slight possibility that the agua dulce product may continue but i will contact you if it needs to be changed to ena
our need for these ena products will be approximately may 0th
when we want to roll out our june products
please call me if you have any questions
tom
i reviewed article 0 and the disclosure schedules to the purchase and sale agreement and see no changes necessary related to the areas of my responsibility
tom
fine with me
tom
i will probably have my needs met by august
my interest has been in analyst/associates coming off rotations that are available in june
i have been working with neil davies to get this done
i will let you know if i have further needs
thanks
tom
karen
any chance she can start sooner
can we leave her assigned to me until the end of june
i am not trying to turn away help because i definitely need it
i am struggling with her starting in august
tom
sorry
i don't think i said her name
it is mary martin
i left a message for her so i bet you will be getting her resume in a day or so
thanks
tom
thank you
i will tell her
tom
from my perspective the waha
exxon katy tailgate and the new carthage tailgate product should be converted to ena on the 0th if we find out that the close will occur june 0st
since the bidweek procedures we are proposing include aep directing hpl activities for june during bidweek if we determine that close will occur june 0st
then it seems only logical that we should start operating as ena at the same time
thanks
tom
an issue has come up that i did not consider in my prior discussions of how bidweek for june should be managed prior to knowing if we close or not
physical deals for june have started to happen already
if close does occur and all the deals prior to may 0th are done as hpl then ena will miss out on a lot of potential business for june
so i believe a fair solution is to have all deals in locations that are most relevant to hpl
ie
agua dulce
thompsonville
oasis katy
lonestar katy
texoma
be done as hpl
deals in a location such as katy tailgate that is relevant to hpl and ena will be split evenly hpl and ena and written up as two separate purchases
waha is not considered here since aep already has a waha trader who is active in the market
thanks
tom
you have sent an e-mail to thomas martin not martin thomas
fantastic
i am happy that it ultimately worked out
welcome aboard
tom
should jim schwieger be included as he has been in prior prc meetings
he knows all the gas traders and middle marketers and has been valuable to this process in the past
tom
seems like hpl/aep needs to get a transportation agreement on oasis
as part of the june transition ena will not be doing any bidweek business at points other than waha
katy tailgate and carthage
therefore even if we wanted to cover this deal
which we don't
we can't
let me know if there is a problem with them getting there own transportation agreement
tom
this is very hard to read with all of the cutting and pasting
i made one change to the definition of the 0,0/d of injection capacitiy
also i do not see anything that addresses how aep deals with their june volumes in bammel
assuming we never close
we talked about them having to withdraw their volumes rateably starting on september 0 and concluding october 0
transportation rates would need to negotiated
tom
has there been a date set for the next trading track interviews
tom
karen
chance rabon is an analyst in the texas risk group who is interested in interviewing for the trading track program
he joined the company in february 0 from coastal where he worked in their natural gas risk group
he seems to be sharp
aggressive and willing to work hard
can he still be considered or will he need to wait for the next round
tom
that should be fine
tom
if this truly cleans out the closet then it is worth it
the potential upside of the entex audit is more like $0
$0 million but our ability to recover that much is questionable given the weak contract language for resolving non-performance
in the past ena and entex resolved volume shortfalls under the term contract by extending the term
obviously we will not have that remedy
do not let aep separate other issues away from this and try to pick us to death
tom
todd
this a resume that i received directly
tom
what ages
are there organized activities for them as well
if not i think they will get bored after an hour or two
i have not generally done it because i did not have time to keep up with them for such a long period of time
maybe someone can bring them up before lunch for a while
tom
no thanks
tom
thanks for the invite
but i can't come during trading hours
this was a huge accomplishment and all those involved in getting this done should be cotom
elsa
i was just made aware yesterday that i am to provide my direct reports the following material
please make a cursory review and tell anne koehler by noon today if you have any matters that should be added to the schedule or corrections that should be made
i don't anticipate that you will have any issues but i am required to provide this to you
thanks
tom
i will not be able to attend
tom
i have executed this and returned to anne
tom
mike
please include my home e-mail address in your weekend weather updates
it is tmartin0@msn.com
any response yet from john regarding jim schwieger being part of the prc process
i think he should be included
please advise
tom
you got the wrong guy
thomas martin
you got the wrong guy
thomas martin
that is fine
tom
jeanie
can you send me jim's evaluation form so i can write his midyear review
john was out today so i did not get to ask about feedback on jim
tom
i don't think we are interested in hockey but texans may be of interest
send an e-mail to redmond for us to discuss
maybe we can share with another desk
tom
the only change i see needing to be made is you said letter
dated august 0
0
instead of
august 0
0
but we knew what you meant
everything else looked great
tom
fine with me as long as you have someone to cover
how is your lunch analysis going
tom
lucky you
tom
this is your internal competition
if you have any dirt on any of these people please let karen know
just kidding
tom
i know nothing
if he is coming into the office why don't you set up a schedule like you did for morris including myself and jim
tom
yes i will attend
tom
at this point i do not plan to attend
i have not had an opportunity to take lavo's pulse to see if this is a must attend
tom
maybe the next step is to dig into the allocation methodology that daniel uses to see if it assumes the correct number of people
then convert the monthly allocation amount to a cost per person and do the same for your other analysis so we can compare apples to apples
when you combine origination and trading we are likely to exceed 0 people
my guess is that we are being allocated costs based on too many people
pre hpl sale
tom
the 0th is ok for me other than it is nx0 for natural gas
starting at 0:0 makes it possible but 0:0 would be better or even the 0th at 0:0 would be better
i am assuming that a lot of thought has gone in to picking this day and other conflicts exist
the other gas traders are going to have the same issue with this time so if it is the only time that works for everybody then i'll be there at 0:0
tom
don
we have not heard of this guy
it looks like his most recent experience has been managing coastal's refinery gas supply activities
unfortunately the people who have the most history with industrial and refinery gas buyers went with the hpl sale
tom
laura
can you put me down for vacation november 0th
if schedules conflict with others on the desk i need to be out the afternoon for sure
allison's school function
tom
thank you
tom
fine with me
as i told you last night i am having dinner with our future enron gas and power traders in the
trading track
program at nino's at 0:0 pm
just to be safe
i probably won't be home until after the kids bedtime
tom
it looks like joe has an expense report i need to review
let's discuss tomorrow
also louise mentioned in the staff meeting that we are going to be more directly accountable and able to control our allocated costs such as it and logistics costs next year
please ask laynie to give a detail of our budgeted allocated costs such as it
logistics
etc for next so that we can review it
tom
any questions or further thoughts on what we talked about last week
tom
whatever you think
maybe eat at 0:0 to 0:0
i will grill if you want me to
tom
thanks for the update
allison
i hope you start feeling better soon
matthew
thank you for looking after your sister
daddy
if you don't know
you should know by now that you never have to apologize to me
tom
we did the following trades this morning
you buy my backoffice will put them in
tom
sorry
the last two trades were cal 0
i don't think i said what term they were in the last e-mail
tom
thanks tom
irma
i respect the fact that a mistake was made
my problem is that the mistake causes me to have to wait until november 0th to get it fixed
it seems that you could have called me if you had a question about the form since it was turned in at least six weeks ago
so what are my options other than waiting until november 0th
tom
if ina says she has coverage then fine by me
you also may want to get in the habit of checking with brian as a courtesy
have fun
tom
i am not familiar with this system but it seems philosophically we should protest even though we don't currently do any business on this pipeline
what do you guys think
tom
that is a sensitive question as i have asked you before about us giving up reuters and getting one bloomberg monitor
we have heard nothing since that lady came by took reuters away and said she would get us bloomberg
since bryan hull works as an analyst at my desk i would like to discuss the
no
feedback with him
please let me know when it is appropriate to do so
tom
probably thursday noon since some people are planning to be out friday
tom
do i need to do something more with eric
i talked to him the other day
trying to reassure him that lavo realizes the value that he brings to the organization and that he will be taken care of
tom
bass and parks
could you send me an updated list of the traders remaining vacation days for 0
i am hearing a lot of members of the desk wanting to get their vacation by the end of the year
i want to know what i am dealing with
try to include daren and dave as well
thanks
tom
thank you
looks like another year where everybody is going to try to get vacation in at the last minute
i am having daren
bryan
dave and charlie coordinate their vacation days for the rest of the year
i am having eric and joe do the same
clearly the calendar does not reflect what these guys will probably want to do by the end of the year
tom
please send to the rest of the texas desk
tom
i have 0 hours of vacation left and wanted your input as to how to use some of it
i will carry over 0 hours to next year
we are off christmas eve
i was thinking of taking 0/0 off since i have that doctor appointment
otherwise maybe 0 to 0 days the first two weeks of december will work
i may be able to take a half day or two at other times if there is something special you want me to do
tom
upon closer examination
more people looking dirty
tom
john
a dangerous environment is brewing on the trading floor
we have very large positions and people are becoming more frustrated with the work environment
uncertain about future employment and now with new information about lay's
golden parachute
i am concerned that not everyone may act in the best interest of the company
hero or zero attitude
or at a minimum may not be in the best frame of mind to trade
i hate to suggest it but do you need to reduce the people allowed to take risk for the company
similar to what was done when we sold hpl
the general feeling is that everyone at the top is taking care of themselves and the
little
people that have been making the money for the company are left out in the cold
i also suggest that you move quickly to ensure appropriate compensation for key traders into next year
i know the first move i suggested would have the effect of reducing morale further but this group has a lot of risk on for people that may not be 0% commited to enron
this may be too drastic action at this point but i think it should watched closely
i went over to talk to laura a little wihile ago and she was crying
what is wrong
is there something i can help with
tom
thanks
i asked her and i couldn't get anything out of her without her getting more emotional
so i decided to back off
tom
we talked a couple of weeks ago about getting together about the ytd stats for the texas gas traders
if you don't mind maybe you could e-mail them to me when you get a chance
tom
renee
when are we going to reschedule the meeting to discuss the methodology that you are using to fulfill our
early distribution
from the phantom stock deferal account
tom
did you find anything out with laura
tom
that is ok
i was concerned that it was something serious
sounds like little stuff
tom
i am sorry that you are having problems with shanna
i am proud that you are doing the right thing and welcoming a new person at school
it can be very dificult to be the new kid at a new school
it sounds like shanna feels threaten by you and others being friendly to this new girl
i know it is hard but some how you need to reassure shanna that you being nice to the new girl does not mean she
shanna
is less of your friend
maybe the best approach is to ask shanna how she would feel if she had to move to a new school and was treated badly by some of the new girls she met
you and shanna have been friends for a long time and you don't want to lose that
but she needs to know that you will continue to welcome new kids that come school and it does not impact your friendship with her
to answer your question
things are ok
there is still a lot of uncertainty with the dynegy and enron merger and it is not going to be fixed any time soon
all i can do is try to do the best job i can and let everything else work itself out
i am going to an nwal meeting tonight at 0:0 so i will see you probably about bed time
thanks for writing to me
love
dad
how come you didn't go to school
is it because of your lice
i am fine
don't forget that i here only half day tomorrow
tom
oops
i can't read you already said that
do i approve daren's expense report
if i do go ahead and approve it
tom
looks like another $0.0 billion write-off coming in the 0th quarter
tom
looks like $0.0 billion write-off coming from marlin and osprey in 0th quarter
tom
cindy
since the majority of the division wants klein high school
i'll live with it
becky miller had a good idea
how about if we see if we can also get their gym so we can have the teams set up in there
it is not as conveniently located to the pool as klein oak's gym is but at least it keeps the teams out of the sun for the day
what do you think
tom p.s
you either respond to this address
work
or the other address you have for me
i have received it
tom
it seems like we would have approximately the same cost for air at klein oak or klein
i guess the question is how much have the pool fees gone up from last year and does that make it too expensive to have air
who knows the prices
tom
i talked to ina and eric said he will come in
the time is apparently between 0:0 and 0:0
tom
irma
did you get a chance to discuss my esop rollover situation with your superiors
i received an e-mail stating that the new savings plan is available early and i would like to get this issue resolved as soon as possible
thanks
tom martin ext
0-0
i think last year anyway the bulkhead issue only affected relays as we started all individual events from the blocks and move the timers for 0 and 0 yard swims
no matter
i am over the
kein oak
deal and moving on to
klein
just suggesting we look into the possibility of using their gym for the teams
i will talk to becky about the rates and pass it on when we get
have a great weekend
tom
i would like our group to continue to get lunches at their desk if possible
if other trading desks are not doing this then just the eol trades
talk to ina and let me know
tom
mom called me today to ask if we would be available to join them sunday morning december 0th as dad is receiving an award at church from the
dominican family
she pointed out that day is the day that you and the girls are joining mom for the christmas function at jones hall
let's talk tonight
tom
i talked to brian and he and i agreed to the concept but we want it to more simple
ie
less expensive
we are thinking about just getting together and have some beers at cabo's while signing christmas cards
no catering
just a few drinks and maybe some appetizers off the menu
the traders probably don't have many if any customers that are not already covered by brian's group but check with eric
joe
charlie
daren and dave
tom
thanks for the info
call me today when you get some time i need you to look something up on the computer
tom
i left you a voicemail as well
i just wanted to drop you a line to tell you that it appears the esop rollover into savings plan ocurred as we discussed last week
i got into the savings plan on friday 0/0 and moved the enron shares to stable assets also as we discussed
it appears that the price used was monday's close of $0.0 instead of friday's close of $0.0
so where do we go from here
i am assuming per our previous meeting that whether $0.0 or $0.0 is used
that one of these prices will be used to keep me whole versus a price sometime in september
probably september 0th
when the esop shares should have been put into the savings plan
please call me at you earliest convenience to resolve this
thanks
tom
i am sorry i forgot to update you
right now i am planning to be out the 0th
0th
0th and 0th
the 0th is for sure the rest is tenative
my plan is to take 0 to 0 days sometime the first two weeks of december
tom
i was not aware that the market closed at 0:0 on friday 0/0
funny we did not discuss this when we talked on the phone on wednesday
how does this impact the bigger issue that needs to be resolved
let me know when you get the answer on the rest of the matter
thank you for getting back to me so quickly
tom
you are mistaken
i have never logged into
ipayit
before
so it impossible that i have an unpaid invoice
tom
kelley
given our financial situation we did not do any fixed price physical transactions for december so we have no trades to report this month
hopefully our situation we be resolved soon so that we can be a part of the process in the near future
for whatever it is worth
it that there are some unusual things happening in the
fixed float
markets in texas particularily at hsc
the nymex is down 0 cents today yet the hsc fixed float market went from plus 0 cents or $0.0 to $0.0 yesterday to now $0.0 with the henry hub also appearing to be inflated by maintaining a fixed float value of $0.0 again in a falling market
we feel like we are defenseless because we have no trades to report and yet have basis and gas daily positions and some trade players know it so they are inflating the prices to hurt us more financially
i have no evidence since i was not a participant in the fixed price physical market this month all i am asking is that you be extra vigilant in determining the validity of the transactions that are being submitted for index consideration
thank you
tom martin
brent
per our phone conversation enron agrees to buy back 0,0/d at carthage for december at ifgmr hsc index
0
i have also talked to eprime who is our supplier and they are buying back this 0,0/d from enron at ifgmr hsc
0
they will subsequently sell the gas to woodward directly at ifgmr hsc
0
both eprime and woodward agree that hsc
0 is a fair market value for carthage volumes during bidweek for december
the purpose of this transaction is to mitigate the risk of physical non-performance by enron given our current financial condition without impacting the contractual pricing of the deals previously done with eprime and woodward respectively
regards
tom martin
we addressed this yesterday
i have never signed to ipayit before so it is impossible for me to have an unpaid invoice
tom
irma
i know you guys are vey busy right now on other matters but i am sure that you can appreciate my nerveousness about what you guys are going to me for me
i still expect enron to do the right thing a correct the error that was made prior to closing the savings plan for the change in administrator
please update me on your progress
thank you
tom
you guys keep sending me this message and i keep telling you that i have never used this system
please call me and tell what you issue is at ext
0 because i have never logged into this system before
tom
attached please find my enron work history
can you make it look similar to the others that are being done and combine it with the resume from hr
thanks
tom
save 0 spots for the texas desk if possible
thanks
tom
laura
i can be reached at home
pager and cell phone in that order
also whatever happened to the pager invoice issue
did it get paid or do i need to convert to personal account to keep it
tom
ed
sorry
i have been out for a few days
we have been marking the curves appropriately every day
eric bass and dave baumbach have continued to get broker quotes twice daily for the duration of the book and to mark the curves correctly
if you have any specific problems in texas let me know
tom
jeff
let's talk because i think it may make more sense to flip the other way
i was hoping to continue using dave in the morning in the cash trading activities
so maybe he can run the texas risk group while trading phyical similar to what daren is doing on the logistics side
tom
jim
i could not open the attachment
can you resend it
tom
the following is the spreadsheet for the texas desk
i understand the control concern but it sure would allow us to be more efficient since texas is small and clean
probably not a full time manager job
he has not and will not be taking risk positions
at least not initially
he has been and will be trading our daily waha phyical volumes
if he evolved to a point where we wanted him to take risk positions we then could move him out of risk
what do you think
if you don't think this will work let me know
but in that scenario i guess i would say don't count on dave
i guess i will have to move him into the associate program or logistics
i we go down that road then i feel like i need to run this by dave since he effectively will be cutting his ties to risk and taking some career risk
i am sure if it does not work out you or some other company would welcome dave in a risk role
let me know what you think or just call me and we can get together
tom
john and louise
i am planning to be on vacation from thursday noon 0/0 and returning monday 0/0
i will be in houston the whole time and available to come in if needed to help out on due dilegence or other matters
i can be reached at home 0-0-0
cell
0-0-0 or pager 0-0-0
i have made arrangements for the curves to be updated daily
if you have any questions don't hesitate to call
happy holidays
tom
thanks for thinking of me
not feeling too much like a hero
but still kicking
happy holidays to you and your family
tom
i haven't worked on tbg in four years
so i am probably not who you want on this matter
i would suggest starting with frank vickers or scott neal
tom
hope you had a great holiday season
just checking to see if there is any new info on my esop rollover error situation
let me know if you heard anything
tom
i thought more about our phone conversation last night
based on what you said and assuming this document is ok
count me in
sorry my reaction was not as positive as you hoped but your comment about not being able to discuss who is on the team with anyone caught me off guard
i don't believe i have any issues with financial terms that you said
again i want to see what it looks in writing
i still don't fully understand your reasons for handling this the way that you are but at the end of the day you are correct when you say that even if 0% of the commercial people is all that we end up
this shop will still be better than any other on the street
i guess get me this document to look at when ever you can
thanks
tom
david
i made a few adjustments to your expense estimates based on a more detail look at actuals in 0 and my previous 0 budget
the total impact is to increase the budget by $0,0
i also was not sure what your rent
technology and transportation amounts were supposed to represent
based on our previous discussions i thought that rent and technology are covered elsewhere
but i used your numbers anyway
i am interested in what that is supposed to be since it is not very much and those are potentially very large dollar categories if everything gets rolled in
call me if you have any questions
tom
details
forgot to send attachment
tom
don
i received this from lockheed martin
we did not have anything with them
i am guessing this is yours
if not i will call the guy and find out what he is talking about
tom
i have given this to o'neal
tom
new and improved budget to replace what i sent you yesterday
i did not know if you heard that enron has agreed to settle the dispute over nng and will fullfill the earlier agreement to deliver the pipeline to dynegy
enron has the right to buy it back by june 0th
enron will still proceed with the 0 billion wrongfull termination of merger suit and include nng in that suit
bottom line for now nng employees will become dynegy employees until this other suit is resolved and/or unless enron excercises its right to buy it back
i wonder if this will impact eric and wendy
tom p.s
are you out of bed yet
ya bum
jeff
i could be in a tough situation at the desk with personnel
right now daren farmer is evaluating an opportunity with aep
if he stays and if we get pressure for another round of cuts
i may be in a situation that i have to do something with dave
if daren leaves then dave is really the only one remaining with waha experience
that is why i decided to move him to the desk
bottom line to me is that based on discussions with you in the past and my experience
dave is definitely a keeper for risk and has gained some physical experience in the last six months that will help me out particularly if daren leaves
needless to say there are a lot of variables to manage here but i thought you should be aware it
particularly if i end up in a situation where i have to make more cuts
i am sure you are in a similar situation with some of your folks so you can probably relate to what i am going through
i will catch up with you as this unfolds but if possible don't completely put dave out of your plans at this point
i have explained this situation to him and i think he understands given he is new to trading
any thoughts
tom
i have it in my briefcase
i just forgot to get it out
another slow day so far
i checked on the internet today about fanniemae and ginniemae per lisa's comments the other day
i learned that ginniemae is a government owned company that buys and sells mortgages for hud and fha loans
they are basically the financing vehicle for these low income housing loans
fanniemae basically does the same thing but is a non-government owned company
used to be government owned in 0
both entities have had a history of financing the rebuilding of rundown urban areas in cities accross the country
so lisa's friend/relative used these entities in the correct way but who knows if there is any truth to their future involvement in our area
based on some of the stories i read they tend to focus on really bad areas
my guess is that on an individual house perspective these two entities provide a mechanism to resale low income housing mortages in the secondary market
so to the extent there are hud or fha loans in our neighborhood they are probably involved in the ultimate financing of these loans but that is it
i had no idea what these two entities did
kind of interesting
tom
sounds like a pretty good deal
i am always in favor of
free
tom
i looked over daren's shoulder while he highlighted what needed to be deleted
disregard my phone call
tom
as a follow up to the texas business plan submitted on january 0th
please find more detail on our desired product rollout schedule during phase 0 and 0
if you have any questions call me at ext
0
tom
sorry
i thought you already had that info
phase 0 is the day we turn on eol
january 0st
phase 0 is february
this timing should be consistent with the other gas regions
basically financial products first and physical products second
if there is any changes between products in phase 0 and phase 0
how much lead time do you need
tom
louise
i asked tammie to call the presenters to make sure of their availability
i also talked to mari and she is trying to find a bigger room given the size of this group
she indicated that approximately half the group will review documents and the other half will participate in the presentations
tom
thanks
they are the same products
tom
try to go to this if you can
tom
daren notified me today that he has accepted a job with aep
he is willing to stay for a week or so to help in our transition
i wanted to know what your thoughts were about moving chris germany from the estate to the manager of logistics/transportation role for the texas desk
if you agree i would like to have him spend time with daren while he is still here
let me know your thoughts
tom
just a heads up
i lost daren farmer as my logistics manager/transportation person on thursday
i have asked chris if he would be interested
he said he would give me an answer on monday
tom
i talked to chris about the texas opportunity and he seemed interested
he still wanted to talk to scott neal about a potential cash trading role on the east desk
in the same breath he said that he welcomed an opportunity that had some commercial aspects but did not require running a book
which the east desk job would probably require
i believe he is hesitant to leave the east environment because he is so familiar with it
he said he will let me know on monday morning
tom
i just read an article on the blomberg news service that says that there are now six bidders and it is expected to go on into the night
each bidder is in a separate conference rooms and the lawyers are going from room to room to get the latest bid and provide updates as to what the best bid amount and structure is
sounds wild
tom
i am losing my logistics manager/transportation person
daren farmer to aep
i have talked to chris germany about this opportunity and he would like to do this job
does this create any problems for you
given the current uncertainty about netco headcount and considering any transition issues you may have with chris leaving
i thought we should leave things the way they are for now but develop a transfer date to be in a week or two
if you are ok with this move
i would like chris to spend part of his time next week downloading from daren as i have him through next friday
on another matter
i believe daren has e-mailed you about an agency agreement that we have with cleburne plant that needs to be transitioned to the estate
he knows the details as does rick hill
i believe he is in your group
we should probably get someone else in your group plugged into this deal
kathy kelly
to handle to the administration of this deal
we should try to identify someone quickly so that he/she can download from daren next week
tom
i am still alive and kicking for now
we will know more in the next few days
tom
bob
i talked to chris about the change of plans
i am sorry that it did not work out but dave has more knowledge of the texas grid and he runs our waha physical trading activities
he works well with mike and he is willing to do whatever we need him to do
he is spending the rest of the week to suck as much out of daren as he can
if there is any training for the logistics systems that he can go to
he should do that as well
if you have any other recomendations to get him up to speed on the logistics side i sure would appreciate it
tom
thanks for your help
tom
rob
lavo has given me the idea that brian redmond may not be part of netco and it is possible that the texas gas origination business may go away completely
i would like to talk to you before you make a final decision
i do not see it as a big money generator but similar to the east and central it is a source of information for the trading business
it is even more imperative to have a couple of people talking to producers and customers in texas because pipeline flow data is not accessible as it is in the interstate market
my opinion is if you had one person covering the producers and one covering the customers that would give us adequate coverage for information and make a little orig in the process
give me a call to discuss at 0-0-0
regards
tom
john
you or greg need to address the various groups with whatever generic information you can as to where we are in the process
expected timeline
hurdles before start up again
starting var and general organizational structure
people are moving from frustration to feeling insulted that they are expected to sit still with no information
i know you have a lot on your plate but if we really want people to hang in there a little longer before we address each individual's situation they need some sense of when they can expect closure
tom
thanks
i got jim's and eric's right after lunch
jim was definitely not impressed but he said we would talk tomorrow
eric seemed disappointed but i think if we can bump his retention from $0,0 to $0,0 per six months
i think i can get him over the hump
he is great value if we can get him for that
tom
stephanie
jim schwieger and daren farmer have left the company
i also changes some of the stack manager and web access settings for some of the other guys
call me if you have any questions
dave
i generally am pretty flexible regarding vacation as long as there is coverage
i am not sure that after we become ubs if vacation carryover will happen
my guess is that you will receive vacation based only on your years of service with enron
do you know the answer to that queston
if not i will find out for you
given the size of our group now
it will be hard for you and mike to take four weeks of vacation after we start up again
i would encourage you guys to take some now before things get busy
let's talk
tom
when i tried to open it up
my system said that the attachment contained a virus
tom
it said
may
contain a virus
sorry
i looked at it and it looks fine
tom
based on my review it looks like our benefit costs for comparable coverages to what we had with enron is about $0 higher per month with ubs
see attachment
tom
good article on the state of corporate america that caused an
enron-like
situation
no thank you
tom
ok
i will try to take a look at it this afternoon or tonight
tom
jeanie
i know i am probably becoming a pain in the butt about this esop clerical error issue but i would like to get this wrapped up before we go to ubs
i do not believe that i will get any attention after i am no longer an enron employee
should i contact robert jones directly
tom
thank you i will call her
tom
robert
jeanie slone has been in contact with you on my behalf about a clerical error that occurred when i tried to roll my remaining esop shares into the 0 k plan back in the august to september time frame
she indicated that there may be reason to believe that i will be reimbursed for this error but you were waiting for further information on the matter
given that i will be going with the sale of the trading business to ubs in early to mid february
i wanted to get this situation cleaned up by then if at all possible
what steps do we need to go through to get closure on this matter
is there anything i can do to help
ie
explain in person what happened
any explanation that you can give as to how and when this error gets fixed will be greatly appreciated
thanks
tom
i know you are very busy with ubs stuff
so i e-mailed him just to see if there is anything i can do to help
thanks
tom
any thoughts
tom
how did daren leave this with you guys
let's talk
tom
we can try
the guy who managed this deal for the desk left the company but i thought he handed it off to rick hill in the estate
i will talk to the rest of the guys on the desk and find out what we have on it and call you
my basic understanding of this deal is that we provided services only and are agent for the plant
i believe rick hill is the commercial contact on the deal so he should be able to provide more insight to the whole deal
i will get back to you
tom
you guys have the list right
can you send it to mike
tom
i think gary bryan already sent you a list that had this info
let me know if you did not get it
tom
thanks for the update
tom
thanks
eric sent her all of the trader's login ids after the meeting last week
tom
i'll be there
tom
i am telling the guys to use their own discretion about coming in tomorrow
my guess is that most of them will not come in
tom
laura
did you get the time for my interview of the meteorologist tomorrow
also i plan to attend the gas fundamentals presentation tomorrow afternoon from 0-0 if you can send me a reminder
tom
starting on the 0th please include any trades with epmi in your templates and your upload to the ftp server
these should correspond exactly to your excel spreadsheet
these should be reflected on the templates using the same logic as if you were trading with the apx
call me with any questions
thanks
this is me in 0 years see attached
i'm glad you had a good time
no mention of pappasito's though
kemah is always fun

i need more info
what zone
is it strictly an sc trade
what is the shape
will it change daily
who is the sc
what is the proposed schedule
who is the counterparty in enpower
i would like the info tuesday morning if possible
i will be out for the week starting tuesday at 0:0 a.m
if this is not possible
jeremy will need the info sometime later on tuesday
let's talk tuesday morning
i entered all the mega deals in caps
we have them for at least another month
i also updated the excel sheet for mega and created a june folder
june 0 file is also set up in that folder
i have not pulled the june data into that file
i have not checked out with anyone for june
they will be ready to
check out on tuesday
make a point to call crc and get any sc trades they have
callaway is a new deal we have
the info i have is that it will be a sale for 0mw flat every day for 0years
this is an ees deal
and will need to be entered on the ees sheet and entered on caps
i think apx0 will be the sc
foster and richter know about this deal
just make sure it is accounted for as an ees deal
it will not appear in enpower
there is a wind deal that elliot did with edwards air force base
i don't have enough info on this yet
it starts june 0
shama lama ding dong
u mow mow
somehow the commucication on these deals got fubared
i've gone with the assumption that we bought 0mw np0 and
0 sp0 at 0 and $0 respectively for june
did this happen
if the idea was to flatten ees out
we should have sold to them
any insight would be appreciated
i thought you meant that the husker bball team made the big twelve proud
i'll take a disturbing the peace charge any day
just no slapping yo girlfriend kind a crap
how are things
diana
please provide me with enterprise manager so can utilize sql queries
thank you
lincoln police obviosly have a automatic link to the press
or the press is pinging the rap sheets daily
this is not news
don't tell me no aggies ever have fights with their girlfriends or punch out a guy over a girl
its only news because of local papers and police want it to be
call the college station police and ask if any football players have been involved in any
assaults
they'd probably tell you its not your business
this brown thing is funny because the new boyfriend kicked his ass
o and if you critisize my futba program again i'll pull your hair and scratch you belly and throw a basketball at you
dave
went ok
i gave susan a few issues that need to be worked on
0
imports/exports do not seem to be getting captured infsp
0
sc trades
some ponts other than california were being captured
some progress was made on generation
if entered in enpower correctly,they appear in fsp
the only problem is once we enter deals in enpower at detailed points
the enpower to caps report does not balance
we need enpower to caps to be reformulated to include all np sp and zp deals including those at detailed points like sdg0,pandol_0_unit
etc
the 0day test for day ahead is done as far as i'm concerned
susan was running template comparisons for the 0st thru the 0rd
which may need some work on our part
for july these are net positions
you are short
dennis
i'm attempting to understand how the uc-davis deal
if done
will impact us
how is this different than all of the other retail contracts that you service
one concern that i had was if they opted to go for direct access and still had provisions to change their load on short notice
real time
this would cause some big problems for our real time group
to my knowledge
we don't currently have any contracts like this
is this the reason uc-davis wasn't included in the original deal with the uc system
can you give me a call or an e-mail
the number below is correct
thanks
wow
this is bad news
if he had pounded his girlfriend instead
i would feel better about our chances of winning a national championship
bob
i gladly pledge $0 and will have my company match it
i admire your willingness to do this
what is this
this checks out on the volume
i'm very interested in going
keep me posted

where are the aggie headlines
this is no big deal
a 0 year old gets drunk,some asshole cops treat them like shit and they mouth off to the asshole cops
who being the only ones able to excercise the power trip
get the last word
same thing happened to me in lincoln and i was not a football player
i had no sanctions and my charges were dropped
he will miss the opener because he's a player
when will espn give equal time to all of the other teams who have drunk 0 year olds getting into trouble
how are you by the way
i really miss having you around
especially this time of year
out
fyi for your neighbor
yeah
the offense was very unhuskerlike
except for crouch
he had 0 yards passing which was fairly good
the line was not ready for such an aggressive d this early
i do think tcu has a great defense as evidenced by their #0 defense ranking last year
evidently they had some depth as well becasue they lost half of their starters to graduation/nfl
the bright spot was the defense giving up only 0 yards of total yards
their only score came on a broken play that went for 0yards
we were also lucky that casey printers pulled a muscle on that play
we played 0 true freshman alot on the d and they were very good
the d should be faster and more aggressive than last year
the domers think they have a chance now that we only scored 0 on tcu
i say tcu is better than people think
but i'm glad we didn't open with notredame
i got your pictures
your daughter is really cute
how will the aggies be
hey dave
of course i remember you
and you were right
saturday the 0th was my birthday
0
i feel especially old now that i am surrounded by 0year olds
i wish some old people like you were still around
how dou you like phoenix
and srp
and how is your family getting along
i have 0 kids now
the last one is 0 mos old
i am done
we have more and more people around here
i am the last of the
texans
the rest all went back to houston
brett hunsucker went to ercot in austin
i think he likes it
miller and forney and smith day are all working for enron on the ercot desk
i can't trade this place for houston
drop me a line dave
its been good to hear from you
if you can do all that
you can beat ksu
i think nu can beat everyone but ou
cu will be tough at boulder no matter what
its like ut playing the aggies
they get up for it
also isu will give us a game
if our d is attacking and we have a pass rush
we could be in the title game to play ou again
count me in
i'll give 0 and enron will match
i got it fed exed yeaterday
please sign me up for the loser pool
my pick for this week is chicago

dear don
i enjoyed your article
you are right
we are a little sensitive
that's a natural reaction when something you are so proud of is criticized
i must admit i almost e-mailed you after reading your pre-game article
what irritates my sensitivities is when it is pointed out that nu players have had trouble with the law
these episodes
misdeameanors or not are not something any husker fan is proud of
surely there are players in every program who have fights with their girlfriends
or who drink too much and don't have the sense to leave a party when asked
my problem is that whenever a nu player messes up
it is news
it's as if there is a lincoln journal star reporter with an office in the lincoln pd complete with scanners
just waiting for some
news
to break
i don't think isu or any other school has such a spotlight put on them
college kids everywhere do such things and pay for them quietly
i don't wish we knew about every infraction at every school
it would be nice if reporters could put things in perspective and stick to the event they are covering
this all started when we were the defending and still contending national champions who had the leading heisman candidate in the backfield
the lawrence phillips issue back then was news because of the heisman hype and because of the severity of his offense
he became the posterboy for abuse of females
and perhaps rightfully so
but enough already
leave us alone until
god forbid
we end up with another lawrence phillips
before i ramble on about this sensitive issue
let me thank you for your post game article which was fair and balanced
you are right
most nu fans are good
a few of us are not good fans or role models
nu fans continue to wish isu and iowa the best
most of us are happy to see the iowa teams do well
take care
scotty
i want to talk with you about the position you have open
please let me know when you may be available to talk
thanks
bob
what's up
thanks for the recent e-mails
did you happen to get together with lisa last weekend
i am heading to omaha the weekend of the 0th to see the folks and help them out with some things
i will most likely get together with orhan sometime that weekend
let me know if by chance you will be around
say hello to traci
be safe
hey
i am going to omaha the weekend of this game
it is one of those games every true husker fan must attend
let me know if ya'll may be interested or just drop me a line to let me know that you are still alive
i think the huskers can beat ou since our d has improved so much
i worry about the offense not showing up on every play
we will need a better pass rush to beat ou
how good are we this year
we'll find out at this game
ksu sucks
out
i don't know when i'll make it to houston next
it's been almost a year since i've been there and that was to interview with someone else
i like it up here but can't help but feel i may have to return to houston sometime
the family is fine
kids are 0,0 and almost 0
you can probably picture what our life is like
everyone is fine
if you come up here for a game let me know
also if your son needs anything don't hesitate to ask
i wish i sould sit in a sports bar with you and watch a game
not a lot of people to watch it with up here
haven't played golf in a long time
i like your enthusiam when it comes to the huskers
i hope you are right and they decide to bring the wood every game
i'm supposed to have some tickets through one of the brokers but haven't got them yet
i bet i get stiffed
i think $0 should get me in there otherwise but think i's rather watch it on tv for that much jack
i'll get back with you later
i'll be in omaha this weekend
i get there thursday night and go back monday afternoon
i'll be spending alot of time with the folks but we should get together
later
sign me up phil platter
hey
we are all fine
how is miller
did he survive the trip to lubbock
ha
he's right the aggies always get kicked in the cohones by the red raiders
must have been a good game
i am officially poor now thanks to enron's financial wizards
you have to be glad you left
drop me a line
take care
which is da best marinate fo fryin turkee
brysch is fine
i guess he bought a boat for fishing in the bay
he is still in broadband and i think is safe
with his skills he should be one of the guys to turn out the lights if that is to happen
enron sucks
the cfo and skilling took my retirement for themselves
i want to piss on them
hell yes
our mothers were best friends when we grew up in c.b
his mother loved us and that created some competitive spirit between us
i beat jeff in 0th grade in a run for student council at hoover
we were friends but didn't really like each other if that makes any sense
personally
i quit hanging out with him when he wanted to always take our shirts off and wrestle on his sisters bed
i thought he was a little weird
he did show up to mitch's visitation which meant alot to me
i would support siegrist
do not forward this to anyone
i'm still debating
i have been invited to jackson hole the week before by some power brokers in nyc
i don
t necessarily have to go to that but in light of recent developments at enron
i may have to look at some networking opportunities there
thanks
you are amazing
just heard some austin powers sound bites reverberate through the floor

i thought i'd drop you a line to inquire about the energy marketer position you have had open
i understand you had the position open internally and that if you did not find a qualified candidate you would consider outside candidates
i am currently awaiting an offer from ubs
the new owner of enron's wholesale trading assets
i want to reiterate my desire to return to omaha and to work for oppd
please let me know of the status of your search for an energy marketer
i can be reached on my cell at 0-0-0
thanks
please see attached
i look forward to workin with you kate
the 0st was on sparky and downloaded fine
thankks
here is what i started working on yesterday
it isn't very far along
when it comes to commitments involving website postings
scheduling or balancing
could i please ask that my group be copied on settlements and proposals
it is not my intent to meddle in your good efforts
just to make sure that i understand what is involved in complying
in the case of the transwestern setttlement offer
my only comment/concern is that i would hope we could coordinate our posting formats with the gisb rules
otherwise we will have conflicting requirements
have the expense of having different posting formats for our different pipes
transwestern will work in good faith to simplify the exising posting formats on its electronic bulletin board
consistent with the gisb formats for informational postings
is there an sla settlement/proposal that i can get a copy of
these both track with the last drafts that i saw and commented on
thanks looks good
i guess i just have a chip on my shoulder these days about being relegated to the world of details

could you please take a look at the format of the outage postings
maybe i'm going at this the wrong way
but when i try to pull up a specific outage posting
i always get a whole set of outage postings
for example when i try to pull up the chaim of postings related to the nng mops 0 outage
i can't just pull up the specific posting
i also get other outages
why can't each outage posting be its own document
here are my additional suggestions
letter looks good
just a few thoughts
in addition to the categories of feedback and promise to work on these areas
should we provide a list of specific things that we have done
should we attach the first round of faq that matches questions from the meeting
instead of referring to the ets directors
lets put lynn
steve and your phone numbers in the letter
i'm flexible on the departure time
ricki
jean has been terrific in handling half a dozen emergencies this summer and the move logistics
i would like to give her a gift from the gas logisitics team
should we send her flowers or do you have any other ideas
yes i will attend
i will bring a guest
would you be my guest
can i get on the list to get a copy of the socal billing issue complaint draft
meet you downstairs at 0:0
that way we'll hit the hov at

oops my mistake
i've lost track of my dates

its next week
this is the message i'm getting when i try to access the ferc website

your mom gave me your email address and said that she mentioned that i would be emailing you
this summer
my husband
kim erb
and i hosted a 0-year old girl named alina from an orphanage in taraz
she came to us as part of kidsave international's summer miracle program
she returned with her group back to the orphanage at the end of august
we miss her terribly
we have been working anxiously to complete our dossier and our ins approvals to be able to bring alina back to our family permanently
obviously world events have us very anxious about the adoption
we are just as resolved to bring alina home and i'd leave tomorrow if i had all the approvals
my hope was lifted by hearing that you were able to travel home to kazakstan last week
we are working with an adoption agency called across the world adoptions
their kazakstan agents are sergei pikalov and larisa reznikova
alina's orphanage in taraz is called ulan
this was the first time they ever participated in a summer program to send kids to the us
there isn't any way for me to call or mail alina now that she is back in the orphanage
i am so fortunate that i am able to correspond via email with sergei's wife
larissa
different larissa
who was here this summer as a host with the kids
larissa and sergei live in almaty
larissa is a medical student
she is rapidly improving her english through her visit and our continued correspondence
yesterday i was so touched that larissa sent me a photograph of alina
sergei was in taraz last week and saw dear alina
she is well
sorry for the long-winded background
i hope you won't mind corresponding with me and offering me some travel advice

a couple of thoughts on the socalgas complaint 0
perhaps you will want to emphasize this as being a computer system programming mistake
not a billing mistake
the point would be to distinquish that its not like someone sat down to bill socalgas
read the global settlement and agreed with socalgas
interpretation of how to bill this
the point would be to show that we made a mistake in putting the computer programming in-place to handle this
0
i don't think the gisb 0-mo limitation went into effect until 0/0
so arguably it doesn't address this issue
nevertheless
i agree with the mistake language
the gisb transcript excerpts that i clipped for dari
chris sebesta for the ies dispute would be germaine
i.e
gisb didn't intend to bar mistakes
0
there is a ferc case that you might want to also cite for the concept of the equity of correcting past mistakes
transco discovered an error in their fuel calculation that was many years old
ferc let them re-bill customers for something like $0 million dollars of undercharges
i think this is a 0 case
this order is even better
it says that courts have founds that any refussal to allow a correction must be proportionate with the mistake
thanks for the update
suzanne
next time you talk to liz gras would you pass along my phone number and email
i am anxious to correspond with her and see where she is in the process and her thoughts about travel plans
i know that the adoption agency wants to group the taraz families together for court dates/travel
one of the other houston families
swangos
has made progress on their dossier and turned in their ins approval
the other
the westbrooks
haven't yet applied for passports or begun their dossier
i want to be very supportive and accomodate all the families
after all the goal line is home for all these children
at the same time
i need to form realistic concepts of likely timeframes for our family
i think talking to liz will be helpful on this front
thanks for all your help
after you make the homestudy changes noted below you will resend to gwyn
then she'll send to me to send to ins
probably sometime next week
i'm planning to take a vacation day tomorrow
and the type a person that i am
i'm just afraid that i'll miss some important action that i should be taking
you can reach me on my cell at 0-0-0 if you need to reach me tomorrow
could you please send some insight into the gas pipeline operational flow i
per jan's recent commission meeting summary i just noticed the commission had added a discussion item on ofos
they didn't get to this at yesterday's meeting
but will take up on oct
0
help joe
what is this about
is there some possibility of the ferc curbing our ability to use ofos

hi cyndi
chad does not have soccer practice tonight so we are free to meet for dinner pretty much anytime
i know you are trying to tie up loose ends at the office and i could stand to work a little late tonight
how does 0 pm at cafe express sound
kim
can you pick up chad and meet me there
gaby says she may take chad to lucas later this afternoon
please pay gaby if you see her
as i have given her the day off tomorrow
hi
sorry i didn't get back to you yesterday
chad had soccer practice last night
i have something i must do tonight
i'm taking the day off tomorrow
would there be a good time to visit tomorrow
when is tom home from school
so he and chad could play
or
if you'd rather
i'd be happy to sit with kathleen or the kids anytime this weekend
two other items when you get a chance
are you still selling nutcraker tickets
i can't recall the date
are you still interested in me selling shopping cards at enron
i need to reserve dates/table space in lobby
hope all is well
talk to you soon
shelley
yes
i'm taking off tomorrow
wish you could too
i'm planning on taking chad to the zoo
fyi
i agree
elizabeth is making these changes
yes
let it rip
not that i can think of
i'm fine with the filing
here are my edits to the faq document
sorry but i don't understand the pool allocation response
my notes indicate that we also need to answer the questions
where storage allocation notices appear
why storage allocation notices come out at a later time
fixes already put in place in the follow-up letter we categorize the feedback
can't we go one step further and say that we have already addressed some items
make customers aware that they can call hottap helpdesk for calls
raise awareness of need to minimize mrongin meetings
haven't we taken a step to notify edi customers about system downtime
we have taken the step of immediately notifying customers of system outages
aren't we adding an injection/withdrawal indicators
can't we immediately change the confusing descriptors
storage analysis completed
vs
storage allocations completed
see my suggestion in faq
sure
let me first make a run at the business needs and then prior to the general notice email
i'll take care of charitable requests
good idea
here is my recollection of the sequence of events
the concept of an operationally available capacity report and what it contains are already in gisb standards
ferc then picked up on this concept
added design capacity
said that the report needs to be updated at each nomination cycle in orders 0-l and in order 0 transactional reporting
gisb has since adopted standardized data formats for the transactional reporting
recently published in gisb version 0.0 standards
while these standard formats have been adopted
and i believe that we are following these formats
they haven't yet been adopted by ferc
so other pipelines may or may not yet be following
i'll try to look at the ngpl posting over the weekend and compare to ours
also
i'm sending your email to theresa hess to confirm my recall of the standardization
mike
i have stan's staff meeting at 0
please store this info for me
please save these files to a diskette for me
make a copy
so i can store one at home
label the files customer e-mail contact info
gary
the biggest problem that i have experienced with emergency employee contact information during tropical storm allison
during recent system outages is that all our contact lists are stored in an intranet environment
when systems or the internet are down
we can't get to the contact info
i am now resorting to keeping a copy of customer contact info stored on a diskette
are there any plans to store a copy of this info on a non-enron isp that could be accessed from our home isp if the enron intranet or servers are down
pam
thanks for all your help on the move/relocation
i think you
donna scott
jean mcfarland have made the process of moving very efficient for all involved
on the longer range issue
however
i need to elevate my level of concern that the moves are having on customer service issues
since tropical storm allison
ets has experienced one computer system outage after another
including the virus problem the week before last
this morning our scheduling system is out and we are having internet problems
both of which are impacting customer nominations
during system outages it is imperative that gas logistics be able to mobilize and implement back-up plans to ensure customer transactions
this is best handled by having a central staging area
i realize these system reliablity problems have nothing to do with our moves or with the ultimate location of the gas logistics group
certainly i am pursuing these reliability concerns with steve hotte
but
in light of these issues
i would like to talk about the timing
end state of where gas logistics is to be located and how long it is going to take to make this happen
i know that your first priority of late has been to get us off 0
now that that has happened
i'd like to talk about the timing for which floor remodeling comes next
0
0
etc
and the ramifications for my group
sounds interesting
although i don't have capital dollars at this point for modifications to make cas accessible to customers
let me touch base with my team to talk about this concept
i'll get back with you

hope you are doing well
any update on when gwyn will sign and forward the homestudy
i was hoping that i might be in a position to forward to the ins later this week
i have all completed the rest of my dossier and am now focused on ins approval
shelley corman
please mark on my calendar
print out this file
please forward this letter
invoice to gulfsouth
i am sending an email copy to claire
thanks for you voice message
i have been traveling the last couple days and thought tim forwarded the memo
invoice on monday
in reality
he was on a trip with some gulf south folks
just returned to the office today
he sent the attached memo and invoice this morning
i was a bit off with my timing
as september accounting close is tomorrow
thanks again for your help in resolving this matter
i think we expected it
the alj said he need more time for his decision
on a positive note
it gives the parties more time to discuss settlement
yes thank you
the home study arrived yesterday in the mail and i'm shipping it off to the ins today
i just go back in town last night from a business trip and am anxious to liz today
liz
i'm not sure if we met either time at the austin airport this summer
my husband and i hosted 0-year old alina
part of the same taraz group as your child
we miss her terribly and are counting the days until we can bring her home
we're certainly not looking forward to travel at this time
and even less happy about leaving our 0-year old son home while we are out of country
but we are resolved to bring alina home
the sooner
the better
based on conversations with ginger and chris
it sounds like we may face the travel adventure at the same time
although i'm not sure when
we have completed our dossier
although i haven't sent the originals to ginger
completed our home study
sent into ins recently
and we've already done the ins fingerprinting
so i guess the next steps are ins approval
shipping stuff off to kazakstan
and getting our kazakstan visas
one of the hardest parts of the kidsave program is not being able to communicate with the kids when they return
she is in the ulan orphanage in taraz
alina speaks only kazak
no russian
so i'm not sure how i'd communicate with her long distance even if i had an address or phone number
fortunately i have received periodic emails from larissa
the escort that came to houston with the children this summer
her husband
sergei
has been to visit the children in taraz
she sent me a picture of alina
sorry to ramble so
i'm anxious to talk to you about your child
your travel plans
possibilities for hiring an escort

my radar goes up about the need to put firewalls in place within rac
looking forward to our discussion
i don't think that it is absolutely imperative to attend
however
we may be able to help joe define some of the customer benefits of electronic service
can one of the tobys attend

i are working on ideas on how we could revised current posting and customer point/path/segment look-up capabilities and are interested in learning whether our revised capacity procedures are any more specific than in the earlier draft we looked at
i was referring to the fact that bearpaw is an actual marketing affiliate of nng and is posted as such on the website
bearpaw has a transport contract on nng
i can't join you in walking this year
but you can put me down for a $0 contribution
i don't need a shirt though
i still have jdf shirts from years past
sorry but lynn already gave it away
i talked to ginger this morning
she received my dossier and is sending it for translation
she said she will be at chris ivins today reviewing dossiers
she also said that there is a possible change in document requirements that would require that certain documents be
apostilled
in austin
i asked ginger to send you the picture of oksana
she said that she thought she had already had
she said she left you a voice message
would try to call you again later
talk to you soon
please print and store for next week's calendar items

add additional interconnect points
add fuel and a system balance computation for the market
midcontinent and permian area
improve formatting and readability
dale will shortly forward a draft of the new report
please confirm that it meets with your expectations
we would plan to put this new format in place mid-week next week
please rsvp that i will attend

also
i want to make sure that we make the trip worth their while

meet us
i need to leave downtown by 0 pm for a meeting this evening and i want to make sure that we have entertainment reinforcements

thanks for securing the astros tickets for gas logistics
on monday afternoon i had everyone gather and we had popcorn and a drawing for yesterday's seats
the extra seats for today and this friday's opening aeros game
it turned out great
even though i followed this democratic process
the winners turned out to be exactly the people i wanted to reward
i also made sure to have a leader in each group to buy the snacks
yesterday brad took jodie floyd
jerry graves
and tracy minter,toby kuehl and lanny cramer
today dannis bellard
dale ratliff
terry kowalke and steve chambers are going to the game
it was a great morale builder
thanks
we'll try to do this again next week if we have extra tickets
astros cooperating of course
today
bill murphy of fpl and jude campbell of teco-pgs are coming to town to go to the game with mike bryant and i
i'm also going to have a dinner for them after the game
perhaps at irma's where hopefully jack and rachel will join us
i'll have ricki leave you a message if you are interested in stoping by
early this am i'll be out speaking at phil's ops conference
i'm going to call julie to get on your calendar to brief you on some key logistics issues and talk about issues related to our current seating arrangements
something like

caroline tells me that it is strictly a revenue review
no o&m
do you want to go over just revenue with my team or both revenue/o&m
no revenue is better
i've already been over our o&m with my directors
too much partying yesterday
so i didn't finish my homework
i'm still working on the slides and probably will be during the commission meeting
so i'll send them to you by 0:0 am of so
if you are available to edit them during a working lunch in my office let me know
it has been terrific to correspond with liz
satisfying to help her get info on oksana from my correspondence with larisa
my dossier is with ginger
hopefully being translated
i have not yet received my ins approval and i'm scared that i'll anger them if i start calling
thanks
i got your voice message
i'm good with getting together on tuesday
but i would also like any major formatting feedback in advance of the meeting if possible so that we can walk away from the meeting on tuesday with the final product
otherwise
i'm concerned that we'll never get out of the cycle of perpetual feedback
differences in preferences of formatting style
kent
i can get together on tues
at 0:0
i certainly want to make this report as useful as possible
but
in some regards i feel like i failed my group in not memorializing the notes from our omaha meeting on the specific changes that we agreed as a group to make to the report
i have kept dale in a state of fiddling with this report for two months now
for example
my notes from our meeting reflect the fact that we decided against trend information
i am certainly willing to change that decision if you guys collectively agree
have you considered whether we need different types of reports rather than try to accomplish all on this page
the purpose of the current page is for gas logistics to report on what is happening on the system
i.e
how the physical world is tracking to the paper world
we need to run through this exercise from a gas logistics side each day even if it isn't meaningful to marketing
i'm not adverse to the concept of studying shifts in gas flows from day-day or year-year
but perhaps this is a distinct analytical tool
hopefully we can work out these details on tues
then run with it
fyi
thanks for the invite
unfortunately
we have a customer meeting at south shore harbor that day
hope you are doing well
i haven't made it home to a football game yet this year
although i guess that has been a blessing
shelley corman
please add to my personal contact list
here is my two cents
from your message i understand that the tree trunk is entirely on our property and branches overhang the condominium fence
if so
then the tree belongs to ashford
the condominium probably has the legal right to trim branches up to the property line
but may not go on our property or destroy the tree
a landowner is generally not required to trim its tree unless it knows the tree to be dangerous or the tree is obstructing a public road
a landowner can't be negligent unless they have legal duty to do something
since the condominiums concern appears to be aestetics and not safety
there doesn't appear to be a
negligence
issue
further
a landowner isn't negligent for natural conditions such as a tree falling onto others property during a storm unless the landowner knew the tree was unstable prior to the storm
if the condominimum choose to sue the church for failure to maintain the tree
they would have to do so on a
nuisance
theory arguing that thetree interferes with the use and enjoyment of their property
still to prevail on a nuisance theory they would probably have to argue that the tree was dangerous
bottom line
we don't have a responsibility to trim the tree
but it seems sensible to let the condominium trim the tree so that issues don't ever arise later if a storm blew limbs down
do you know
hi ms
traylor
i gave my mom a heads up that

i am so pleased with how happy chad is with school
at first he expected to be coddled like kindergarten and complained that 0st grade was too hard
boy how things have changed in a month
yesterday he told me that he was so happy that school was hard
kindergarten was soooooo boring
i really appreciate the firm
yet compassionate manner you have with the kids
it is just what chad needs to develop
while i'm writing
i will also mention one thing to you in case it comes up at school
over the summer we hosted a 0-year old orphan girl
alina
from kazakhstan
she had to return to her orphanage while we complete paperwork to adopt her
the other day
chad was watching tv and saw a picture of some afghan children
he commented how much they look like alina and then burst out in tears
if the school works on a project for the afghan kids
chad may seem a little more emotional than usual
just wanted you to know
regards
shelley corman
chad's mom
the orphans petitions coordinator at the houston ins office called this morning to say that our paperwork appeared in order and that she has an appointment to review our case with her supervisor this afternoon
she said that we should receive the approval notification form within a week

drew
in your new organization is frazier the marketing affiliate attorney
or hartsoe
we need to continue to refine the procedure for posting updates
for example this week i found some overdue changes that needed to be made to the website
i think it sounds worthwhile
since linda breathitt and stacy girard are participating
if stan is unavailable
i think phil lowry or mike nelson would also be great choices
here is my mark-up
please make sure that it is factually correct
thanks
i agree since i am at the bank right now
now i'm back at my desk
i think we've finally found the right tool for you to stay constantly in touch with me
great
great
i will review them on monday no need to send to fl
are you going to apply
i am out of town on business
are you interested in dinner tomorrow night at cafe express
on sat chad has a 0 pm soccer game and at 0.0 birthday party
we can work around these plans if you prefer
i am out of town on business tonight
i saw you called but thought it is probably too late to reply
yes i would like to attend the conference and would love to get together while you are in town
i will give you a call tomorrow night when i get back to town
i didn't hear from ginger this week
i did talk to connie the travel broker and she said that she was just holding our visa stuff pending instructions from chris ivins

when i was approving latest expense report i noticed an item listed gulfstream project
lunch with keith higginbotham
i have been working on gulfstream oba
interconnect agreement with frazier/dot
sharon for several weeks
i didn't realize that you were working on gulfstream items too
what is your team working on on gulfstream
also can i get a copy of the revised contract quick reference manual
i think i had the outdated one prior to the latest printing
thanks shelley
i now have another meeting over the lunch hour
perhaps another day this week
i am feeling pretty blue today with all the enron stuff
finances being what they are
we need to do some serious soul searching on royal oaks
can we get our money back if we walk or are we stuck
please also calculate the value of your transocean options
i may want to monetize these to cover adoption/travel expenses
we had 0 kids and 0 adult helpers
the kids were pretty wild
it wasn't one of our better days
oh well
if it's okay with you
i'd like to take a week break next weekend
i need to be at an event downtown at 0 pm and it would be nice not to rush
i will bring you the boom box and cds with music suggestions
would that be okay
also
stan is not available the third weekend in november so i have agreed to switch with him
he will teach nov 0
i will be there to help
and i will take nov 0
kim promises that he will definitely be there
liz
i spoke with ginger today to tell her that my notarized ins approval is in the mail
she said she is really busy because chris is on vacation
she reiterated the point that you made that there is another group traveling to almaty before us
they are not traveling until nov
0
we will be after that
perhaps a week or 0 days later
this journey is certainly full of ups and downs
i was thrilled to receive ins approval and am now discouraged about not traveling until late november or early december
i was thinking about making an appeal for us to go before the almaty group
what do you think
perhaps you have better standing for such an appeal given your health concerns for oksana
shelley
i am avialable tomorrow afternoon
will 0 pm et work for you

travel times
i think that we will both travel over
kim will probably be the one to stay the two weeks
so that i can come home to tend to chad
his obligations
we definitely don't want to leave alina to come with an escort
but
the issue we still need to work through is the fact that alina is still scared o kim

by prior correspondence dated ______
we notified you that we you were notified of ashford united methodist church's concern over the proearlier this year amaintenance of houston currently provides janitorial service to ashford united methodist church and ashford child enrichment center under a month to month contract
under this arrangement
maintenance of houston provides an on-site janitor
in our initial correspondence soliciting janitorial service bids
we explained that our facility is used as a school during the week
we explained the importance from a security perspective of minimizing the number of different people that have access to the facility
we also asked maintenance of houston to provide documentation of employee screening procedures
it has recently come to our attention that maintenance of houston has not furnished employee screening documentation for the individual that maintenance of houston currently has assigned to our facility
it is our policy to request criminal background information for any contractor that is in our facility during school hours
please furnish such employee screening information to us by april 0

nancy.bagot@enron.com motion to intervene the aga petition raises issues that are directly related to the operation of pipelines
0
enron operates a number of interstate pipelines subject to the jurisdiction of the commission under the natural gas act
in some cases these pipelines are wholly-owned subsidiaries
in other cases enron is a part owner
these interests are collectively referred to herein as the enron interstate pipelines
the enron interstate pipelines have currently pending order no
0 compliance filings and may be affected by the outcome of this proceeding
and thus have a direct and substantial interest in this proceeding that cannot be adequately represented or protected by any other party
thus
the enron interstate pipelines
participation is in the public interest
comments the enron interstate pipelines wholly support the response of the interstate natural gas association of america filed this day and incorporate the comments made therein
like ingaa
the enron interstate pipelines take issue with both themes of the aga petition
first
the enron interstate pipelines take issue with the procedural request to implement the new capacity release timeline separately from order no
0 proceedings or gisb compliance filings
second
the enron interstate pipelines wish to once again voice concerns about the far-reaching impacts of the flowing day recall rights that the aga petition advocates
rather than repeat those concerns again here
we have attached a copy of comments that were submitted to the gisb executive committee during the discussion of whether gisb should remove the current prohibition on partial day recall rights
for the reasons set forth in both ingaa's response and the attached comments of the pipeline segment
the enron interstate pipelines ask the commission to deny the aga petition

i didn't want to jump ranks or push him for an earlier date
but i wanted to make certain that he knew that all our paperwork is in
dates all work great
as you mentioned
i will likely be traveling in late november or early december
i'm thinking that we may miss church altogether on sunday
we may spend the night at my inlaws in conroe
they have been bugging us to visit and i don't see another date on the calendar that will work
nov 0 for example
there is no children's church
but i am open/close trustee
don't worry about the cd player
it's no problem
i don't mind exchanging it until we get a cd player and duplicate copies of music
which i'm working on
we received our ins approval to adopt alina
but with court date delays etc
it looks like our most likely travel time is late november or early december
when i get a little better info
i will make children's church plans
if it turns out that i'm gone several weeks in december
then perhaps we can talk patty into letting the kids sit in regular church during advent
it is always such a fun time for them to be in church
they recognize so many of the songs
if i'm only going to be gone in late dec
first week of dec
then we can probably continue with children's church as planned
i'm really just guessing now
since this international adoption stuff changes by the minute
fantastic
is sheila planning to attend
if so then
there are already 0 tickets committed
if any of these cancel
i have a back-up list
i will take 0 seats
please give me the invites for those two
i'll take care of their transport
they will not need enron transport
interesting
thanks for the info
i have been building spreadsheet cases all day
fyi
majority/minority isn't driven by the number of shippers
its driven by the volume
i made the appropriate changes on galen's spreadsheet
a couple of further things that i need
i need to reconcile the net volume on galen's sheet by month with the net cash out volumes on jim's sheet
there are huge differences
can these really all be receipt imbalances
galen for the months aug 0-jul 0 can you break out receipt imbalances from market imbalances
we are only planning to put the majority/minority pricing on the market area imbalances
let me know if you guys want to sit down and talk through this
i need to get teb my final analysis by the end of the week
return to ricki and she can take care of it
great
last week i was invited to a forum
but i was disappointed that i could not attend
i consider the no notice to be part of the market imbalance for this analysis
thanks
no-notice imbalances are market area from the perspective of commodity pricing
the only reason that they are separated out from the rest of the imbalances is because of the transportation element of the cash-out price
you could never be a bother
a woman serving food at a volunteer event always has a special place in my heart

hi mom
chad just loves his apple checkboard
thanks again for it
i am still feeling sick
last week my dr
told me its just allergies/asthma
but i'm still feeling puny
i trying to get in to see if i have a touch of bronchitis or something
i'm going to forward this little list while i'm thinking of it
ordinarily
i'm not one of those people that believes in giving people a gift wish list
it seems kind of rude and presumptious
however
given that we may be traveling in the november-december time frame and unable to field the normal questions i receive about what mr
chad is into
i thought i'd provide this list
things chad says he wants for christmas
that santa isn't bringing
if anyone asks
not he should expect to get these items
since some cost more than $0
harry potter game for computer
ms-windows
more expensive item
backyard football game for computer
ms-windows
harry potter trading cards
video or dvd of
cats and dogs
harry potter snapes potion kit
more expensive item
ultra grip nerf football incidentally
chad is asking santa for the harry potter legos set
a levitating game and an air snare drum game
more later shelley
joan
stan tells me that in 0 i will have the privilege of representing the pipeline segment on the gisb board
will you be letting rae mcquade know the results of the pipeline segment board elections
hi
hope your week is going well
i'm discouraged to still be sick
asthma or bronchitis or the like
also
i'm sure that you have heard the perils of enron
then there is adoption stuff and then there is world news
i am really hoping that you will have some time to be my therapist this weekend
what would you think about tryin to coordinate hair appointments sat
my only constraint is chad's noon soccer game
if hair doesn't work then how about coffee
could you make a dr appt for tomorrow for the dr on level 0
tomorrow is fine
did ginger give you any read on how long to translate our documents or when they might be sent to kazakhstan
shelley
gisb group has not met yet
i was afraid she'd think i was being difficult if i mentioned my displeasure at being pushed into the holiday airfare timeframe
not to mention my concerns about missing chad's christmas events in december and our nanny holiday issue
my gut tells me that we should tackle this by trying to get some sort of understanding about when translation will be completed and when our papers will be forwarded to kazakhstan
because frankly telling us that we can travel 0 days after the other group means nothing if our paperwork hasn't been turned in sufficient time
tonya
haven't heard from you in awhile and i am assuming that you were probably just burnt out over the flurry of summer activity
all of my paperwork
including ins approval
is turned into ginger and i am now just anxiously awaiting the opportunity to travel to kazakhstan
ginger and crew are so busy that i imagine that things won't happen very fast
not try to bother you if you had enough of this kidsave stuff
but on the other hand
you worked hard to bring the kids here this summer and i just wanted to let you in on the fruits of your efforts
shelley
when i called ginger's house today to see if she received my ins approval
one of her children answered and said that she is at chris
house
so i guess that means chris has returned
if your process estimates are in line
our documents would have to be translated by next week to hit a travel at the end of november date
i am very concerned that we will slip to christmas time travel
while i'm not trying to have you do my dirty work
i feel like you have a little better standing to fuss at ginger or chris this week about some commitments of when paperwork will be turned in
after all
your paperwork has been turned in for some time
you have specific health concerns for oksana
since i just turned in my ins approval
even though the rest of my dossier has been in for several weeks
i feel like i don't have much standing to complain about timing
i'll be on the call for the first 0/0 hour
theresa will be on for the whole call
we can re-group to talk about comments after the call
i thought that you would enjoy reading this article about chad's school
my editorial notes are added in red

awesome visit on friday
october 0
president george h
w
bush and barbara bush visited our school
the bushes had pledged to match the donation that our students made to the children of afghanistan
right in front of the entire student body
president bush whipped out his checkbook and wrote a personal check for $0
0.0
the children were very impressed
the day was fabulous
the weather could not have been better
and our children were stellar
the program took place on the stage in the interior courtyard of the school
because the weather permitted us to use this area
every student was able to take part in the program and enjoy the excitement
as the president and mrs
bush entered the stage
the children waved paper dollars in the air to greet them
the program opened with the singing of the school song
carmen sullivan gave a history of the pledge of allegiance to the flag and kelly iko
this is our kelly from sunday school
whom i'm sure will be the first minority president of the united states
led the group in the pledge
the students sang god bless america and waved individual flags
not an eye was dry
it was awesome
maggie strange
julius liu
danny siso and brandi shallenberger told the group about the effort the bush students had put forth to collect money for the afghan children
doris reese
joan zhang
this is a sweet little girl from chad's class
and andrew nelson wheeled in a red wagon with the students
contribution
the program closed with more flag waving and the singing of it's a small world

kevin/rod
one line item on the tw counterparty revenue summary probably requires explanation
the report shows a net $0.0 million payment to pg&e for transportation
this is because pg&e released capacity at rates in excess of the maximum rate due tw
thus pg&e was due a credit
this was not a liability to tw
as the other side of this capacity release is embedded in the revenues paid to tw by other counterparties
here is a sample of articles
please add to my calendar
first worksheet show summary gross transportation revenue by counterparty for the 0 months ended 0/0/0
total transport revenue is $0.0 million
other worksheets show detail by contract and contract expiration dates
this information has been furnished to kevin howard
the only open question is how this data can be reconciled to financials
i spoke with tracy this morning and she reflects gross operating revenues for tw for this period of $0 m
the difference is primarily fuel sales
which are not currently included in my numbers
fyi
i made my staff burn the midnight oil last night putting together tw/nng revenue summaries for review by the bankers that rod/kevin are working with
thought you might me interested in the report
it gives a nice snapshot of our activity with our major counterparties
here is the presentation for the 0:0 meeting today
revised presentation for the meeting this afternoon
hi ginger
chris
hope you are doing well
just wanted to check in and make sure that you received the notarized copies of my ins approval
when i spoke with ginger a few days ago
she said that she thought we would travel 0 days or so after the almaty group
probably in late november
after i get off the phone i always think of questions i should have asked
since my questions are not critical
but process in nature
i thought i'd drop an email
i am unclear about the steps that need to happen between now and travel
how long does translation take
what happens after that
when is the dossier sent to kazakstan
typically
how much notice are people given of their kazak court date
i would also like to get your views on the likelihood of the process slipping such that our travel would fall over the christmas holiday
as that would present some childcare concerns for me back in houston
sorry for so many questions
i know that you are both very busy and i know that patience is definitely in order with this process
i am just so very new to this international adoption process and want to make certain that i am realistic about the steps involved
shelley corman
i will be thinking of you
i have rates and capacity utilization info ready
i'll call you whan i get to the office
is the system running ok this morning
i heard
i'm just pulling intop garage and will call back in a minute
with heightened security concern in the building this morning
i wanted to report two items
0
when i parked in the allen center garage this morning
level 0 yellow section
at the top of the stairs from the enron building
just under the covered area
i noticed a large brown/copper truck
i park my blue explorer in this same spot every day and i have never seen this truck before
it's probably nothing
just wanted to report it
0
when i reached my desk this morning i wanted to call in this concern
i pulled up the corporate security number listed on the website 0-0-0
the woman that answered the phone was rude and said that the number wasn't corporate security
but rather building security
she laughed and didn't seem remotely interested in my concern
perhaps
i misunderstood the website posting about who to call with security concerns
but
if i did
perhaps other employees will as well
i would propose to use only the mainline west sheet

both shelley and kim are loving parents to their six-year old son chad

please call ava garcia to pick it up when done
thanks
i'll call you tonight
thanks for the info
elizabeth brown will forward the capacity release data shortly
kevin the dial in network is down so elizabeth is headed into the office to get the pge capacity release report
it may be an hour
sorry for the delay
thanks i needed that today
fuel is retained in kind from the shippers
if i understand the question
the answer is that we only have to seek approval for corporate changes to tw
the regulated entity
we would disclose entities above tw in the corp chain for informational purposes
ferc is interested for two reasons
to understnad that tw operates separately from its marketing affiliate and as part of determining tw,s capital structure and return in a rate case
rick i have a number of contracts that the bankers want early tomorrow
i am assuming elizabeth will be in to help me
we received a call this morning from a gentleman

what a neat idea
electronic thank you cards
fyi while i have been periodically giving updates on the above max rate capacity release activity
i was surprised by the magnitude of the pg&e value above max
rates
for the 0 months ended 0/0/0 we had net cash payments to pg&e
approx $0 mil revenues to cal
+ $0.0 revenue on san juan
$0 million in above max rate capacity release activity =
$0.0
million
thanks i will look at it tonight
that must be frustrating
i've asked hr to address this problem
i know that the long term solution rests with charlie thompson
but
caroline
i'm frankly shocked at gms seeming lack of concern for the seriousness of this situation
i have serious leadership questions about a group that could continue to receive charts in after the 0th of the month
on all 0 charts
and continue to just file these reports without ever even looking at them or making corrections
when ask why they never raised the issue or brought it to management's attention
their response is that this is the way we've done things for 0 years
i'd like to visit with you about the leadership and direction of the gms group
no problem with measurement data is ever gms responsibility
its always someone elses fault
the field didn't get the info in in time
the omv wasn't received
the system doesn't work
what is the level of service that gms is accountable for
please understand that this criticism is not directed to you
i'd just like a chance to brainstorm with you one on one about how we ever have this group enter the 0st century with the rest of us

can someone pull this together quickly for me
hope your holiday was a fantastic one
my dossier info was not picked up from the embassy last week
so now i'm another week behing in the process
but
the delay does perhaps give me a chance to take care of my sinus problem
i've still been feeling cruddy and want to have a specialist look at the sinus polyp
can you recommend an ent
looking forward to seeing you soon
thanks
if you could have richard add the volumes in as columns into this schedule format that would be great
rod needs this asap
are you available to come by for a few minutes before staff meeting
i need to talk to you about a new round of due diligence and a conference call this afternoon
i had kim run down to my office to sign the revised letter and so i can fedex tonight
i am so bummed about jan
travel date and not having alina for christmas
is this for sure
was she speaking just about me or was she saying jan 0 for you too
why jan 0
if there holidays are dec 0-jan 0
then why shouldn't we set out to travel around then
so we could have our court date the first days after their holidays
sorry for all the venting
it is late in the day
liz
right after i had kim run over with the revised form and put it in the overnight
chris called me to say that the application will probably need the
sworn and subscribed
language before the notary stamp
do you have a typewriter that you could type this in above the notary stamp
or perhaps feed it through your computer printer
i sent three signed and notarized copies
so you have a few extras to play with
here is the missing language state of texas county of harris sworn and subscribed before me on this 0th day of november

my conversation with chris was quite different than my conversation with ginger
while she said that it would be more convenient if we set a date like jan 0 to travel to be able to buy the tickets in advance and hopefully get better fares
she also acted like it is not out of the question that travel around dec 0 might be possible if one didn't mind being away at christmas
on my voice mail she left a message that my dossier had been received in astana
when i called her back she said that this was a mistake
that what she meant was that it had been picked up at the embassy and was expected in astana on thurs or fri
you can call me at home tonight if you want to talk

we will not be permitted to fill this position without making a special appeal to stan

attached is tw revenue detail by contract for the years 0-0
at the bottom of the schedule
i've made a simplistic cut between short-term/long-term based on the expiration date
for example
for calendar year 0

pnr revenues long-term = firm contracts with expiration dates in 0 and beyond

i'm talking about if a confirming party refuses to confirm a block of ena gas
we are notifying bob as a courtesy and nothing about this added notice should hold up routine business processes
you can leave bob a voice message at x 0-0 or call me and i'll call bob
in any event
i also would like to be briefed about any significant cuts in ena or other enron affiliate supply
yes
please assure galen of his need to recuperate
will you send him a fruit basket from the group
how are you coming at getting debbie thompson or blair or larry berger lined up
we found no cross-default provisions in the material contracts
moreover
ferc standards of conduct required pipelines to keep contracts
books and records separate from other enron entities
no thank you for all you and your teammates do
i get a bit frustrated when stan says that
we all need to re-focused back to work
i need to remind him that we have never lost our focus
that despite what has been going on
our staff has continued to work 0/0 to maintain our service level to our customers
i would like these individuals to have a training with teb lokey today or tomorrow
teb is aware of my desire in this regard and is awaiting your call to set up the time
fyi
please send to all ets gas logistics in the never ending world of changes at enron
upper management has determined that we will not be using the pep system for feedback this year
i apologize that this decision was made after you put time into selecting reviewers and completing reviews
i have not received word on whether ets year-end feedback will occur in any alternate form
as a result of this development
the feedback training session for this afternoon is cancelled
bob
fyi
the statements about transco not honoring eol contracts doesn't make sense to me
i don't understand if they are saying that they are cutting supply or not honoring transportation nominations
i've had a change in my schedule today and i won't drop off the check in person
i deposited the enron check in my bank account this am on my way to work
to make sure i get the cash before any bankruptcy filing
and will have a personal check couriered over to your office
unless you instruct otherwise
i will make the check out to salomon smith barney and put the caption fbo shelley corman in the memo line of check
let me know if an account number should appear on the check
thanks
rick
please add contract listings
proof/have letters put on letterhead for my signature
thanks
a couple of thoughts
per travelocity lufthansa does fly between houston-frankfurt-alma ata
then moscow-frankfurt-iah
we'd only have to take transaero one way from alma ata to moscow
if we fly through moscow on way to kaz
keep in mind that the airport we fly into moscow will be a totally different airport than the airport we fly from moscow to kaz
the regional airport
i have heard that the regional airport is not a very safe or american friendly place
i want to me flexible on travel
but
i'd really
really rather not fly on aeroflot
i know that we are all under a lot of stress and i probably shouldn't send this note
but i just have to get this off my chest
have i done something to undermine your faith in me
when i worked on due diligence matters
you asked me why was i working on due diligence
when i prepared the demand letters you asked me why i was sending the demand letters
and
today
despite the fact that we oversee the day to day transactions
there is no mention of my group in the customer letter
i wish someone would just fire me if i'm incompetent
because i live in a hell worse than being fired
at least i'd have time for my family
almost 0% certain that its just me
i'd rather have good flights and spend the money on just me
i.e
we can share hotel costs
fyi
i know you were being nice and i am sorry
i really can't put into words how it feels to get out of bed in the morning right now
it takes me 0/0 hour to get myself together
i shouldn't have been so mean to you
i know you were being nice
i know this isn't a reasonable request
but these aren't reasonable times
i just need some space when i'm getting ready in the morning
the heat and the fact that i couldn't have coffee this morning just put me over the edge
my physical was ok
listen to this
because they are a preventive medicine shop he can't prescribe antibiotics
so then
i couldn't get my travel vaccines
until i find out whether i have a sinus infection and need to be on antibiotics
am i just dreaming these last few months or is this really my life
gina
did you ever prepare a set of talking points on the separateness of the pipelines from enron
liz
i noticed that luftansa has flights back on dec 0 from moscow
using the same itinerary that we discussed before
but for dec 0 returning dec 0 listed fare is $0.0
your prayers and concerns are much appreciated
thanks gary
this is an excellent plan
okay
i've already had questions about statements in this memo
my understanding of this is as follows
in the event of bankruptcy
employees are guaranteed to be paid for work already completed up to an amount of $0
if the company were to file next week
this amount should be small since payday was today
in addition
employees are paid for hours worked after bankruptcy at their normal salary or an amount the judge determines and such payments are not capped at $0
corp security did a quick audit today of the gas control center on eb0 and made several recommendations of some steps we should take prior to some of the expected workforce changes next week
0
tighten control of access to the gas control facilities
they recommended reducing access to a single door and posting a guard for the next week or so
they recommended reviewing the card access lists for the secure doors and reducing to critical staff only
we have arranged for a guard beginning monday morning
access to gas control will be through the south hallway and door only
exit
except for emergencies
will be limited to the south door as well
the guard will be checking everyones card prior to entry
we have reviewed the card access lists for all secure doors and removed everyone except gas logistics and it support staff
we have disabled access into gas control on all doors except the south door
we have cancelled all scheduled meetings and presentations scheduled for the gas control presentation center
eb0c0
0
isolate the gas control network environment
disconnect our network from the corporate backbone we do not intend to isolate gas control until events dictate that we should
we are taking steps to be prepared to isolate
while minimizing the impact to the gas control scada system
the tms system
and pgas
on monday we will also configure the hangar to support temporary operation of the gas control and other gas logistics business functions
two conference rooms and the break room will be configured with phones
network connections
and workstations
they will be configured to support up to 0 staff
the minimum staffing requirements for the hangar to support the gas control and gas logistics functions,as currently defined
is 0 staff
the hangar will be left configured for approximately two weeks
depending on events
rod
do you know how to get in touch with paul cherry or dan fancler over the weekend
i have most of the gas logistics related items prepared for tw for the bankruptcy lawyers
including contract lists and receivables
i need to have someone run a payables list
i can be reach via blackberry or on cell 0-0-0
i'm in my office now
fyi
thought you might be interested in gary smith's response to these questions
rick dietz and i are both in the office
please give rick a call to coordinate putting our oba payable info together with your payable information
gary
except for this week
it is my understanding that it will be okay for us to use 0c0 if the meeting includes solely gas logistics staff that had security access to gas control
fyi
i don't this we give our customers lockbox instructions any longer
invoices cite wire instructions and physical address
raetta please confirm
can you please check whether the 0k withdrawal was received on your end
it looks like it left my account
also can you tell whether the check in from bank one cleared
it doesn't look like its in the account either
thank you for your thoughts
i am fine
our pipeline companies were not included in the bankruptcy petition and we are continuing operations normally
while these have certainly been stressful times and a sad day for the many enron employees that lost their jobs today
we have not had any workforce reductions in our area
it's a little lonely in the building and i have to make sure to put my lipstick on before i go down to the lobby to face all the tv cameras camped out down there
yes can do
please remove my name from you solicitation list
shelley ann corman
i know you are swamped with other matters
so i jotted down in memo form my travel plans
i guess it's murphy's law that i got the phone call that i need to travel now in the midst of current work events
john
per stan horton's voicemail
attached is letter from you as the pipeline segment board chair to the gisb office indicating the pipeline segment's desire to fill stan's seat for the december 0 board meeting
hi becky
i'm thinking of you
cynthia corcoran called today to see if i knew anyone interested in doing regulatory work
i thought of you right away and cynthia was enthusiastic
but didn't want to violate your privacy by giving out your email address
she can be reached at 0-0-0 or i can give her your contact info if you prefer
shelley
rae
just a heads up
pending pipeline board rep approval
stan asked that i prepare the attached letter for john somerhalder to send to the gisb office if this is appropriate form
looks like fpl is getting back-up gas supplies to keep their nominations up
see attached for updated gas day 0/0/0 through id0
sorry but i don't know the status
thanks
don't know how that happened
i'll call you when i get downstairs tomorrow am
thanks
i went to see dr
shelley leeds rickets this am.she is a baylor grad and is very nice
glad you weren't in an accident today
have a good trip
what a crazy day
i'm in the waiting room of the ent now
i will make meatloaf for dinner when i get home
see you at noon
stan is having a 0/0 day staff meeting next wed
dec 0 until lunchtime
accordingly
i need to reschedule my staff meeting
please let me know about your availability to meet from 0-0 pm on dec
0 in my office
jackie
i got the call to travel to kazakhstan for the adoption and will be leaving next thursday
dec
0
i will be in kazakhstan over christmas and hope to touch base with your daughter to see about the possibility of locating a christmas eve worship
i think i've misplaced her email address
if you wouldn't mind
would you forward it to me again
thanks and have a blessed holiday
shelley
publish away
caroline
i think you captured the right projects
but please look at the bottom line on total reductions
you show $0 million in savings
i think that the schedule should reflect over $0 million of reductions from the original cap
budget
in my mind there is still a question on whether the meter bounce and pnr projects should be included
the phase vi upgrade wasn't on the list of projects that gary submitted
but not to worry as you will see on the attached it is and always has been part of my overall gas logistics capital budget
our team holiday potluck luncheon is scheduled for tuesday
december 0 at 0:0 am
so dust off those cookbooks and sign up to bring a culinary creation
the sign-up sheet is located outside ricki's workstation
0a
the buffet will be set up in 0c0
the gas control presentation room
room 0c0 is also reserved for seating
following our luncheon
we will have a gas logistics staff meeting at 0 pm in 0c0
we can discuss any enron updates and i will do my best to address any questions and concerns that you have
at the end of our staff meeting
we'll hold our holiday raffle drawing
we have lots of fun prizes
including many sets of sports tickets
all gas logistics employee names will be entered
you need not be present to win
finally
i want to fill you in on my upcoming journey
my husband and i have been trying to adopt a young girl from kazakhstan into our family
the paperwork and red tape have seemed unending and i was having doubts whether it would ever happen
early this week i received the call that i need to travel to kazakhstan next week to pick her up
while i am excited to complete the adoption
i'm not terribly thrilled with the timing of being gone over the holidays and away from work at this time
at our staff meeting
i can address any questions you have about whom to call in my absence
i'm looking forward to our get together next week
to the extent that you aren't able to make the luncheon
let me take this opportunity to wish you and your family a happy
safe and relaxing holiday season
it's been a few days now since ena dropped their gas supply from ena from 0m down to approx 0-0m and fpl has settled into a pattern of how it is replacing the ena gas and still keeping its nominations at 0m
here is a quick snapshot of where fpl is sourcing there gas from
exxon 0 western gas 0 el paso 0 aquila 0 duke 0 coral 0 national energy 0 delivered gas
reliant 0 energy authority 0 total fpl supply 0 less
fpl energy services 0 total fpl deliveries 0
0 firm + 0
thanks for your kind words
hi cindy
i know this is a trivial question in the greater magnitude of things
so just drop me an email when you get a chance
for my 0 uw contribution
i asked to have a lumpsum payroll deduction in feb
unsual bonus time
now
i want to have uw just bill me instead
i can't seem to get back into the system to change this
shelley
diane
cindy replied back to ask you to take my contribution out of the payroll system
and
that i should then call uw to bill me directly
please call me if you have any questions
shelley corman
catherine
i have received the call and will be traveling to kazakhstan next week to complete the adoption
my husband and son are staying back
i arrive in almaty on the 0th late in the evening
i'll spend the day of the 0th in almaty and then take the overnight train to taraz
i expect to have a court date in taraz on the 0th or 0th
then i will be back in almaty
probably over christmas
finally
i expect to travel to moscow on around dec 0 and then return to houston around dec 0
this of course is the plan if everything goes exactly on schedule
which it probably won't
i will certainly miss being away from home at christmas and am hoping to find a christmas worship service in almaty
i'd appreciate any advice in this regard
i would also appreciate advice on what time of clothes are appropriate to bring
thanks shelley corman and
sorry for the delay
my wallet and checkbook were stolen on fr night
i spent all day yesterday getting things in order
after the thief charged $0 on my credit and debit cards
remember that conversation we had about 0
i did little research on compuserve and aol
both have acess numbers in almaty kazaknstan
where i'll be at least 0 week of my journey
looks like they both use the same access numbers and both charge a $0 connect fee
so i don't see the advantage of adding aol
unless you see something i don't
here's the catch
neither has service from moscow
so i'll be out of lunch in moscow unless i can find an alternative isp
i'm at regional type hotels in kazakstan
but
i'm staying at the grand marriott in moscow
surely they have some sort of isp access
my current isp is compuserve

thanks
sounds fine
if you don't know about the nng quality posting that's probably a good sign that it hasn't been posted yet
i'm hoping to have a conversation with mary kay tomorrow before its posted
thanks
get back to your kid stuff now
fyi
great
please verify that this is taken care of and that i do not need to have someone in my group work on this
thanks
i'm forwarding this so you know what is going on when there is a $0.0 deduct from my 0/0 paycheck
fran
i need to straighten out a few personal payroll matters before i leave town on thursday
i was able to revise my bank deposit instructions on eronline
my wallet was stolen over the weekend and i had to change bank accounts
i was also able to adjust my efcu deductions
i am unable to complete the following changes online and i'm hoping that you can help me work these issues
stop pac contributions
stop savings bond automatic purchases
stop 0 united way deduct
i had selected to make one time contribution in feb
around bonus time
my plans are to stop the automatic deduct and have the united way bill me directly instead
thanks in advance for your help
my thought is that the enron contract is probably going away anyhow so that it makes sense to set this up for jan 0
i think the charges should be recorded to the balancing tools account
thanks
you are the best
either galen or jim studebaker
i'll check with sheila
do you have a few minutes to meet this morning
i don't understand why the schedule show no variance for gas logistics
my workpapers indicate that we should be down by $0k or so
thanks for the information
do you happen to have an email address for elza
ditto back at you
sounds like things have been crazy at halliburton this week
please add to my contact list
please add lou moore to my contact list
please add john baily to my contact list
please add
need to talk to you about this
thanks
yes
i forgot to mention how sad i was to learn about cuba
i agree that this is the revised capital budget that we should submit
chris
i never heard back from you after i sent the fax yesterday
i am anxious about correctly signing and notarizing the ins forms and would like to discuss when you have a minute
shelley corman
i haven't received my dossier
both kim's parents
my mom will be at the house on christmas eve/christmas day
so i think they'll eat their christmas meal at our house
i'm sure that kim
chad
mom and nevin would appreciate a christmas evening dessert invite
you can coordinate when you see them for mexican food on sat
night
have fun at the violin concert
hi sherene
mom forwarded a note that you were looking for chad suggestions
he is into anything about rocks
harry potter
or of course his all time favorite
baseball
i'm leaving for kazakhstan tomorrow
so i didn't have time to ask for gift lists for your guys
chad helped me pick out some items
that i hope they'll like
believe me
you will see the chad influence when you open the items
a box is on its way to you
have a blessed holiday
love shelley
thank you for your kind note
frankly with all the challenges our leadership team has faced this year
i don't have the slightest qualm that you and the other directors will handle anything that comes our way
please print
incl attachment
and keep for reference
oh my perhaps i've given you the wrong idea about the sophistication of chad's rock collection
it consists of rocks he has picked up at the park and a few gems he bought at a museum
he would love anything about rocks
is this cash coming into tw
i would like an updated copy of the schedule you brought me with adescription from the reps about why the customer is saying that they haven't paid
especially peoples
on first glance it looks like many of the items relate to capacity release or peoples
please send it to both of us
given gary's presentation on bonus timing i plan to turn in my recomendations today
can i meet with you at 0:oo
i am meetin with my direct reports at 0 to work on recommendations
so i need your spreadsheets asap
thanks see you at 0
any chance of doing the one penny test with the credit departments of the top couple of customers
please add to contacts
the offers to help you keep rolling in
jennie
this looks okay if i wait for my husband or liz to go on the 0th
although i think the return would need to be extended a day or so
could you also see about if i am traveling alone and wanted to change my ticket to leave sat
i was searching the internet and it looks like the lufthansa flight is still available on sat
i need to make some quick decisions about what i'm doing tomorrow
today chris called to tell me that liz gras will not be traveling with me and that i should leave on dec 0 instead of dec 0
tomorrow
this is all a shock
i will have to travel by myself
i have never traveled internationally before and i am a bit scared
as i'm sure that you were this past summer when you visited
i know everyone in kazakhstan will be nice
but i am not looking forward to customs
i am very excited to see you though
depending on how long that i will have to be in kazakhstan
i may try to come home after court and have alina escorted to moscow
kim
or kim
i
may travel to moscow to pick her up after the new years holiday
i will be sad if i have to leave her behind for a few more days
but i might have to accept this arrangement if my work calls me back to houston
so many times my schedule changes that it is difficult at work
i know that you experienced similar difficulties with you flight plans this summer
i will bring pictures of your visit this summer
i will also bring warm clothes
i received an email from a new family that hopes to adopt zhuldiz
i am so happy to hear that she has a family
jean
i keep getting these messages
i just got another batch of 0 similar reminders
sorry i missed your call last night
i had a good cry and went to bed early
as you noted in your voice message
i am planning to travel by myself on saturday
dec 0
it is the only time i can get a confirmed flight
albeit a more cumbersome route and more expensive
here is the other part of my plans
i feel fairly sure that i will return to the us immediately after my court date
unless the stay requirements are very
very short
i can fathom the courage to travel by myself
but not to hang around 0 weeks by myself
also
all these constant changes have put a serious strain on what is already a very tedious work situation for me
i am still planning to have connie move forward with getting kim a letter of invitation
visas
including a russian visa that is good until mid-january
that way kim can return for alina after the first of the year if necessary
please ask sergei to look into possible arrangements
i would be happy to pay for sergei and larisa to have a holiday in moscow if they were willing to fly with alina there
perhaps she could stay at the orphanage or with a host family and have an orphanage worker take her to almaty
i am totally terrified about traveling by myself
but this isn't a fear that will ease with time
i feel like i just have to dive in or i am going to change my mind
i need some reassurance on what happens at the airport
will the assistance service help me at customs
will sergei pick me up and where will i find him
do i have hotel accomodations
if so preferrably at the hyatt
obviously i am also handling a mountain of guilt about leaving without liz
i wrote her a note about my current thoughts on travel and why i am leaning towards leaving on sat
shelley corman
donna
lets meet tomorrow am to translate the bonus/merit info into spreadsheet form
fyi
this is what the supply breakdown looks like for fpl without ena in the equation
don't worry
whenever you get here is fine with me
attached is a copy of theresa's mid-yr review
jennie
when you get in tomorrow
could you please check whether the direct flight on the 0th cleared
if not
please advise which flight path i'm currently cleared on
i don't want to lose the return home through moscow on the 0st
waitlisted also for 0th or 0th
but i may also need to return immediately after my court date from almaty on dec 0
in such case my husband would fly back to moscow to pick up our daughter after the 0st of the year
i would like to make such a reservation is possible
i think you can probably let all the other waitlisted items go for me
please call me when you get a chance
shelley corman
i keep getting these notes
help
kim
my nonstop direct from houston cleared for tomorrow
0:0 pm
the only catch is that i have to go to the airport this afternoon to change my tickets
my return back from moscow on the 0th also cleared
i am still waitlisted for a return flight from almaty on the 0rd
just got off the phone with jennie and i know you already talked to her
my direct flight tomorrow cleared so i plan on taking it
i will pray really hard that you can join me on the 0th
then we can spend some of our waiting time together
yes
travel
this sounds fine
please have my phone forwarded to ava and provide her with my contact information
looks good
thanks for your leadership on this issue
the commercial staff has been very concerned about the lack of daily data and i haven't made much headway with the gms folks
i'm glad you are involved
i will be traveling out of the country next week
others from my staff will attend and i'll catch up when i return
happy holidays shelley
made it to almaty
thanks for all your help
it is hard to access my enron mail from my hotel
if you need to get in touch with me
please email me at cormanerb@cs.com shelley
ricki
i think it's working
jennie
i made it home last night
but have been unsuccessful in resolving kim
alina's travel arrangements
i have only been able to get the answering machine at your office this morning
i need to get kim
alina on flights home on wed
jan 0
my current thinking is that it may be better to take a refund on the lufthansa return tickets
since the moscow lufthansa office doesn't want to reissue
and to instead prepay tickets home for them on a flight path that only requires one change
please advise shelley corman
terrific
i called to let kim know
they will be leaving in just a few hours

keep up the great work
i know things have been really stressful for you lately
it was terrific to have you to rely on when i was away
and when i'm here too
here is my written review
let me know when you want to sit down and talk
donna
here is the draft written performance review that i prepared while i was traveling
i would be happy to sit down and discuss with you in person at your convenience
does fri at 0 work for you
i may be in tomorrow too after i make sure alina won't freak out with the babysitter
next week sounds fine for vacation
i wasn't able to use the global phone in kazakhstan
but a friend recently rented one and used in europe
the neat thing is that you use you're reg cell number
playdate sounds great talk to you tomorrow
yes please explain that 0 need dr signature so she can start preschool tues
besides fri and mon afternoons i don't have any other planned time off
i'll be in this afternoon and will give you a call
great
donna
attached is the written comments that i prepared while i was traveling
i can't remember if i already sent this to you or not
please forgive me if i already sent this to you
sinus congestion is not conducive to sound thinking
let me know when you want to sit down and talk
brad
attached are the written comments that i prepared while i was traveling
let me know when you would like to sit down and talk both about 0 and directions for 0
i'm fine with giving him these charts and also the job description write ups from the website
barbara
received your message
i can't promise that i will attend
as things are pretty much ad hoc at my household at this time while i try to establish some new routines
i'll try
see you sunday
i'm okay with the information
with cost center numbers excised
thanks
here are my thoughts
thanks
saturday was great
yesterday was not a banner day for me
i just kept having feelings of remorse and then guilt that i was feeling remorse
you're probably the only person that can understand how i'm feeling
talk to you tonight
if you and chad are gone to karate before we get home
we'll go to the store and have dinner ready
hi nancy i have alina at the dr for her physical this afternoon
but we should be home by 0 pm and be home all evening
sorry i missed choir last night
we are still transitioning and alina had a fit as we were leaving a friend's house to come to choir
see you soon shelley
ha ha
we have no busy schedule
we are just trying to do exciting things like making it to work each day
feb
0 is fine
of course you have so kindly showered alina with gifts that she isn't in need of much
please touch base with gina and let her handle this
i guess we'll cancel the direct report meeting since this means that lynn
steve
mike will be absent
sorry teb but i have an appointment with the sinus dr
can we visit in advance of your meeting
yes
please reschedule for tues
thanks
how about 0:0
i'll come to you if that time is okay
hi
thanks for the info
hi
sorry we missed rehearsal sunday
but we are definitely still
transitioning
we will be out of town on sunday morning at a family gathering and will not be in church to sing
we will be at choir practice sunday evening
i'll look for march and april songs for the cherubs
the videotape of the christmas program is cute
maybe we can find a time to watch it
my meeting with rod is next wed
i'm concerned about the magnitude of the supply imbalance that we've built up again
tim
are these numbers verified and up to date
can i get a breakdown of the 0.0 bcf and the 0 mmcf current month portion
it seems like we just worked down these balances in the fall and now we're building these balances back up again
if these supply imbalances are building up as a result of phase v outages perhaps the payback gas use should be separately captured and recorded against the project
did ets officially make a bid to the bankruptcy court for abandoned equipment
any computers or just flat screens
sorry i'm so slow in getting back with you on your suggestion
nothing moves fast in the world of bankruptcy
before i left to go out of the country we had put together a proposal to the bankruptcy court to buy computers
per donna's note below the bankruptcy court hasn't acted on it yet
i'll let you know if i hear of any opportunity for employees to buy computers
shelley
ok i'm thru with appointment and am on my way in
thanks again for the kind gift of beanie babies for the orphanage children
your kindness is memorialized in my journal
if you are interested
i have in my office pictures of the kids with their beanies

hi mrs
traylor
obviously things have been a bit chaotic in our family life as we try to get alina
chad's new adopted sister
settled into our routines
we have been trying to keep chad's routines as normal as usual
including bedtime and homework time
while he seems happy with school
i have noticed decreasing marks on his homework and practice tests
this especially concerns me with respect to his math
where he has always been an excellent student
do you have any suggestions to help chad with timed practice tests
do you recommend any particular classes
kumon
etc
or workbooks
if you think it is appropriate to meet to talk about chad's progress
i could come to school anytime this friday
february 0 for a conference
thanks shelley corman-erb

barbara
i have samples of group's vbs curriculum and children's church curriculum and would like to get together and see what you think
group's vbs this year is called bug safari
think
bug's life
the bible lessons are about david and play on theme of little in size
big in spirit
the video
that can be used during refreshment time
is the basis of our friday evening program
features chatter the chipmunk
so we could reuse the adorable costume ann turney made
i would like to select the curriculum with you guys before we have our volunteer luncheon
which i would like to do in late feb or early march
i would also like to agree on the date in mid-late july for vbs
i think i currently have 0 weeks penciled on the church calendar
i also have ordered samples of group's children's church curriculum
i have been struggling lately with inspiration for new lessons and some pre-prepared lessons might help us draw in additional volunteers
most of our volunteers are enthusiastic about helping
but not preparing
a children's church worship
evening meetings are difficult for me right now
as there is much to do in the evenings and little time
i would love to meet sometime this weekend if you are available
kim will be out of the country the first few weekends in feb
or i can meet on fri
feb 0 or fri
feb 0
if either of those days suit
thanks for your kind words
i also wanted to thank you for your flexibility in covering both the gas control desks and the measurement desk
in my office instead of 0c0
thanks
yes
please add tami head
barbara bakanic
maggie van syckle if its not too many
the offer is still open for you and linda to host at my house if you would like
here is gaby's address
gaby paniagua
okay
hi there
so glad you are back
how was skiing
hope we can get together on sat
or sun
i never know the polite way to suggest gifts
perhaps just a gift ideas list
summer clothes
size 0t pants/0t shirts
swimming accessories loving family dollhouse furniture
accessories gift certificates * in lieu of gifts
contributions can be made in alina's honor to kidsave international
sorry i missed you today
looking forward to lunch tomorrow
will 0:0 at la grilia suit you
have fun at your event tonight
also
mea culpa
i just replaced my daytimer calendar for 0 and realized that i missed matt's birthday
i hope that wasn't the day we were all over at your house
oops
wish matt a belated greeting on us and of course congrats on his promotion
see you tomorrow
see you at 0 pm
now that we have alina's initial visit out of the way and she has stopped talking about the bad
jaman
nurse that gave her the shots
i guess it's time to plan round two
please let me know the appropriate timing to schedule a follow-up visit for further immunizations
thanks shelley corman
i worked on the grade level promtion
i didn't know what her new title was supposed to be
lynn chcecked with fran and she told her coordinator
so i guess we'll have to check back in with fran
i think your outlined measures sound fine
i would think we could change to the new hotline almost immediately
got your note
i'm volunteering at school this afternoon and can't open the attachment on my blackberry
i'll review and send you a note over the weekend
okay i'll go for a ticket
are you back in town
do you want to go to the cafeteria for lunch
this isn't the language that we ageed on and it will cause serious objections from my camp
i thought i sent jim an email over the weekend
the language needs to say that enron has advised that it is willing to treat ubs as an affiliate
we cannot say the interstate pipelines are agreeing
as this would take agreement of our partners
cyndi
i have misplaced lori schroeder's cell phone number and need to set an appointment with her before sat
help
thanks for getting together sat
even if i am bad at picking movies
could you please be so kind as to send me the full shower address list back

hope your week is going well
here are a couple of things i wanted to tell you

i'll give you my handwritten notes

thank you for your update
our hearts are very heavy today for rich and his family
jayshree
here are some thoughts on the im
i still can't tie to the top customer revenue figures

i am anticipating that you'll want to sleep on sunday
sunday afternoon we are going to mary beth schatzman's birthday party at a mexican restaurant
sunday morning the kids choir sings
last night the kudla's came over and we ate take-out
christopher broke one of the plates on the wall in the dining room and was very active
i was pretty tired by the time i got everyone to bed

a configuration of small-diameter branchlines with multiple delivery points that function as an extension of the ldc's distribution system

northern recently extended the contract with its major iowa customer

thru 0
beyond current contract terms
northern will face competitive threats from ngpl in the des moines and sioux city
with several significant contract terms up for renewal in 0
northern will face competitive pressures in the wisconsin and chicago areas because market prices are below maximum tariff rates and due to the high concentration of competing pipelines
to some extent these competitive factors have already been recognized
as wisconsin gas has already bypassed northern via great lakes
the distance of competing pipelines to many northern towns will preclude bypass for many others
major competitors in the market area include
alliance
anr great lakes
natural gas pipeline
northern border
trailblazer viking
saturday night sounds good
my sister will be here
things are going fine at home
but we'll be happy to have kim home
greg
typically i sign all these edi trading partner agreements with lee huber's initials
can we get the proper agency/delegations in place so that i can continue to sign without further ado so long as the agreements are identical to the gisb standard agreement
we can put in place a separate procedure for any non-standard tpas
any numbers for me
can you send me the latest version
also
i am expecting to shortly have the power plant numbers to add for the 0 market and 0 southend power plant per year based on actual annualized revenues from a recent market power plan
great river
and southend
powertex
great rosemary
i'm so slow in thanking you for the lovely party
you are the best
my sister will be here for our lunch on monday too
we're going to be out shopping that day
i previously mentioned to you that i have assigned john buchanan as mgr
tw scheduling to ensure that we have a consistent focus on tw scheduling matters and presence at the 0 am tw morning meeting
lynn blair
steve january and terry kowalke are in the nng morning meeting each day at the same time
previously terry kowalke and john buchanan split time advising the tw and nng team on day to day scheduling matters
terry was sitting on 0 and john on 0
in light of the immediate change in their assignments
i asked john and terry to switch desks
i need you authorization to move their telephones
this change is important to demonstrate to the commercial groups of both nng and tw that we will not miss a step in tending to daily business even during the transition
thank you for the support
it's not final yet
i'll forward the latest copy that jayshree sent me yesterday afternoon
i still need to check that all our comments were added
fyi
i'll gladly bring my photo album and alina
chad has a playdate at a neighbors house
gaby told me that she cannot attend
you mentioned that several people may come to the get together late and that we may visit longer than 0:0 pm
my sister is arriving in town for a visit around 0pm and a cab is picking her up at the airport
i currently have arrangements for the cab driver to take her to my house
probably around 0 pm
let me know if you think i should change this arrangement
i can't think of anyone we missed for the party
except bobby oldfield
she is going to start working with us on children's church and was a fantastic help with vbs
i inadvertently dropped her name from the list
thank you for everything you do
i'm always overwhelmed by your kindness
shelley
here are a few more minor edits i saw in the latest im
kevin
we can get ets-related pipe throughput for 0
and rick has subsequently sent the tw 0 data
but we won't have non enron pipeline throughput until they publish
i j found three more minor nits
sorry but i don't have an isolated power plant capex number
in the nng commercial folks original budget they forcasted $0.0 m revenue growth from $0 million 0 capital
so my thought is that if you have already included maintenance capital = depreciation
then $0 million capital includes market area expansion as well as power plant growth
we should change all refernces to say top 0 customers provide 0 percent of revenues
i changed that in one prior draft
the other figure is the top 0 contracts
i think we should stick to customer figures rather than mix customer and contract stats
there are a couple of slides in the recent bank package nng prepared and a few more slides in the original 0 budget package
i'm a vacation day but have to stop by the office later today and will round these up
skyline refers to added seasonality that nng proposed to add to its rates
the rate case settlement represented a compromise approach to shifting more responsibity to the peak
so no we didn't implement skyline as proposed and nothing is pending
i expect that nng will make a new proposal to refect peak cost responsibility as part of the next rate case
tomorrow morning
okay
so i see that it's orlando cogen
not orange
i'm unclear what the relationship is with el paso
do they own 0% of orlando cogen
are they the designee
have they sent correspondence to us that el paso is now owner or contact party for this contract
can i see the trunkline oba too
i just got this message
i assume it is an old message or do you have a new injury
in addition to the post-it note
please record the following items
0 lynn blair $0 * also
please make sure to record the approx
$0 deposit i made while you wer gone
thanks
rick i need you to work out a full budget for this class
the houston class
both the customer portion + the individual employee travel expenses that will hit our budget
once you have the cost estimate together
lets sit down and make sure we're okay from an overall budget perspective and then make sure that the participating staff know that we need to stick to the budget
what did we put in the 0 plan for the tw contract training
are you at all worried that this starts the move to zone rates in the market area
do we care
are we worried about having competitive zone e/f rates
when you have a chance
can we talk about this
0:0 works for me
please coordinate a meeting next week between don hawkins
myself and rod hayslett for don
i to discuss a proposal for nng measurement with rod
another concern i have is that once we say that we can path
then we've lost our best argument against physical segmentation
rod
i received don's memo before i sent out the memo that we had talked about
so i turned the thoughts into reply comments
fyi
would you guys be amenable to signing up the boys for nature explorer camp july 0-aug 0
the audubon lady said that i can sign chad up with the 0-0's if he's going to be with a 0-year old buddy
summer schedule i'm not planning any camps for chad the week of june 0 because of swim team
really busy first week of june
june 0-0 is grace vbs we'll be on vacation week of july 0-0 ashford vbs july 0-0 hopefully nature explorer camp week july 0
aug 0
i'd like to sign him up biron's or some other camp 0 or more weeks
either
june 0-0 july 0-0 july 0-0
yes i can either meet you at noon or at 0 pm take your pick
i have to take the kid's to a b-day party from 0:0-0pm
kim can watch them afterwards
i'd like to go to neiman marcus last call
how did you make sure it was the right set
will it be delivered
i,m so excited
this will make my week
can you resend
there was no attachment
fyi yesterday
sunday the 0th
one of our gas controllers was stuck in an elevator for approximately 0 hours
apparently the alarm and the intercom were not functioning and she had no way of notifying anyone that she was stuck between the 0th floor and the plaza
after other dispatchers became concerned about her being missing and searched for her
it was 0 hours before they determined she was stuck in an elevator
it then took another 0 hours to repair the elevator and get her out
we were advised by one of the guards that the weekly test and inspection of the intercoms was not performed on saturday
as scheduled
evidentially the level of maintenance and monitoring of the elevators has recently changed
we are pursuing this matter with bill donovan and the building/security staff
i'll try to attend this meeting if you need me
i have a cle class out of the office from 0-0 today
but
i would like to dispel the suggestion that jerry put together the spreadsheet for me
i'm very enthusiastic about the ar tools that jerry
jim have developed and i'm happy that the reports seem to also serve the needs of the finance folks
but i feel like i made it clear that the customer service reps
like marion
that are on the front line of collecting monies are the main clients of jerry's reports
if the tool needs to be modified to better meet their needs
then it should be modified
i'm all for automation and less manual intervention
wednesday will work best for me
say 0:0 at the daily review
would one of be able to email this gentleman
he called me again this morning looking for information on connecting a well to northern
ricki
would you please
0
make reservations at 0:0 on thurs for judy johnson
i at duck
co in hyatt 0
set up a pre-meeting for don hawkins
i before our meeting with rod tomorrow 0
move my wed
staff meeting to run from 0-0:0
instead of 0-0
since we no longer have a wash office
i plan to watch the commission meeting myself
i'm confused how this fits in with the projects that we recently had dynegy approve
is this one of the discretionary network upgrade projects that they agreed to support
or one of the other discretionary projects that we didn't have funding for before 0/0/0 anyway
i'd tell her that we have actual tickets for games on mar 0
astros
and mar 0
indians
but otherwise just plan to buy the day of the game
we just pulled schedules from the web
my feeling is that once they affirmatively decide they are going to fl
you should say that i rented a house and that you are going to come over and stay with us for a few days
i know this might push us to the point of her asking whether they can stay with us
but i'm afraid the kids will spill the beans
per my earlier email
this is the maintenance company's response
thanks for your concern
while it was very scary for helen
i'm satisfied with randy's reply
i don't know who/what got everything stirred up today
it is true i have other offers
but none are new
i've been thinking about them for several weeks and haven't made up my mind
i'll let you know when i figure it out
tim
is the activity at the midlouisiana points normal
how did we build up a 0,0 mmbtu balance at port hudson
is this a measurement or a scheduling mismatch
how big is this point
here are a few thoughts
tim
the denominator in the load factor calculations needs to be updated
please check with mike to get the current denominator for the months

ann
per rod hayslett
you are able to process changes to list b to accommodate instances in which dynegy
ets can agree on the specific assignment of an individual
craig buehler and esther dasilva are both currently company 0 employees
we moved both of these individuals to list c because we anticipated that one of the two might need to stay to support deal capture/contracts/data requests for tw
craig buehler has subsequently indicated his plans to leave the company if he is not assigned to list b
dave neubauer has requested that craig be moved to list b and both rick dietz
craig's immediate supervisor
and i are in agreement
and
if we agree to move craig to list b
we need to make the same accommodation for esther dasilva
dave neubauer is in agreement with this revision as well
accordingly
please move craig buehler and esther dasilva from list c to list b
fyi
we will use another contract position vacancy to cover tw deal capture/contracts/data requests if deemed necessary
thanks shelley
don
i never heard anything back
is everyone ok with these clarifications
i'll await mike's email
thanks
ditto happy birthday from me too
was i the first d-in-law to wish you happy birthday
let's see if sheila can attend too
sounds good
is marion comfortable with the plan
thanks
i'll keep you posted
can you please advise what is going on with the flat panels that we had planned to distribute to our gas logistics team
it was in the budget and we had the okay
but now i'm hearing there is some hold-up
the units are stored on 0
shelley
does that mean rita will need to go through security every day
my preference is to give her a temporary badge or activate her old enron badge for the full week
i just listened to the presentation on the gisb final rule on intraday recalls
the final rule requires pipelines to support intraday recalls and allow the recalling shipper to nominate at each nomination cycle
but the implementation of the rule will be in two phases
0
by may 0
pipelines must file tariff revisions to be effective july 0 to permit recalls at the evening cycle or for capacity which was not being used by the replacement shipper
0
with respect to recalls during the flowing gas day
the commission directs naesb
gisb
to file comments by october 0 on how these recalls should be accommodated
with reply comments by october 0
commissioner massey noted that some parties claimed the new rule would undercut reliability
staff responded that if a shipper is worried about partial day recallability
then they should buy capacity release packages that are not designated as partial day recallable
the releasing shipper can decide whether to offer the space with partial day recall rights or not
the discussion of the order seems to be in step with ets pipeline 0 proposals to only allow intraday capacity release/recall at the timely and evening cycles at this time and say that we would need to build additional validations and need more time if required to allow recalls during the flowing gas day
the fact that comments aren't even being filed on phase 0 until oct
i think we're safe to assume that this phase won't be implemented until 0
i didn't understand we were borrowing them
i thought we already reached agreement to buy them
i recently received a schedule k-0 form from ssb
i sending you an overnight package with the form to add to my other tax materials
thanks shelley corman
yes
of course i'm still here
i think my nng friends are spreading the rumor that i'm out of here
but
i just keep busy with my day to day work and try to put of making any decisions
i haven't visited with stan lately
why do you ask
i know he has a lot going and doesn't have the crystal ball that i and others are looking for
i'll try to sit down with him next week
i'm not planning on doing anything this week
what is an ambassador doll and where can i buy one
fyi
no idea
let me know if you hear something
alina's dr
appt is at 0 in the medical center

shelley corman vice president
ets gas logistics
no change
we are to retain all documents
i'm okay with providing your attached sheet to jane
great
just wanted to make sure i was on the right wave length
as jane joyce has asked the it folks for more detail on the contracts and revenue projects and i didn't want to lead the it folks astray with my understanding of our meeting if it was incorrect
you are going to be so very mad at me
but i have lost my atm card
can you cancel my card
i think this proves that i am no allowed to have an atm card in the future
call me
it's been canceled
there were no unauthorized withdrawals
it very well may be in the pocket of one of my blazers at home

sorry but i'm hostage in
meeting in 0c0
i'll catch up wti you tomorrow
chris
i was about to send off the info from the prior email when i received your latest update
however
i'm confused by the update
the form seems to be the same
except it is intended to be sent to the republic of kazakhstan in new york
is that really where we are sending our registration information
what about the autobiography
what is that
what is required
i understand the urgency in registering and am prepared to do what it takes to accomplish this today
but
frankly this whole process was a surprise to me
does your agency have an written materials on follow-up requirements/processes in general
i'm sort of at a loss on the whole issue of what comes next
when to apply for ss#
what about readoption
passport
certificate of citizenship
etc
i was surprised when a resident alien card arrived
i need to take care of the registration issue today
as we will be on vacation starting tomorrow for a week
shelley corman
thanks
i won't be home until 0
have meeting
will call when i leave
let it rip
john

i don't plan for us to sign on
we'll just wait for it to hit the board for vote
great
thanks
pre april 0 was specifically not covered by the 0 month rule
but 0 don't think that means that we are automatically required to process all old ppas
i think we should plan to manually handle any pre 0 ppas that we feel bound to accept
fyi i saw ken caminiti at animal kingdom yesterday
florida is great
we have been on the go all day and its been after business hours when i've gotten back to the house so i didn't get to talk to you

i have received the revised w-0 forms from enron that increases my reported income to reflect my non-eligibility to participate in the dependent daycare spending accounts
see letter in the package of information that i previously delivered to you

to meet at your office to review my return and to discuss alternatives for the second home

i think we could get the planting done in about an hour
congrats to you on your recent wedding
i am so thrilled for you both
fyi regarding mn ec closing
i really enjoyed our talk last night
you gave me some really good advice
i'm sure that vacation/going out of town is the very last thing that you feel like thinking about
but when you're up to travel thoughts let me know if you would be interested in going to the hill country hyatt some weekend
i think alina would love the water rafting
we could go the weekends of may 0
0 or 0 if you are interested

the return of the personal best award program or anything else that is on your mind
if you have issues that you know that you would like me to address please drop me an email today so that i can do some research and be better prepared to answer your questions
shelley
occ has called me and i am on the call and the operations folks seem irritated with my explanation that i no longer cover communications so i have jotted down the notes on the call and would like to hand over to you as appropriate
summary notes from tom mertz
there was an oil spill on the block 0 platform off the coast of la in elod
sp
bay on an eott facility
have 0 people on blocks but they are busy with booms
so they are out of communication
and others are on the way to the site to bring up communications
the spill was initially reported at 0 barrels
but later received report that slick reported as 0 ft wide x 0.0 mi long
and it is nearing the bank/shore
going to do fly over
govt agencies have been called including the coast guard
coast guard will meet us at site
we have deployed us environmental to do containment and cleanup
there is concern that news will cover when slick reaches shore
fyi
let me know if you are okay with these and i will forward to stan
jennifer
regrettably i will not be able to attend the april 0 meeting of the dinner
please pass my best wishes on to both dean dutton and professor kleit for a successful meeting
shelley corman
the ferc is presently deliberating on more restrictive rules
but i'll answer in the context of the current rules
there are three main principles behind the current rules
0
pipeline can't share shipper information with affiliate 0
pipeline can't share transportation info with affiliate
unless pipeline is willing to publicly post info
and 0
pipeline and affiliates must operate as separately as reasonably possible
there is no prohibition on the pipeline having affiliate information
but the real root of your question is whether the entities are operating separately
for example
pipeline gets forward price curve info from affiliate
we'd argue that this is just info that helps pipeline do its job better
but
compare with scenario where pipeline has a detailed list of all affiliates sales obligations
price
terms
etc
the argument can be made that the entities are not operating separately and the only reason that the pipe has this info is to favor affiliate business
there was a real case to this effect
the pipeline
affiliate attended a joint strategy meeting each morning
the pipeline claimed that it only listened during the meeting
ferc found that the pipeline and affiliate were not operating separately and fined the pipeline
so
i'd say that the rules are asymmetric for the case where the pipeline wants access to research/training/historical type info
but probably symmetric when it comes to matters of day to day contracts of transactions
new rules propose to
0
expand the list of who is a marketing affiliate 0
require pipeline to keep detailed records of communications with affiliates
thanks
i needed a little bedtime reading
no material impact
the filing concerns various scheduling and balancing rules
ricki
i don't yet have answers back to many of the questions that i pitched to hr and lynn and donna are out
so could you see about the possibility of moving our staff meeting to tomorrow afternoon

hope everything is moving quickly ahead for you
shelley
or are you still swamped from being out of the office

let me know what you think about april 0 as a possible san marcos date
second choice would be april 0
i have another meeting at 0
i'll join you late if i can
i'm just finishing up my comments on the nng business plan and will forward shortly
this morning i discovered and forwarded to teb/rob the cases of several major pipelines
trunkline
texas eastern
that converted to llc status with no protests or conditions
these were unpublished letter orders so they don't turn up on a westlaw search
teb agrees that these provide a very straight forward road map for us
great
are you interested in getting a group of people together to buy 0 tickets
est
cost $0,0
would need to be split 0 ways to be doable
here's my first stab key findings 0
with only one significant exception
the groups acknowledge their tasks/responsibilities in the measurement process
the only area that appears to be lacking defined roles/responsibility is follow-through on open issues/corrections that are not made prior to close 0
the main issues with late data for billing relate to execution and lack of communication follow-through 0
there needs to be an added focus in the field about how their tasks relate to the nng billing process
current procedures are written solely in the context of calculating uaf
0
the customers chart changing arrangements raise audit concerns and concerns about our ability to gather timely data for billing
recommendations 0
educate field and gms staff on use of measurement data in billing
combination of written materials and presentations
gas logistics
0
renegotiate chart changing agreements/gain understanding of timing parameters
0
assign responsibility for past month issues past measurement close
0
develop single point of organizational accountability for quality/timeliness of data fed into pgas
including field teams with respect to their measurement duties
measurement technology
gms and uaf specialist
i can make that work for chad if that is when drew is available
i assume you are talking about wk of june 0

is your net send working
mine is not
what is you msn name
let me try this again what is your yahoo id
two statues in a city park
one female and one male
had faced each other for many years
one morning
an angel appeared and told the statues
since you have both brought enjoyment to many people for years
i'm giving you your greatest wish and bringing you to life for 0 minutes
in that time you may do whatever you like
and the statues came to life
smiling at each other
they ran toward a stand of trees and dove behind a couple of bushes
the angel smiled as she listened to them giggling and rustling in the grass
after 0 minutes
the statues emerged from the bushes
smiling and happy
the angel was puzzled
you still have 0 minutes
would you like to continue
the male statue looked at the female and asked
do you want to do it again
oh
yes
the female statue said
but this time you hold the pigeon down and i'll poop on its head
the san francisco chronicle final

the buddha says that we take wisdom where we find it
perhaps the buddha does not say that
but it's not a bad idea anyway
the buddha would have said it
maybe
had he not been saying the other things
our enemies can teach us lessons
our adversaries can make us stronger
they can be consumed with greed and contempt
their very breath can be toxic
and yet their actions can open upward-flowing paths
take enron
the energy company
or chevron
another energy company
or el paso natural gas
yet another energy company
these organizations are the minions of satan
they pillage and they profit
they are in the ascendant
their enemies fall before them like cordwood
ordinary citizens cower and meekly hand over tribute
and yet we thank them
we send our investigators after them and we pray that their executives land in jail
but we thank them
they have shown us the nature of our enslavement
they have defined the nature of our sloth
we have believed the big lie
we have believed in the free lunch
we have trusted those who would pander to us
we have eaten energy in great dripping gobs
did we know it was not infinitely renewable
oh yes
did we understand that energy companies could create
shortages
whenever they wanted merely by closing plants for
maintenance
you bet we did
and did we confuse the energy companies with charitable organizations and/or alchemists able to repeal the laws of nature
we did not
but it was more convenient to forget those things
and so we did
we have busy lives
we must do the things we must do
the infrastructure is everywhere crumbling
and we are patching it up ourselves
we are paying bureaucrats with taxes
but the bureaucrats are inadequate
so now the spirit of volunteerism is much praised
volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but don't
and somehow
even in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one
we forgot about our own checking accounts
already seduced by the idea that credit card debt is good clean fun
we decided to waste a lot of money using energy we didn't need
i'm not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the river and beating your clothes with small stones
i'm talking about washing machines with quarter-full loads and settings far too powerful for the task at hand
right
lights burning in unoccupied rooms
appliances plugged in but never used
we pay for it
we send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains in american commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else
you wonder why they have contempt for us
you wonder why dick cheney believes he can fool all of the people all of the time
because he has
look
last week the secretary of commerce suggested means-testing social security
that is
means-testing a pension plan
you gave us the money
we kept it for 0 years
now
prove that you need it
why did he suggest that
because he can
why did pg&e demand additional compensation for its executives
who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals under any fair definition
because they can get away with it
they will get away with it
you watch
i am not saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves
there are active villains
and there are people who allow villainy to occur
everyone in a corrupt system is corrupt
the fools are the ones who don't end up with any extra money
we are the fools
if we understand our foolishness
we begin to be wise
we send lovely bread-and-butter notes to enron
once we were blind
but now we see
and we await developments
or create them
ina
i still have not gotten my last two expenses
can you see if john has approved them are where the snag is also from the trip how do i expense out a cash expense with out a receipt ie paying at crowbar for 0 people

it had trouble going through 0.0 in auggie but on the nws and api news it broke other levels are 0.0 in winter and 0.0 in cal 0
my opinion is that it will take a low aga or weather to push through all three of these resistant levels at one time
cal 0 was 0.0 bid this morning and then came back off to 0.0 along with winter being 0.0 bid and falling with it
this has happened several times already

i can not tell you how grateful i have been for the support both you and nancy have given me during this time in my life
i know i have not been at your house as of late and that is due to being off track of the plan

checking on the psl price it was great to be home when you got there cut rate will be there at 0 tonight
no to the snake
if there are 0 franchise players then the order should be supplemental 0 through say 0 round one should go supplemental teams 0 to 0 then franchise teams in reverse order of how they ranked the previous year round 0 through what ever is the same as the other draft we did
suggested draft order
scenario 0 franchise teams and 0 non-franchise franchise teams ranked 0
0 based on total points of franchise player from previous year first the supplemental draft round one # 0 franchise team
# 0 supplemental
# 0 franchise
# 0 supplemental and so forth and so on with a non snake system going from there ok everyone chew on that and spit back dutch
now that i have jeff on board lets here from the rest of you
0 or 0 teams

good to see you made it back to the states where are the dreads
i just wanted you to know that i am thinking about you and hope that you are having a ok day
at 0.0
question 0
when we talk about
the market
reacting to events
what are the prices that we are talking about
from a simulation standpoint
i am trying to figure out what prices we need to show as being affected by these many events
is it the forward curve
is it the spot market price
is the bid/offer prices for the various instruments
and
if we are having users trade basis
we will need different prices for different locations
right
quigley
dutch
for each event we need to build a change matrix that will change the previous price curve to a new one depending on each event it could change all parts of the sport and forward curve question 0
given that the calculation of var is rather involved
we decided that it would not be worth our effort to have that calculation in the model
however
we understand that the user needs to 0
know their var and 0
know that they need to make sure they stay within their var limit
so
we will need to set a var limit for the user and
fake
the individual var to reflect their risk exposure
i had a talk with erro mclaughlin about this
he made a good point that if our user are not expected to understand the complexity of how a var is calculated
will they know how to control their var
i.e
if a user sees that he is over his var limit
what should he do to get it back within the limit
is is as simple as not being too long or too short
and if that is the case
would it be sufficient to use position reports/tallies as a proxy for risk exposure
instead of var
one possible way to fake var may be to adjust the var number to reflect how exposed the user is
so if they are x dollars long
they have a var of y
if they change their position so that they are now 0.0x long
they have a var of 0.0y
perhaps we can also throw in a factor that takes into account market volatility
what are your thoughts
quigley
dutch
instead of a var number we could set position limits that they must stay within at all times i.e
over all position can not be outside a set range
nymex risk can not exceed +
0 contracts basis
index risk can not exceed +
0 contracts so for and so on therefore not having to calculate var and expect the user to understand what to do to stay with in limits lastly
when could you meet with me next week
i would really like to meet on tuesday
if possible
quigley
dutch
can you check with your team
i am to meet with them on monday and tues
so see if you can squeeze into one of the times or we can make a new one dutch

welcome to the pleasure of planning an event for your asshole friends

the next step is
the event
that will be the turning point of this bitching
there are two outcomes
0
everyone has a good time and you will bitch back and it will be lessened to good friendly humor 0
everyone is pissed b/c they drove 0 miles
they play bad and blame you for picking a bad place to play
they kill you and bury you in a sand trap on the number 0 hole
finish the round and never mention your name again

attached is a spreadsheet summarizing hourly ttc and atc data for cob s/n from jan 0
0 to april 0
the data were obtained from the iso
after looking at the data
it is clear that
although the ttc values have not changed from
0 to
0
the atc values have decreased dramatically
i believe the reason for this is the iso's attempt to prevent exports to the northwest
i propose that we send this spreadsheet to our iso rep
via sue mara
and ask him to explain the reason for the reduction
thanks
this gets even better
on tuesday
april 0
i had our california prescheduler ask the iso day ahead personnel why the cob s/n atc had been decreased so much
there reply was that the atc is calculated by taking the ttc less existing transmission contracts less ftrs less capacity benefit margin
normally
and up until january 0 of this year
they haven't used a capacity benefit margin when calculating atc leaving the state
so the amount of atc they had at cob s/n is normally in the 0 to 0 mw range
rather than the 0 to 0 mw of atc they are using now
we asked what this capacity benefit margin was
and they said it's not in their tariff
it's in the nerc operating manual
i went to the nerc web site
and sure enough
capacity benefit margin is a defined term
it reads
capacity benefit margin is the amount of ttc reserved by load serving entities to ensure access to generation from interconnected systems to meet generation reliability requirements
the iso's use of this language is outrageous
this is language to ensure that load has transmission access to remote generation
i can see them using this argument with respect to cob n/s but no way cob s/n
in fact
one could very easily argue that they are violating this criteria
if we have load in the northwest
and have purchased generation in california
we should have access to available transmission
they auctioned off 0
up from 0
so that's not it
thanks
there fruity-pants
alan
attached is the memo i promised
it's sort of rough
but accurate
please feel free to utilize any or all of it
it would be interesting to get steve walton's feedback as well
also
this doesn't really address my concerns with respect to curtailing firm exports under muni-transmission
at least not completely
if you have any questions
let me know
installed windows 0 at home and work
quite nice
no compatability problems
good job
your numbers are close enough to mine to agree
i put in an annuity to modesto for $0,0.0 dated march 0
the enron deal number is 0
just in case there is any confusion
if there are any problems
give me a call
thanks
sean
attached are my final comments
they deal more with the proposal to curtail exports
including muni
i don't really care if we file this with the material we have already put together
or do something with it separately
with respect to the atc and ttc questions we were addressing earlier
i haven't added anything to what steve put together
the caiso's argument about restricting atc because of path 0 congestion
because
as steve points out
any technical problems would affect both ttc and atc
if anyone has any questions
let me know
seems like one or each desk could participate
the problem would be the unrecorded line
cell phone is a good idea
how many
mothballed
power plants are there
kevin
here are the examples we talked about assumptions
0
we put out a cob/mc market $0 at $0
here's what will happen in the broker market
a
if someone hits my bid of $0 in the broker market i will buy cob at something like $0
and i will sell mid-c at $0
b
if someone lifts my offer of $0 in the broker market i will sell cob at something like $0
and i will buy mid-c at $0
if you take the same assumptions and show this market on eol
here's my understanding of what will happen
c
if someone hits my bid of $0 on eol
i will sell cob at $0
and i will buy mc at $0
compare this with
a
d
if someone lifts my offer of $0 on eol
i will buy cob at $0
and i will sell mc at $0
compare this with
b
clearly this doesn't work
one possible solution
i think
is to examine what happens if you put out a cob/mc product on eol
but switch the products such that product 0 = mc and product 0 = cob
and assume we put the underlying product 0 market out as mc $0 @ $0
e
if someone hits my bid of $0 on eol
i will sell mc at $0
and i will buy cob at $0
achieves same result as
a
which is what we want
f
if someone lifts my offer of $0 on eol
i will buy mc at $0
and i will sell cob at $0
achieves the same result as
b
which is what we want
i realize
e
and
f
don't jive with our long contract description
but conceptually it works
if you have any questions
let me know
bruce
i haven't had an opportunity to call you directly yet
so i thought i would e-mail you first and sort of lay out the circumstances
i've been a short-term trader with enron for about 0 years
i run our short-term northwest book
prior to that
i cash traded for portland general for a couple of years
my contract with enron is up july 0
and i have a 0-month non-compete obligation
theoretically
the earliest i could leave enron would be may 0
so the earliest i could start with another shop would be sept 0
to be honest
at this point i'm shopping
i'm talking to a couple of other outfits and i basically want to see what sort of interest there is out there
i talked with matt
and he mentioned you
so i thought it might be a good idea to get in touch
if you are interested in pursuing anything further
please e-mail me and we'll arrange a time we can talk over the phone
thanks
sean
we've been experimenting with spreads on eol and i want to lay out to you what happens when you transact a spread on eol
assume you want to put out the cob/mc spread
0 at 0
also assume cob is 0 at 0
as you know
if you put this out in the broker market
you would expect to buy cob $0 under mid-c or sell cob $0 over
if you want to duplicate these trades on eol you could put out cob/mc
0 at 0
but here is what's going to happen
assume cob mid is 0.0
if somebody
hits
your
bid
you will sell cob at 0.0 and buy mid-c at 0.0
if somebody
lifts
your
offer
you will buy cob at 0.0 and sell mc at 0.0
effectively the eol transaction turns your bid into an offer and an offer into a bid
or the title is cob/mc but the transaction is mc/cob
the problem it seems to me is that
fundamentally
bid is always first
offer is second
for this to work as is
the market would have to accept that
in all cases bid/offer applies except with eol spreads where it's offer/bid
this seems too confusing to me
i'm not sure how you guys feel about it
but i want to give you a heads up
steve
i've been talking with james over the last couple of weeks about possible opportunities at duke
just to give you a quick look at my background
i've been running enron's short-term northwest desk for about 0 years
prior to that
i performed more or less the same function with pge for a couple of years
my contract with enron is up july 0
i'm under a 0-month noncompete obligation after i leave enron
theoretically
my last day with enron could be may 0
so the first day i'd be able to start somewhere else would be sept 0
to be honest
at this point i'm shopping
my goal is to have 0-0 options to consider by may 0
i'll be in salt lake on may 0
so if you are interested in getting together to talk about any opportunities duke might have
please let me know
thanks
sean
today is a good time
e-mail me with a number i can reach you at
a time
and i'll give you a call from my cell phone
thanks
sounds good
i'll give you a call
kevin this looks like it will work
since there has been some confusion around this
i'll lay out what i think will happen with this language
assumption #0
cob is not displayed on eol
product 0 is cob
product 0 is mc situation #0 customer lifts the cob/mc spread at $0
enron will then buy the mc at $0 and sell cob at $0
situation #0 customer hits the cob/mc spread at $0
enron will then sell the mc at $0 and buy cob at $0
this is how it should work
i suggest we test things out now
and see how it works
thanks
sean
why
if i can build a product
i'm ready any time
we can test it internally before we go live
let me know if i can build the product
thanks
thanks for your response
i was wondering if you guys have public information about the spill program coming up
kevin
is the sp and np language in the spread language the same language we use when we transact sp0 or np0 on eol
hey bruce
thanks for the chance to meet you and the people you work with
i was just wondering where we are at now
if you get a chance
either e-mail me or give me a call
thanks again
sean
down to brass tacks
eh
this is always the interesting part
quite frankly bruce
it's a pretty good job market
basically i'm looking at two other prospects
the first will require me to sign a 0-year contract
the second will not
the base component with the first is going to be around $0/year
the second is going to be around $0/year
as far as incentive bonus goes
i'm looking at about a minimum of $0 for the first to about a max of $0
at the second i'm looking at a min of about $0 to about a max of $0
so over a one year period
we're looking at about $0 to $0.0m for prospect 0
and $0 to $0.0m for prospect 0
in terms of location
both prospect 0 and 0 are in attractive locations for me
prospect 0 is in a very attractive location
to be honest
i'm not a big buyer of houston
so i have to factor that into the equation
secondly
both prospects are big
well entrenched players
so i'm pretty confident of the above numbers
while i'm pretty excited about the prospects of being on the
ground floor
with cinergy
i also have to recognize cinergy doesn't have a p&l track record for me to assess the probability of the incentive payout
for that reason
i think
i would require a fairly large guaranteed number the first year
while still participating in cinergy's incentive program
the second year i would be willing to renegotiate the guaranteed number if we had our feet underneath us and it looked like we had the room to prove ourselves and generate some serious money for the company
given what you guys have in mind
i honestly think i can help you achieve your goals more quickly
and with less risk
i also think there is serious money to be made with the right team--i've seen it happen at enron
no matter what happens
i appreciate you taking the time
please also extend my thanks to everyone i had the opportunity to meet in cincinnati
hey bruce
the 0 and 0 are guaranteed
yes
i didn't mean to imply cinergy wouldn't pay out
i meant more i'm basically comparing startup prospects with established company/operations prospects
startup prospects are
i think
more risky
also
i realize there are distinct advantages from living in houston
my
reluctance
is more of a family/moving type of thing
it is an issue
but not a huge one
thanks
sean
bruce
the 0k is salary
and nonperformance related bonus payouts
it is not guaranteed bonus over and above salary
i wish it was
basically
i am 0% certain i will make a minimum of 0k/year with either company
worst case i'm looking at 0k/year
excluding incentive
incentive would be in addition to
my offer would have to be in that ballpark
if i worked 0/0 the year
assuming a base salary in the 0 to 0 range
i would get 0 less
also
i'm not trying to be vague
essentially i'm working with 0 moving parts--non of which has become crystal clear yet
at this point
let's look at this
0-year contract with an out after 0-year
$0 base salary
$0 signing bonus
$0 retention bonus after 0-year
if i take it
i'm done for another year
participation in the 0% incentive package
relocation package
that seems to be the ballpark we are in
thanks
sean
steve
thanks for the dinner and chance to meet everyone friday
it actually was a pleasure to talk with nancy
rare
i think for an interview situation
i'm sorry to say i'm still in a holding pattern
there are a couple of bits of information i still need to process
but i thought i would email you with some initial numbers
i'd also like to confirm my understanding of duke's compensation program
base salary
$0k-$0k/year lti
0% of base salary paid out in options that vest 0/0 every year
performance incentive
0x to 0x base salary
no contract
full relocation package
this is what i recall from the interview
if i'm wrong
i'd appreciate clarification
regardless of what happens
i appreciate your time and consideration
i should be able to come to a decision next week
thanks
sean
looks good then
let's try it
hey bruce
hope you had a good vacation
i was just touching base to see where we're at
i leave for europe on june 0 and i'll be gone until july 0
my last day in the office here will be either thursday or friday of this week
some other places you can contact me are
cell
0-0-0 home
0-0-0 thanks
sean
hey bruce
thanks for the response
i think i would like to see cinergy's bid
i sort of have to weigh many nonfinancial issues as well
it would be nice to know where we are at
if you could provide me a rough number
that would be helpful
thanks
sean
thanks bruce
i appreciate it
hey
west power trading accomplishments and goals first-half accomplishments st nw book made approximately $0 million
effectively managed complex physical positions in the northwest
effectively managed st nw personnel
provided effective leadership to other traders and schedulers on the desk
provided feedback to fundamentals
short term goals continue to trade the st nw book
meet new p&l objective
work on my discipline
learn more about gas
learn more about options
prepare for q0
work with tom and mark to create more of a cohesive and integrated cash desk
apply coordinated pressure at various points in the cash market
work more with fundamentals with respect to organizing and displaying information
long term goals play a lead role in enron's involvement in the northwest rto
if the rto turns out to be a substantive and functional organization
here are some questions/comments i have regarding the ruling
0
how does the cap apply to index prices
if the dj-pv index settles at $0 and the cap is $0
do parties selling index have to adjust there price to $0
0
would financial products
swaps
be affected by the cap
0
there has to be less ambiguity with respect to day ahead cash markets
for example
assume it's a monday and the iso is under normal conditions and the price is $0
then assume on he 0 the iso declares a stage one and the price clears at $0 and the price is $0 for the rest of the day
tuesday assume the price is $0 during the first few offpeak hours
but the wednesday forecast shows identical conditions as monday
what is the day ahead cash cap trading tuesday for wednesday
is it $0 or $0
one could make the argument that it should be $0 because it is reasonable to assume they will be in a stage one real time on wednesday
but at the time cash is traded they are not in a stage one
it seems to me the easiest way to solve this problem would be to have an independent market organization declare what the day ahead cash market price was before the cash market traded
so for the example
they may recognize it's likely a stage 0 $0 cap will be in effect on wednesday
so they'll set the cap at $0
the market will know before hand and there will be no ambiguity
more efficient market
less litigation
0
what about call options
if a generator owns a call option at $0
the cap is $0
but the market is actually trading $0
does the generator have the right to exercise the option
what if the generator has a plant that he can fire up at $0
does the generator have to wait until the price hits $0
seems like the strike price on an option would be an easily demonstrable expense
and would there be a difference between a marketer owning an option and a generator owning an option
here are my comments 0
i wouldn't agree the caps have hurt liquidity
in fact
in the northwest at least
they have actually increased liquidity
any decrease in liquidity can be attributed primarily to a couple of things
0
uncertainty about the level of the cap and
0
when the day-ahead prices trade above the cap
removing marketers as sellers
i would propose the following cap timelines
first of all
i think it's important that ferc realize the
spot
market really is two separate markets
what we call the
day-ahead
cash markets
and
day-of
real-time markets
the 0-hour designation doesn't dovetail with the current market timelines and is a source of confusion that can adversely affect liquidity and dispatch of power plants
for example
day-ahead cash typically trades from 0:0 am to approximately 0:0 am for next day deliveries
however
on thursdays the wscc otc market trades for friday and saturday deliveries
and on fridays
we trade for sunday and monday
all of this can be adjusted for various reasons
but this is the typical schedule
if we held to the 0-hour spot cap literally
then tuesday thru friday the cap would apply to the day-ahead market
but would not apply to saturday and monday
this obviously cannot be an intended consequence
i recommend the cap timeline be consistent with the day-ahead wscc otc trading timelines
in addition
there is some question with respect to what cap applies to the day-ahead market
what if the forecast calls for much higher temperatures and it is assured that real-time markets will be trading above the 0% threshold
assume that stage i
ii or even iii is a certainty
it seems prudent that a higher day-ahead price cap be established
still consistent with ferc's guidelines
why
because you would want units prescheduled to have high reserve margins going into real-time
rather than scrambling to dispatch units real-time
it seems like it would be prudent for some independent board to set the day-ahead price cap equal to either the 0% or stage i limit prior to trading time
this board would have to have regional representatives in order to be truly effective
establishing the cap does not have to be cumbersome or time consuming
in fact
it should be fairly easy
the cap governing real-time transactions is clear
however
what isn't clear is what happens when the new stage i cap is actually lower than the existing 0% of stage i cap
for example
during the first couple of days in july the real-time cap was operating under the 0% of stage 0 criteria
approximately $0
the iso hit a stage i and stage ii and the price actually fell to the $0s
this created uncertainty exactly when it shouldn't happen
as a result supply was apparently affected in california and the southwest for a few hours across the peak
it seems odd that prices should fall real-time as reserve margins decrease
one could argue this is a good reason why caps should be tied to daily gas prices
but assuming that isn't an option
i propose something like this
the day before
around 0
the caiso
or preferably an independent body
would determine the real-time non-stage cap as well as a stage minimum
while in a stage i
ii
or iii the hourly price would be the higher of the non-stage price cap or the recalculated stage price
if the stage i price turned out lower
then the non-stage price would be used for that hour
but the recalculated stage i cap
and corresponding 0% price
would apply for the next operating day
and for day-ahead cash trading for the next trade day
this provides information before the trading period
enhancing liquidity
and eliminates strange price movements during real-time
it also fits the ferc price cap paradigm
0
marketer prices
i think there is a clear bias against marketers in the order
but given the fact it seems deliberately slanted against marketers
there are clearly three areas where marketers should be allowed to recover costs that are easily demonstrable
first would be losses at a tie into california
if we sell at the cap and incurr losses
then we can't sell at the cap
second would be the 0% credit premium
credit issues apply whether you're a marketer or generator
third would be call options
it seems if the market trades above the cap and above the strike in a call option
that a party should be able to exercise and sell
i'm not sure what the difference between a peaking plant and a call option is
wow
a long time
i was out june 0 and came back on july 0

back
i heard about this
griswold was a weener
on august 0
0
enron counsel in dc requested that the enron northwest cash desk pull together a tremendous amount of data for part of the 0 operating year
the data request was unusual in the type of information it asked for
and for the most part
enron's internal systems did not track the information in the format requested
since the pending lawsuit involves a large amount of money
it was imperative that
0
the data be pulled together
even though our internal systems did not track this type of information in a format that was readily accessible
0
the data be as accurate as possible
and
0
it be done in a very short period of time
the amount of data we were asked to review and pull together was massive
utilizing cara's comprehensive
and fairly unique understanding of our scheduling and accounting systems
we were able to accomplish this task
there were many instances where we hit a
brick wall
specifically
it was difficult to match information from our scheduling dataset with our accounting dataset
although it was imperative we do so
cara was instrumental in bridging this gap
as a result of her efforts
we were able to hand a quality set of data to our consultants in dc
and subsequently for our ferc filing
i recommend that cara receive a personal best award for the amount of $0,0

i've had an idea for a new eol product that i would like to start our eol legal and contracts people thinking about
it's kind of a weird product
but i think it would trade quite a bit once people figured out what it was
it's called the day ahead/real-time park/lend product
essentially it's a financial trade on a day ahead basis that is settled real time
for example
let's say morgan stanley agrees to sell us 0 mw onpeak for $0
but that it is not prescheduled--it is to be settled real time
if we fast forward to real-time
morgan stanley has two options
they can buy from us on eol
whereby this transaction books out
or they can deliver us physical power
whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time
the nice thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a position to real time
even if they are not a control area
in addition
it would provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a day-ahead position
kevin
i'm not sure if it's you i need to talk to about this
but i would appreciate some direction if it's somebody else
once we identify who we need to look at this
i'd like to set up a conference call to discuss contract language and eol mechanics
thanks
i'm not sure if my first response got through
the person to talk to about this
this long of a term
is mike swerzbin
if you have question concerning the short-term
let me know
thanks
my name is sean crandall
i work with jeff richter
i'll send you a check
i'd like to pick the bears as the losing team this week
kevin
could you e-mail me the contract language we currently have for the mid-c physical product so i can work with it
i don't have an electronic copy
thanks
kevin
one more thing
we'd like to get some more spreads going
specifically the pv/mc
the np/sp
and the pv/sp
i realize the pv/sp might be a problem from a legal standpoint because of contract language
but i would like to get the others going
can you give me a call some time today
thanks
i pick washington
i've mailed you my check today
my pick is new england
please keep me up to date
thanks
kevin
my apologies for not getting back sooner
but i sort of wanted to see how the enron real-time products did before proceeding with this
it seems like real-time is a success
so let's get going with this
i call this product dart
day-ahead/real-time
it's basically a physical product that is transacted on a day-ahead cash basis
but is delivered on real-time
for example
on the day-ahead
lets say i post a
us pwr phy firm mid-c peak oct0 to oct0 dart
$0 at $0
if i get hit
then the party selling to me is obligated to deliver on oct 0th
real-time 0 mw each hour
i would be long real-time at $0
if a party lifts my $0
then i would be obligated to deliver to them on oct 0
real-time
0 mw each hour
i would be short at $0
the mechanics of this deal are much like a regular day-ahead cash transaction
the primary difference is we would have to flag these deals somehow such that they would not get mixed with our regular day-ahead transactions that needed to be prescheduled
as far as the product language goes
i think if you add the following language to what you provided below
we should be ok
obviously subject to legal review
this product is intended to be transacted on a day-ahead basis
for delivery on a real-time basis
day ahead means the trading day prior to the day of delivery
consistent with wscc scheduling and trading practices
real-time means the actual delivery day
real-time deliveries shall be consistent with generally accepted wscc scheduling timelines and practices
take a look
give me a call
thanks
alan
you were saying we had some instructional material concerning pjm
could you provide me with a copy
thanks
you are right
there are no delivery/scheduling obligations on the day ahead dart product
unlike the regular day-ahead
yes
a dart onpeak would mean delivery on all onpeak hours for the corresponding day
and a dart offpeak would mean delivery on all offpeak hours for the corresponding day
the 0-0 is ok with me
i would like to go monday through wednesday
thanks
are you still around
hey
what's up
do you have aol chat or something
in case you don't
hey what's going on
i haven't talked with you in a long time
so i was wondering what's up with you
how's dc
how's pge
i'm doing ok
i went to europe in june
whole month
very nice
italy
switzerland
france
and netherlands
hard to come back
then i almost went to duke
but then came to agreement with enron
that was interesting
anyway
just wanted to touch base
let me know what's going on
sean
hey kevin
just wondering what the status of the dart product is
dow jones is interested as well
i really think a hourly index would be very useful
price discovery
financial positions
etc
no
good job
hey
you sound kind of bummed out there
amiga
understandable though
tough and very weird times that's for sure
very sad
the funerals must have been brutal
i know i'm depressed by it because i get these waves of sadness that hit me out of the blue periodically
hopefully things will improve
our stock has just been munched
it sucks because we're doing well
but the other
half
of the company appeared to be mostly smoke and mirrors
everyone was wondering why skilling left
i guess we know why now
enough of the gloom and doom
sounds like you are getting opportunities--that's good
i knew that you would
here's some pros/cons for your options
recalling my vast experience
structuring
interesting but not alot of dough
probably the most easily replaced by those fresh mbas
trading
like being handcuffed to a schizophrenic on speed
can turn you into a frothing mass of neurosis at times
good dough if you make it though
marketing
low immediate
constant stress
but still competitive
you have a great deal of charm and brains
so i think you would do quite well in this area
in addition
there are a number of firms
calpine
aep
coral
who are opening up an office in portland pretty much geared towards mid-marketing
might be opportunity down the road for you to move closer to home
plus you can buy me beer
which is always a plus for anyone's karma
as far as your overall attitude towards the industry
i think i disagree
i think it's a good industry to be in
particularly now
because no matter what
people need electricity
and it's still changing
especially out west
so there will be challenges and opportunities
it's great talking with you
cheer up
call your folks
run
punch a punching bag
do drugs
kidding
take care of yourself
and if you need anything
give me a buzz or drop an email
sean
deborah
i think when i
left
enron i was removed from the mailing list
so i don't get belden's general emails
thanks
wednesday or thursday around noon would be ok
sounds good
alan
there are some problems with your attachment
when are you sending this
hi there
thanks for the note
it is very weird for sure
i never thought it would happen to enron
one of the reasons i didn't go to a smaller shop
even though i was offered more money
was because i didn't want to deal with crap like this
lo and behold
life is strange
anyway
at this point it looks like dynegy is the suitor for the big e
i think it will happen
the question will become
where are we going to be located
fortunately
i only have about 0 months left in my contract
so i won't have to put up with too much crap for too long
we'll see
italy is awesome
really really is
i realize it more and more since i came back
tuscany is so cool
if you go there
go to san quirico
montecino and montepulciano
very cool little towns and good wine
florence is very cool as well
i may go back there for a month or so this june if things aren't to wacky
have a good time there
i'm envious
sounds like you are doing better
also sounds like work is fun and challenging
so do you think you are going to stay there for a while
do you miss the west
i don't think i'll live east of the rockies
but you never know
well
it looks like this year might be as interesting as last
i keep thinking things will mellow out a little
but things keep getting more and more strange
it was great to hear from you and take care of yourself
sean
thanks fran
let me know if it bogs down or anything
i'd like to get it done
there are a few others
pacificorp
puget
bpa
audrey
here is a brief personal work history
i've been in the utility industry pretty much since 0
i started trading for portland general electric in 0
i've been a trader for enron for the last 0 years
i run enron's short-term northwest book
i have market-making responsibility for the cash
balance
and prompt months for the mid-columbia and cob specifically
although i am responsible for the entire northwest
i also trade palo verde
sp0
and np0
i have recently talked with a couple of other trading outfits out west and generally the structure looks something like this
0
various bonus structures
generally with a minimum guaranteed equal to the base salary
quite frankly a move to the east coast is not very appealing
the compensation package would have to be very attractive for me to seriously consider a move to that area
if you have any questions
please let me know
thanks
sean crandall
fran
we had a problem with the pge loss return on that day
i thought we fixed it
anyway
i put in a crossdesk
deal 0
thanks
do i go and drop him off
or go
yes
it came to the office
i sent it to the yesterday
thanks
so what do you think
pretty wild
huh
miller
for the love of jesus
how are you
what's up with the layoffs
absolutely amazing
i have seen it all now
fran
due to the fact houston killed several transactions
as opposed to zeroing them out in scheduling
the real-time position manager is out of balance for december 0 and december 0 at the mid-c and cob
december 0 looks ok
this seems like an issue that houston is going to have to resolve since they know the deals that were killed
i will put the necessary interdesk swaps in on saturday
but i'm going to leave sunday and monday open at this point
if you have any questions
let me or diana know
thanks
received
diana scholtes sean crandall chris mallorey tom alonso mark fischer bill williams bob badeer matt motely mike driscoll tim belden jeff richter mike swerzbin thanks
hey there
how's it going
i understand you guys stole one of our marketers
that's ok
i'll forgive you
things are insanely boring here
basically we are in a wait mode
probably
i think
until february
this is the first time in 0 years i haven't had to worry about p&l and i have to say it's pretty weird
it's nice sleeping in though
so supposedly we have 0 potential suitors
you've probably heard of the banks
and i've also heard reliant is putting together a bid
that would be interesting
we laid off probably half the people in our office--pretty much all back office support and some conservation/renewable people
bad timing
plus
when we laid off enron broadband folks
they got a six month severance package
and ebb didn't make any money
and in fact lost a substantial amount
then enron lays off people on our floor
which has made a phenomenal amount of money
and gives them basically $0,0 taxed at 0%
life is not fair
it's going to be interesting to see what this does to the industry
i think the california debacle
then enron
now calpine
is going to create an interesting dynamic going forward
credit is going to become more and more an issue
especially towards the back of the curve
it's interesting
i remember 0 years ago the prediction was
when it was all said and done
there would be 0 big energy suppliers in the country
looks like it's heading that way
so are you going to europe
sounds like fun
if it looks like we're going to be on the sidelines for a while
i might go on vacation for a couple of weeks
maybe hawaii
well
i'm going to go grab a cup of coffee
i hope everything is well with you
take care
sean
on dec
0 crc called and wanted to resume deliveries at the mid-c
they are delivering to us
i'm assuming this is ok
let me know otherwise
sean
point buy/sale counterparty on off price deal #
they got it
yesterday i talked with chelan's trader and she informed me they regard the 0 mw we are delivering to them as a
good
contract
so long as we are able to deliver
they will accept deliveries
i'm not sure what this means in light of their termination status
but since the price is $0
i'm going to deliver until i hear otherwise
sean
alan asked me to email this to you
no
that's fine
just give me a call when you get in town to remind me
everything is fine at the townhome
it's quite comfortable
sean
i agreed with the numbers on the spreadsheet
we delivered 0 mw flat for dec 0-0
dec 0 0 mw flat
then 0 for remainder of month
too bad i didn't talk with you a little earlier
this sounds like a great job
and ultimately i would be very interested
however
i'm basically under a 0-year deal now
so i won't be available until feb
0
i'm showing we have two deals in the system under bpa contract #s 0 and 0
if there are additional transactions other than these
i need to know within the next couple of hours
sean
we've been keeping this deal in because i've been concerned about congestions at cob
i'm not concerned going into february
so this contract is out of the money for february
probably in march thru may however
if there is some reason to keep it whole
we have the length at cob
let me know what we want to do
thanks
i agree with this
here's what changes
cob
we are not going to deliver to midesto
deal # 0.0
mc
bpa deal # 0 and busbar bpa deal # 0 are cancelled
steve
please wire $0,0 to aep
same info as tom alonso's
and wire $0,0 to avista
same info that we've been using
this will take care of our northwest book of business for feb 0 through feb 0
i will send you the p&l calculation a little later
thanks sean
steve
the difference is because i rounded the purchase prices from aep and avista in the p&l spreadsheet
rather than taking a weighted average
the wire request amount is correct
that would be a
0
very cool
thank you sir
i completed mine on monday the 0th
i haven't yet
i will give him a buzz tonight
thanks steve
i think we might be interested in pursuing something
it's kind of hectic right now
so let me give you a call when things settle down a little bit
probably next week
talk with you later
i closed out our balance of february nw position
the total we pay is $0,0,0
i'll have more detail to you and thome in a minute
the one in portland

i am working with cibc on another credit mitigation deal
they are interested but they have said nothing yet on pricing levels
i am sending them something on monday that will propose a enron payment on friday december 0th of approximately $0 mm cad

this payment would come from the u.s
office so if there are any administrative things that need to get done i suggest we get on it quickly
i assume juanita needs to deal with funding and louie needs to secure a letter from cibc re credit mitigation
i'm in houston part of the week but you can track me done through my secretary

jim this information on ontario nukes is similar to our information
the only difference is that our regulatory lawyer feels that only one of the four pickering units
0 mw each
would come back in 0
although optimistic
followed by one each year after that
your report says that all pickering units would come back in 0
even in your report
however
they seem doubtful that this is realistic
the bruce units
0 mw
appear to be dead for a long time if not for good
regards
john p.s
i'll call you soon on are project
currently on hold until 0 if we decide to build in ontario

tim please add bookrunners names beside the books on your p/l

all of a sudden mark frevert asks me everyday about when we'll know about hedging re ppa's and if we can delay the auction 0 weeks
the dream is still alive
let's see my boys come through
the emmisions book under kevin mcgowan will take a one time $0 million hit today
this is to move the curves to better reflect the current market
this hit will stay in the coal group but will be removed from its p/l from a performance measurement standpoint
now that the curves are corrected i expect a focus on building our emmisions trading business in the following ways
0
understanding the fundamentals
0
taking advantage of structural shifts that we forecast
0
building more liquidity and being the primary market maker
0
developing new traders
thanks john
ron thanks for your help with my house purchase
please forwad an bill to me at enron
location eb0
kim no more salary changes without my approval
i'm just simply better than everyone else
i think we should restrict peter's memo's to 0 words or less
please advise
lavo
please excuse kim hillis and kay chapman from sap timekeeping class and provide them with the necessary tools to learn this at their desks
i understand that with this dismissal that they will be required to learn it on their own
kim hillis is currently registered for the class on thursday
june 0 and kay chapman had beverly stephens attend on her behalf
please provide them with a contact name in the event that they have any questions
this memo follows up on our discussion this morning
with respect to the 0 million of increased var that the board allocated to rick buy and jeff skilling i propose the following
0
0 million be allocated to ees and therefore remove ees's positions from the wholesale gas and power groups
this has already been done
0
move the control and decision making of 0 million of var each to the trading heads of north america
lavorato
and europe
sherriff
0
with respect to north america i intend to create a group called the
cross commodity trading group
which will warehouse the 0 million of var and use it as it sees fit
i will run this group and currently be the only employee
this will start out as an administrative structure to use if we need to throw more var at certain positions
i see the individual trading groups staying within their var limits
however
i do see the need for a true cross commodity group that would search for low risk
high probability trades accross the commodities that we trade
this structure may help to start us down this path
please let me know what you think
john
we're back baby
rick i wasn't double counting
my 0 million was the cross commodity group
i'm fine with your comments re
sherriff
rob just to clear on our conversation
i'm fine with the sunoco transaction
how is our internal trading of pjm demand going
dennis thanks for your memo outlining your positions and strategies
it was very helpful for me to understand your thought process which seems very sound
i hope to spend more time with you guys in the future
i am also working on the human resource issues you mentioned
john lavorato
dave it sounds like the urgency on the wind power decision wasn't a reality
kevin says that they are working on it
if you need me to do anything let me know
looks good to me
please do not send me these charts
chris i know i have to sign this stuff
i don't think i need the e-mails
your getting way to complicated
this product may not trade much and until it does we can do most things manually
joe a couple of questions
0
where did the gas trading p/l derive from this month
0
how are you coming on the position reports we discussed
talk to you soon
john lavorato
kathryn although we are a qualified bidder
we still have not made the decision to bid
i would try to avoid discussing but if you need to give me a call
beth please respond with a plan to solve these problems
thanks john
let me know if she doesn't solve your problems
brad can you get me a copy of the final prc results for all employees in ena
ed as well as dave's suggestions
i would like to see value per transaction which i'm told you keep track of
dave following up on our summit
i wrote down that you would follow up on the synergies or lack there of between the research group and the group run by scott tholen
i would be happy to coordinate this myself
please write back and let me know if this is okay
i have asked the crude group to give a presentation on fuel oil supply and demand which will take place wednesday july 0 at 0:0 in the big boardroom on the 0th floor
i would encourage everyone to come and bring any traders that you think would benefit from it
call me lavo
dave it looks like we hit a home run
i would like to request a temporary increase of the natural gas var limit for the next 0 business days
i suggest natural gas trading's limit increase to 0 million limit from the current 0 million limit
the floor is very bullish and we don't want to take off our west basis positions which are eating up a lot of var
please advise
this is the most bizarre resume i've seen in a long time
put all these dates on my calander
oxley and i will come up with a first stab at the option grants
john
i guess we were wrong
we were totally surprised by the a.g.a
number
we need to work on are ability to predict it
therefore
we probably net sold contracts today and will be under our 0 million limit
i don't think there is any reason to change what we did today
we will keep it in our pocket for 0 days unless you disagree
john
change the rating
john lavorato
i would love to see more detail
dave can you get one of your people to handle this
ok
rick can you include me on your distribution list re
nepool and the icap product
thanks
jeff why don't you take a stab at the disaster plan
john
ed how are you doing on these reports
figure out how to print this file on one or two pages that is readable
put this in my binder and tell him to start sending it to you
let's get this done quickly
you should tell everyone what they need to do to accomplish this
john
sorry jim but i left you a voicemail saying that there was no material loss in trading
ed set up a meeting with me and you to discuss this report
fifty dollars
it sounds like i need to clafify my plans for trading and risk management of power in ontario
0
garrett is in toronto and should be doing everything possible to try to understand all the ins and outs of the ontario power market including building forward curves
he has dual reporting to paul devries
head of the enron's toronto operation
and dana davies
head of ena power trading for the northeast u.s
dana has ultimate risk management responsibility for ontario
0
my current opinion is that we should trade ontario out of the toronto office with risk management responsibilities rolling into dana
this could always change in the future if it doesn't make sense
0
john mckay
although he has been helping bill out
will ultimately have no power trading responsibilities
0
tom may is the cash trader in n.y
reporting to dana
i expect us to use tom's expertise with respect to ontario to build up our competency there
however
toms
main role will be n.y
0
garrett should spend some time
probably soon
in houston getting to know the people and the technical resources available to him
if anyone has any questions concerns please give me a call
john
when we have made some inroads into so0 analysis please set up another meeting with me
no hurry
you guys just peeked my interest last time and i would like to continue discussions
john
i thought i would try to summarize our meeting this week and document a list of agreed apon tasks
0
the unify system is on the brink of disaster and everyone agrees that we have huge business risk if it blows up
> sally and beth are going to document the steps we are taking to maintain the system and minimize the chances of a failure
everyone understands that this is a difficult task but it sounds like it should be a high priority
0
the database to run the gas books takes way too long and is leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff
> beth is moving from sun-o-s to sun-sularis which should allow us to address the problem
we have 0 contractors working on this and we are expecting it to take 0 weeks
once this project is complete we can add hardware and reduce the time problems
0
the traders need better real time management tools that ultimately combine their physical and financial trades together and identify their real time risk
tds was a system that was built to help this however it does not meet all the traders needs
this ultimately needs to be a system that is commissioned by the traders to meet their needs
> phillip allen is going to prepare a list of trader needs in consultation with all the gas desks heads
after this beth should try to come up with a plan to get a system that meets all the traders needs
0
the power system is unstable and fails on a regular basis
this is leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff
beth has made progress in this area and we are going to monitor the improvements over the next 0 to 0 weeks to see if the improvements prove to be working
0
steve natt is going to put a plan together that meets with kevin presto's approval that addresses our needs with respect to all-requirements deals and volume management deals in the east
0
there will be no more business trips to london
somewhat kidding
0
portland has issues with speed do to the fact that we still run their books through an interface with houston
> john lavorato will talk to tim beldon and beth to determine whether its worthwile to put servers in portland
> since tim was not in the meeting
john will make sure we are covering all his needs
where did you ever get the idea for this
dave i don't think i can follow up with 0 people
please advise me if i should be handling this or your group is hadling
john
jeff please confirm that the assistants are going to the houstonian to learn how to read the screens
dave give me a call on the weekend if you get a chance
i talked to shankman and he talks about more groups going to global than i thought
like to discuss
home 0-0-0 cell 0-0-0
tony wow i don't think so
i thought i would rewrite yours and correct some of the factual errors
if you disagree please write me back
i moved from our houston office in 0 to calgary and in 0 was named president of the canadian operation
we went from a small gas marketing shop to the dominant natural gas trader and originator in canada
it was absolutely awesome
i had the time of my life
we built the business with very little supervision from houston into a major contributor to enron corp's bottom line
these days
as many people know
we are using the same trading and risk management skills that we learned in the energy business to create liquid tradable markets in bandwidth
pulp and paper
coal
and many others
so our newer people still have the chance to do what i did in canada and help build revolutionary new businesses
what a lot of people don't realize is how dominant our trading and risk management presence is in natural gas and power
the opportunities our outstanding and the challenges will test the best minds out there
these businesses are interesting and very complicated with a million different variables to figure out ranging from the weather to the levels of gas storage in montana to how to move power from new york to south caralina
you can't put gas and power on a truck or store them in a warehouse like other commodities
its not like trading bonds
where you sit around and try to figure out what the fed is going to do
it has much more complexity
and if you like trying to solve complex problems and your good at it
get down here
we need you
john's callout quote enron's not a place where you can hide
if you can't get it done you won't fit in
but if you can
and you work hard
you'll get noticed
you'll excell
you'll get paid
and we're going to love you
i think we should play on wabamun
assume we are
i was right on the legal question jeff asked
julia was wrong
she is dropping a note to skilling
you didn't attach anything
i've been assured about funding before
i would like to know what canadian vehicle they are going to use
dave what is the status
have they seen them
if they haven't i would to talk to you about it
print this in color
greg here is our info
john,dina and michael lavorato phone home 0-0-0 work 0-0-0
what type of industrial
ie chemical
fertilizer etc
ed this stuff looks good
why don't you combine all your stuff
maybe include the org chart also and see if we can get a 0 or 0 page report
send it to me and i'll run if by dave
john i asked about loss limits a couple months ago and ted said that they no longer report these numbers to the board
however
i think we should get rid of the whole concept
var is the relevant concept
please advise
i am not on side with a contract for per
please give me a call
i'm ok with this brad mcsherry

hunter shively needs doyle baughman to monitor the construction of a pipeline in the u.s
doyle has done this for us in the past
the terms of the agreement are as follows
hunter anticipates that we will use doyle for several months
we can terminate our agreement at anytime
regards
brad
thanks dave hope everything is well in london
you can call sherrif
if you need my help let me know
let's leave it for now
john
natural gas risk management requests and increase to 0 million from 0 million to increase our gas fixed price position
long
until tuesday morning
august 0th
thanks john
this looks good
don't worry i will definately call if i want something
no storms in sight
so do we have emmisions
brian sorry i didn't get back quickly
you need to tell me what the premium translates into from a dayrate perspective
in addition
i thought you were going to write an outline of what they would try to do in the next little while
ie how much one way exposure
this way i don't have to get involved in every deal until they prove to me that is big enough to allocate a risk manager to the market
sorry
a hurricane off africa
i think you will have a good tail wind when you are leaving
please put the new hire thing at the doubletree on monday on my schedule
thanks for the update and keep up the good work
ees is trading them up
give me a call
fine
i think shankman wants me to go to this
if this is true please put it on my schedule
kevin is this the guy you are interviewing
i haven't seen an e-mail
make sure this is on my schedule
hey greg
if you ever are in houston again give me a call
i want to talk to you about the order stuff in the second version of
i can't seem to print this
can you try
please give me a call this week i need some info
david when you get back
hopefully in one peice
can you take care of my moving expenses and the gross up issue
thanks for the increased var
we got it right this time
rick i would like to request an extension of the 0 million limit until friday
we like gas and we would like to maximize this move
the ppa auction is going along well i think
we are leading on sundance b and have been for 0 rounds now
some weird things are occuring so it is too early to tell what will utimately happen
the government has said that it will move to the third and final stage of the auction in the morning
we would be estatic if people continue to leave us alone on sundance b
currently we are bid $0,0,0 canadian and a swap price of 0.0 cad
but again its too early to get our hopes up
does this mean that we have no var limit during this time
we should be getting gas fax
that's great
please don't let len delay
dave is there a round 0 of raptor and is beau canada going into it
just to be clear
there will be no re-allocations of analysts and associates from ena to global products
what have you been smoking
make sure we don't lose these two to jeff
call celeste and tell them that we have place them in gas
i talked to whalley about it a little bit
the one issue is that when we liquidate a bad position they get out first
think about it
mark we can make this even simpler
all broker trades are confirmed the next day
we would only need to record trader deals when they deal direct which is rare and all marketer deals
if we do this we might consider keeping the tapes for a longer period because only the confirming part would be on tape
please advise
i really think we can do this more systematically
give me a little time
ie
trust me i'm the godfather
dave i hate to make the management committee too big but how about scott tholen
he is very high quality
can you please help greg get this info
i have to think that we have this info somewhere
a couple questions
do i need to do anything next wednesday or will money just hit my accout
will you pay the contractor and if so why is len wong involved
john
chris ask dave he is still the king of your world in my mind
tim given the tight schedule
lets try to find a half and hour for me to sit in front of all of the traders at once
john
ok i think 0 days a year is fair
per i misplaced your emain on the funds
can you resend it please
thanks john
beth i'm wondering if you are done are close on the systems plan
i am getting on a plane early monday afternoon
i would love something to review even if it is not complete
thanks john
get chris abel on my schedule early monday
also can you make sure that i have a computer set up for me in portland and calgary and that it gets me into my network
i especially need to be able to get into the executive reports
dave we need to think about trying to get more var for the gas floor before all these other commodities go to the board and scare the hell out of them
i have several reasons for this so lets discuss
0 million
pan nat gas purchase from duke
contract allows for price determination
0 million
tolls risk associated with pgt transport that expires in 0
0 million
index risk at chicago as a result of the peoples transaction i'll call you later today
we won a ppa in alberta
we will know for sure on thursday when the government declares the auctin a success or not
it is highly like that it will be a success
please direct all detailed questions through derek davies in canada
xxxx xxx
if this is ok with you its ok with me
paul the fellow in andea reed's group is all yours
p.s
how is our trade coming along
phillip allen will put 0 million in schedule c reserve on august 0rd and mike grigsby and kieth holst will put 0 million each on august 0th
change holst and grigsby to 0 million and 0 million
help
dave try to make sure that my assigned guys get significant roles
make sure they are interviewing on campus
ps herdon is a director not vp
that's fine by me
sorry vince i have been out of town
please give me a call tomorrow
i think i know what this e-mail is about
looks good to me
john lavorato
i would like to see the resumes
should the cap affect the marginal price of power in ontario
this e-mail is kind of funny
can i please see the resumes
i keep hearing that mcsherry is gone yet his xxxxxx name keeps coming up
the commercial support people that you and hunter want to make commercial managers
i've told presto to relax 0 times
just deal with me on this one
i'm in vegas this weekend
want to come
p.s
we should play soon i have averaged 0 in my last 0 rounds
good job
wes are we allocating people like research out to the various wholesale groups
john
fletch make sure they also set up the fixed price vs
daily term swaps at henry the hub
fyi
see below
belden is the king
looks great
i think we should have a least 0 or 0 real time traders in calgary
dave as part of the info you should put together i thought it would be good to have the historic head count
for 0-0 years
by month and by level to try to get a sense of how many people we hire
might even need the number of hires and fires/resignations
my thought is to try to figure out how difficult it would be to have a few committees to interview candidates before offers would be made
beth get me that new list as soon a possible
john
why is milnthorp doing a u.s
school and i thought i was doing mit
aslo where all my traders that i assigned
was greg onside with this stuff
give me a call
rick i thought i would give you an update on what i am doing from a systems perspective
i'm trying to get a systems plan together from beth
we simple do not have one
from there i will coordinate with traders and back office to try to create a plan that everyone can by off on
my new motto is
systems will be fixed or people will die
i will keep you informed
john
can i also get a copy of his resume
i know you are screwing with me
if you are not
no
my opinion is that you need a budget
eric the contact names are listed at the bottom of this message
please call if you have questions
just say that i said that you did a great job
no
mike can you live with the gas position reports
john
no
hi nana its micael
no changes
no to nelson and i'm ok with scott but i would like to hear the figures
make sure the benson's of the world who don't read their e-mails read this
please give mike grigsby access to the basis position reports and the fixed price position reports for gas
let me sit on that because scott's performance has not been as strong as hunter and fletch's
rick buy i'm expecting more details from bill re
perry gas but i'm quite pissed about this
i will deal with my traders when i have the details
on the retail side
i think this is the problem in trying to set up a separate wholesale trading group in retail which is clearly happening
this wouldn't of happened it they were trading through us
call me about this
peter deal with joe deffner directly
i threatened his life if we don't pay them in time
rob can you make sure that the toronto office is not blowing their minds on costs
fine do it quickly
talk to fletch about progress
get me info on this
good job on this
tim there is absolutely a spot for john
maybe he should give me a call or even come an see me
why don't you talk to him and also i would love your thoughts on what the best role for him would be
can you send the contract to me
i guess this one went out before me
hoyt did you get me response on martin
i don't but i need a golf shirt
just kidding
change it to 0 and 0 on long term comp and ignore the bonus target and send it back to me
i will forward it to belden with a note
thanks
we got it covered
it was my fault
you should include vp's and also you should make it a little clearer that i don't want to be on the schedule unless they have made a decision
you missed logistics as a rotaion
also
let's leave out where they graduate to
this might be an issue with the aa program if we say that they are going to re-enter the program
david i quess this whole nelson ferries contract thing started before me
however
i can't imagine that we can retract on it
please advise
gas var
gas var
futures accounts
hoyt the zufferli stuff seems like it is getting a little confused in canada
they might need to change his contract to canadian language but none of the terms should change including the end date except for his agreed upon canadian $ pay
so i guess dave doesn't want to send this out
i hope the data on these performance reviews is wrong
i think we need 0% of reviews done
do you agree
yes call me
colleen i have no idea what my intent is
i was trying to get more info so that i could evaulate things
this may mean that i do nothing from a valuation perspective
get on my schedule
just wondering if i am going to take the same fate as keith
kim have you called nigel and told him about the interviews
greg thanks for taking the time to interview nigel
if you like him please sell him hard on
i having second thoughts about raising south american limits
if its not too late and if i have a vote give me a call
did you get me the performance review forms
beth can you get me an updated list of projects by october 0th
can we put something into our trading system where it would stop us from entering a counterparty in if we were full on credit
this could help the communication problem that currently exists on companies like perry gas
please advise
i know that you'll give me hell for this but i'm out of town for my sister-in-law's wedding that weekend
john
i guess i'll let this one slip through
charlene just a comment
i would love to facilitate a couple decision meetings when i'm in town
i not sure i know who david jallits is
i hope you are talking to phillip to get you system needs as part of this project
i guess we will just go without a contract
bill scott neal talked to someone who said that we could do this
please call scott
i thought you hated getting involved
just kidding
congrats
i'm sensing that you don't have much to do during the day
i'm thinking about inviting mark waldren down at the same time

in case you guys want to go to a nice place to eat you might want to bring some casual pants but for the most part jeans should be fine
i'm okay with this
i do not run ees trading
i would contact marty sunde with respect to big costs that ees wants to spend
marty runs ees north america
i agree with you however that they should't go crazy on spending
saturday 0 my course

i would like to set a deadline of november 0th to have a plan on all north american projects
i'm ok if fundementals groups are excluded
that is signed off on by commercial
sally's world
and beth's world
when i say signed off i mean that i want signitures on a piece of paper that everyone is onside with the plan for each project
if you don't agree don't sign
if certain projects
ie
the gas plan
are not done yet then lay out a timeframe that the plan will be complete
i want much more in the way of specifics about objectives and timeframe
thanks for everyone's hard work on this
john

as requested
can we do it without the bonus target

billy what has this recent rally done to our exposures
cnr must be huge
the model looks great except when i changed an input and hit go it blew up
maybe i'm doing something wrong
one thing that i would like changed is that i want to make the swap product and product that settles against the 0nd last day
so the role should happen on the second last day not the last day
please change that if you can

thanks john
dave i think overdyke is still working on the peaker insurance deal
he has per on the road working on it
we probable should tell him that we don't have anymore unless new albany is enough
book this deal very conservatively
ie
set the curve so you pay credit reserve but show no income
we will discuss in 0
john
that would be outsanding
dave i agree with all your points
there had to be a first time
i've been blowing ted off because of the markets last week
let's get together this week with ted and discuss the future
kim please set up meeting with ox and bland and me
anthony thanks for the email
however
that was the last thing that i received
i think some credit intermediation would be helpful
print all these resumes for me
kim please print all these resumes for me
can't seem to find this
john
hickerson always claims that they have var by trader
new england +0 0/0 jets +0 0/0 and over 0 0/0 tease as discussed

charlene my gut tells me that some of these folks we are hiring don't fit that well with the current strategic direction of enron
although i'm sure they are very high quality individuals
if its not too late
i wonder if we should slightly scale back the number of associates that we are attempting to hire
i'm not sure that dave and i need that many individuals that are focused on international business
regards john
wes can you tell me how many enron entities are members of the aga
american gas association
the fee is 0k and i think hpl is a member and not us
but i wonder if some of our other piplelines are members
vince where did this resume come from and is he still employed by the national bank in monteal
print all these resumes for me
kim please print all these resumes for me

john

sheila can take the current spreadsheet attached and add the origination prc resuslts under the proposed cash bonus categy

this is a great first step in our ultimate goal
for the seven names that were not on the spreadsheet
can you fill in all info like the others for them including who they work for and get it back to me promtly
thanks
i thought i was very clear that we are not publishing anything internally about california gas prices
the pain will stop soon
through the course of the year 0 people have been identified by east power as the key to their real time group
no request will be granted on an emergency basis but will go through the usual process of getting facts and checking with me
another thing is that i don't know why we are not doing these things in conjunction with prc so late in the year
same a mid year i'm smarter than everyone else
just in case * managed a trading group that is up 0 billion
more if you included hits taken
probably not due to me
* left a lot of money in canada
some is still there
* led the ppa deal
which i will resign and buy personally if you want to turn it back
* created the gas fundamentals group which every business unit is copying
* came up with ltp which everybody hates but will fix our trader shortage in the future and every company is copying
* trained many great young kids in calgary that are now key players in houston
* created structure and communication around our system strategy
brought traders
it
and back office together to create a plan that everyone has bought into
the future success is unclear but the exercise was very worthwhile
* had very few var violations and helped improve our understanding and reporting of var
completed mended the relationship between gas trading and the risk group
* should get most credit for the increase in power trades on eol and the continuation of the increase in gas
* turned the east power group into a focused trading group not a think tank that bets on july-aug power price
still nowhere near completion
* put a halt on the hiring of unqualified people
have spent many hours devising a plan to bring in qualified
experience people
you will see this implemented in 0
* experimented with the
pay prc
which i think was very successful
i think this will start our organization to think a little differently and hopefully in a way that will benefit us
* possibly the best accomplishment is
killing the dragon
i'm glad you made me write this list down because for the first time in months i realized that i was smiling while i was writing
regards john
the pain will stop soon
i wanted to thank you guys for all your support over the last painful week
although i am definately not getting brave
i would like to request an extra 0 million for gas for the next week
the price levels are making it hard to eliminate risk
i can give you my assurance that any increase in var day to day will come from price movement
not increase in position
let me know john

john
john i don't see maggie's line on the p/l
tim give me a call on this i don't understand
john
dave i'm not sure milly can escape this
john
we absolutely should do this
we shouldn't necessarily not get paid
there are many different type of outsourcing structures that we have used
brooklyn union peoples
laura luce my experience have been only positive when we have been able to get very close with a customer
money will show up
however
if we do operations/accounting stuff for them we should get paid
your employees will be upset to leave canterra
hunter did you know that the extrinsic value of the northern border trasport from ventura to chicago has increase from 0.0 million to 0 million over two months
i would love to play 0 or 0 games

christina and joe congrats
i'm very happy for you guys
we have been out of touch for way too long

stacey assuming this p/l is going to stay at 0
get the line item off the dpr
chris presto got some info the calpine got a great price on their power sale to california
are we negotiating with california and will they agree to credit terms that we like
it seems like we are going to sell to someone who is going to sell the california
if this is true we should evaluate the margin vs the credit and legal risks
print them out i will do them by hand
tim i still don't see and origination line on the reports
give me a call because i really want this to happen
john
thanks peter hey did mungo or mongo are whatever the hell it is buy my house
we need to talk for like 0 hours
let's schedule some time
what happened with arcor
where are you
i hear your already living the new life
sick last week
vacation this week
buying land in colorado next week
you were supposed to pair me down at the top not the bottom
so i knew that you were going make some money last week off my positions but wow
just kidding
sounds great
dave i think we are going to go back to the original pebble plan
the 0th to the 0th
tych and calger are o.k
with this
there is a small chance that i will have to cancel or come back saturday night but what the hell
let me know if you can do this and we will all attempt to arrange transportation
john p.s
sorry for the confusion
your continuing to kill me
is that how you spell continuing
although i haven't heard from dave i'm trying to change my flights to march 0

i'll work up some paper
john
talk to louise
i told you that pope and milly wouldn't last
please get someone to deal with this
derek your in on pebble if you want
i guess i must stop calling you master dorland
the east power traders have agreed to post their two ways on eol for ees
janet
you might want to help speed up the administrative process
it should be minimal effort
do we need any help on the ontario front from lay or skilling
given the size of the stakes
i could definately justify their time
your pan nat summary was not clear enough to pass on to my supervisors
can you simplify it a little more
thanks
so are you in or out
oh god is there an agenda
would dinner thursday work instead
your buddy beau invited me
how about prior to that or after that on tuesday
chris set up a time to go through pastoria with me
rob is the deal actually signed
set me up
i look forward to the updated supply demand analysis
john
done
no but we need to solve this quick because a lot divided by three is more than a lot divided by four
another math tip from lavo
rob i'm going to get on ken lay's schedule in the next couple of days
assuming he'll let me
i'll ask him his advice about our deregulation strategy in general and talk to him about his visit
i'm concerned that hoards of people from houston will show up and that it will be a cluster
can you send me an email with some key facts about our deals
p/l impact of opening and the market in genereal
also the history of dereg and the dates they have missed and why for my ken meeting
write it in bullet point format and quite summarized
i working on it
scott tholan reports to greg whalley
i got the rest covered
it's more related to the size of this transaction and the fact that the transport model apparently doesn't calc var
i have no fundamental concerns but this one hit me from left field
on our other issue
i working on getting something in front of you this week
bob
please increase kim hillis
my assistant
email file
kim often receives mail files on my behalf and needs the additional space to receive this mail
chris on the california deal
can we possibly get the right to kill the deal 0 months from now if they do not get some credit support
we may not exercise the option anyway
however
it would be nice to have especially if you could get it for free
john
maybe you can have a diesal position
if you can justify it to me and rick buy
talk to shankman and see who in his organization runs that product
i need you to leave me alone for a week
kim can you set up a phone interview with this guy next week
no
i would like to talk about dana
can you a oxley recommend a contract to me
do not mention it to dana
there seems some confusion about the
amps
project
this project continues to be an enron north america project
where's my index
here goes tych owes wes 0 ox owes wes 0 ox owes me 0 dave owes me 0
this could be very dangerous
opg controls all the megawatts
they could set the price high and we wouldn't have the ability to do anything about it
if you could use british energy and get some deal done with opg to hedge us maybe we would for a few months
ignore frank
i don't want you guys trading power right now but that might change soon
put this in my central desk binder
gas
this goes in the second coverless binder we created
get you not me on the distribution list
dave that sounds reasonable
however
i am looking at taking a different tract
ie
going without orders and being a merchant company rather than an engineering company
this has several issues especially capital but we are evaluating it over the next 0 weeks
i will keep you posted
ps that's the longest email i've ever written
kim same deal as the legal memo stuff
take the gloves off
tim
it doesn't need to hit the dpr
mike's job is not to respond to rfp's
if this isn't working then it means that there wouldn't have been agreement over money at the end of year
which is another problem
finally
i could of paid mike half of what i paid him and he would still be sitting in his seat
he needs to figure out a way to be a team player and build the business
we're not trying to build stat oil here
if we don't reward our originators properly
we won't have any
having said all that
if your marketers want to go back to the old system and risk getting underpaid
maybe that's the best answer
call me
print and put in my inbox
is the paper done
still don't know what project maple leaf is
john lavorato 0 mercer st
houston tx work 0-0-0
are we missing one
wayne if michael moutlon wishes to pay for this i'm o.k
with it
the memory business was never sponsored by north america
please get michael to send me an e-mail acknowleding that he well pay
thanks john
you don't need presto
it's administrative and has nothing to do with him
i thought eric was gas
depending on the cost profile we would probably still do this
the question is do you buy options on sites
buy sites
and whether or not you pursue permits
sounds fine
i haven't seen the latest agenda for ken
louise i'm in toronto with lay on april 0th
you should attempt to go to this
john
dave can you follow up on this
they forgot one
ya
i agree
having some trouble because dave wants ees on your floor giving you no room to grow and i'm fighting that
anyhow
soon
we don't need the currency or mmbtu/gj conversion language if gas daily agrees to what we want
dave when is the gas daily meeting
i would like to attend
i think i could help with the pitch
pete you might want to spend more time on cuiaba
i assume your aware that we are putting all aspects of the project into the accrual bucket including the stuff we once marked
john
print and put in my inbox
print and put in my inbox
i'm in brazil returning that night
you can decide if you can reschedule or not
john sent me the index
get him to send it to you
tammy check into this
if these were index trades they should be in our physical volumes not financial
i mentioned it to jeff breifly and i will re-mention it on the plane
i think it is higher than 0 million
kent castleman knows the details
john
wes i'm away monday and tuesday in brazil
i thought i would give you things that i'm waiting on or that we should meet about next week
0
your group was going to give back the assets/balance sheet stuff in 0 formats
0
on south america
lot's of stuff but we'll talk when i get back
most importantly that i get an income statement that looks like north america
they did a trade with me that's up 0 million for them
this is fine but the negative p/l was not showing up in n.a
the positive p/l was showing up in south america
we should make sure this trade does not get cash settled
the last thing i want is cash going to s.a
on an internal trade
0
cross commodity book
i have 0.0 million of losses that were last year that they found in january
put this in the tbg line and change the line name to other
in the footnotes we will explain all others
i'm sure there is a million things to come
0
we also need to improve the footnotes section you gave to me
0
i've set up a meeting with you,me,deffner and louise on this 0% capital charge
we should come up with another methodology
that's all i can think of now
john
has an agreement been reached between south america and north america on the turbine
or is north america waiting for final approval of its power plant
what happened to dona francisca
mark you still own me you expected values for pan nat
i've allowed one person to enter enron america into jacoby's group from broadband
we need to be very selective because broadband and ees will have people who will be put into redeployment
i expect louise or i to approve any employee who enters enron america
i will accept no exuses if someone slips in
milly this looks good especially if you get harris
what do they want me to be part of if anything
i was assuming the breakfast and the lunch and hopefully the meeting with harris
can you let me know so i can set up my schedule
i would like to go see the toronto office and also get some personal time in
thanks john
can you get me julie's presentation
i'm in toronto on april 0th and may be able to come to n.y
however i would want to know how many meeting you would want me to attend and the message you would want sent if any
unfortunately
my time is unbelievably tight
i can't assure you yet that i can make it
but i would like to try
wes with respect to the ppa reserve
we need to adjust the usd reserved based on the currency
we decided not to hedge the currency when we took the reserve
its hard to make an objective decision on whether this is correct or not
however
the currency was 0.0 cad to 0 usd when we did it and now 0.0 cad to 0 usd so the reserve would be 0.0 usd not 0
we should just adjust this weekly or monthly
dave i thought we were hiring 0 person from ebs not two
william abler was ranked as a strong director
i will agree
but i hope the quality is as high as you think
we are going to get tones of resumes from ees and ebs
if your going to blow all you bullets upfront
make sure your getting great people
some guy at duke told mark frevert today that on march 0th
duke won a court ruling saying that they expanded the scope of the pannat arbitration
true
mark we get a much different story from our appointed arbitrator for pan nat
although the main arbitrator did not do exactly what we wanted he had strong words to duke that they had no support for their position
we would like to ignore their pleas to settle because they have been making very unreasonable settlement offers
as we understand it arbitration starts july 0
i'll talk to you more next week
if you want an update prior call richard sanders
john
as you would say
there is good news and bad news
the good
we got the dining room chair
the bad

specifically it has two arms but the chair that broke has no arms
good luck john
test

i would love to meet with you and i'm sure louise would too

after a great deal of work the canadian team has renewed our outsourcing arrangement with petrocanada for another 0 years
this was a great accomplishment for enron canada
the logistics
accounting and commercial execution over the last 0 and 0/0 years played a key role in extending this deal
john
ya
we're in
were you a guest speaker
blow me
thanks for your help on this
hi john i think we should kill the concept of cross calibrating analysts and associates accross business units

let me know if you disagree
john

greg our copel shares are falling in value

give me a call to discuss
john
tim you will get stopped out
i talked to david port today because last year we spent a lot of time cleaning up gas var and now we must spend the time fixing power var
however
until its fixed i have no choice but to use the reported numbers
wes can you call milly and explain the facts of life to him
i don't want to talk to you
talk to tim and kevin
dave this is the format i want
can you have someone check the data and then print and deliver a color copy to me and louise today

john

first i heard about this
love dceg
let's just leave the prudency stuff unhedged for now
mark make sure you are allocating these expenses to ees
cliff good luck and more importantly
have fun
thanks again for bringing me down here to compete with the big dogs
i think i've survived so far
dave i changed it slightly so i could sleep at night
the top line is just a little joke from me to you
let me know
no
we have been assigned 0 new associates
0 new anaysts
0 summer associates and 0 summer analysts from the incoming class
please let me know your needs with respect to numbers
louise and i will then decide if we agree and then we will create a process to pick from the ones we have assigned to us
i'm assuming that calgary
toronto and portland have done their own thing and don't need any of these people
let me know if this is incorrect
if you received this and you report to someone else on this list
ie
you don't report to the office of the chair
please cooridinate your needs with your supervisor
please respond prompty
john
hello everyone
in december we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility
louise and i would like to get everyone together offsite
probably in late june
once louise is back from holiday
just kidding
i think it's time to go have a little fun with the group driving enron's success
i would like suggestions as to
0
where to go
0
what should be the focus of the business meetings
0
should we have business meetings or should we do something else
ie
climb a mountain
i'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain
0
and any other ideas you have
in addition i would like to start having staff meetings about once a month
the first one will be friday may 0th at 0:0 p.m
please add this to your schedule
i have invited everyone who has p/l responsibility
portland
calgary and toronto will have to be on video or phone conference
regards john
we were thinking of having another interview session for the trading tract later this month
i've been screening outside resumes but internally we haven't received many suggestions from each of you about other people already at enron
if you think anyone could qualify send the name to karen buckley
if we don't have enough candidates
we will wait until the new analysts and associates arrive and do a session then
seemed to want to trade equities
yes
sorry
ok i've added them
forward the email's for me
it would be helpful to our corporation if you would try to hire some of your staff from places other than enron north america
thanks john
do you have an extra raquet
please print this for me
i'll never be able to print
phil are we allowed to attend
can we send an analyst
i asked everyone for their a/a needs and received very little feedback
please respond promptly
thanks john
please let kim hillis
my assistant
know about all the ees meetings planned for this week
i'm going to try to attend
can i get an updated contract status report
if he is the wellhead book
yes
hi we are getting in several anylysts and associates
new hires
in the next few months
we also have interns coming for summer only
do you need any
can you use interns or does the training out weigh the benefits
john
i just need numbers
dave i booked a time for 0:0 on sunday
i can't play because its mothers day and i would get killed
use the time if you want or get kay to cancel it
your call
just do it quick
did you blow up my south america deal yet
i'm prettry pumped about losing 0
wes is going to tell me in the morning if he is coming with us to steel town
go mario
joe i once again asked about the committee
i think skilling
delainey and kean set up the committee and i'm told that there are going to be no changes
you and i will need to go over your vice presidents prior to the meeting
john
can i get that prc list from you when its on one page
i told miller that you and him should sit down and discuss the ppa
yes
take a two week vacation
let's make sure that presto
tycholiz
whitt
lucci
kerigan
and proffit are either signed or will never sign by the end of this month
no
i thought rogers signed a long time ago but check with oxley
yes
you can pick
this is pretty sensitive stuff
we should talk about whether we need to distribute it at all and if so who should get it
i have no ideal why heizenrader is getting it
can we get more critical mass
our portland guys
ie wolfe
might have some montana counterparts
i would offer him the initial contract assuming its what i think it is
i know that we have base salary issues that we would have to deal with
i basically told everyone to drop it when mike proposed his numbers
again
the offer to you and him were not meant to be insulting but meant to offer something a year early as we did with a handful of other folks
we naively thought that these would be accepted quickly
for everyone else that got offered a re-up a year early
they did exactlty that
let me know if you want to discuss it further
what's up ross
to your questions
yes to houston yes to enron almost to running the company although i'm thinking about demoting myself
i miss trading
married
one child
0 0/0 michael
give me a call if your in houston and we'll have a few drinks
john lavorato president and chief executive officer enron americas
from the gas and power side
we wouldn't need any traders in montreal
but perhaps some marketers
paul devries in toronto runs our eastern canada operation if you would like to talk to him
john
i'm confused by this one
who in ena is bidding this stuff and did we know about the balancing
0 million
is this back money or forward money
why did the volumes change so much
we should have room on 0
check and see if arnold has redone the floor plan
you need to keep this away from fred's group
i would suggest locating near gas structuring
ed mcmichael
the head of gas structuring can be a big help
accounting lists the high prob
q0 deals for my budget meeting with whalley
currently you have one deal on it that is dwr and it says 0 million
could you please make sure the commication with accounting is taking place
john
brett have you heard of a deal called camargo correa
its listed as a high probability deal for q0 with 0.0 million of origination
i'm talking to dave about hughes reporting to sally
they don't need to even check the bill
they can have a customer service group and if the customer calls the customer service group can deal with our guys
john
fyi
i ask again
who in ena did the deal
hello everyone
aep has been very cooperative with us when we have posted numbers in error on eol
please extend them back the favor if an issue comes up on their side
also please e-mail me if an issue comes up
thanks john
wow
where are we at with the contracts for this month
it would be helpful to have the cases below 0
i'm not sure that we have enough candidates to bother
i don't want mark to market i want accrual
thanks aint technology great
i understand you owe jean 0.0 million this week
please make sure it's paid
just use mids on the day they were pulled
management sucks
i'm definately not going to support you on this
just kidding
call me about the dynegy thing i have an idea
have we sold any copel shares yet
have you told hickerson to sell
rob and john we sorted out ngx today
our data will be ready by the end of june for them to start including it on july 0st
the 0 day settlement issue is another whole issue
on wednesday we will be having a mini trading track interview session
the quality may not resemble the first session we had but i thought it would be worth it if we can find a couple more folks to put in the program
we will probably have a much bigger one later in the year after the new analysts and associates join
i had a couple of observations from last time
0
i think we were too hard on external candidates
there are 0 or 0 external candidates
remember that they don't have the enron grounding that the internal candidates have
most of them are not in the gas or electricity industry
try to evaluate them on their intrinsic qualities
0
some people have not thought about trading concepts and are unfamiliar with trading lingo
that doesn't mean that they will not be good traders one day
i think we were a little biased based on someones ability to run a stack tommorrow
regards john
this week or next week
this is bizzare
global markets promised jean this money and won't seem to write her a check
it was also a low number relative to what was created for gm
john
i don't need to see him
rick i would like to make the temperary var permanent
i would give most to gas and some to power
i feel like its the best place in the company for it
please let me know
john
there should be an appetite for increasing overall risk at enron
delainey and i started initial discussions reguarding ees and the customers and products they plan to market
these were initial discussions
dave is writing something up to send to me
before i agree on anything i will talk to all of you
some of the meeting that are happening may be a little premature
john
i'm getting really really tired
if the company's intent is for me to just run a trading operation let me know
kevin i'm meeting with dick and mike at 0 and 0 this morning
i'll let yoy know if there are any problems
0
how much is reuters paying us
0
what is you decorators number
good
this person hasn't found a violation in a year
i find that hard to believe
i wish i could help
my thoughts are the same
you should stay in canterra
we can squeeze way more desks on that floor and i'm sure you can boot someone out below or above over the next couple of years
given the experience with the walls i would stick to your day job
just talked to shapiro
he wants lay
alex and me in the meeting
i of course was fighting alex
i'm okay with lay meeting other people while he is in town
shapiro said he would get alex working on the talking points
you and devries should spend time on them before they come to me
not that i know of
great
is this in nevis
call me on this
fun fun fun
this 0k came from about 0 mw
i'm not sure
if we didn't sell any elp shares over 0 yet i'm taking over the execution
done 0:0 at the houstonian
see you there
i thought you would find this funny
hi my name is joooohhhn lavorato from tarona canada
how the hell are you guys
where the hell are you guys
call me
i'm still an enron hack
can you guys please have all your curves set by 0:0 calgary time
as well as kathy
a lot of houston bookrunners are having late hours due to the lack of discipline in setting canadian curves
thanks john
greg do you agree with the notes below
john
i think we are going to pass
no one needed for the prc
jaime williams and steve irwin are co leads
wait until louise gets back
these should not be big
ie 0 and 0 at most
i'm not even sure that irvine is the right guy in the end
if the gas isn't going into jackson
where is it going
i guess they have signed quite a few deals
rock on
just so you know
i've talked to zufferli
cowan and lambie this week
i'm working on it
joe first of all
blow me
second
my wife is expecting in early november so i might be able to slip away in september
i would vote for anything that would require one flight from houston
i'm sure rich would agree
ie
timmins would be tough
i would love to join you all and get mocked for an entire weekend
or lavo as the hacks down here call me
i put it on my schedule for july 0th
please call me the week before
my schedule is a little crazy
go ahead and schedule the meeting
just go ahead and talk to dave about the other industries
they are working quite a complex tax structure in canada
i'm not sure what role i should play
should i just assume that they know what they are doing and let them do whatever they want sort of like the finance guys do with our balance sheet or should i get involved
my first take was that this was way too good to be true
john
jeff sorry it took so long to respond
i talked to our eol guys and they keep this stuff very close to their vest
people are talking to us about buying the code but this would cost tens of millions of dollars
so i don't think i can help
sorry john
you should use 0 c0 with that many people
give me a couple of days please
stan i haven't heard from the fellow from el paso
yes i want to move next weekend
if we can start at 0 pm on friday it would be fine
big commission
kevin can you settle this guy down
as well as always whining about his fake trading account
he wants to accellerate out of real time early
tell him to do his time and learn
also he wanted to go to harry's group next which is a mistake
he needs to learn the business not the derivatives
john
chapter 0
public relations
go down the employee list from highest to lowest paid
when you get to someone that makes under 0 k per year make them enron americas public relations person
please keep this to yourself
sally beck will meet with you guys this week about having logistic leads for your respective regions reporting to you'all
let me know how it goes
greg this list is virtually final
any changes will not be material
i think you should add louise in the 0-0 level
i'll call you later
i guess our confirm group shouldn't be worried
thanks for your help dorie
i met with el paso
the just got a $0 billion financing in brazil and i think they really want to buy electrobolt
working it
does this sound right bill
tych
we are not below bbb
can your respond to me so i can respond to clayton
i just noticed this
i would support gorte
he is a reasonable guy despite what you guys think of rac
can we do this in conjunction with rick
stan i met with el paso yesterday
they seem very interested
thanks
thanks laura
thanks kyle
i'm hoping that port can't find me in the new building
0 day or 0 day for hub cash
can you actually desribe in detail the book out trade
term/price/location
just send me an email

we can include the sithe agreement in the master netting agreement although we do not believe that this will work for dynegy as it is not a forward contract but an annuity stream which cannot be accelerated
however if they think it works
fine
we would not want the margin calculated net
it needs to be exclusive of this transaction
if they were to convert to two swaps in order to allow for acceleration in the master netting agreement
there is an accounting issue for us

0 or 0
or some other number
kay

this email explains why jeff and i tried calling you this am
any comments
thanks
kay
what issues were invented
some thoughts
observations
suggestions
0
advantages to the single contract
don't need a consolidation agreement
so we don't have to negotiate one
better from a liability standpoint
easier to administer
is there any reason we can't go with a single contract
i'm working with steve on the letter agreement
0
assignment to mitsui steve is confirming payment issues
and ability to comply with ge's requested payment within 0 days of executing the contract
this means that the assignment and assumption needs to be executed contemporaneously with the ge contract
i have a call in to rob stevens to verify
in stan's absence
peggy is checking on this
also
0
parent guaranty
ge is requesting an enron parent guaranty
from a quick review of the draft contract
it appears that a change in language will be necessary
since the current version only requires a parent guaranty in the case of an assignment to a certain class of assignees
if i am correct
then i suggest consider inserting new language that the parent guaranty will be due 0 days after execution of the contract
so that mitsui can provide the guaranty
if necessary
kay
fyi
i faxed it to david
originals being sent to you
hi jeff
i'm preparing the letter agreement regarding payment
can you help me with the name and address to use
thanks
kay
i did not authorize anyone to initial any version of the document
fyi
i'll send a copy of the executed original change order once i get it
kay
evidently ge feels that we already have an agreement based on something brian signed before the agreement was reviewed/approved by tax and legal
the internal process is not working
kay
hi charlotte
we are going to the astro's game tonight
so it would be very easy for one of us
probably neil
to pick michael up at your place
probably after 0
is that ok with you
thanks
kay
hi kathy
i neglected to keep a hard copy
please send hard copies of the change order to
brian hulse
carl tricoli
and me
if you prefer
you can just fax it back
and i will send it to the ena folks
thanks
kay
hi brian
could you email me the mou we are terminating
thanks
kay
if someone can tell me which ena lawyer worked on it
i'll track it down
the collective memory at ena is that there wasn't an mou per se
just the assignment and assumption agreement
kay
they came by and gave me the data dump
it filled in the picture very well
thank you
that would be helpful
kay
here's the latest from ge
when i spoke to rob stevens
he had a question about whether mitsui needed to review the final drafts of the ge agreements
i don't know the resolution of that issue
as you know
the current arrangement with ge requires payment within 0 days of signing of the contracts
which means we have to be prepared to assign the contract
then wire the money from eeim to mitsui immediately so that mitsui can pay ge
and ge can refund ena
has eeim been funded yet and has mitsui bought in on the payment plan
i do not know the status of the tax issues raised by jeff
i would also like to make sure that jeff agrees with the mechanism of superseding the prior agreement with ge
kay
fyi
congrats on your new baby
kay
i hope that spelling your name correctly will help this get through to you
kay
accomplishments
i haven't jumped out the window yet
or slapped/cursed anyone from any other enron entity
this is significant in a way that not all would understand
vision
values
my other significant accomplishment was the lm 0 deal
revising the structure
figuring out how to sell the westlb stuff to ge/s
s
and closing it in a relatively short period of time
more to come
as for vacation
i'll scatter some days off here and there
but i don't have any plans for consecutive days off
kay
fyi
talking tomorrow am is fine
i have a 0 conference call on another matter
otherwise
i'm open
i've made some changes
which i thought i would circulate internally for comment before sending to ge
i left jeff smith a voice mail asking how the initial payment is supposed to be split between the on and offshore contracts since this document references payments to both
comments
kay
i've made a couple of changes
including changes suggested by jeff blumenthal
main difference is title/risk of loss language and definition of
the agreement
since we don't have an mou
kay
my only comment is that the word
lease
should be deleted from the heading in paragraph 0 of the assignment agreement
kay
gracie
this is one of the ones i cancelled
since i haven't taken wellhead to burner tip yet
thanks
kay
hi bobby
ok
here's another detail
what's your web address
maybe annie and katie can come for a visit when things settle down
i know michael would be delighted
we could take them to the pink house
if they preferred
neil and i have talked about wanting them to visit for awhile
i realize there are lots of detail to attend to in the next several weeks
if there's anything i can do
please let me know
you and your family stay in our thoughts and prayers
i can't imagine what you
your dad and sister must be going through
i can relate to katie and annie
though
as the loss of each of my grandparents caused me a lot of sadness
i know they were close to your mom
and spent a lot of time with her
what a wonderful gift of memories they must have
and what joy they must have brought to her life
love to all
kay
i'll be glad to assist
my comments to the assignment agreement are as follows
in paragraph a
transformors
should be
transformers
please note the following comments to 0
0
successors and assigns
this assignment shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
their successors and assigns
this assignment and the rights and obligations herein may not be transferred or assigned by one party without the other party's written consent
except that assignee shall be entitled to assign this assignments to calumet power
llc or its affiliates
if permitted by the option agreement
and there upon be released from any and all obligations hereunder upon the giving of written notice to enron
i do not have any comments to the notice
please let me know if you have any questions
kay mann
john
here's abb's wiring instructions
the wire transfer has to be sent to abb trafo
s.a
our bank coordenates and account number are
bank
deutsche bank swift code
deutesbb notice should be sentto
michael sandridge comments to the assignment will come separately
please let me know if you have any questions
kay
abb is struggling with a fundamental assignment issue
their concern appears to relate to assignment to a project company or contractor which might not have the financial ability to pay
i believe they are looking for some type of security
lc
bond
guaranty
i didn't sense that they have an issue with the identity of the assignee
just the ability to pay
comments
kay
chris and mike
we are trying to do some sales tax planning
and need to know when the first lm 0's will be ready to ship
or store
as the case may be
i know there are projected dates in the purchase agreement
but those were more targets than commitment on the first few units
can you give the current status
thanks
kay
here's the latest version
it looks ok to me
the most substantive aspect of it is that calumet power
or its affiliate
could end up the indemnity obligations under the agreement
in other words
an entity without a lot of money to fund indemnity obligations
in my opinion this isn't important in the context of the option
unless someone objects
i'll tell perc that enron is ready to go with the assignment
kay
matt
our preference is to sign this before june 0
i recall that herman is out
do you know when he will be back
i will make sure that you and herman get a copy of the next draft
it won't be this week
kay
just for your info
the agreement and notice are fine with enron
kay
for your review
stan
could you please me send me the electronic file of the executed epc contracts
including the consolidation agreement
thanks
kay
please email the signature version of both documents
thank you
kay
jim
per gregg's request
i am forwarding abb's wiring instructions
please let me know if you need anything else
kay
john
the price includes shipment to the site and installation
but not connection
therefore
there is no additional freight charge
kay
john
the executed signature page has been faxed per your instructions
kay
jeff
here's a draft for your review
i suggest that the payment terms for the offshore contract require the intial payment to be made within 0 business days of execution
that way
we can sign this up next week
kay
gentlemen
i have been advised by j
nassos that peoples
through westlb
will be exercising the abb option today
i have asked that they send me a copy of the notice of exercise of option
and i left mike sandridge a voice mail telling him to expect it this afternoon
please let me know if you have any questions
kay
jeff
i'll focus on the consolidation agreement today
it seems to me that the time ge has to remit the payment to ena should remain 0 days
i don't see a reason to stretch it to 0 days
since it represents a double payment
your thoughts
looks like the tax issues are completed
kay
this time i'll include the attachment
it must be monday
kay enron north america corp
team vitro
i wanted to run these changes by you before sending them to jeff smith
jeff s
has lobbied for deleting the language on assignment
and state that assignment of the consolidation agreement will be subject to the same terms
etc
as the other 0 contracts
he also provide alternative language which appears to be close to what was in the previous draft
since i didn't know the genesis of the language in the consolidation agreement
so i thought i would check with you first
i eliminated 0
a
because the contracts allow for partial termination
hello again
if these contracts are going to be assigned immediately to mitsui
isn't the issue of a guaranty a mitsui issue
is this addressed in the epc contracts
if an enron entity must give a guaranty
i would think we would want ena to give it
to be replaced by a mitsui guaranty unless we have some safeguard against the possibility of paying mitsui and mitsui not paying ge
so that we would have to pay twice
kay
fyi
is there a conference call scheduled for today
and is boyd available tomorrow
thanks
kay
hello again
makes sense to me
i would add
on behalf of meh
after
transaction
on the first line of the second paragraph of vii
i don't have the meh operating agreement
do you have an electronic copy of it
thanks
kay
fyi
isn't it nice to know he is looking out for you
you can tell how much he cares about you
thanks for sharing the stories
i really enjoy each one of them
kay
hi gregg
i'm looking at it
kay
a little light reading
another will follow
as promised
fred
my understanding
which i will verify
is that enron would still be at risk from an environmental standpoint with a lease
we could try to lessen our exposure as much as possible with the lease
and get indemnity from pgl
kay
per your request
hi richard
i'm working on a form epc contract
do you have a favorite arbitration clause you would suggest be included
thanks
kay
who is authorized to sign on behalf of this company
thanks
kay
gentlemen
i have made changes to the consolidation agreement
which i hope all will find acceptable
it does need a date or two
as for the termination agreement
here's what i suggest
do we want to address the purchaser's parent guaranty in both of the contracts
or just the consolidation agreement
i would suggest that we make the guaranty a deliverable 0 days after execution of the contracts
which gives us time to get the mitsui assignment done
as we expect to assign the contracts immediately
that way
mitsui can provide the guaranty
if necessary
if ena does provide the guaranty
we would want to have the ability to have it replaced with a suitable substitute guaranty from mitsui
sorry i missed your call
it was a day of meetings
i will be on the road tomorrow
but will check my voice mail
kay
gentlemen
here's the notice we discussed
kay
did you guys work out anything on the 0th slot
thanks
kay
fyi
i thought i recalled you suggesting that changes we used on the lm 0 deal be incorporated into a
master
maybe i misunderstood
not the first time
christi
i'm so glad you wrote
not just because the information is so important
but also because i've been meaning to return your call
i look forward to working with you on this and other issues
i'm sure i'll be calling with questions soon
kay
this is the most current information i have on specifications
i sent ben and mike an email about the 0th slot
but haven't heard from either one of them
by the way
i was asking about whether the changes i had suggested for the transformer contract had been included in the calumet equipment purchase terms
as i was confident the changes are in this agreement
kay
i haven't opened the attachment yet
but i wanted to get it to you asap
here's the attachment
any time is good for me
will do
hi sheila
i'm happy to take care of this
i just want to make sure i'm not stepping on anyone's toes
is anyone else working on this
kay
hi again
i accidentally deleted the emails you sent me about gleason
could you resend them
thanks
kay
john
probably safe to assume it is me
kay
an update
i think you sent me an email which had some information from the gang about the tests
etc
do you still have it
thanks
kay
mike
here's a revised version of the option agreement
i changed the shipping dates
quantity
0
outside exercise date
and the amount of the option payment
i did not change the prices
since i had not discussed this with ben
and couldn't get the numbers to work
have there been some changes to the data sheets
it appears to me that there might be a version which reflects the inclusion of the low sound option
in the last draft we did not include the low sound option because the impact on the load losses had not been agreed
so the prices did not reflect the option
please call or email me if you have any questions or comments
kay
hi rusty
just wanted to check to see if you can get me a copy
thanks
kay
brian
i'm not sure i understand their objection to the wording about the guaranty
do you think that there is going to be a problem with them accepting the mitsui guaranty
i don't know what the arrangements are with mitsui
and perhaps there isn't a real issue due to how this is being handled in the epc contracts
my understanding is that peggy will be giving legal sign off on these agreements for ena
kay
brian
could you please email the electronic version of the ge contracts which are ready for execution
thanks
kay
fyi
per your request
kay
for your information
please call me with any comments
thanks
kay
fyi
when do you think you'll be done
thanks
kay
we seem to missing the termination agreement
i'll check with brian
kay
brian
the termination agreement needs to be signed at the same time
here is what i have as the latest draft
i never received a copy of the assignment and assumption agreemen
and the legal assistants have not been able to locate it
has anyone found it
if not
we need to get a copy from ge
kay
peoples stuff
we are very early in the process on this one
so you haven't missed out on any opportunities
kay
this is very helpful
david
for information but no action on your part at this time
kay
hi nancy
lisa mellencamp's time is being consumed by a special project
so i'm working on this ppa
could you give me a call at your convenience
thanks
kay mann
how about 0:0am on thursday to discuss ge and how to end world hunger
please let me know if this works for you
and i'll get us a conference room
nominations for other participants would be welcome
thanks
kay
i expect ben to turn up the heat today
no pun intended
hi kathy
please let me know if you get to the point where the exhibits are all that need work
if you are there now
please send me the current version electronically
thanks
kay
thanks
i'll keep it to myself
i think having a list is a sign of progress
0 am is a bit early to work it into a happy hour
however
there are lunch possibilities
the other commercial issue i saw was confirming the invoicing procedures
how/who will calculate cumulative net revenue
and flow of money in general
fits in with the refund stuff
kay
hi stan
not to rush you
but do you have an estimate of when you will have completed your review/memo
thanks
kay
stan
for some odd reason i am having difficulty forwarding this email to peggy and sheila
please forward it to them for me
thanks
kay
i'm glad you found something interesting to do
let me know if you meet anybody famous
we now have televisions in the elevators
at first
cnn ran all the time
this morning we started getting messages from management about the sap program
it is kind of odd to get into an empty elevator
but hear voices
i was discussing enron with my 0 year old daughter
i found it difficult to summarize what enron does
and what kind of opportunities it has for college grads
any wisdom you have on the subject would be appreciated
i know your husband must be overjoyed to have you back
his gain is our loss
but i understand completely
take care and keep in touch
kay
nancy
here are some come comments to the draft ppa
as a general note
we would have these goals
0
keep the ppa has streamlined as possible
putting as much as we can in the interconnection agreement
0
minimize ties to specific unit
0
maximize optionality
especially delivery points
0
keep construction/ownership of the facility off the balance sheet
0
signing the interconnection agreement must be simultaneous
or a cp
more specifically we would like to
move start up/metering terms to interconnection agreement
megawatts will probably change due to change in equipment
bracket 0 for now
the capacity will change for summer and winter
also
specifics to be determined
make sure we are protected from any liability caused by their delay
comments on specific articles
definition of emergency start up will belong in interconnection agreement
0.0 expiration is dec
0
0
move bracketed language into interconnect
0.0 we need an out in case we don't commence construction/achieve commercial operation as a result of buyer's action/inaction
and the term
breach
should include failure to timely perform any of buyer's obligations under any of the agreements
any reason why we shouldn't want an extension if there is a delay due to action/inaction of any governmental authority
we can add change of law as an event which gives us schedule relief
but we might want to broaden the definition of change of law
also
we don't have the site acquired yet
so we may need an out in case we encounter a problem
unless we will not sign this agreement before acquiring the site
0.0 peak period is july and august
0.0
b
amount left over will depend on the summer and winter capacity
might just leave blanks as placeholders
0.0
c
let's try for 0 hours notice
0.0
d
suggest title
start-up minimum run time
0.0
e
add maximum of ___ per year
need a minimum shut down time between start ups
0.0 note
0.0 refers to alternate sources and market sources
0.0 refers to the wholesale market
we should pick a term
define it
and use it throughout
0.0
c
replace
covenant
with
obligation
and follow with
other than payment
default isn't a remedy
so there's a disconnect in that sentence
0.0
d
remove
shall
and conform grammar in romanettes
0.0 refers to ld's
0.0 but i didn't see any unless 0.0 is meant to encompass the concept
a little unclear to me
how is this supposed to work with 0.0
is there any reason the damage waiver can't be absolute
does the sole and exclusive language in 0.0 need to be conspicuous
or is it ok
0.0 is the demand charge included in the invoice
or is it due without an invoice
0.0 on the third line
shouldn't the second
seller
be
buyer
0
no mediation
0.0 delete oral amendment language
exhibits
a
megawatts
heat rate to be confirmed
heat rate believed to be 0,0
deleted bracketed language about implied cost of fuel from alternate source energy
start up costs
$0
emergency start up to be addressed later
could we schedule a conference call for friday or monday to discuss any questions/issues
please let me know your availability
thanks
kay
as requested
please call if you need anything else
by the way
i have the original contracts in my office
kay
nancy
please call me about this
thank you
kay
i'm available any time except 0-0 on monday
have a good weekend
hi guys
i suggest a brief meeting to discuss strategy before anything is sent to sw
kay
anybody uncomfortable yet
suzanne
please forward this to jeff
my email is acting up again
hi jeff
i thought i would pass this email along to you since you've been working on some of the aspects of the peoples deal
i don't want to interfer with whatever you have going on
but i'm happy to assist/participate in whatever way makes sense
kay
good idea
i'll let him know
marty
fyi
sheila mentioned that mitch is one of your guys
kay
hi kathy
here are my suggestions/comments on rev
0 definitions
i think we need a business day definition
and a search and replace of business days for business days
0.0 the definition of performance tests is really a definition of performance test reports
i think we need a definition that incorporates the tests listed on exhibit e
the phrase installation option is used
but i didn't find a description of the installation option when i did a search
0.0.0.0 is 0 months enough under this circumstances
does it matter
0.0 delete
each
0.0 the amounts on exhibit n don't match what i have on the last option agreement
and there isn't a description of any options
unless i'm interpretting it incorrectly
0.0
ii
add
as provided in section 0.0
0.0 i may have missed this
but i didn't see where amounts owed by seller would be charged interest if not timely paid
0.0 are the roman numerals correct
i am going to email you some new language for assignment and the buy back option
you should have it today
do you have a redline on this rev 0 versus whatever the version was i read before
i'm skimming it and i want to make sure i don't skip something
thanks
kay
sounds good to me
stan
i have one minor question
is the notice to proceed effective date a set date
or is it x days following y event
i would expect to see language along the lines of
if notice to proceed is not given by the notice to proceed effective date
then
i see the deleted language was something close to that
so maybe in the context of this epc different terminology is used
kay
hi heather
here's a form of loi we can use
nancy w
called and is ready to discuss the ppa
we can call her after our meeting
or before if you have the time
kay
ok
so basically all bets are off if we don't give ntp by september whatever
sounds good
hi guys
here are some quick thoughts
0.0 suggest we delete
specific
from second line
0.0
i
to protect cash flow neutral status we need to get the money a couple of business days before date due
0.0 we need to discuss changes which could materially impact the value of the agreement to meh
not just the risks/responsibilities
i'd bracket the concept of what the admin service fee is supposed to cover
can we recover any additional costs
such as the cost of preparing/filing docs on their behalf
0.0
and collection
0.0
i think we probably need to limit our role to
short of litigation
type stuff
maybe
reasonable efforts
short of litigation
something like that
that's all for the first quick read
kay
here's the new version with attachment
here's the latest version
kay
i'm waiting to hear from ben on the buy back
and i need to incorporate some changes which were given to me by others
i noticed the paragraph headings duplicated themselves on this last draft
odd
more to come
kay
did you get this
the address for you looks odd
i'm not sure i understand it
i wonder if they mean payment in full has been made as of the time of the assignment
i'm clearing some other stuff off my desk so i can get to this
hopefully this afternoon
kay
hi nancy
it seems we may be scheduling a meeting with vepco to discuss the ppa
july 0th is the current date being discussed
i don't know how we want to staff the meeting yet
but i do want to check your availability
how does that date look for you
thanks
kay
fyi
kay
sheila
i believe i can help lisa with this information
at least confirming some of the stuff for her
kay
ben
this email has the prices in exhibit n of the current draft agreement
are these the correct numbers
kathy and i discussed your comments
and she is making changes to the contract consistent with those comments
she is not available this afternoon
but is free tomorrow am to discuss the contract
please let me know if tomorrow am works for you
kay
gentlemen
i've made some changes to the assignment language of the abb contract
the language is not identical to the lm 0 language
but is substantially the same
and in some respects better
please let me know if you have any substantive comments
i am also attaching the current draft of the contract
it is being revised to incorporate delivery dates and to clarify the scope to include installation obligations of abb
haul and install
also
in the fourth line of the first paragraph
the word
purchaser
will be added to the parenthetical
after
westlb
any other changes should be very minor or technical
we are trying to get this finished this week
please let me know if you have any questions or comments
kay
hi kathly
note addition of word
purchaser
guess the haul and install stuff is up in the air
kay
i believe i was told richmond
here's what i can give you without talking to anyone
i am not familiar with the goldendale turbine
#0 on ena long list
ena's ctg group lists #0 as being an eecc turbine for goldendale
not an ena asset
i don't know the 0 used gec turbines
#0 on ena long list
on the eecc long list
#0
0d0a
is not slated to be used on an an ena/electrocities project
as lm's are now being considered
guess you knew this
i believe blue dog
#0 on eecc list
has been an eecc deal
not an ena deal
i don't know about the choc
bayou or central iowa projects listed as ena projects
maybe these are sleepers
i can chase down more info
and sheila probably has a great deal she can tell you just from looking at the list
kay
i'm attaching a revised draft of the option to purchase the land for the vepco deal
i've limited it to the land in edgecombe county
changed the initial period to 0 days
with 0 x 0 day renewals
the price is changed to $0,0
as have the option payments
$0 for each 0 day period
is there anything else which needs to be changed
fyi
i've left a message for dutch bumgarnder
vepco's lawyer
concerning the interconnection agreement
and who is doing what
thanks
kay
rusty
let's meet at your convenience
we need to identify some of the tripping points and critical path items
especially since our goal
i assume
will be to keep equipment
epc contracts
land
etc off enron's balance sheet while things are developing
talking through the process should help
kay
we can discuss this am
i don't have a problem with not back dating it
i'll see if there's a sesitivity to it from abb's side
lisa
thank you for the timely comments
credit support
on the issue of credit support for a project company partially owned by enron
abb has some concerns even when enron still holds an equity interest due to some late payment problems they had in the past with an enron project company
also
the abb and ge payment schedules are different
with ge being more front end loaded
for example
ge will have received 0% of the total payments due by the time the first 0 units are ready to ship
by the time the last 0 units are ready to ship
they will have received 0% of the payment
in contrast
we hold 0% of the price of each abb unit until delivery
0%
and acceptance
0%
of that particular unit
effective date
the typical reason for an earlier effective date is to capture any work which abb may have chosen to do during the option period in order to hold their guaranteed completion dates
in the ge contract we addressed the issue in section 0.0
stating that it governs all work performed pursuant to the agreement in principle
it is fine with me to make the effective date a current one
price change
i will confirm why the prices changed $0,0 from the latest option agreement
i suspect there were changes in the specifications since the data sheets have changed
hope this was helpful
kay enron north america corp
no problem
for your reading pleasure
hi juan
some strange things happened when i restarted my computer
this little screen came up
saying
installation aborted
i chose ok
which was my only option
i'm obviously on it now
so we'll see how it goes
thanks
kay
mike
i've been trying to figure out what is meant by the last sentence
can you
or dave
clarify what is wanted
does it mean that payments must be current for the guaranty
etc
to be acceptable
thanks
kay
here's what i have on the open issues
to do list
resolve shipping/delivery obligations in accordance with option agreement
conform contract confirm pricing add schedule of delivery dates finalize assignment language
i sent mike an email with a question about their request
agree on effective date
suggest signing date be whatever it is
hope for tomorrow
with effective date being the last day of last option need estimated price per month to store
a request from finance for budget purposes
verify sales tax exemption with westlb
doesn't require abb involvement
nor does it need to be done before contract is signed
need assignment of option
finance to provide
no abb action
i'll follow up
kathy
do you have anything to add
are there any technical details left to resolve
ben
anything to add
i'll send a cleaned up version to mike tomorrow am
thanks
kay
thought you might be interested
thanks
i'll give you a call in a little while to compare notes
status
etc
kay
hi mike
sorry i missed you when you returned by call this am
i have some concerns about the voice mail you left re
assignment language
enron can't stay on the hook for payment if the agreement is assigned
as this would bust the financing/accounting arrangement
what we have tried to do to meet your concerns is to see that abb has a contract with a party which is as financially sound as enron by adding the guaranty language
this addresses abb's request that the party with the payment obligation have the
financial wherewithall
to make the payments
this is a big change from where we were in the last contract
i've had a request to get an approximate storage cost
monthly
for budgetary purposes
this is in connection with the buy back arrangement
can you give me a guesstimate
thanks
kay
an
april-less
version
kay
here is the most recent
and dare we hope last
draft of the abb agreement
kathy clark is preparing a redline for your use
and you should have it shortly
abb may be insistent upon dating this june 0
but we will try the 0th with an effective date of the 0th
ben advises that this is a very
very critical point to abb
i have not taken abb's comment on the assignment language
but i hope they will accept what we've given them in this draft
i have been advised that the price reduction is due to more definitive design criteria being provided by enron
matt gockerman points out that their is exposure to missouri sales tax
so we will need westlb's cooperation in getting the proper exemption certificate for mo
have i forgotten to address any questions or comments
thanks
kay
hi again
could you send rev 0 to mike s
thanks
kay
i'm speechless
fyi
kathy is changing the address to 0 smith in the final version
kay
please make the change
hi richard
when you have 0 minutes i can bring you up-to-speed on the westinghouse dispute
kay
you should have a closing party for this one
hope so
we'll spare you extra emails until then
hi jeff
ozzie pagan's team is working on a project for vepco
the power plant will be located in edgecombe county
north carolina
i've been told that getting gas for the plant is a significant issue due to local gas supply conditions
one alternative has been to buy gas from the city of rocky mount
which has a take or pay contract with the local supplier
and is not using all of their gas
especially in the summer
we have developed a preliminary draft of the loi
which i am attaching for your review
i would appreciate the opportunity to discuss it with you to get your input
etc
of particular concern is that rocky mount wants ena to deal exclusively with them during the term of the loi
this isn't reflected in the draft
thanks
kay
ben noticed a mistake in the abb contract
one i missed
enron's address was listed as 0 louisiana
i could not figure out where that address came from
as it had been correct before
i asked kathy and she told me that she changed it from smith to louisiana because she thought that was the correct address
ok
now i'm scared
the change appears necessary since there is no 0.0 b
this must have been left over from the ge contract
anything from mike
here is the answer to the storage charge question
as you recall
the contract allows for us to request storage
kay
my understanding is that the abb equipment will most likely be used somewhere other than calumet due to the noise issue
it is possible that lm 0's will be used on calumet
resulting in a re-bid of the epc contract
however
none of this is etched in stone
and their are active discussions with peoples about what to do
i suspect this isn't much help
paul probably has better information
kay
michelle
i would like to sign up if there's still room
thanks
kay
hi juan
i had another error message today
the box was titled
cmd.exe
and the message was
directory name invalid
my computer is working so far
just thought i would report this for future reference
have a good day
kay
allyson called friday afternoon to tell me they would be sending this out friday
and it needed to be reviewed quickly
it never came
i left a message friday afternoon
asking where it was
they sent it to me on saturday
i left out the really bad part
i had to leave early on friday because michael's sitter
who picks him up from school everyday
had a heart attack
she's still in st
luke's
i'll take a look at it
yes
i have it
she thought she had heartburn while she was with michael
what a summer
that would have been too much
i've roughed out a document for you to discuss
it isn't in good enough shape to go to peoples yet
but hopefully it gives you something to discuss internally so we can decide what we want to do
in the meanwhile
i'm going to continue to think through the issues
please let me know what i can do to help
kay
i want to verify that the relationship between vepco and ncp is sufficient to justify the statement that we are negotiating a power purchase agreement with north carolina
as for the statement concerning ena owning the other peaking projects
i could verify the correct enron entities involved given a little time
perhaps we could work around it by saying that
ena and its affiliates
are involved in these other projects
i'll try to confirm the correct entity to apply
kay
humberto
this is the most current version redlined against a previous version
kay
here's a couple of clauses from some other contracts
from abb contract
maximum liability
seller,s maximum aggregate liability for claims bypurchaser arising out of seller,s performance of this agreement whetherarising from tort
including negligence
breach of contract or any othercause of action is limited to one hundred percent
0%
of the purchase amount
provided
however
that the foregoing limitation of liability of seller shall not apply to the following
i
under article xx
indemnification
ii
under article xxiv
liens and claims
iii
section 0.0
a
and 0.0
b
compliance with governmental rules
iv
section 0.0
taxes
v
article xix obligation to maintain insurance
vi
arising from or related to environmental harm caused by an action orinaction of seller
its agents
employees or vendors during the performanceof the scope of work
vii
resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of seller,their agents
employees or vendors
viii
patent or copyright infringement in accordance with section 0.0
or
ix
article xxi
non-disclosure of information
which liabilities shall not be limited
additionally
any liability of seller provided for by the proceeds of the insurance maintained pursuant toarticle xix shall not be counted toward any of the foregoing limitations ofliability
the indemnity language in the abb contract probably wouldn't work
i'll loaround
allyson
will the certification of necessity be specific to ena
i ask this because i suspect that at some point we will want a special purpose company to be involved
this provides us with the option of selling the equity of the entity developing the project
your advise is appreciated
kay
i can try
here's one
thank you
paul
i appreciate your help
i am not responsible for this tribasa mess
my responsibility ended when tribasa iv was signed
kay
fyi
i know it is because i'm new to the game
but i find this stuff interesting
kay
attached is a draft of an loi for the city of rocky mount
please let me know by tomorrow morning if you have any comments
by the way
the exclusivity provisions are being re-examined
as crm wants reciprocal exclusivity
thank you
kay
i left bruce a message offering my assistance
fyi
hi matt
you may have given this to me before
but i need a copy of the corporate data sheets
also
is there a standard slate of officers for ena
fyi
this company is jointly owned with another company
kay
here's the latest from gregg fyi
fyi
no action needed at this point
kay
i expect to have it today or tomorrow morning at the latest
i understand that mr
dobler is out
if so
mike miller is available to sign it
any new developments
kay enron north america corp
here's another draft
note in particular changes in exclusivity
now bilateral
tax abatement
exh
a
termination rights
term
i also made a minor change to dispute resolution
as for their hesitancy to give us trade secrets
these should be covered by the confidentiality provisions
although this version is very basic
see underlined language
i just want to make sure we get the gas supply contract asap
we can do a full blown confidentiality agreement that helps
i never heard back from dutch bumgardner
i'll get the interconnection agreement started on this end
unless you think otherwise
hope you are having a good trip
kay
hi gregg
here is a new draft which incorporates comments that boyd and i have made
i haven't reviewed this version yet
but i wanted to get it to you asap
i would like to look at this draft before it goes to peoples
and i'll give it priority for tomorrow am
i spoke with dave gorde
rac
he is prepared to discuss line of credit/dash at your convenience
although tomorrow he is tied up with prc
i'll go ahead and get a draft of a
simple
revolving line of credit doc started
unless you think otherwise
kay
yes i can
nancy
as difficult as this is to believe
we have been told that vepco wants enron to take the first crack at the interconnection agreement
please put this on your list
i will check around here to see if there is a form we want to use as a starting point
thanks
kay
well
i've lost today somewhere along the way
how about friday morning
you and i can discuss the agency agreement
then get them on the line
anytime is good for me
kay
i should be able to accomodate the schedule
kay
nancy
i don't have details on the meeting on the 0th
but please hold the date open for us
talk to you soon
kay
fyi
mitch
here's a first draft
please suggest any additional complaints/shortfalls which we need to raise
it is better to be all inclusive than leave something out
richard
any ideas or comments
kay
i've left the electricities lawyer a voice mail
i just received this so i wanted to pass it along
i'll work through the comments and get back to you with any questions
kay
hi guys
i need the abb contract and the pda at your earliest convenience so that i can work on the documents we discussed
thanks
kay
viola
just a reminder
the contract gives us 0 days to give them written notice
i'm not sure when the clock started ticking
the contract says something about the supervisory personnel at the facility becoming aware of the problem
paraphrasing
of course
enron north america corp
not to suggest anything
but i'm going to try this for that stubborn 0-0lbs
weak excuse
it lasts for 0 weeks
lisa bills and i spoke concerning this transaction
and what kind of document we can put in front of peoples at this time
here are the highlights from our conversation
enron can't enter into a binding commitment to purchase the equipment without putting the moore project on the balance sheet
therefore
either westlb needs to enter into the agreement with peoples or enron can enter into an option agreement
there is room in the westlb facility for the turbines
however
rac needs to approve the purchase
lisa advises that transaction support
herman or roger
needs to buy in as well
i understand we would like to present a binding agreement to peoples tomorrow
however
this appears to be problematic given the need to keep the moore project off the balance sheet
i'm available to discuss this
lisa advises that she will be in tomorrow as well
lisa
please correct me if any of this is not accurate
kay
good morning
i'm looking for a confidentiality agreement between ena and peoples energy resources on or around nov
0
0
can either of you help me
thanks
kay
per your request
they should put pictures on resumes
it the dark recesses of my mind i recall that honey has a form to fill out
however
that doesn't keep us from distributing $
we just need to keep enough to pay ct to file the documents
congratulations
that was quite a feat
time for a fish wake
kay
matt
please see if you can chase down the executed version of the first document
lou stoler may know something
you can also check with david tucker at thanks
kay ps did you ever figure out how original documents are handled around here
fyi
here's a start
i thought i would send this to you and you could just try to guess what we want to do
thank you
more light reading
kay
here's where i am
kay
this is mostly just a template at this point
lisa has it as well
kay
ok
i'll send it
here's an outline of what i was thinking of using
obviously
there are huge holes in it
but i wanted to see if i'm on the right track
kay
i've made a rough stab at an exhibit to capture the changes which are necessary for the abb contract
please comment on the attached
suggest changes
etc
i will add a rep
or condition about receiving all the change orders
etc
fyi
i will be working on this over the weekend
should you care to comment
kay
boyd
i am not sure you have seen this agreement
if you haven't
please give it a look for
fatal flaws
or information you think we need to be informed
thank you
kay
hi nancy
we are still on for thursday with vepco in richmond
i would like for you to participate
in addition
we would like the opportunity to meet with you before hand
we can meet late wednesday afternoon in dc
how does that sound to you
i look forward to speaking with you soon
kay
i haven't seen a signed copy of the termination agreement cross my desk
i just want to make sure that the fully executed document has been processed
thanks
kay
hi guys
could someone send an electronic file of the execution copy of the coyote springs contract
thank you
kay
hi nancy
there are some comments on the vepco ppa from our regulatory side
i was unclear if you had seen these before
kay
i think i have everything except the termination agreement
i'll check
and send you what i have
if anyone would like to discuss the transaction this weekend
i can be reached at home at 0 0 0
kay
fyi
i see your point that the put should be higher up on the list
in my opinion
this will be the biggest issue with abb
i think we will be staying in richmond
at least that was the plan as of friday afternoon
heather kroll will be meeting with us
kay
i thought that someone retrieved the originals
which has been signed by ge but not enron
while i was in ft
worth for my dad's surgery
marty mentioned that you were looking for them
so i thought he had given them to you
he's out this week
i have not seen the termination agreement since i returned
did you and john leave fully executed termination agreements in my office
maybe someone else picked them up
i can't tell you what's going on with the assignment
perhaps peggy banczak can help out with that
kay
mom was asking my about cake
and i don't know what is on the menu for dessert
guess we can ask for cake
neil thought we should have cake at the ph
guess that makes sense
too
you want to coordinate on when to get there
that may be too out of character for all of us
but we can aspire to organization
it is hot here
too
the wind in the afternoon is really oppressive
dry heat
ha
it is still darn hot
i cringe at the thought of six flags
i'm sure paige can be bought
she went recently and had a big time
hope your week is quiet
love/hugs
etc
to all
kay
how bad is that
i forgot i asked him to send it to you
hi bob
is there a favorite go by for an interconnection agreement
i have one on my immediate to do list
and i want to point outside counsel in the right direction
thanks
kay
i'm available anytime
enron north america corp
good morning
enron's finance people are asking about the status of the turbine contract for pastoria
since sheila is on vacation i thought i would check with you
is it in final form
and if so
has it been executed
it would be a big help to get an electronic version sent to me
thanks
kay
this is the contract that we said would be the jumping off point
an accurate description
for our ge discussions
as i recall
we need to give it the off balance sheet treatment before it is distributed to the masses
rose
can you take responsibility for the basic obs stuff
i suggest we discuss assignment and indemnity separately
and soon
my assistant is setting up the legal team's conference call for wednesday at 0
details to follow
kay
sounds great to me
enron north america corp
i threw the initials in there for your benefit
it means oh bull shit
kay
the following is a redline version of the execution version
so we hope
versus the last draft you saw
please advise if there are any kay
nancy
i believe we are scheduled to start at 0am thursday
i had a voice mail from heather that said she was planning to spend the night thursday in case the meeting went long
or we wanted to continue on friday
i haven't heard where we will be staying
as for the interconnection agreement
it would be great to have a internal working draft this week
that way we can discuss it with heather and make good use of our time
also
we could have some general
preliminary discussions with vepco about it
if we feel ready
i've been trying to get a form from someone around here
but haven't had any luck
perhaps someone bp's houston office has an
enron form
sheryl gussett's name is next to
interconnection agreement
on our document team list
kay
as luck would have
i have to leave town this week
i need to cancel this class
thanks
kay
hey
we all can use a little money
life doesn't seem to get any cheaper
honey
i think we discussed c t systems doing the filing
do you recall how much it was
if not
i can see what i can find out
which is more strange
joe in central america or jack in egypt
clark in chicago
kay at enron
gerry buying an engineering company
honey still at sounds like a great time for a reunion
kay
fyi
we are staying at the richmond marriott or marriott richmond
whichever it is
what are your plans
kay
nancy wodka dc 0 0 is the main number kay
fyi
kay
thank you
kay
sorry if i'm a little late in the day
i feel into marathon meeting mode today
here are my observations of the ge contract
i tried to confine it to significant issues since it appears to me that the negotiations are far along
general terms and conditions i don't see where the buyer has much financial leverage for performance/warranty issues
final payment is made at shipment
with the buyer having the benefit of a 0% retention bond
however
the retention bond expires at provisional acceptance
there is no financial leverage for final acceptance or the warranty period
also
usually provisional or final acceptance requires that ge provide the operating manuals
the assignment language
0
is somewhat narrow
i don't know the deal
so i don't know how it fits
it can help to have language which allows for free assignment after provisional acceptance or payment in full
whichever occurs first
also
the contract can allow for a substitute guaranty as payment security
in lieu of the buyer guaranty
again
i don't know the deal so this may be fine as is
the contract incorporates ge's proposal as a part of the contract
but does not give an order of precedence
i haven't seen the proposal or any other technical exhibits
but sometimes these can be very self-serving
therefore
you can potentially lose ground with what is in the exhibit
warranty
the language is a bit confusing to me
especially the interplay of the 0st and 0nd paragraph
also
the
outs
they have are very broad
it is better if there outs are limited to installation/operation/maintenance not in accoredance with their written instructions
alternatively
industry practice
also
they have an out if repairs are performed without their permission
but there's no time line or urgency for their response to a warranty claim
a statement that they must provide a service engineer within 0 days or so might help
i also suggest being clear that 0.0 applies to warranty obligations
but their obligation to respond quickly to warranty problems need to be explicit
excusable delay
0
i would delete
indirectly
from the 0rd line
provisional acceptance
i don't understand the phrase
only to the extent and proportional share
does this mean that ge may not be liable for the full ld's
or that the buyer has to prove a right to collect ld's
litigation
the dispute resolution
mediation then litigation
is not consistent with the usual arbitration route we request
i didn't take a hard look at ld's
since i assumed these are settled
0.0 enron typically gets more precise language than this
for instance
i would delete or clarify the phrase
including that due to environment or operation
as being vague
0.0
i
the phrase
proper storage
installation
operation and maintenance
should be as defined by ge's written instructions
or at least based on industry standards
0.0
ii
could conceivably allow them to drag their feet on a repair
then not allow us to get someone else to do the work
0.0 the last line should include the words
strict liability
after
negligence
ge ususally gives us indemnity for any hazardous substance they introduce
this is a quick look
if you need more detailed information
and you think there's time to negotiate further
i can look at it in more detail
kay
what fun
i know t
mueller is on holiday
i suspect he would want ai and st
paul to agree in writing that this doesn't prejudice any rights/constitute a waiver
etc
you may have considered this already
but payment to
request for payment to eepc may trigger the responsibility to pay vat
good luck
and keep me posted
kay
here's a revised draft of the agreement with peoples
kay
not me
bart
is it you
kay
mr
turner has the signed dissolution papers
i have not responded yet
mostly because i don't know the answer
kay
neat
thanks
it might work better if you call
steve is very nice
just a reminder about our telephone call tomorrow morning
sheila left word that she won't be participating
something about being in st
thomas
last i heard from scott
he was on his way to the uk
but maybe he will be dialing in
talk to you tomorrow
kay
a likely story
by the way
what do you think of having rob or someone obs the coyote springs contract so we can use it as a starting point
that would give me something to report
thanks
kay
hi
i don't think i would have rob participate in the call
just doesn't feel right
i haven't heard any feedback from this morning's conference call
have you
kay
brian barto might have the info also
i left brian a voice mail and asked him to call you or me back with the info
he is pretty bad about returning phone calls
though
kay
fyi
do you remember anything about this agreement
it was something people were looking for while i was in fort worth
and now i'm trying to find the signed original
thanks
kay
i just want to get it finished and off the to do list
i just got a fax in from westlb with a couple of changes
cringe
what's your fax number
please fax the winston
strawn changes to kathy clark
thanks
kay
hi nancy
i've misplaced your direct line
could you email it to me
the travel schedules of the enron delegation are becoming complicated
would it be possible for you to travel with us to richmond tomorrow night
that would give us more flexibility in case we need to convene before the meeting on thursday
we are staying at the marriott in richmond
thanks
kay
jonathan
please resend the draft confidentiality agreement for the public staff
preferably by email
i cannot locate the document here
the loi with rocky mount is still under discussion
in a recent discussion with one of enron's folks the city
or their lawyer
raised the issue that kilpatrick stockton had represented them in the past
and that there might be a potential conflict
i don't anticipate a problem
but we should discuss it soon
thank you for your assistance
kay
thanks
i'm still not sure who has this territory
however
if you need something
please let me know
kay
i'm flying to richmond this am
i'll read the abb contract on the plane
and let you know what i think this afternoon
hopefully
we can put it to bed
kay
hi clark
i'm in dc
in bracewell's offices
in fact
and just picked up your email
has anyone taken you up on the offer
if not
i'd be happy to take the tickets
thanks
kay
hi herman
here's the agreement i referenced in my voice mail
we will change it so that they can't buy any equipment without further written authorization from enron
anything else
thanks
kay
gentlemen
we have revised the option agreement to reflect most of your suggested changes
please advise if the attached is acceptable
thank you
kay
hi
i'm working with nancy wodka on a deal with virginia power
we are working on the ppa tomorrow
thanks for the offer of the tickets
i'm sure bob will enjoy the experience
even if the game is
well
an astros game
what a difference a year makes
see you soon
kay
thanks
i'm in dc
actually
richmond va
with nancy wodka working on a ppa
i haven't opened the attachment yet due to the length of time it takes over this connection
and the late hour
you may have addressed this in your email
but as i recall you were going to work on a summary of the restricted activities
as a foundation for the document anticipated by the llc agreement
any luck with that
i'll be in touch shortly
thanks for keeping track
kay
hi matt
this is the document that i referenced in my voice mail
it would be great if it could be compared against the agreement for the wilton center
i will call later to see if you've had any luck
as you can guess
this is on a short fuse
thanks
kay
hi fred and suzanne
i'm sending this to suzanne so she can make these changes
suzanne

karen
fred mitro forwarded an email you sent him concerning a legal question
please be advised that enron policy requires that all outside legal advice be coordinated through an inhouse lawyer
and certainly any legal advice given to enron employees must be given to enron counsel as well
this requires some discipline on the part of our outside counsel
but we find it works in everyone's best interest
thank you for your attention to this very important policy
kay
gee
if you hurry you can still make it to the volleyball game
we had the legal call on wednesday
it was mike
kent and me
you didn't miss much
they are waiting on us
and i didn't want to give them anything we hadn't discussed internally
i asked rose to have the coyote springs contract obs'ed
off balance sheet-ed
she should have something shortly
by the way
the contact sheet that steve distributed was the one we prepared
i'll catch you up on other stuff when you have time
nothing urgent
kay
good morning
i'll check around for some peaker availability language
if you would like
i can give a heads up to the finance group so that they know how quickly things will need to move
i don't have any messages from nancy yet
but i'm sure we will get a few today
kay
any luck
thanks
kay
hi lisa
i received your voice mail regarding the abb contract
as i recall
abb signed the contract after i received approval from you
while we were on the phone on july 0 talking about the moore project
rose
and herman
and had incorporated the comments sent by rob taylor
quite frankly
i thought that was it for the gf approval process
so westlb's comments came as a surprise to me when they were faxed in a few days later
i received a voice mail that indicated that abb is ok with westlb's changes
i expect enron may be signing today
and we will need westlb's signature
please advise how this should be handled
kay
fyi
kay
i find the process a challenge to manage
how's that for hyperbole
well
what can i say
it represents job security for all of us
hi heather
we can discuss these comments
if you want
or just incorporate them
electricities shouldn't mind
kay
i don't believe i forwarded this to you
kay
i'm not sure why this came to me
but i thought i would share it anyway
thanks for your help
kay
an email only a fellow turbine czarina could appreciate
to tell you the truth
this stuff is difficult for me to retain
so i could be completely off base
i would like to have herman walk through it again
tomorrow is probably better than wednesday
gentlemen
due to some internal comments we have made some revisions to the land option agreement
the most significant change is that it is clear that the option payment is not refundable
and will not be applied against the purchase price
there is also a clarification in paragraph 0
re assignment
that the assignee remains responsible for any liability arising prior to assignment
i believe we are ready to go forward with signature when you are
please advise if this version is acceptable
also
please let me know if you would like for me to have a redline version prepared
kay
this is on the horizon
so i thought i would let you know
kay
mike
i'll try to figure out the conversion
in the meanwhile
if you can email me your fax number i'll send it that way
kay
well
there's your summo wrestler
a fan
wasabi peas
and i think a sea shell
they can't open the attachment
is there a way to save it in an earlier version of word and resend
also
please print the attachment and fax it to thanks
kay
i got the same response from mike and ken
doesn't sound good
allyson
thank you for the update
is not having the cpcn an absolute bar to beginning construction
what are the risks
thanks
kay
john
credit appears to be a problem on this deal
therefore
please stand by for further developments
i appreciate your very quick response
apparently
my client was satisified with the service he received
kay
attached is the current draft of the ppa for the vepco deal for your information
review
etc
kay
here's the version showing revisions
there were technical difficulties with the last one
this should be easier to read
kay
here's a version
you probably know this
but the most important stuff is
assignment exercise dates
get more time than you could possibly need
because you'll need it
scope
if available
schedule guarantees option price not credited against purchase price
and lately
not refundable
lisa bills
herman manis
rose engeldorf and matt berry typically review these

p's office
and how much it costs
thanks
kay
tomorrow is bad for me
but thursday afternoon or anytime friday is good
kay
karen
i have in hand the ledford agreement
my only comment is that on its face it does not appear to limit the ledford's to the relief described
no sole/exclusive remedy clause
does that occur by operation of law in illinois
thank you for your assistance
kay
hi rusty
here's my only comment
which i sent directly to karen
kay
i sent it to ken and mike
they had difficulty opening it
but did get itopen this am
i haven't heard back since then
herman wants to meet on thursday or friday to discuss structure
what do ythink
the willard was booked
so i'm staying at the monarch
near nancy's office.i'm taking flight that gets to dc around 0
we received an email from allyson that indicates that we may be able to getsome deadlines set so that the cpcn is issued by november 0
she says it imuy mal to begin construction before it is issued
do you want to have a conference call this afternoon with nancy to discussthe draft ppa
kay
allyson says we can scratch around in the dirt a bit
i'm paraphrasing
so i'm sure some site preparation is ok
i'm not sure i like her availability stuff as inserted
maybe we should leave some space for some wording
but not give them actual language today
it is such a big issue
i hate for us to get into a box which won't work
i'm going to check around again for the oec stuff
i still haven't seen anything
i'll tell nancy we will meet her in her office around 0:0
as for meeting with herman
should j keenan be included as well
kay
hi there
i'm trying to put together a meeting on thursday at 0 to discuss the vepco project
how does 0 look for you
thanks
kay
herman says he has a lot of accounting issues to go over
and i thought it would be best if we all heard the same thing at the same time
plus
how the heck is this puppy going to get financed
amen
to complicate things
the process is relatively new
so the originators/developers aren't experienced in working through it
i don't see a problem with it
could you fax to heather and ozzie at the same fax as last night
thanks
kay
i've just returned to the office
and will handle the changes as suggested
thanks
kay
nancy
thanks for the wonderful turn around time
i glanced through the interconnect
it includes arbitration
poor dutch
and equipment outage as force majeure
gee
what's good for the goose should be good for the gander
talk to you soon
kay
damn
how do i find out what it is if i deleted the stupid email
ed
although this email was directed to ei lawyers
i was under the impression that this was a corp policy
maybe i was wrong
kay
gentlemen
i have made the revisions to paragraphs 0 and 0 as suggested
i have also changed the state designation of the tarheel notary to texas
if this version is acceptable
we will execute originals and forward to you
do you need more than one original for the optionor
thank you
kay

please feel free to add others
kay

could you email me the menu
we will be bringing beer and wine
see you soon
just not soon enough
kay mann

has the letter gone out
kay
well
i believe i'll bring something cool
comfortable
and casual
or
maybe jeans
i don't have a very large selection
since most of my clothes are either work clothes or beyond casual
yard stuff
i have a couple of hawaiian shirts
so i'll probaly pick one of those
neil will wear shorts and probably a hawaiian shirt
since that is what he almost always wears when he isn't working
what do you want to do about lunch tomorrow
i can bring something
or we can just tell mom we ate on the way
you know how she frets about such things
or
we could pick up sonic if someone is hungry
we'll have some type of snacks for michael
i guess
since he's at the age where he eats constantly
hmmmm
more to think about
hi again
i just called mom and told her our plans
she says dad has no clue
she vacuumed on monday or tuesday
and he asked her who she was expecting to visit the next day
ha ha ha
i told her that we are all very proud of ourselves for not blowing it
dad doesn't know i called today
so i can call him tomorrow when we are on the way
talk to mom and let her know when we will be there
it won't be that weird for me to call on a saturday morning
she say larry and beverly left today
so we can park in their driveway and be sneaky
i'm so excited
kay
we need to keep in mind the 0 day deadline to provide notice
we don't want to give them any room to wiggle
we can always send another notice later

fpl
entergy merge in $0 billion deal new york
reuters
fpl group inc
the parent of florida power
light co
said on monday it would merge with entergy corp
in a stock deal worth $0 billion to create the largest u.s
power generating company
the combined company would have a total enterprise value of more than $0 billion
consisting of $0.0 billion in equity market capitalization and $0.0 billion in debt and preferred stock
the companies said
the merger is expected to immediately boost earnings for both companies
under the terms of the agreement
fpl shareholders would receive one share of a new holding company for each fpl share held
entergy shareholders would get 0.0 of a share of the new holding company for each entergy share
based on the companies
closing stock prices
the deal would value entergy at its market value of $0 billion
or about $0.0 per share
fpl shares closed friday at 0-0/0
off a year high of 0-0/0 but up from a low of 0-0/0
entergy stock ended at 0-0/0
off a high of 0-0/0 but up from a low of shareholders
approval required the combination must be cleared by shareholders as well as federal regulators
fpl and entergy said they hope to complete the transaction within 0 months
``the merger combines two strategically aligned
financially healthy companies into an organization that has no equal in the industry
said j
wayne leonard
entergy chief executive
leonard will serve as president and chief executive of the combined company while fpl's chief executive
james broadhead
will serve as chairman
the deal was billed as a merger of equals but gives fpl shareholders 0 percent of the combined company and eight of 0 seats on the board of directors
the companies said
once combined
the new company is expected to see annual cost savings of $0 million to $0 million in its regulated businesses derived from eliminating duplicate corporate and administrative positions and programs
competitive businesses should see annual cost savings and revenue enhancements of $0 million to $0 million and capital expenditure savings of $0 million to $0 million
the companies said
fpl and entergy said they will seek to ``minimize workforce effects of the merger
through a variety of unidentified efforts
in addition
both fpl and entergy have authorized stock buyback plans
together worth $0 billion
fpl plans to repurchase $0 million shares while entergy is looking to buy back $0 million in stock
the companies said

hi
i'm kinda tired this morning
i guess i just need a bit more sleep
michael tried to push the envelope this am
he wanted to eat some more after he had brushed his teeth
i told him breakfast was over
so no more food
and wanted to go back in to get a toy to take
nope
he handled the frustration do we have anything planned this weekend
ta ta for now
attached is the form interconnection agreement provided by virgina power
for your information
review
etc
it is a new form which is currently under review by vepco
kay
i'm trying to locate a copy of the contract to purchase the 0d0a turbine to see if we need to be aware of any issues in the contract
do you have a copy
if not
i can probably get a copy from eecc
thanks
kay
both of those sound pretty good
paige is so excited
she got a $0 pay check
i have some folks who want to option some land in new york
do we have a company for new york yet
if not
i seem to recall that we were going to start using one of the existing companies for land options instead of creating a new one every time
am i remembering that correctly
basically i'm looking for the company name to use in an option
any suggestions
thanks
kay
it is raining
i hope it is raining at the house
it looks like it probably is raining all over town
hope you get some there
neil's address is nmann@erac.com
paige's address is recordp@southwestern.edu
she can get her email from houston
don't ask me how
we had a great time this weekend
too
i'm glad it worked out so well
i thought it was very relaxing
i would love to have the recipe for the beef
i will probably go to north carolina wednesday
returning thursday or friday
take care
love
kay
sheila stopped by to let me know that it is ok for me to give you a hand on the lease term sheet
i've stopped by a couple of times today
but i've missed you
please let me know if you still want my help
and if so
if you have any additional information
etc
thanks
kay
yes and yes
enron north america corp
here it is
i guess she didn't make my reservations
you might want to double check
obviously
i do not need a car
i would like to get these reservations asap for the upgrade
thanks
kay
ed
to clarify
the edgecombe we were discussing is in north carolina
the new york deal is a separate deal
thanks
kay
i've made a list of issues heather and i have discussed based on vepco's suggested revisions
some of the issues are commercial
some legal
somejust reminders
comments are appreciated
0
term
what will we accept
0
availability
single computation despite source of power
market or facility
is forced outage the correct concept since we want to have somediscretion
and ld structure should apply even if power coming from the market
note vepco,s insertion of a new event of default under 0.0 forfailure to deliver energy when the facility is not in a forced outage
liquidated damages language still ok
ld,s should apply regardless ofscheduled source of power
no cost of cover for market power
0
our position is that contract capacity set at contract signing
then adjusted
if necessary
based on performance tests
not subject to adjustmeafter that time
ditto for the demand charge

kay
sounds good
we may not need the entity in new york yet
as we are looking at getting a free option
not anonymous
deals kind of funky
correct on the edgecombe
north carolina
thing
kay
i don't think this agreement will be on the agenda until next week
if things change
moving up or back
i'll let you know
thanks
kay
let me think about it
i disagree
none of the problems i've had in the last 0 weeks can be attributed to changes
there was no explanation given as to why they booked me to return a day early on the first trip to dc
what was up with that
last week
i wrote down exactly the flights i wanted didn't change my plans
in fact
i've spent more time investigating my options by myself than i ever had before
a travel agent ought to be able to deal with changes anyway
that is what business travel is all about
and has been for the 0 years i've been flying around north america
south america and europe
i've had good agents and bad ones
the good ones can deal with the changes and never miss a beat
please have my flight changed as follows
wednesday
august 0nd
change to continental flight no
0
departing iah at 0pm and arriving rdu at 0pm
the remainder of the travel plans stay the same
thanks
kay
i'm scheduled to fly back to houston around 0 that night
so it isn't looking good for me
enron north america corp
i wasn't blaming you
i was just disagreeing with the statement that that changes have caused the problem
she may turn out to be great
just because she becomes extra cautious with us
any luck with this
i don't recall the answer was to the question about whether we have a land company in new york
and if so
its name
thanks
kay
after i wrote this i recall ed saying that we don't have a new york company yet
i'm fairly comfortable that i don't know whether there really is an edgecombe development company
and if so
is it available to use on the virginia power transaction
sorry for the memory slip
kay enron north america corp
hi kay
i trying to find out if we have confidentiality agreements with the following
virginia power dominion resources
or something close
electricities
don't know the remainder of the name
north carolina eastern municipal power agency thanks
kay
gee
makes you wish there was a way to track documents without having to speak to someone
do i sound like a broken record yet
i'm fairly confident we can use this company
as the project i am handling is lisa's old project
there's time to wait for her to answer
though
do you have a copy of the one with virginia power
thanks
kay
please protect thursday afternoon
august 0th for me
i have some important personal stuff to take care of
i spoke with kent shoemaker
and he has a conflict at 0 houston time today
i suggested to him that enron go forward with the call as an internal call
and we can conference him in after 0
when he's available
if we have anything noteworthy to report
if that is acceptable
i will go to sheila's office at 0
and we can call scott and rose
how does that sound
kay
i need this document today in a big way
can you assist in getting it located
if kay doesn't have it
it is possible that lisa mellencamp might
thanks
kay
michael problems
he has add and some other lesser learning problems
we are going to meet with the specialist next week
i'm going to try to take off friday afternoon as well
we are thinking of changing his school
and neil and i need to go visit a new one
hectic
due to the nature of this deal
i've prepared an loi with an exclusivity period
let me know what you think
kay
we've known
but is has gotten to be a bigger issue as he has gotten older
i am attaching a operating lease summary which i have revised to include some basic asset operation stuff
i've left lisa a voice mail with a brief explanation of what we are doing
and asking her if she would take a look at this from a financing
fatal flaw
standpoint
with enron being the lessor
i've been summoned to nowhere north carolina
rocky mount
for the remainder of the day and tomorrow
and will be back on friday am
anne
i hope this helps keep you moving
lisa
many
many thanks
kay kay
i suspect that there are several options
he is such a sweet
cute
smart thing
you will like him
he is very very charming
let's just assume i'll be out friday afternoon
hi cheryl
i'm looking for the executed version of the contract with westinghouse for the 0d turbine
which i believe was originally headed to panama
ena is looking to use it in a project or two
and i need to give a look
an electronic version would be fine
thanks
kay
here's something to work with
virginia power and ena agree that virginia power will authorize and pay for the ________ so that the queue
que
spot for necessary interconnection
right
will be maintained
ena agrees that should ena
or its affiliate
fail to complete negotiations and excute a power purchase and sale agreement
it will reimburse virginia power up to half of the cost of the _______
heather
this is a study
ie
soft cost
right
not to exceed a reimbursement of $0,0
great
i'm gone
i'll have my cell phone on later
friday am is the only time this week that works for me
here's what i sent to rusty on wednesday
it seemed like an option didn't quite fit
since pacs doesn't have anything to option
strictly speaking
kay
how transparent is that
hi lupe
i heard a rumor that tribasa had found somebody to buy out the loan
another victim
perhaps
i can't imagine how you must have felt to get a call from don
maybe he's looking for a new opportunity in mexico
since bufete didn't pan out
i've been busy working on a read deal with some very bright commercial people
it is very challenging
sometimes i feel so uninformed
this is a nice change
i feel like it is elevating my professional development
i ran into chip recently
he seems happier now that he has erik's old job
more hugs
kay
gentlemen
any progress on the summary
thanks
kay
hi karen
did i mess up
i saw herman and he told me that the 0am was held
i hope i wasn't supposed to be there
please call if i can help
kay
please send me a copy of the data sheet on the above company
thanks
kay
nancy
please incorporate this language from enron's tax guys
thanks
kay
scott's done the difficult part and generated something for review
i've added my comments
sheila
would you like to add your 0 cents worth
thanks
kay
allyson
as you know
we have had discussions with the city of rocky mount regarding possibly buying gas from them for the new power plant in edgecombe county
evidently
the gas company has figured this out
and is not happy with this prospect
we would like your opinion concerning the city's ability to
a
require that a tap be made so that the power plant be served and
b
sell gas to enron for this purpose
when considering these issues
please assume that the city would own and annex the land
and lease it to an enron entity
we will need the gas by next march or april
so time is critical
should the gas company decline
what is the appeal process and how long can it be expected to take
do you have any suggestions for expediting the process
i am having the contracts between the gas company and the city sent to you
and you should have them by monday
thank you for your assistance
kay
i wish i could say that's the reason we haven't heard anything
i suspect we would have heard if they had a problem with it being wordperfect
i hope this doesn't mean they haven't tried to open it yet
i have complained about eecc contracts using wordperfect
as far as i know
it is the only enron group still using it
eecc legal uses word
i always figured this wordperfect thing was intentional
which is why i had wordperfect loaded on my computer
i don't think i can make the conversion from home due to download problems
i will see that you get a converted copy
kay
hmm
what hotel would be the closest to the willard
other than the marriot
which i'm not wild about because it is so big
what does the hay adams have
alternatively
what do you suggest in georgetown
do you know if anyone else from enron has stayed there
the four seasons
recently
thanks for asking
by the way
i'm travelling on monday
so please ask my assistant
suzanne adams for a copy
i'm new to this particular group in legal
so i'm still learning who does what
no offense intended
this deal has a lot of life and potential
so i look forward to getting to know you in the process
kay
the attached is the version of the contract which is under internal review and has therefore not been sent to vepco
warning
the black lining may not be much help to you
depending on which version you last reviewed
we are meeting with vepco on tuesday to iron out the remaining issues
and would like to send them this version in advance of that meeting monday afternoon
with apologies for the short notice
any input you might want to give would be appreciated
we would like to send them this version
with internal revisions
in advance of that meeting
therefore
please email me any proposed changes
or leave me a voice mail at x0
fyi
the goal is to have this part of the deal completed prior to august 0
thank you for your assistance
kay
hi again
i checked my maps of dc
and it looks like the hotel washington might be a good alternative
could you see what they have for mon/tues night
also
please check back with the willard to see if they have had any cancellations
could you email me your telephone number and the afterhours number
due to the shortage of time
please call me with any information you might have
i should be in my office from 0 until 0
ex 0 if i'm not there
i'll be checking messages
thanks
kay
feel free to copy all you want
assuming there is nothing too compromising
a small step for man
hi suz
please print email and attachment
and fax to me at the willard
i'm in room thanks
kay ps how was pappas
good job ric
hi ben
just wanted you to know that i received your email
and will follow through on the change order
i should be in the office on thursday am
if not sooner
as you can see
i'm picking up email
and can also be reached on my cell phone
i reviewed your email re
vepco
we do have a project entity to use
and accounting
and global finace
have been involved on the mtm and off balance sheet issues
i suspect we will find out about the need for a guarantee soon
it was good to get your input on vepco
there's lots to do on that one
kay
sorry to miss your birthday
did you have one in my honor
you know i really did have one for you on vacation
points well taken
some we have already addressed
others probably need to be tied up better
see you soon
by the way
it hailed in dc today
looked good from the bar at the willard
kay
hi carlos
i'm back in dc
at the willard
so i'm thinking of you
we
the commercial leads and i
will be in richmond tomorrow for negotiations
then back tomorrow night at the willard
i hope things are ok for you
i know it is probably stressful
hang in there
kay
this is so sad
but then again
god works in very mysterious ways
if things are going to fall apart soon anyway
jim and his family have been in my prayers
this must be very hard
most hotels have a 0 to 0 oclock the same day policy
that's pretty awful
i agree that we need a
standard
way of moving the turbines
and transformers
into other structures
both the ge contract for the lm 0's and the abb transformer contract envision such moves
in addition
the ada's with westlb anticipate these moves
i'm sure you've heard plenty about all of this
i've been working on developing on some of the forms required to take some of this
global finance will coordinate other aspects of it
i believe we are in pretty good shape conceptually to take care of all of it
but we should plan 0 to 0 weeks to get the documents completed
i don't see any problem with this
i just wanted you to be aware of some of the logistics
i'll be in the office tomorrow if you would like to discuss this
kay
i can understand how that can be a problem
certainly
every effort can be made to expedite the process
and i do think the first time will take the longest for obvious reasons
for the purposes of scheduling going forward
i think it would help to keep that type of time frame in mind
with the thought that maybe it can happen more quickly
kay
hi gregg
i'm back
i don't know what the deal was with my cell phone this week
perhaps the problem was the weak signal in the area
several people commented that they had problems reaching me
and my phone was on almost the entire time
in fact
i made many calls
but i ususally checked to see if i had a signal first
sorry for the inconvenience
i'll take a look at the dash
etc
and get up to speed so that i can speak intelligently
kay
fyi
bob
here's the bill of sale we didn't use on the last deal
i don't know how much good it will do you
but at least it gives you some tax language
as i mentioned
the last deal was supposed to be a
wire me money
i'll sell you stuff
deal
but it didn't happen
i'd like to see the installment sale form once it gets fixed up
if possible
kay
fyi
i don't think she finished her thought
i'll check with allyson on this
kay
allyson
thank you for the email
it seems to stop in mid sentence
so i was wondering if maybe something got deleted
we have an interest in having the application for the cpcn amended to be less specific on the equipment we will be using
i believe jeffrey may have mentioned this to you before
we would like to follow up with that now
unless there is some significant problem with it
thank you
kay
i have meeting with a different specialist for michael next wednesday at 0
i will need to leave by 0
hi nancy
i am planning to make the changes which arose out of our meeting with vepco
when we met with them
we agreed that we would accept all the changes in this draft
then blackline against it
i tried to do this to this document
then realized that this is a compared document as opposed to a draft marked with changes
can you email me unmarked version which contains all these changes
and i'll start from there
i apologize if i already have the clean draft
but i want to be certain that i am working from the correct version
thanks
kay
allyson
thank you for your prompt response
can you describe the process and timing for filing a project update
thanks
kay
i'm leaving in a couple of minutes
i just wanted some extra quiet time
absolutely
morning is better for me
as i have a meeting at 0 this afternoon
i spent some time with rose and humberto yesterday
discussing the logistics and options in connection with this and city of austin
kay
hi kathy
i'm in the office today
if you want to finish up abb
ben jacoby and jody pierce will need copies
if you will be making copies for distribution
we can talk about the lm0 change order #0
also
thanks
kay
gentlemen
i thought i would pull together a brief email outlining where we are on certain tasks
here goes
hub agency agreement
gregg recently met with peoples to discuss some of the outstanding commercial issues relating to the hub agency agreement
roy is putting together a summary of the outcome of that meeting
gregg and i decided it would be better to not send peoples the current draft of the agreement which has been circulated internally
but instead will send a draft which incorporates the outcome of these discussions
memo regarding restricted activities
david has prepared a draft for enron's review
here's the draft
gregg and i need to review it
gregg and peoples have been working on the grandfathered transaction list
since both sides are running behind on this
david prepared a very straight forward amenment to the llc agreement
exending the time frame for finishing the task
here it is
policies
gregg
policy man
penman has been working on a credit policy
cash management policy
risk management policy
and probably a couple of others i'm forgetting
revolving line of credit
gregg has been working the internal enron system to get approval for a $0mm line of credit for meh
he has raised the issue of peoples needing to provide a guarantee for their half
also
it may be necessary or advisable to document that the line of credit will be paid before any distributions are made to either member
this is still under internal review at enron
i will check around to see if corp
the lender
has a form of credit facility we should use
miscellaneous
decide about services agreement confidentiality agreements transfer pricing documentation other agreements
isda
gisb
peaking agency
third party master
board resolution appointing officers/managers budget and marketing plan other administrative functions
per gregg's business setup items list
hope this is helpful
kay
hi there
could you please print these for me
thanks
fyi
i'm going to antitrust training from 0 to 0
bet you are jealous
kay
attached is a recent version of the vepco ppa
which is currently be revised

this is why i never throw anything away
kay
david

but it should be over by then
kay
fyi
as i'm sure you've figured out
this is vepco
hi ken
i have two tickets available for saturday night if you still want them

thanks
kay
sounds good to me
i'm in eb 0
hi guys
i want to make sure that you are comfortable with whatever services are being provided by piper rudnick
so that there won't be any surprises when the bill comes in
could you give me a brief outline of their scope
thanks
kay
here's the risk management policy gregg has been working on for meh
jeff
i don't know if you have seen this
so i thought i would float it by you
david
i'm sending it to you so that you can comment about any concerns you might have relating to the llc agreement
thanks
kay
sheila
for your information
gregg
0ish looks good for both david and me
if you would like to call me
we can conference in david
thanks
kay
gorman's will be picking up/delivering on tues/fri
they had mon/thurs available
but monday am is too hard to remember
besides
delmis may be able to bring our clothes in on tuesdays
and i'm generally home early on friday
our driver's name is david
his cell phone is 0 0 0
we can call him if we ever need pick up/delivery on a different day
he will leave us a sack today
how's that for cool
kay
please compare this new document
to this old draft
and create a redline
thanks
kay
both are in vepco
names under the word icon on the email
i'll try to remember next time
here's the most recent version of the document formerly known as the ppa
kay
i got my hair cut
it feels so good to get it cut
i'm planning on going as scheduled
do lots of people go to this
what was i thinking
sounds good
i'm on a conference call that won't end
i received your fax and will try to call you this afternoon
do i have original
initialled documents to which i can add the signature pages
you may have given this to me already
thanks
kay
here's the clean version
no redline
of the most recent draft of the ppa
i have no idea what happened with the redline
but i'll try to get a decent one done
what can i say
here's the tubine torture possibilities as they exist at this point in time
i am attaching a redline of a revised version of the document formerly known as the ppa
this is compared against the august 0 draft
i am sending it without anyone else reading it
a gutsy and foolhardy move
so it is subject to further enron review
thanks
kay
this is hilarious
and so true
we are doing fine here in the sauna
despite the heat and horrible pollution
no big news to report
which is good
hope all is well with your bunch
give lou a howdy and a hug for me
kay
from bev
pretty good stuff
hi dutch
my email did not go through to jeff or john
could you please forward it to them for me
thanks
kay
i may be on the road tomorrow
won't know until later
so something early afternoon friday would be best for me
thanks
kay
in speaking with allyson
she believes we need to have the responses the public staff's data request no later than sometime next week
the staff wants to have a meeting or conference call to discuss our responses during the week of august 0th
therefore
allyson suggests that we have a call this week to discuss how and when we will pull this information together
sounds like a good idea
please let me know when you are available for the call this week
i suspect it will take between 0-0 minutes
also
please let me know if you have not received a copy of the data request
as these should have arrived via company mail
thanks
kay
hi there
when i was at monday's astros
game
i thought i heard them say that enron is sponsoring some type of kid's book drive at next sunday's game
i have quite a few gently used kids books i am looking to give away
so i was wondering if i could do it in connection with that program
i will not be at the game sunday
and i didn't locate a reference to the program on your website
is there a way for me to donate kids books for whatever program enron is sponsoring
without going to the game
many thanks
kay mann
hooray
if i'm paid up with hays mcconn through the month
i'll continue with it until the end of august
if we move michael to public school and save a $0 on parking
things may start to add up
we could pay for a nice little trip somewhere
will you be in friday
if so
could you help me remember to pick up my parking card
i finally got a slot at the met
thanks
kay
i'm flying to somewhere
probably dc
tonight
returning on friday
ozzie is making the travel arrangements
so you don't need to do anything
i'll let you know what else i find out
thanks
kay
virginia power has raised a question about wanting some type of guaranty or other form of performance security should an enron llc sign the contract
what can we propose
or exclude
under the contemplated structure
thanks
kay
attached for your information/review is the latest draft of the vepco contract
thanks
kay
i'm headed to virginia tonight
and should be back friday am
could we push back the conference call to the afternoon
heather will have the same travel schedule
thanks
kay
i'll keep in touch
my copy printed completely
let me see what's up
thanks for the input
i'll see what we can figure out
appt is at 0
i wanted to leave at 0
please resend the august 0 redline to the virginia power people on the list i gave you
thanks
kay
you know how remote control
how fun
nepco's position sounds more typical for a cost plus contract
is this a lump sum deal
if so
then i think nepco is taking an aggressive approach to both lol and retention
a 0% limit of liability during the warranty period is particularly aggressive
unless there are a lot of carve outs to the limit of liability
and other give-and-takes which make it make sense
another factor which might make a difference is the treatment given to the ge contract
is nepco taking risk on ge performance
and is the dollar value of the ge equipment included in the price used to figure the % of liability
i'm glad to discuss this if i can be of help
kay
kathy
could you please accommodate karen's request
if you would like
you can just send it to me and i will get it to her
if you have delivered my original to me i can make make her a copy
thanks
kay
i can send you what i have on the westlb stuff
but it may not help too much if you are trying to figure out how to get turbines into a project
we are currently working on the mechanics relating to that
it may take a while to get a copy
as i don't have an electronic version and i'm currently in meetings where i'm using my hard copy
how soon do you need it
kay
i don't know if he has the financing docs
hi mike
in a meeting friday afternoon with ben jacoby
he mentioned that he didnt want the change order signed quite yet
i suspect he wants to review it before it is signed
and he's on vacation this week
kay
kathy
i believe ben needs to initial the change order
and he's on vacation this week
kay
here it is
please let me know if you have any problems with this document
kay
help
what's my r/c number
is it 0
does that look like an rc
we need to get an invoice from the travel agency heather and ozzie used for my flights last week
i know the travel agent's name is julie
but i don't know the details
the agency is something like vitol
i suspect claudette can give you the telephone number
etc
i would have gotten a receipt from continental
but the e ticket machine wasn't working
i have the rest of the receipts
i'm still not wild about 0.0
which says they have no liability for any advice they give us which is not required by the agreement
it seems that we could get into an argument about causation of a problem
and what was in/out of their scope under the agreement
i don't know that i have any brilliant ideas about how to narrow this carve out
i guess we could say no liability so long as the advice is clearly outside the scope of work
and is given in good faith and in accordance with industry standards
just to catch you up a bit
0.0 separate advice or assistance
if seller furnishes purchaser with advice or assistance which is clearly not required by this agreement
selleshall not be subject to any liability whether in contract
warranty
tort
including negligence or strict liability without regard to fault
indemnior otherwise in connection with seller,s provision of such out of scope of service advice or assistance
so long as such advice or assistance is givenin good faith and in accordance with industry standards
hi rob
i think we would prefer if you would route the document back this way
and sheila or i will send it to the folks at ge
thanks
kay
could you please go through the option agreement i have in my directory on o
it is under option agreements
and it is the only document there
it should be called fehr land option
or something similiar
please go search and make optionor plural throughout
and make the grammar match
i started making the changes
but got distracted from the task
thanks
kay
i'm scheduled to be here
tomorrow and wednesday are pretty bad
but thursday and friday are wide open
kay enron north america corp
karen
please forward the revisions once you get them
thanks
kay
fyi
i'm going to miss you really badly
are you sure you want to go to the cool air
unwind
sip wine and eat delicious food
and miss all this
i shouldn't have looked at that when i'm so hungry
what an incredible menu
and in a relatively small town
you better take a wad of fatburners
just being out of this nasty smog will be great
plus
i bet it is nice there when the sun goes down
what a great time of year to make that trip
can you hear my heavy sighs
it is time for me to plan something fun
even a short trip
planning and looking forward to it is 0/0 the fun
here's where we stayed on our honeymoon www.whalewatchinn.com
i have an extra i can send you today
kay
thursday afternoon would be best for me
enron north america corp
just a reminder to send me the description you gave the school
hi brian
what a great surprise
life is pretty good
to see a summary
you might want to check out paige's website
i tried to copy that as a link
but i think i messed up
i guess peggy told you
or you figured out from my email address
that i'm working at enron
i like it
i enjoy being back downtown after being a suburban lawyer
home life is relatively calm
which has always been a goal of mine
i'm dealing with my folks getting older
with the health problems which come with that process
overall
i'm very blessed and happy
how about you
if you are spending time at hm
you must still be doing the law thing
i might have lost a bet on that one
so how's your life
paige completed her minor in german
consider it a wunder legacy
her brother
michael is a real charmer
you would get a huge kick out of him
thanks so much for writing
i can't wait to hear what is going on with you
kay
hi guys
is the 0d in storage
if not
when will it be delivered
i'm asking in connection with information to be provided in the cpcn process
thanks
kay
could we benefit from an internal meeting prior to the call
kay
we are at the mou stage
need to keep off the balance sheet duly noted and emphasized in a commercial meeting last friday
commercial leads at ena and global finance are out this week
so no progress at the moment
the information i was given is that we want to get it done by the end of september
how does this sound
kay ps also includes 0 transformers
heather
did you want to send this
anything else you want to add
lm's # 0-0
0-0
plus a couple of abb transformers
bill
i'm attaching an electronic copy of the letter we sent to westinghouse
if you email me your fax number
i'll fax you their response
thanks
kay
hi there
paige is still here
i think she may leave tomorrow
have you ever visited her website
here's a link
you might trying clicking on the link to see if it takes you directly to her web page
she will have the same email address again this year
i suspect she will have the same mailing address as well
since it is a box number
michael slept well this weekend
he had a great birthday
he takes his dinosaur everywhere
it is so funny
because the button gets pushed accidently when it is being hauled around
so it is constantly growling
we saw a few drops of rain
but nothing to help the water bill
the smog is horrible
i'm in town all week this week
which is nice
neil and i have a birthday party to go to for our neighbor donnie
he was at the party
on friday
so michael will spend some time with charlotte again
she should be off of most of her restrictions tomorrow
so maybe he will get to see her more
we went to the astros game last night
and they actually won
sammy sosa hit a home run harder than any i've seen before
even some of the astros fans clapped at the sheer force of it
the pitcher said he watched it
just because he had never seen such an awesome hit
too bad about the heat
but what the heck can you do about it anyway
love
kay
just a reminder about tomorrow's call
enron participants
we will have a conference room on the 0th floor of eb available
kay
if it didn't come up when you put your cursor on it and click
then you'll have to type in the address in address space when you are on the internet
or
you can search paige record southwestern university on the web and find it
hope this helps
kay
in an effort to pull the pieces together
a meeting has been scheduled to discuss the draft energy and capacity contract
formerly the ppa
it is scheduled for thursday
august 0th
at 0am
we are still in the process of locating a conference room
so the location is tbd
thanks
kay here are the most recent comments from vepco
some of you may have received this already
i have not compared it against what we last sent them
please make sure sheila has the host code
thanks
yes
sheila said her assistant arranged for one
could you check
at least drinks and coffee
thanks for thinking of it
hi
my name is kay
and i'm a diet coke addict
suzanne
i left the response
which is a letter from siemens westinghouse
on the part of my desk which is next to the window
i may have put it in a file folder labeled
westinghouse
the letter references a letter we sent to them in the first line
please find the letter and fax to bill
thanks a bunch
it would be very helpful if you could participate
or have your designee participate
sorry for the short notice
what else is new
perhaps we can also arrange a discussion about the interconnection agreement
i'm out this am
but will pick up voice mail
thanks
kay ps i can't wait to hear about st
lucia
i assume that this is in lieu of the meeting we had scheduled for tomorrow afternoon
just want to make sure
kay
i've scheduled the conference room for 0 hours
we are also looking at friday am
is friday better for you guys
kay
there's a meeting with a cast of characters to discuss the westinhouse warranty issues
it is tomorrow
thurs
at 0
do you have any interest in sitting in
kay
what did heather tell you
couldn't tell if you saw this
sounds good so far
this replaces the meeting scheduled for 0 tomorrow
i have a heavy meeting/conference call schedule
to be honest with you
i'm a bit unclear on who is doing what with this
any advice/insight
kay
the room is 0ac0c0
according to this email
i didn't check to see what it was before
cr
aka conference room
0c0
i know they are in the allen center
i'm just damn smart
that's all
you are a big help
not finished yet
looks like thursday at 0pm is working out for most people to meet to discuss the vepco ppa
the meeting will be held in eb0c0
please let me know if you have any questions or comments
kay
yikes
would you have just 0 minutes sometime during the afternoon tomorrow
i really struck out with everyone else for friday
otherwise
i'll be glad to schedule a meeting on friday
in addition to this one tomorrow
to review the structure with the various players
you pick a time
the earlier being better for me
thanks
kay
here is the latest version
our meeting is scheduled for tomorrow at 0 in kay
here
tis
and i'm a yes
i'm going to visit with the hermanator briefly tomorrow
would you like to join me
kay
done
see you then
i've asked heather and jeffrey keenan to join me
kay
fyi
i hope to go
at least friday/saturday
assuming we have a sitter for michael
of course
i met mrs
kerekgarto yesterday
chris duerr
duerrc@spring-branch.isd.tenet.edu
maybe you should ask to visit which ever classroom chris thinks michael would be in assuming he started at vo on september 0
just a suggestion
or maybe you can visit more than one class
you might want to ask to visit a class during an academic time
as opposed to when the kids are in centers
here is a rough draft of the fehr option
herman
you will be happy to know that this one is much shorter
it needs some clean up
but this should be enough to get comments going
kay
just a reminder that until the finance arrangements are fixed and the rules are clear
enron can't incur any hard costs related to the virginia power deal
this means enron can't obligate itself to purchase any equipment or materials
or enter into any services agreements except for studies
etc
i will try to get some clarification on what can be done at this point
and will pass it along as soon as possible
kay
hi jo
i left you a voice mail
but being an email addict i thought i would send you a note as well
our son
michael is in a montessori kindergarten
which we have decided may not be most suitable for him
we discussed it with vivian shudde
and she suggested that i give you a call about the grace school
my husband and i would like to visit grace
we are wondering if it might be possible to visit tomorrow
please let me know what you think
thanks
kay mann
don't forget the progress report
thanks
kay
hi john
looks like it is worthwhile to finish up what you were working on before
thanks
kay
yes
jo
we had some unexpected complications with scheduling today
we'll have to reschedule
thanks for such a prompt reply
kay
he's doing great today
he's here with me
he just attended a meeting with ozzier
heather
herman and sheila
sounds good
early in the week is better for me
here's a suggestion for the equipment question
ena and its affiliates have contractual rights to numerous turbines
several of which can satisfy the technical and scheduling requirements of this project
and some of which are already manufactured
in the case of turbines still in the manufacturing process
ena has firm commitments for delivery
backed by liquidated damages clauses and other financial incentives
hope this helps
fyi
if you are doing the deal with eecc or nepco
i would just as soon them not see these docs
here are my comments to the draft response
0
i'm a bit troubled by the first sentence
since i really don't know what may have been on the drawing board earlier
maybe someone else can vouch for this statement
otherwise
i suggest deleting it
0
the reference to nc power utilizing the plant should be applicant
third sentence
0
i would change the second sentence to begin
it is intended that the plant will be designed
constructed and operated
kay
hi there
we've had about 0 minutes of rain
i think
just enough to keep the mosquitos happy
kay
that would be great
kay mann 0 inverness park way houston 0 thanks
kay
hi dina
do we have a ca with teska associates
thanks
kay
one more ca question
pollina corporate real estate
thanks
kay
i believe this draft reflects herman's comments
kay
i'll check on the geotech
what is involved in the site development plan
don't give up
there may be a way to get this done
kay
hi gerry
enron is a great place for an engineer to work in a non-technical position
in fact
i work with reformed engineers daily
in various capacities
enron has an analyst program for college graduates
where the analysts go through six month rotations in various parts of the business
in addition
there is a good job search feature on enron's website
if you see something that looks promising
i'll check things out around here to see if i can get the inside scoop
fyi
enron north america
enron broadband
and enron energy services are good choices
ena is the old enron capital
trade
so it is the real heart of enron
yes
it is where i now work
enron is also focusing on industrial development
paper
steel
and who knows what else
i don't suggest eecc
hope to see you soon
kay
i'm hearing rumblings about the need to perform various preliminary tasks
survey work
etc
i've given the admonition to avoid incurring hard costs until the financing/accounting treatment has come together
that lead to the question of what is a hard cost
i know construction/equipment obligations are problems
studies generally ok
this leads me to the conclusion that a geotechnical survey would be ok
am i safe here
thanks
kay
karen
both lisa bills and rose engeldorf are out of town this week
which means we don't have all the players from global finance available
humberto
can't remember how to spell his last name
from global finance/ena may be available
and he has participated in similar discussions on two other projects
at some point he will need to be involved
the time is fine with me
kay
hi nancy
this should do it
hi matt
ena is selling some of the lm0's to esa
will you be the ena tax man on the deal
thanks
kay
back at cha
reagan
just to clarify
we intend to assign the land option to rocky mount
they buy it and lease the land to us once they own it/annex it/zone it
kay
hi gloria
could you please print these for me
thanks
kay
just in case you haven't seen a copy
ncng has filed a petition to intervene in the cpcn proceeding
the reason stated is that it isn't clear who is providing the natural gas
it has asked for the right to examine and cross-examine witnesses
to file briefs and argue its position
etc
kay
allyson
please delete stuart zisman and add me to your distribution list
thanks
kay
no problem
i like this answer
i'm going to have an updated contact list prepared
please email me with your telephone
location
email address
and cell phone number
if desired
please let me know who should be added to this list
if you are receiving this vis a cc
i have your information
thanks
kay
here's two more to add
i suggest you put our outside counsel last on the list
there are two firms
kilpatrick
stockton and bracewell
patterson
i would put bracewell before kilpatrick
thanks bunches
here's the current redline
incorporating most of the comments made last week
herman
the language to address your biggest issue is in 0.0
page 0 on the marked version
thanks
kay
more
for the bracewell part of the list
another print job
please make me a wheeling pitt file folder for these docs as well
thanks
kay
i'm keeping this one
too cool
this should be the final
or at least almost final
version
the amounts are correct
fyi
we had discussed having two change orders so that the esa stuff is easily identifiable/assignable/etc
is this still the plan
kay
per ray's request
fyi
i'm far afield of my area of expertise
but boyd's comments make a great deal of sense to me
gregg
did you/will you pass these along to perc
perhaps it would help if boyd could speak directly to the perc person with the typewriter
so to speak
kay
kevin
thank you for your work
i especially appreciate the memo bringing me kay
here's what i have
otra mas
did i get that right
hi ben
i've started a draft of the esa document
and i wanted to get your comments before i go much further
basically
i want to make sure i'm on the right track
i'll make it look pretty as we go along
getting the deal points are most important at this point
thanks
kay
sara
maybe a conference call with gregg would be the most productive way to go
kay
feels funny emailing someone so close
i'm addicted to email
however
i saw gregg in the elevator lobby as the door was closing
i'm going to see if i can corner him while he is in town to see what is going on
i'm not up-to-speed on this one
kay
good morning
here is the email you mentioned
have a great day
love
kay
i believe i have compared the ena aug 0 version to the vepco aug 0 version of the capacity and energy contract
i'm no expert at comparerite
but i believe it worked
here goes
let me know if you have any trouble opening this document
kay
the details for today's conference call are as follows
0:0 cdt call in number 0 0 0
participant code 0 rose is on vacation and sheila will be calling in from portland
i have a 0 conference call
but i will step out if i can
talk to you soon
kay
maybe spelling your name right will help this go through
sorry
july 0st for edgecombe
i didn't prepare the other option
but i'll check to see if there is a copy around
kay
i'm looking at the skelton option
hart county
ga
and can't figure out when it was executed
must confess i didn't read every word
can anyone help me with this
thanks
kay
chris
i would think that we would want to designate which units are affected by the provisions of the change orders
to the extent a the change is specific to certain units
what do you think about that approach
kay
i am still on my 0 conference call
i'll catch up on what i missed later
kay
glad you wrote
since i need to send you this option agreement for your review
i will chase down the fax and give it a look
thanks
kay
hi there
i have a personal errand to run
nothing bad
thursday am
so i won't be in until around lunchtime
can't wait to hear about your trip
i hope it was marvelous
we're looking at a private school for michael
st.francis
i think it is time for a change
kay
i need to talk to the commercial guy on the deal
got a name for me
thanks
kay
since the time frame is short
i wanted to give you an outline to mark here's how i understand the deal
people's has the manlove gas storage facility
we have presented to people's a nonphysical method to monetize it
similar to what was done with bammel
since this is a regulated asset
regulatory approval will be required
and the consumers will receive part of the benefit of the monetization
the essence of our deal is that enron will receive 0% of the net earnings
up to $0mm
as our fee
in consideration for this fee
enron takes the financial
legal
accounting and engineering lead
peoples and enron will work together on the regulatory strategy formulation and implementation
we want to present a draft mou to peoples this week
the basic goals are
define scope of the agreement define our lead role in the 0 stated areas create exclusivity for enron define financial arrangements
cost/profit
get an acknowledgement that what was presented to them was proprietary
and covered by our confidentiality agreement
define term
0 years
each party bears their own internal costs
and third party costs are split 0/0
with prior approval
in that regard an immediate concern is getting the engineering work kicked off
we want the agreement broad enough to cover physical withdrawals
we do not want it specific to this field
since we want the benefit of the use of our methodology
please correct/supplement
etc
thanks

enron pres
still committed to power generation business wednesday

mail this article to a friend by james covert new york
dow jones
despite an increasing emphasis on wholesale trading rather than asset ownership in its electricity operations
enron corp
ene
news
msgs
will continue to develop and purchase power plants
president jeffrey skilling told dow jones newswires on wednesday
generation assets are essential to a successful trading operation
skilling said
responding to recent trade reports that the company plans to exit the power generation business
the houston-based energy company is
absolutely not
selling its power plants as part of its strategy
he said
enron will continue to build and purchase natural gas-fired
peaking plants
which produce power only during times of high demand and wholesale prices
skilling said
enron has begun construction of a few such projects in the u.s
midwest and south
and will continue development chiefly in the u.s and europe
he said
the margins are higher
in wholesale power markets
in europe
skilling said
the market there is more fractional
and that creates more opportunities for someone who's playing across the board
developments in europe
particularly in southern europe
also offer a higher per-unit rate of return
skilling said
nonetheless
skilling did confirm that the company isn't interested in building larger-sized plants in any country
and that its construction goals may not be as lofty as those of other energy companies
we are not interested in building base-load plants
skilling said
referring to large power plants that produce power in steady quantities around the clock
base load simply delivers megawatts
that's a bulky
undifferentiated commodity
skilling said
but peaking plants allow us to play on the shape of the market of that commodity
skilling declined to give any projections or figures related to enron's future development plans
saying that they weren't set in stone
but skilling said the company generally aims to site power plants where there are bottlenecks in the transmission system
and that enron isn't focused on any one geographic region as opposed to others
there are companies out there saying they're going to build 0,0 megwawatts by such-and-such a date
and i don't really see how that's possible
skilling said
there are just too many variables to approach markets like that

i'm ready for another trip to chicago
to work on the details
the transfer pricing
the manlove monetization
etc
would a day next week be good
it would probably be helpful if laura had some availability as well
tuesday is bad for me
but wednesday or thursday looks good
i'll look over the list and give you a call after lunch
kay
if anyone asks
i would prefer to have gloria for our temp
thanks
kay
please hang on to this for future reference
thanks
kay
hi gregg
it looks good for tomorrow
i prefer not to schedule anything later than 0
if possible
just to give myself a chance to handle the end of the week kay
hi bob
does this have anything to do with the wisconsin site you mentioned in the staff meeting
thanks
kay
fyi
i'm talking to gregg on the phone now
kay
i saw something on the intranet which says you can check all your benefits
etc
including vacation time
it called for a password
did you receive a password for yours
i wonder if it is the same as the password when you submit benefits
any ideas
i wasn't sure if you got a copy of this
kay
laura
here's the revised version
here's a compared version so you will know what i did
i'll work on the transfer price agreement today or this weekend so we will have something to discuss
i'm planning on being in chicago on thursday if you would like to discuss any of these matters
kay
ben
here's a draft of an mou for the sale of the lms and abb equipment to esa
one issue is when this transaction can close
since the equipment is owned by westlb and since the feeling is we don't want to involve westlb in the transaction
the actual transfer would take place at the termination of the westlb facility
if another approach is preferred
we will need to circle back with lisa
a second issue i see is with the concept that ge will need to look to both ena
or westlb's successor
for some of the payments
but look to esa for payment for changes
storage
etc
as far as i know
this concept hasn't been addressed with ge
i re-calculated the overhead charge
so you might want to check it out
i look forward to your comments
kay
i'm reading it now
david
please change the date on the draft so that we won't confuse it with the prior drafts
i would delete

just in case i forget to mention it
i need to move our sf visit to friday am
due to travel plans
is this still ok with you
kay
i'm not particularly wild about many of the changes proposed by ge
seems that it would be a good idea to get a consensus on how to respond
here are the issues i see
indemnity issues
they should indemnify us from claims by their employees/subcontractors
indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence
what is a cognizant government
limit of liability issues
they want to limit their indemnity obligation to 0% of purchase price
they want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence
if possible
they don't want to clarify that they have to indemnify us for another party's claim for consequentials
as in a personal injury claim
we've don't have anything concrete on assignment yet
comments
sheila has asked that we change wednesday's call to 0 central
or 0 central if 0 doesn't work
is this a problem
kay they should have to
hi allyson
what is your impression of why the nc attorney general's office has intervened in the cpcn proceeding
is this typical
does the ag's office
or any other intervenor
have any special rights to discover any of the confidential information we file

this article was originally published monday
washington
dow jones
the federal energy regulatory commission has limited authority to address flawed electricity markets in california and alleged price gouging by power producers
but will act to overhaul the state's wholesale power markets if necessary
ferc chairman james hoecker told a congressional panel monday
the commission was ready to act once the results of an expedited staff investigation of problems affecting power markets in the u.s
west becomes available
hoecker said in testimony presented to a san diego field hearing of the house commerce committee's energy panel
if we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction
we will do so
hoecker told lawmakers
and if price gouging is occurring
as some have alleged
he added
we will respond accordingly
by revoking market-based rates or otherwise
however
hoecker stressed that the commission's authority is limited under the federal power act
the commission has limited ability to relieve the immediate customer crisis
important aspects of this problem are a state responsibility
such as authorizing construction of new generation and transmission facilities
hoecker testified
the commission can't act to limit prices charged by power providers
until we have a record supporting such action
he said
referring to the results of the pending staff investigation
further
he said
the law bars ferc from ordering retroactive refunds to san diego gas
electric co
for the power it purchased this summer to serve its retail customer base
hoecker testified before the house commerce committee's energy and power subcommittee
which is looking into the supply shortages in california this summer that have forced san diego electricity consumers to pay twice as much for power as they did a year ago
state mkt structure blamed for crisis the hearing comes after much wrangling at ferc
as sdg&e
a unit of sempra energy
sre
news
msgs
sought an order setting price caps for power bid into the state-sponsored electricity exchange
and power producers sought an order allowing cost recovery for lost opportunity sales if the state's independent grid operator curtailed sales outside california
where price controls don't apply
ferc hasn't yet responded to the producers
and deferred action on sdg&e's bid for price controls until the staff investigation is completed
but it left in place an order allowing the independent system operator to limit the price it pays for power
which acts as a de facto cap on prices bid into the power exchange
hoecker
while withholding judgment pending the staff probe
appeared to place much of the blame for this summer's crisis with the state-mandated market structure
which left san diego consumers subject to spot-market volatility
and he appeared to suggest that ferc's order directing utilities to transfer transmission assets to control of large regional transmission organizations
or rtos
will offer an opportunity to develop a regional solution to the power-supply problem
ferc deferred to california in restructuring the wholesale market in california because its experience with new market institutions such as power exchanges and isos was limited
hoecker said
other states
such as pennsylvania
were
less prescriptive than california in telling the commission how their wholesale markets should operate
hoecker noted
now
with ferc's order 0 encouraging formation of rtos
the commission is in a very different posture with respect to the structure of wholesale markets
he said
large regional markets can be made to work effectively
hoecker told the lawmakers
citing the pennsylvania restructuring as an example
other witnesses were more forceful in criticizing the state-mandated market structure
by requiring the state's three investor-owned utilities to purchase all their electricity from the power exchange and limiting their ability to hedge price risks by entering into long-term fixed-price contracts
the state left consumers subject to volatility in the state-mandated spot market
said officials with enron corp
ene
news
msgs
and reliant energy
rei
news

california's market structure
placed no economic incentives on the default utility providers to look out for the costs that are ultimately passed on to their consumers
reliant's john stout testified
san diego's experience offers the congress an unparalleled opportunity to learn from a bungled attempt at deregulation
said michael shames
executive director of utility consumer's action network
shames and other witnesses warned the congressional committee that california's electricity crisis is likely to occur in other regions of the country unless steps are taken to free up interstate trade in power and allow ferc to better police markets
california is just the latest problem area in u.s
power markets and
unless policymakers act quickly
it will not be the last
said enron corp
ene
news
msgs
steven kean executive vice president
unless congress and ferc are willing to address the interstate issues that are beyond the jurisdiction of state legislators and regulators
i predict that our experience in san diego is indicative of what others will encounter in trying to create a competitive electricity market
said edwin guiles
sempra's president of regulated operations
this electricity crisis is not a california-only problem
said rep
brian bilbray
r-calif
who represents san diego and requested monday's hearing
we will continue to be in this mess if state and federal officials don't work together to find long-term solutions to the flaws in the marketplace

in short
i've been enronized
i picked up your number on a scrap of paper instead of the travel agent's number
different scrap of paper i still have not found
and when you answered i couldn't figure out who i called
at least your email helped me get back to reality
i apologize for the confusion
for not getting back to you
etc
please don't read anything into it other than your glimpse into enron
my sense is i'd better not commit to anything this week
since i literally don't know whether i am coming or going
thanks

described by laura as being
like the bammel deal
if i can get laura to commit to a time
how about a conference call to discuss where to go with this
i'm taking the long way to chicago
via connecticut
but will be checking voice mail
etc
thanks
kay

i've checked with christi
mitch and reagan
so they don't need to confirm
details to follow
thanks
kay
please see if you can get a conference room
allowing 0 hours for the meeting
thanks
kay
i should mention 0am as the time
enron north america corp
russell
i don't believe we intend to qualify in all of those states
kay
please see if there is any way we can have it in the same elevator bank
i will ask to have it on 0
so you won't need to check there
hope you've had a great weekend
the weather was perfect
kay
hi reagan
is a conference room available on 0
we are having a hard time finding a meeting place
thanks
kay
what could be better than a meeting on an interconnection agreement
i know i need to organize another turn of the c&e agreement
i'm going to give it a look and see what open issues we might have
kay ps isn't the weather perfect
i thought of our friends in va and nc with the hurricane remnants headed their way
hope it isn't too bad
if i show
it will be only to lend support to those with real input
and to show legal department solidarity
ie
avoid later lawyer shopping
thanks for the info
kay
please calendar
also
thursday is my mom's birthday
so i need to remember to shop for her at lunch tomorrow
thanks
kay
hi sheila
shall we try to get the enron groups together to discuss the approach we want to take with ge in our next phone call
if so
please advise of any time you have available on monday
and i'll get it set up
thanks
kay
just want you to know that i should be getting an epc form to work on from eecc re 0
i didn't get to discuss this with j
schwartzenburg on friday
since i didn't see him for after work on friday
i opted to see michael instead since i had been out of town
i've got the form break out contract for the lm 0's
i'll get it ready for you to review re the esa deal
it will probably take me a few days to get it in shape to let it go
hope you've had a great weekend
i don't think the weather could have been better
kay
i'm trying to avoid a two elevator ride
if possible
god forbid i should take the stairs
i'll let you know what he comes up with
if anything
kay
fyi
reagan is a man
a developer in ben jacoby's group
i checked the paper for an obit about don
was there one
how was his mother
are you going to jillian's on thursday
can't wait to see pics
i'll be by soon
kay
power assets is currently sheila's group
pre-reorg
long conference calls make me happy about having email
do you want brian/lisa/anyone else commercial
kay
how about meeting in advance of tomorrow's 0 phone call to discuss the approach we want to take with ge
i'm suggesting 0 this afternoon
please let me know how this works for you
thanks
kay
i should have included you also
are you available
thanks
kay
lisa
i inadvertently left you off the list
hope you can come
kay
lisa bills and brian barto are also invited
i haven't heard from anyone yet
please call the list around 0 to see if people are available
also
can you find a conference room
thanks
kay
hi karen
i'm looking at a version which was faxed on sept 0
if this the final version
expecting the answer to be
yes
i am reviewing it now
kay
i suppose a location would help
location tbd
i'll make sure you get a call
kay enron north america corp
i can come
i'm looking at it right now
could you please email it to me
thanks
kay
my understanding is that illinois is the only one
unless enovate will have employees or inventory in any other states
it is my understanding that it will not
gregg
russell
matt
please speak up if i'm missing something
kay
i'm going to work really hard this week to see if i can catch up a bit
and take a day off soon
no surprises with cw
she's very nice to me
but she does like to keep very specific hours
i get the impression that leaving 0 minutes past 0 really bothers her
just watch
and see
karen
i don't run across many people without email these days
big hassle
it is so much easier to check for certain issues with an electronic copy
i'm looking for the fehr option
but the latest i have on my computer is the version i emailed to you on august 0th
is there a more up-to-date version
and if so
could you please mail it to me
thanks
kay
this makes me crazy
i ask her to send me a document
and she copies two partners on the transmittal
plus fred and rusty
good
i feel better
i just don't think we owe them enough yet
it is mainly a tax issue
whether we have to pay franchise tax
and ena tax says we don't need to register
at least that's how i understood it
i'll double check
we can do the name change and register later
that's no problem
kay
here are my observations
i agree with rusty re
the put option complicating things for us
second
there has to be an absolute end to this agreement at some point
if we want to have an automatic extension by commencing construction
there still needs to be a date certain after which we can go forward without them no matter what
in other words
if we want to add the language rusty suggested
it should be limited to x months after the expiration of the option agreement
we'll need to run this back through accounting
i really don't like the inclusion of the language in paragraph 0
if we add the language requested in paragraph 0
we need to run this agreement back through accounting
and we may need to add some other additional language
i don't know if rusty and fred think we may need a zoning change for this parcel
kay
due to a last minute conflict
we need to reschedule this meeting
how does everybody look for wednesday
sorry for any inconvenience
kay
karen
please send me the revised version with the language you believe reflects rusty's suggestion
otherwise
i will have to go to accounting twice
please email me with the specific performance language you want to add to meet their request
thank you
kay
viola
as soon as i get a redline
i'll get it to accounting and we can go forward quickly
i will also process the virgil and joan ledford deal at the same time
i just had a meeting cancel for tomorrow
which will help
kay
sorry for the inconvenience
ozzie had to leave town
and he wanted to participate in the first meeting
i'm sure we will get something worked out
kay
allyson
here is a very recent version of the ppa
kay
hi sara
i believe we still have an interest in using an enron form as a go by for the enron/peoples activities
if you can give me what you are comfortable with
i will make sure it is transmitted with the appropriate caveats
confidentiality restrictions
etc
thanks
kay
here tis
we'll be turning a new draft to peoples today or tomorrow
but i figure it needs to go to allyson now
kay
hi cle
we need a revolving loan agreement between midwest
now enovate
and enron
please call me at your convenience to discuss
0 0 0
thanks
kay
hi there
any luck with the form to work with on the affilate/epc/0 0 compliant contract
thanks
kay
hi allyson
someone was asking which of the information we have filed is public information
is the petition itself public
what else would be public
i know this is a variation to the
what is confidential
question
once again
your assistance is appreciated
kay
hi kay
i hate to admit this
but i need another copy of whatever confidentiality agreement we have with virginia power
thanks again
kay
this may be our best bet
this information is helpful
is the draft of the ppa submitted by vepco confidential
thanks
kay
hi heather
the confidentiality agreement signed by enron/vepco states as follows
except as required by law
neither party hereto nor their representatives will disclose to any person either the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place between them not any terms
conditions or other fact with respect to any transaction that may be proposed or undertaken
including the status thereof
we can loosen up the terms in the contract so that we can disclose certain terms to potential investors
i'll make that change
or we can discuss amending this agreement
additionally
it looks like we have the testimony and application filed with the public staff to work with
kay
one more thing
did someone send you copies of equipment contracts
those have confidentiality provisions which need to be considered
therefore
please advise what you received from enron in that regard
i was under the impression that most of what we were submitting we were submitting as confidential information
specifically including the responses to the public staff's data requests
i don't recall the specifics at this point
thanks again
kay
i don't know what i have in mind
austin
palacios
i'm still struggling with the concept that if we see my parents for a holiday
we have to include your mom
or vice versa
that just wasn't how it worked in our family growing up
we typically spent holidays with one or the other
rarely with both
i'm trying to figure out the rules
i haven't heard from st francis yet
kay
this is a very rough draft based on an agreement done previously with a jv company
i'm sending it for enron review only
since i haven't even read the entire thing yet
i thought you might want to take a look at it to see what you think
and to consider the scope of the services to be provided
as for legal services
one alternative would be to have the services provided by an outside law firm
not associated with either principal
could you forward me what you received from clement regarding the corporate guaranty issue
i would like to see what's the latest in that regard
thanks
kay
i think all of us who deal with assets are running across confidentiality hurdles in all kinds of agreements
including confidentiality agreements
in short
our business people need the ability to disclose agreements to potential purchasers of projects
contracts and assets
and not all of our forms allow this
i'm trying to include an exception for
potential lenders and investors
whenever i can
instead of just lenders
does someone have a more artful or effective solution
just wanted to share the thought so that more eyes could be watching for the issue

bandwidth trading activities
the company's chairman said tuesday that it has completed about 0 trades of telecommunications bandwidth
speaking at the dain rauscher energy 0 conference
enron chairman ken lay talked about the current status and futures plans the company has for bandwidth trading and broadband services
asked what kind of company enron is
lay gave an answer that shows the recent expansion of the company's business strategy beyond energy
enron is still basically
an energy and broadband company
he said
while energy is still the source of most of enron's revenue
lay's answer underlines the growth potential it sees in broadband services and bandwidth trading
a number of enron officials have been quoted in the last year as saying that
in a few years
it could be making as much money from those areas as it now makes from its lucrative natural gas and power businesses
enron plans to spend $0 million-$0 million this year and about the same amount over the next two to three years on broadband and bandwidth trading
lay said
it will spend more during that time if necessary
in fact
the company is planning to sell energy assets around the world in emerging markets that aren't growing quickly enough to meet enron's standards
proceeds will be deployed into businesses like broadband and bandwidth trading
which are growing more quickly
he said
in pioneering bandwidth trading as a commodity
enron's 0 bandwidth deals put it far ahead of competitors in that nascent market area
el paso energy corp
epg
news
msgs
officials have said they have done 0-0 bandwidth trades this year
companies like williams communications group
wcg
news
msgs
won't talk about the number of bandwidth trades they have made
bandwidth is the capacity to move data between two points on a telecommunications network
enron will finish deploying its domestic telecommunications network by the end of this year
lay said
some of the fiber-optic network will be lit
or made operational
this year with the rest to be lit later
the company has four bandwidth trading pooling points completed in new york
los angeles
las vegas and london
enron's current plans call for a total of 0 pooling points
bandwidth trading pooling points are facilities where telecom carriers can connect to each other to allow data to flow from one carrier to another
facilitating bandwidth trading
enron plans to begin delivering movies to home via broadband connections in december as part of its deal with blockbuster video and a number of telecom carriers
the deal is a 0-year exclusive
worldwide deal with a potential contract value of more than $0 billion to enron
according to materials the company handed out at the conference

hi guys
i'm trying to figure out what info we submitted from which turbine contracts
could someone please identify the contract and what was sent to allyson
thanks
kay
gregg
sheila was telling me that enron has an isda agreement with peoples
and there's some guaranty language there
also
i'll try to track this down
kay ps i've asked sara for the isda agreement
i'll let you know when i get it
my fax number is 0
fyi
i want to see if we are in compliance with the confidentiality provisions of those contracts
in fact
i would like to get a copy of the 0 d contract
i have the ge contract
do you have a copy of the entire thing
thanks
kay
so do you know where the piece of the contract came from
maybe we can track down the rest
i have seen an electronic copy of a contract which may or may not be the correct one since the delivery date is last june
i think ena needs a complete copy of the contract
including any executed change orders
do you think someone in your group might have that
many thanks
kay
i think it would be a good idea
we really need the entire executed contract
with change orders
opps
said that already
and i only have an electronic copy
no good deed goes unpunished
hi karen
our accounting contact is leaving tomorrow at 0
so it would be helpful to get this information as soon as possible
it would also help if you could send a redline against the version i had sent you
as this was the last draft reviewed by accounting
thanks
kay
nancy
i knew you were thinking about it
so i didn't worry
i'm monkeying around the ppa
only because i had a meeting with ozzie and heather late last night
will you be picking up emails in the next day or so
i can forward you what i've done for your review
we need to get a enron/bp dialogue going concerning the lease with the city of rocky mount
when do you want to discuss this
or have us discuss it with the right b
p person
thanks
kay
speaking of options
i don't think i saw that happen
i need to set up a conference call with the outside lawyer who will be drafting the lease
and other docs
who would like to participate in the call
how about thursday am
thanks
kay
viola
thank you for your response
it is always refreshing to get good news
i'm at home this am trying to get it finished up
i just couldn't get 0 clear minutes at the office
here are my comments
revise
whereas
clauses to make it an option for an easement
not a current grant of an easement
should we be able to enter all of parcel 0 for due diligence
as opposed to just the easement area
paragraph 0
matt
i wanted you to be aware of paragraph 0
kay
i'm at home this am
working
what do you think of this
sorry it isn't redlined yet

i called in for the finance meeting
i'm trying to finish up an important document and could never get a half hour without interruption
i should be in after lunch
kay
i've returned the staff's phone call
but got voice mail
it would be helpful to discuss this before i talk to them
could we schedule something around noon
or later
thanks
kay
now you know why i'm at home
i just checked my messages
nothing from sf yet
maybe we give it a couple of hours
i'm getting nervous
but i tell myself that whatever works out will be for the best
no problem
i got some comments from accounting
but i'm fine if you want it to go out with the caveat that enron has a couple of minor administrative points to clear up
kay
i know i'm repeating myself
thank you
thank you
thank you
i'm working as fast as i can
things connect together
so it takes a little while
i think i'm about done with the hard stuff
i still have to fix the liquidated damages/termination stuff
but here's a redline for you to look at
i picked up the comments from others
terry
christi
and these should be lined as well
i should be done soon
i'm losing it
glad you looked
i need to provide the ncpuc a copy of the incorporation documents as soon as i can
how long will it take
kay
i spoke with bob henson
his questions were
ownership of llc
i'm getting the documents
and status of ppa
kay
yikes
i think i'd still rather be a woman
although now i can't remember why i feel that way
got anything
should have been signed this year
thanks
kay
i think the llc agreement would be a big help
thanks
yes
and please add me
too
i can't remember if i mentioned that before
this friday
michael goes for a visit at st
francis
which may be his new school
so far
so good
i'll be in around0 most fridays i'm going to try to pick michael up since i'm away so much
which means leaving by 0 or so
october 0
ena orientation in the am
october 0/0
neil is out of town
so i have to pick michael up from school
leave at 0
october 0/0
hope to be vacation time
neil has a meeting in san antonio
usually it is in miami
san francisco
phoenix
not so great this year
it is the officer's meeting for enterprise
and spouses are invited
this means we won't be in town for the compaq thing
figures
of course
thanks for asking
i'm watching for some good vacation days
also
we are staying at the hyatt hill country resort
which is nice
there will be a private party as seaworld
which could be fun
they usually do everything first class all the way
since it is the officers shindig
i get to see some nice people i only see once a year
everyone parties hard
too
diet time
i've done ok so far
considering the travel
this means i've lost the weight i gained when i was on the road every week
i have a couple of questions so i can wrap up the loi
we refer to licensed fuel cell energy equipment
do we intend to reference a particular manufacturer
or should this be more generic
do we want to attach a draft of the development agreement
and condition the final deal on agreeing to terms substantially the same as what's in the draft
i have a concern that the enron optionality bug could bite us on the backside with that one
do we expect to have one epc contract
or several
i'm looking for the confidentiality agreement
which may be in bart's files
haven't checked closely yet
if anyone has it handy
it could speed things up for me
thanks
kay
forget the one or more contract questions
i see we expect to have separate contracts for each project
enron north america corp
on the issue of the contracts
the draft says that the $0m is paid when the epc contract is signed
are we expecting that the portion attributable to each project will be paid as the individual epc contracts are signed
thanks
kay
remarkably clear explanation
here's a draft letter for crra
i didn't send it to jeff since he is out today
kay
hi cle
fyi
kay
i think you and i may have different documents
maybe we should compare
thanks
kay
what time
fyi
meeting is at 0
per your request
fyi
no action requested at this time
being first is overrated
is it time yet
allyson
you should receive some formation documents relating to edgecombe development
the name is not spelled correctly
missing an
e
but that is being corrected at this time
bob spoke to me about wanting enron to send a letter concerning the financing arrangements for the project
i would like for us to discuss this as well
kay
this is a comparison to their version
i think i have a comparison to ours as well
kay
a comparison to ours
kay
hi gregg
i was out of the office on friday
so i just now heard your voice mail
i haven't been through all my email
but i haven't seen anything from stephanie on email
i do have a hard copy version which is too long to fax with confidence
i'll give the forms a look
and fax them your way with some type of disclaimer for peoples benefit
kay
i've worked with kilpatrick stockton's north carolina office quite a bit
mostly regulatory
they are so so
it is my understanding that the atlanta office messed up a simple thing for lisa
and that's all i know about them
i've worked extensively with king
spalding
both their houston office
multiple matters
and atlanta
two matters
and have had good results
i've always worked through john keffer in houston
who then hooked me up with the right folks in atlanta
kay
okey dokey
wanna go
sounds like fun to me
michael will love it
kay
sounds good to me
i'll check with neil
i know michael would love it
thanks
kay
hi john
question
can we agree that a form contract will work for both eecc and nepco
sure would make life easier
kay
pretty small stuff from a dollar standpoint
perhaps the sky is not falling
gentlemen
i've recently become involved in the
cell sale
side
meaning the transaction to sell the fuel cell equipment cells to crra
i've met the fuel cell folks
but have not met anyone with crra yet
currently
i'm preparing a letter of intent for enron/crra for the purchase/sale of the cells
have a development agreement prepared by outside counsel to review
and need to come up with a draft purchase agreement for fce to review
i'll make sure dan is in the loop on as much of that as he cares to read
i've heard a rumor of an issue regarding the authority of crra to purchase the equipment
perhaps relating to the use of bond money for the purchase
but haven't come up to speed on that issue yet
i would like to chase down that issue some more before a loud alarm is sounded
however
i'll get a grasp on the hearing protocol
as i know dave is very interested in that aspect of the process
kay
per your request
kay
this is an internal draft
which has not been sent to crra
as far as i know
kay
here's my suggestion
0.0 consequential losses
the parties have agreed to liquidate certaindirect damages and have provided for these damages as liquidated damages ancancellation fees
for purposes of this section
liquidated damages and cancellation fees shall not be deemed consequential losses
in no event,whether as a result of breach of contract
breach of warranty
indemnity,tort liability
including negligence or strict liability without regard tofault
or otherwise
and whether arising before or after completion of thescope of work
shall either party be liable to the other party for special,indirect
exemplary or consequential losses of any nature whatsoever
including losses or damages caused by reason of unavailability of the equipment
shutdowns or service interruptions
loss of use
loss of profitsor revenue
inventory or use charges
cost of purchased or replacement poweinterest charges or cost of capital or claims of a party,s customers
for the avoidance of doubt
the foregoing limitation of liability in this section shall in no case not limit seller,s obligation to indemnify
defend and hold harmless purchaser indemnified parties in accordance with article xx for anclaims third party claim
including claims involving the third party's consequential losses
losses or damages occasioned by third parties
in accordance with article xx
i have in mind a contract that eecc and nepco will agree is the ena form contract
so that there isn't a need to come up with two different contract forms
is that too high of a mountain to climb
i hope this didn't sound flippant
cuz i didn't mean it that way
kay
this is the one you looked at and left me comments
your comments aren't in this draft
timing
but i want to pick them up in the next go round
when we get together to discuss stuff
maybe we can review this
it is difficult to get your comments over voice mail
as i'm just not that quick
kay
karen
could we have the option of using a letter of credit versus a corporate guaranty
0
matt
since so much of this related to tax
i thought you should have a look at it
rusty/fred
i'm not sure of the context of the presentation of the information
is this something which is going to the public
or to the governmental entity involved
if there is something which will be distributed to the public
then we should consider having enron's pr group bless it
kay
hmm
hi dan
one more thing i want to mention
as you know
enron has a confidentiality agreement with a competitor of fuel cell
i believe it is onsi
the agreement has an exclusivity arrangement
which prevents the other company from chasing certain transactions without enron
once we really know what we are going to do with fce
will it be necessary/advisable to waive the exclusivity provision to avoid any restraint of trade arguments
fyi
when i last discussed the other company with ozzie and heather on friday
they were planning on calling the other company to tell them the general status without violating confidentiality obligations to fce or crra
i will follow up to get the details of the discussion
kay
you made me laugh
how about meeting in sheila's office
0
at 0
hi stephanie
thanks for the hard copy of the isda docs
would it be possible to get an electronic version of what you gave me
thanks again
kay
i received your voice mail regarding my comment about substituting the loc
the reason for this suggestion is to provide flexibility in our financing structures
depending on which entities own equity in the llc at the time of the posting of the security
perhaps language such as
an appropriate payment security
or other similar language can be utilized
please be assured that i have an understanding of the differences between an loc and a corporate guaranty
the draft responses have been forwarded to the enron tax department
due to the discussions concerning certain tax issues
i believe it is appropriate to get their approval of the language prior to these answers being released
also
i don't believe i fully appreciate the context of these questions and answers
and how and to whom these answers will be given
a brief explanation would be most appreciated
thank you
kay
here's the latest info i have
other than that mrs
lincoln
i thought it was an excellent synopsis
has anyone given any thought to the creation of a new company to enter into the crra/fuel cell purchase/sale transactions
any names to suggest
if enron is going to be the contractor as contemplated by the pda
i would expect to use a limited liablity company and not ena
please advise
kay
i can call you when i get out of my meeting
but it might be awhile
or
it might be 0
dunno
fyi
i'll bring you the onsi confidentiality agreement
got anything that looks like a confidentiality agreement with a company called onsi
should have been signed this spring
thanks
kay
hi sarah
thank you so much for your efforts to get this scheduled
however
it doesn't look today is going to work
since spoke earlier this week
michael has been accepted to private school
where we believe we will move him
however
we still haven't determined what to do about speech therapy
and would appreciate the benefit of your evaluation and expertise
especially since michael is eligible to receive services at vo
is it possible to schedule a meeting with that in mind
thanks again
kay
fyi
and for us to discuss
just a reminder that the enron team is planning to meet a half hour before the call
0
kay
in connection with the attached
please note the highlighted language at the end of the document
we couldn't decide what it means
so it needs to be re-written or deleted
the party we are contracting with is virginia power
not nc power
if we misstated this previously
we would like to clear it up now
thank you
kay mann
karen
it appears to me that this version of the document allocates a new risk to enron
risk of damage to a certain road during construction
it would seem that the responsibility to repair it should be limited to damage done as a result of the construction
also
it is unclear as written as to whether we can repair it ourselves
or whether the city fixes it and sends us the bill
what is the intent
thank you
kay
here are my observations
i'm not certain that an enron entity will provide a performance guaranty
i agree that the commercial deal is that a portion of the fee will be at risk for a performance problem
is the reference to the
state
a reference to the dpuc or crra
as far as i know
the crra deal is still in the works
with nothing but a confidentiality agreement
with an exclusivity provision
signed
and in my opinion should not be presented as being a done deal
kay
i'm good anytime after 0 am on monday
kay
here's a marked version of suggested changes
would it be preferable to be consistent with the use of the names vepco and capacity and energy agreement
kay
good afternoon
our son michael will be in your class beginning next monday
october 0
so i wanted to introduce myself
i hope we will get to meet in person soon
is there anything you would like to suggest that we do to make the transition easier
i picked up the package of information today
and will read it tonight
l won't ask any questions until i do my homework
i look forward to seeing you soon
kay

i haven't seen the paperwork on the name change
i asked around yesterday
and i have someone checking it out
initially going through corp
vs
ena
made it a bit more complicated to track down
0
i believe i sent you a form services agreement to review
i think that the parameters for performing certain services can be captured by way of reference to a named guideline or procedure
or by attachment as an exhibit
i will resend the email for your easy reference
hope this helps
kay
hi heather
don't have the answers to your questions
but i wanted you to see the attachment to gregg's email
it outlines some of the commercial aspects of the loan agreement
although it might not be in a form you can easily decipher
kay
so do we now have an enovate/enovate
thanks
kay
i had the definite impression he was going to call you
i also know he is working on a different deal on an impossible schedule
you know the drill
bart is a washington
lee guy
he is older than ned
so he didn't go to school with him
just a little trivia
kay
sounds like progress
no response required
fyi
heather
this is a rough cut of a services agreement
since the loan agreement
services agreement and llc agreement are all pieces of the same puzzle
i thought i would send it your way
kay
hi fred
i will check with herman again to get his final comments
kay
can legal be far behind
i'm headed to a lengthy conference call
but i wanted you to have this info
anything going on with manlove
kay
fyi
i don't think it will take long to get a draft
i'm happy to coordinate with sarah and accounting
is it mary lynn that i should talk to
kay
i have not dropped it off yet
can he be set up for monday
fyi
i working with outside counsel to get a draft of the revolver prepared
she
outside counsel
heather brown
has summarized the information i have given her as follows
see below
and i would appreciate your input as to whether it is accurate
once we get a draft we can sit down and discuss it
and make sure we are on the right track
i believe gregg said that this needs to be in place within 0 weeks
thanks
kay thanks for the information
if i deciphered this correctly
this is going to be what i would call an
autoborrow
facility
enovate's cash flow is swept into an account
each day
i
if enovate's cash position is short
and availability remains under the loan agreements
advances are made under each loan agreement
probably directly into the acount
and
ii
if enovate's position is long
the positive balance of the account is applied towards the outstanding loan balances
if any
we'll need to get minimum target amounts
i.e
do you really want them paying down $0.0 of each loan
from the business people
based on the foregoing
i suspect that these will be single-lender
prime rate based loan agreements
otherwise it would be a huge operational headache
once you confirm the single lender part
that will be enough preliminary information for me to start on a loan agreement
how could i resist such an opportunity
enron north america corp
with a typical contractor a tight schedule usually increases the cost
you might check to see how much a delay in cod to
say aug 0
might lower the cost of construction
not to say that it will
but it might
busy
as usual
kay
i thought tom wanted to change the time
did he get with you on that
hi heather
any idea what the analyst starting salary might be
if not
can you point me in the right direction
i know you don't have anything better to do
but i really appreciate it
kay
heather
just go to your dash form file and pull out language from another deal just like this one
that's how we handle things on the 0th floor
kay
a more lucid explanation of the issues
lee
can you see me a word
or wordperfect
file for this letter
thanks
kay
gentlemen
i haven't seen the 0d contract yet
is it on its way or perhaps been misdirected
thanks
kay
hi paul
i've been reviewing the draft facilities agreement
which is now getting to be a hot topic
one thing to keep in mind is that we would really prefer that the facility agreements not refer to the may 0 agreement
if this is possible
could you please give this some thought and review the document with this in mind
i look forward to discussing this with you soon
thanks
kay
hi paul
this will need the same facilities agreement treatment as the ge contract we are working on
thanks
kay
0 is my office number
i've made a stab at revising lee's letter
heather
i haven't heard back from anyone on the single lender issue
but i say go for it
assuming a single lender deal
at least that gives us something to work with
thanks
kay
allyson
here's a suggestion on the language to address the issue of termination
for any reason
on page 0
line 0
insert after
limits
deleting the remainder of the sentence
applicant's requirement to notify the commission to instances where the agreement is terminated as a result of applicant's default
thanks
kay
are we good to go
i forgot to show my husband your pictures
if it is ok with you
i'll bring them back on monday
have a great weekend
kay
for those who don't have these numbers
here we go
i have ozzie and heather's contact numbers as well
but don't see any reason to take up their time unless something commercial arises
jeff
i'll be glad to hold you numbers in trust as well
i have nothing special planned
there goes my wild image
so i'm available anytime
i'm going to read over the latest versions
keeping in mind that the commercial deal is done
kay
good luck
and fire
release
shoot
fling
straight
kay
it took place
we made some progress in indemnity and lol
the carve outs from the lol remain an open issue
we had some helpful discussion about assignment
but i'm not sure how much progress was made
you were assigned no tasks this week
kay
stuart has finished his review of the pr invoices
and not the massive pile is on my desk
here's the vepco version
much grass
please start me a fuel cell notebook
beginning with the clean versions of the documents listed below
don't need the redline
the binder needs to be at least a 0 inch binder
thanks
kay
scott has given me some comments on the loi
which i hope to discuss and incorporate today
does anyone else have any comments
thanks
kay
hi there
i made changes in accordance with our meeting on friday
please let me know what other changes you would like to see
thanks
kay
yes
i suggest the changes as shown on the attached
chris is researching a drawing number so that we have them committed to a certain specification
i've added the concept of a date certain for the delivery
i'm referring to these as
equipment
and part of the
units
so it is clear that the warranties apply
is there any change to the sound guaranty level
or other guarantees
for the units utilizing these stacks
kay
always
fyi
i thought someone from trading should give this a look
thanks
kay
i'm out october 0 and 0
i'm trying to pick a favorite
here is the abb contract you referenced in your email
i am working on a 0-0 compliant epc contract for nepco/eecc
however
i wonder about the challenges presented with the need for nepco to enter into subcontracts and purchase orders which preserve the accounting treatment all the way down the line
this is a very tall order given the contracting environment
your email is an excellent description of the challenges of doing a deal off the balance sheet
and worthy of further discussion
kay
i'm just afraid to say anything about anything because of what you said the other night about
gee you can't do anything right
i guess i'm a little upset because you comment on how i do things
i don't even try to fold clothes
pack the car
unpack the groceries
load the dishwasher
etc
but if i say something about how you do something
you get upset and say you can't do anything right
so i should feel guilty about saying anything about anything
gotta go
we can talk about it later if you want
love
kay
here's the latest revision inserting the drawing numbers
is it ready to go to ge
scott
payment for change orders is addressed in the contract
i would think cocktail attire
what time are the receptions
just a small piece of internal discussions regarding the revolving line of credit and how it ties in with the enovate bank account
roxanne
thank you for calling last night
we took michael out for dinner to celebrate his first day at sf
and missed your call
michael had a great first day
all the kids drew portraits of him
and he got a big kick out of it
i noticed on the class list that you live in spring valley
we live on inverness park way
and used to live on cedarspur a few years back
it is nice to know that michael has a classmate in the neighborhood
again
thanks for calling
kay
tough time of day to dress for
but i think you have it figured out
i don't have a lot of formal stuff that fits me now
i've gained weight in the past 0 months
i may do a little shopping
hi scott
here's a revised draft for your review and comment
i've taken out the balance of plant warranty because you raised a valid point about them knowing what bop entails
so now it is just a warranty
i've also been more explicit about our fee
i think there's a bit of confusion embedded in the document because of the uncertainty about who is doing what
but i haven't come up with a simple fix yet
sorry
didn't mean to forget you
that's a good one
i knew you guys would hit a home run
i have a conference call at 0
then i'll come see you
kay
please print for me
thanks
kay
more to go with that other print job
warning
i have not even opened this to see how it looks
the goal is to delete the reference to westlb and the master agreement
so i know there is work to be done along those lines
at least this is a start
kay
this is for the psco project
and ben wants chris to sign it
i'm thinking that this is dale's project
so i'm sending him a copy
if it looks ok to you i will clean it up and send it to ge for their review
kay
maybe i'll get your address right this time
jerry
thanks
i'll give it a look immediately
and will discuss the game plan with heather
congratulations on wrapping up the alliance and associated agreements
looks like an interesting and exciting opportunity for both companies
kay
kent
here's a revised change order #0
please let me know if you have any comments
thanks
kay
kent
here's a revised letter agreement
it is being reviewed internally
but i wanted to get it to you today anyway
as i will be out of the office beginning tomorrow around 0
kay
fyi
i am attaching the current term sheet for the rio gen epc contract which is has been approved by aa and i believe global finance
kay
here is the current rev of the eecc
standard
form which i am reviewing/massaging in connection with the 0 0 exercise
it includes the exhibits
where i think you can find something useful
if this doesn't help
please let me know and i will check elsewhere
thanks
kay
mark
i've reviewed the fax sent yesterday with the proposed conditions to special use for livingston energy center
is titan land development the owner
will it be necessary for titan to make the escrow payment prior to exercising the relevant land options and the commencement of construction
i do not know whether these agreements and/or the making of the deposit would impact the balance sheet treatment
but i understand from fred that we are not concerned about the balance sheet treatment for this project
kay
please order me a 0 hole punch and more letter size red ropes
thanks
kay
the water could be 0 feet or more away from the dock
depending on how long it blows that hard
i hope our shrimp come back
there's a rumor going around that you are signing up people for the pilotprogram
if true
i would love to volunteer
as i work at home frequently
thanks
kay
gregg
it is my understanding that enron and peoples intend to discuss the most appropriate form of isda documentation for enovate to use
peoples has forwarded a form for our information
and we would like to reciprocate
therefore
attached per your request are sample isda documents as a starting point for discussions
since these are forms
there will certainly be aspects which will need revision based on discussions between peoples and enron
these documents should be treated as confidential
kay
hi ben
janet has requested that we set you up with signature authority for development documents
how do you want you name to read on the corporate documents
thanks
kay
i volunteered to be a guinea pig
i've already discussed this with mark h
and he thought it had already been done
i haven't found any indication that it has been done
i'll follow up immediately
kay
deb
i'll get you the particulars
but you get the general idea
i'll have to check on the expense account stuff
kathleen
you haven't done any thing with this request yet
have you
could you get the names of the active development companies so that we can address those
as well as ena
thanks
kay
lisa
i haven't seen a copy of the sept 0th letter yet
but i've been at an offsite
so i might have missed something
i'll get you a copy of co #0
co #0 has been transmitted to ge for comment
i'll have to confirm the status of the mou and co#0/#0
these have bounced around a bit
so i need to nail it down so i don't give you bad information
kay enron north america corp
not this week
maybe next week
hi
just checking in
michael and i are having a nice morning
i've got my computer plugged in to my home line
but my cell phone is on
michael has an appointment at 0
so i will be out of a while
this is great stay home weather
i have fires in the fireplaces
all i'm missing is the smell of bread baking
kay
i thought the conference was pretty good
i had a great room
with a huge jacuzzi tub
did anyone get promoted
no one said anything about promotions
so i figured nothing interesting happened in that regard
i've been throwing out accumulated paper today
cleaned out my person
got out some clothes to give to the maid
it all feels good
i'm going to do email now
see you tomorrow
kay
make that cleaned out my purse
not my person
geez
i'm not at the office today
but i probably have a copy of the option
i don't recognize the memorandum of option to purchase
do you have a copy of it to see if it gets my memory working
okey dokey
please print and put in the fuel cell binder you made me last week
it is on my desk
i think
everything went fine
i hope dan is ok
did the antibiotics not work
i know he has been worried
but i thought he was feeling better
now i'm worried
how old would you mother have been today
i was wondering about karen
i wasn't sure what her title was before
i haven't checked voice mail yet
heather called on my cell phone
which was fine
i hear the mark
nyc
is very nice
i hope to get back earlier than 0 on friday
but not early enough to come in
i'll figure it out tomorrow
ciao
kay
congratulations
you should be proud
i am
i suspect that it wasn't recorded
my bad
hi guys
enron policy requires that the assignment of tasks to outside counsel go through
or at least be coordinated with
the legal department
in the future
please let me know what you need so that there can be some order to the process
did the fehrs and ledfords sign the option agreements
thank you
kay
i found the originals
so please disregard my question about same
how's you dad
i hope everything went well
did you make it in time to see him before the surgery
kay
i believe this to be the latest draft of the psco change order
kay
i didn't know there were 0 things to get clogged
what a blessing that he had the surgery before he had a heart attack
somehow i'm not surprised that your dad is a quick healer
still
going home today is amazing
kay
you know how i hate to have originals
please take them from me
once i get the draft i will set up a conference call with the people who can provide the input on the document
if it would be better to have the call before let me know
and i will try to set it up
i'm free tomorrow am if that is a good time for you
i have the september 0th invoice
could you fax me the rest
thanks
kay ps
i feel like i had previously approved at least one of these invoices
we have changed accounting systems and invoice processing personnel
so just about anything is possible
fyi
i've discussed this with mark and he didn't have any problem with it
kay
i think the easiest way is a power of attorney
i've talked to deb korkmas about it
i hear she's the one to handle such things
and i've asked kathleen to identify the most active development entities so that we deal with as many as possible at once
as for the expense account
i figure she can just tell ben to sign her name to the reports
any other ideas
kay
i was wondering if you were there
hope the weather is better there than in houston
is there any water in the bay
love
kay
fyi
attached is the most recent draft i have of the change order for the esa stuff
i think we need to add the info on drawing numbers and delivery dates for the options
much like we did on change order #0
please let me know what you think
kay
it will escalate over time
that's how it worked for me
this is more like it
if my flight is on time
i should be able to pick up michael
kay
opps i read it wrong
darn
i am scheduled to be in nyc and danbury
connecticut as of tomorrow afternoon
through the remainder of the week
i'm assisting with the negotiation of a contract for the purchase of fuel cells
this is a jeff don't know if you guys like to keep up with such things
but i'm glad to keep you informed
kay
kathleen
please call karen way at piper rudnick and follow up on the points you raised
october 0 sounds good to me for an effective date
but you might as well check with karen to see if there is a reason she didn't date it
good job
thanks
kay
anything to get one thing off the
to do
list
this was sent to me by one of the developers
i believe it relates to an expansion
or new interconnection
of the caledonia facility
i don't know which lawyer has been working on it
so i'm sending it around to see if anyone claims it
chris thought that someone from power trading may have been working on it
kay
deb
let's go ahead with poa's for ben f
jacoby for ena
tarheel land development
edgecombe development
and titan land development in accordance with janet's request and ena standard practice
deb
i have the impression that this is something you typically handle
although i'm glad to volunteer kathleen for the task if that would help
there will be other companies
but we can add these as we go
kathleen
please advise if there are any which you see as most active at this time
for instance
what are the names of the florida development companies
your assistance is greatly appreciated
as janet is eager to get this done
thanks
kay
well
i personally would like your input
although i'm not clear who will end up with it
kay
we can always do the poa's after the fact
if necessary
there are something like 0 development companies
so i hate to do them all at once
i would at least ask ben to identify key regions
however
you do need the names of the companies anyway
because they are mostly your companies
please call mike and kent directly
thanks
found it
it was buried beneath a stack
looks good
i would add something to the effect that the appointment terminates if ben leaves the company's employment
thanks
i'm glad you mentioned that fact
i'll keep you advised of anything i come across that relates to a peaker
speaking of which
are you generally aware of a warranty claim against westinghouse for the gleason project
i've been helping mitch out here and there on it
kay
kathleen
please proceed as outlined
kay
ed
would it be possible to designate which is east/west
as opposed to just deleting the west entities
that way
us easterners will know when we are encountering a western entity
thanks
kay
good thing those offices are big up there
must be getting crowded
i've never heard of them
when do you leave next week
kay
good idea to give them a heads up
please call bruce silvers with bingham
dana in hartford
conn
and tell him my trip has rescheduled
please see if he is available to meet on monday afternoon
preferably in new york
although i'll confirm later
i think it might be helpful if nick palatin was available as well
thanks
kay
forgot to mention that
please ask bruce to check his availability
fyi
i'll respond later
back to the contract
we might want to consider meeting with the fuelcell team in their offices
if this is less intimidating for them
i may be able to fly up on monday am and accomplish what i need to do with bd
although flying on sunday is fine as well
tbd
kay
fred
i think kathleen will be a big help to all of us in improving the flow of paper
i trust her to work up initial drafts of option agreements
subject to my quick review and the review of local counsel
thanks for your cooperation
i made a mad dash to get this revised
i can't promise that i incorporated everything we discussed
but i figured i needed to get it to you now
are these the ones which didn't have the date
this is pitiful
hi gregg
i've been tied up today so i haven't gotten this to you
maybe we can talk soon
kay
thanks for checking
i'm on message 0 of 0
and don't have anything from bruce
sorry i was cranking this am
i got here at 0am
mostly because i had problems with a document which had to go out today
kay
i'm in good shape now
just a little left for today
is ric getting sentimental
losing someone can make you feel that way
even if it isn't logical
we'll just get through this day and start over tomorrow
stuart
kay's venting for the day
is it nitpicking to expect outside counsel to
0
make sure the option agreement is signed and acknowledged
0
ascertain whether the thing has the dates filled in
and
0
makes sure that the legal description is included
ok
maybe i'm whining
but i think mark should know that we are having problems
have you mentioned anything to him
kay
fyi
i haven't read it yet
but thought i would pass it along anyway
kay
i don't know if you are in the loop on this one
i may just ask him if anyone else has had problems with the quality of their work
and leave out the billing stuff
if i say anything i won't mention you,although i think you did what you could to control these cowboys
kay
hmm
can you get a picture of the dog
neil and i have been talking about getting michael a dog
and we do not want a puppy
does she bark much
is she hyper
she's a short haired dog
isn't she
the problem with the document arose after you left yesterday
and i knew i had to get cracking on it early
i would have had to ask you to be here by 0
and i figure that was just too much to ask
thanks anyway
it is yours
i never said it would last
if fact
it is a tribute to enron that that era is over
you've earned the right to doubt my credibility based on your original interview
however
ps
you will love the government contracting business
really
i think you will
here's the redraft
i fix up the form for you as well
next email
and with this email i bid you adieu
hasta manana
ciao
etc
kay
i may be in trouble
i didn't know he was 0
yes
thank you so much
it is displayed proudly in my office
it is sooo cute
hi stuart
i'm assuming
very dangerous
that you are handling this
as this project does not ring a bell with me
kay
the attached contains revisions and comments as compiled by eecc and ena
kay
i will be out of town
but i think you should definitely be there
i'll mention it to sheila
kay
please
tuesday afternoon is our best bet
in nyc
kay
i'm glad she sounds so good
maybe she can be a back up for next thursday
kay
i think we arrive around 0
so 0 is about as good as we can do
kay
is this something i should have heather brown participate in
kay
hi heather
are you available to participate
i'm not sure what is on the agenda
but i thought i should check your availability
thanks
kay
fyi
kay
i couldn't remember if i forwarded this to you
so here
tis
kay
karen
as far as i'm concerned you have answered my legal questions
i will add that i think that it is the city which has preserved its option as to who repairs the road since they have approval authority
however
this doesn't seem like a big issue to me
so long as the commercial team is happy with the minor changes with the risk profile
i'm happy
kay
any problems/comments
we don't need her if we aren't going to discuss the loan
have you heard from sara
i was under the impression that she is out of town this week
guess i could walk over there and look
kay
just to keep you in the loop
heather
doesn't look like this will apply to you
the person we need to include in our discussion is out of town
talk to you soon
kay
janet and ben
ben now has signature authority up to $0,0
let me know if you have any questions
kay
per your request
is the contract supposed to be an off balance sheet contract
i'm supposed to be working on the changes necessary to make this one 0-0 compliant
but i haven't done it yet
maybe you will beat me to it
which is fine by me
kay
darn
hi there
sounds like things are going really well
neil is working tomorrow
his turn
then we have a wedding to go to saturday night
paige isn't coming in until sunday
leaving tuesday or wednesday
she's visiting friends in waco
you know how it goes with juniors
so
it doesn't look good for us to make it to palacios this weekend
how long are you going to be there
gotta get on the phone
love
kay
please cancel this
kay mann
please make this right
thanks
kay
we don't have to meet with them
lee
your changes to the letter look fine to me
i'm attaching the latest version i have on change order #0
are we ready to go with this one
we would like to close out #0 and #0 soon
i believe ge prepared #0
could you send me a copy of the latest draft of #0
as it was inadvertently deleted from my computer
meanwhile
i'll work to get you a draft of #0
thanks
kay
lisa
here is the discussion draft of change order #0 for your review
comment
changes
etc
once it is finalized ena would appreciate receiving a note requesting that the change order be executed
with the change order initialled by the appropriate person at esa
thanks
kay
ben wants chris to sign this change order
i believe it is in essentially the same form as when i sent it before
please advise is there are any changes you want made
thanks
kay
would you believe i don't know how late the maid stays
i think on most tuesdays she comes in the afternoon
but beyond that i really don't know
i don't know if paige will be here still
but she might
buy you really don't need to do that
as we don't mind getting it whenever we next come to palacios
makes the fun last longer
we won't even celebrate our anniversary until the weekend
as i will be out of town tuesday-wednesday
new york
and neil is gone thursday-friday
dallas
tag team parenting
love
kay
lee
here's a revised draft incorporating your two suggestions
i've forwarded what i have on the co
#0
for south america to their lawyer
so i hope it will be wrapped up soon
i've seen reference to the pleasanton co
and i know it is in the works as well
it is percolating through the system
do you have the electronic file for the lv cogen change order
#0
extending the delivery dates
i'll be in on monday
although i have a heavy conference call schedule
i'll be easiest to catch towards the end of the day
kay
thanks
unless someone catches me
i'm out at 0
i don't know
i'll ask suzanne
for the calendar
richard
when you get a minute i would like to catch you up on these issues
i think it is appropriate to get outside counsel to look at the two westinghouse issues we have
thanks
kay
lisa
per your request
kay
karen
please provide a redline version of this document against the fehr option
or whichever previous document you started with
thanks
kay
she makes me crazy the way she copies three lawyers in her firm eveytime she writes me
a pet peeve
i leave tomorrow
and will be back on thursday
there's a bunch of food up here today
you might want to make the trip up this way
hi kathy
i can't remember if you are in the loop on this one
kay
hi bart
i think this is at least close to the final draft
it ain't pretty but it seemed to work
you won't hurt my feelings if you make massive revisions
so long as i get a copy of the new-and-improved version
kay
i am so sorry to hear about annie
did it break in a different place
i think they sometimes have to wait for the swelling to go down to really tell what is happening
michael had a good time
thanks for having him
he was sooo excited when paige got home yesterday
he is just crazy for her
thanks for the bird house
we are going to put it in the kitchen on top of the cabinets
all is fine here
just buzy as usual
love
kay
does that take into account that more money may be going into the spending account
i think we have a total of $0 allocated for the year
my records indicate that i've put in $0 as of my last paycheck
love
kay
did you rsvp for me as well
that would be extra points
i haven't looked at this yet
kay
hi gregg
my initial reaction is that it is ok for a small gambling debt
but a little thin for a $0m revolving line of credit
kay
i found it
hi sweetie
you know how paige is about directions
etc
feel free to call her
though
i ate all vegetables for lunch
but then i had a third cookie
annie broke her arm again
and may have to have surgery
kay
latest
i think it just changes my seat assignment
kay
heather
i'm guessing that peoples wants to use this form in lieu of the credit agreement
maybe i'm wrong
kay
that should be easy enough
paige needs some glasses
and that could run dental is also covered
if we have any uncovered dental expenses
i'm going to guess we might have another $0 in prescriptions to fill this year as well
i could stand some new glasses also
your eckerd's glasses can also be submitted
we need to forecast for next year
as open enrollment starts soon
kay
remind me to check the harry
david's catalogue for something nifty
kay
i'm o positive
and used to work with bob
i'm on the road until thursday afternoon
and give give blood on friday
kay
fyi
for fuel cells and crra
hi dale
i would contact kathy clark
as far as i know
there have been no change orders
unless my memory is failing
which is a possibility
kay
did you get these
kay
we must hang together less we hang separately
are these the correct dates on change order #0
is this ok with everybody
it incorporates ge's latest comments
kay
fyi
i need details
chris calger will sign for ena on #0
i believe his title is a vice president
dale rasmussen has offered to handle signature
i haven't gone through all my emails to see if it is ready to go
janet will sign #0 and #0
kay
i think the effective dates have been relating to when the deal was cut
that's as much a guess as anything
ben left me a voice mail that said he had gotten something from esa on #0
but i haven't made it through all my emails to see if i have it
i will send it to you if i do
of course
i would think #0 is ready as soon as i get confirmation that the dates are correct
again
i have to check my emails
i heard a rumor about 0
but am now drawing a blank
and haven't heard of any others
kay enron north america corp
this deal never closed
so it must be the perfect contract
please print and add to my fuel cell book
thanks
kay ps please print a second copy for john however you spell clawburg
hi chris
any opinion on the major component question
kay
carlos
having some difficulty finding another job
happy anniversary
sorry i wasn't here to take you to lunch
kay
kathy clark as eecc has the electronic version of the turbine contract
rob taylor at andrew
kurth probably has the electronic files for the other document
rose engeldorf might have the electronic files as well
kay enron global finance
hi paul
any luck with the draft of the abb facility agreement form
looks like we might have some business
i have forwarded your draft of the turbine document to ge
but have not had any comments
i would like to set up a conference call with ge to discuss it
how is your schedule tomorrow or monday
thanks
kay
hi guys
i think the price of the turbines will be the internal enron price
sheila has the magic number per turbine
kay
hi kent
i was wondering if we could schedule a conference call to discuss the form of these agreements
are you available any time soon
thanks
kay
i have a conference call that starts around 0 and is scheduled to go to 0
otherwise
no lunch plans
kay
viola
if you don't hear from me by 0
i probably won't be having lunch
could you please get me some post it notes
various sizes
cool colors preferred
thanks
i'm still in my conference call
do you want to come visit later
in other words
need to get out
please print and put in folder
off balance sheet epc contract
thanks
kay
if i had a printer
i wouldn't ask you to print this
but since i don't
thanks
kay ps don't worry too much about ruthie
you'll get her figured out
is it true that tomorrow is your birthday
if so
happy birthday
you did better than i did
i was telling people i was 0 when i was 0
i felt terrible when i realized i was older than i thought
oh well
it just goes to show you that it is all a state of mind
i'm not sure how you don't focus on development
when it is all a part of the same group and process
neat trick
though
i wish carlos was here to do a lot of this
though
kay
why don't you try feeding her again at night
maybe she will sleep better
i feed jack twice a day
and he is still skinny as a stick
isn't she on the thin side anyway
all dogs go through adjustments
she may be trying to find out who is the boss
there are lots of little tricks i can tell you about to show her you are the boss
i'll try to make you a list while you are gone
crate train her
it is one of the best things you will ever do for yourself
she may fuss at first
but she will love it
crating her will calm her down
i believe the pointer rescue people agree
ta da
joe
would you like to renew with a letter agreement as in previous years
thanks
kay
i've been out of town
and have back-to-back meetings/conference calls
i'll call you though
kay
fyi
this form came from global finance
have a great trip
hi gregg
per your request
see ya
kay
hi guys
in looking at crra's comments to the draft loi
i have these questions
0
i'm not sure what we mean by epc contract
is this referring to the fuel cell document we are working now
or is there to be another layer
i know this may depend on whether crra or someone else is doing the balance of the construction activities
0
he expects one epc contract
and we had tried to leave room for multiple contracts
does anyone care
0
does crra get a full refund of the purchase price if the fuel cells fail the performance tests
we have discussed with fce the concept of a proportional reduction if the performance is within 0 percent
then a full reduction as to the failing unit
s
only
also
are we planning to mark up the fuel cell contract to recover our fee
is our fee at risk for the fuel cells failing to perform
thanks
kay
barbara
here is the document i discussed concerning some of the chicago stuff
jeff
i don't know if you have received this from gregg all ready
kay
i've given blood at md anderson before
and i think they will have the blood type information on file
if anyone else is in the same boat
you call the number below and ask for barbara
i couldn't reach her today
because it is saturday
but they tell me she will be in on monday
if all goes well
i could be in business fairly quickly
kay
i don't know if you got this
so here
tis
i was out of town and missed the presentation
although i've worked with herman
roger and david on these issues
i'm sure they would be glad to give the presentation again for others with a need to understand the complexities of off balance sheet treatment of power plants
kay
i understand completely
those ear infections can be very painful
nothing can get to you like your kid in pain
if it makes you feel any better i have a 0year old
i can't believe it
and a 0 year old
even more unbelievable
and both have a lot of allergies and sinus infections
etc
my oldest also had a lot of ear infections
and it seemed to be painful
but she out grew the problem
i expect to be in town mon-thurs
with high hopes of taking friday off to join my husband at his officer's meeting in san antonio
kay
my morning is fairly open
other than grinding on the purchase contract
i'm available
as i mentioned
i'm still working away on the revised equipment contract
kay
heather
could we handle the crra loi at the same time
it would help me get finished with the fce doc
i'm sure you saw that ge and honeywell are merging
i wonder if that makes onsi a part of ge
does ge have a fuel cell product yet
it would explain the statement in the journal that headquarters would not be in nj or connecticut
kay
shall i handle items #0 and 0
kay
i am waiting for a call back from md anderson concerning whether they were able to locate my information
their records go back to 0
and i believe i gave at md anderson in 0
but you know how that is
assuming that all goes well
i can go tomorrow at 0am
when they open
i'll keep everybody posted
the folks at mda confirmed that they have michael's consent forms ready to go
just in case that question should arise
bob
sorry to hear about the doctor
and the impact it must have had on michael
kay
i'm going to guess that it depends on whether you are giving a direct donation
as in this case
or a replacement donation
since it is for a specific patient
they may want to make sure it works
especially since it will keep you from donating for a while
just a guess
how's this
okey dokey
i think piazza sped up to try to get close to the bat
he's a sly one
roger's first story was ok
i didn't think he was running
i was tossing the bat to our bat boy
second version was a little iffy
i didn't know if i had the bat or the ball
why the hell would he throw the ball towards the dugout
the turner wedding was amazing
jim and betty boyd sat behind us at the wedding
mauricio and his wife were there
and showed no signs of leaving
when neil and i left at 0
michael was with grandparents
the band was still playing
and the bride and groom were still there
unbelievable
i wonder how late it went
i'm out of town this weekend
neil's officer's meeting at the hyatt hill country
then up to see paige on saturday
back on sunday
let me know if it reschedules
did you change jobs
what do you hear from ben
anthony called me last week
just to chat
they are looking forward to hunting before the baby gets here
kay
did you hear candy is moving to holland
she looked great
i didn't know she was married until i saw her
she seems happy
sounds like ben found a good head hunter
it can be hard to get positive after being in that environment
kay
i'm thinking you don't have anything to move
maybe it would help if you acknowledged that ena might not be your final destination
but seems like a good place to get exposed to a variety of opportunites
such as enron global markets and enron industrial markets
both new businesses with international aspects
plus
lawyers at ena move between groups without much fuss and bother
if it changes
don't blame me later
how does that sound
kay
paul
fyi
this is the document which starts the move into the abb facility agreements
kay
to keep you in the loop
kay
is everyone available for a brief conference call at 0 tuesday morning
please let me know if you aren't available
dial in instructions will be forthcoming
thanks
kay
do you want to generate one just like the rest
that would be the easiest way to go
thanks
kay
paul
when can we expect a draft of the abb facility agreement
it is getting urgent
thanks
kay
the attached is marked to show changes from previous draft seen by crra
kay
hi matt
sheila tells me that you are working on the docs requested by global finance for turbopark
does this ring a bell
if you can get me the docs on this llc
i'll see if we can pitch the angle sheila suggested
thanks
kay
ok
i'll follow up
the insanity continues
i finally called lee johnson at s&s
who fortunately had called me
and asked him if he knew if kent was around
as i hadn't heard from him
he is going to get in touch with kent for me
i'm expediting paul pipitone re the abb facility agreement
but haven't heard back from him yet
hope your trip is going well
kay
hi david
it is just us chickens
gregg's agenda
kay
hi jeff
i guess this answers the question of whether the policy has been adopted
i'm at home this am
as i'm on my way to md anderson to donate blood for a friend's son who has leukemia
i don't think it will take too long
but they don't open until 0
kay
in a recent discussion with mark h
he suggested that i consult you two gentlemen about outside counsel in chicago to support our efforts with peoples
it would be beneficial to have a firm on board with some trading expertise
as well as more generalized transactional experience
gas would be a plus
i've used jones
day
good job on regulatory issues
and piper rudnick
bad experience
any suggestions
thanks
kay
kathleen
we have forms for confidentiality agreements
all ca's are processed through kay young
as she maintains the data base
kay
could you point kathleen to the repository of the forms so that she can generate the first draft
by the way
i've assembled the emails i received on changing the form
i'll be happy to take a crack at the revisions if you tell me which form to start with
i know it will have to be processed through before it becomes standard
thanks
kay
i'll get the draft working
but it would probably be a good idea to discuss this a bit
kay
is this a pig deal
remember when the biggest accounting issues were mark-to-market
ahh
the good old days
kay
please prepare a fed ex package to go out tonight
as described below
also
please prepare a transmittal letter to heather for me to sign
thanks
kay
janet has already signed change order #0
so adding value to this one will required that change order #0 be revised
then we would have to go back to esa for their approval
it would be easier on this end if we could pick up the new stuff in this one to a subsequent change order
i spoke to lee johnson yesterday about all the change orders
and a couple of outstanding issues
i am having difficulty getting ge's attention on the facility agreements
and would prefer that the change orders not be given to ge until i at least get a call back on the issue
if this is a problem
please let me know
kay
thanks
this is a very drastic situation
so the draft will be appreciated
as i recall you were going to turn another draft of the ge facility agreement
deleting the westlb references
when will this be forthcoming
thanks
kay
bob
my donor number is 0
let me know if michael needs more
as you know
i can go back in 0 days
here's hoping all goes well
i'll have your family in my thoughts and prayers
kay
joe
here tis
c
kay mann sr
counsel enron north america 0 smith
suite 0 thanks
kay
sheila
i just realized that this is at the same time as our ge conference call
can we adjust the time of the ge call
i have a feeling that roger's presentation is the generic mark-to-market stuff
but i could be wrong
i just don't get the feeling that it is directed to the lease accounting rules and other stuff specific to turbine torture
do you have any follow up questions from last week you want me to ask
i'm expecting a draft of the abb facility agreement tomorrow
a
k really dropped the ball on that one
although i wish i had expedited them more
i still haven't heard from kent
despite email
voice mail
and calling lee
i hope he is ok
because being non-responsive is not kent's style at all
did you see that moby dick
aka
ge
is swallowing another big fish
honeywell
i heard it increases their size by a third
so i guess the 0 pound gorilla is now a 0 pound gorilla
ok
i admit i used the calculator
talk to you soon
kay
to all
as you know
enron is refinancing the equipment we bought through westlb
i've been asked to compile a list of all the equipment purchased through westlb
and the change orders related to same
all i know about is the lm deal with ge
with 0 executed change order
approximately 0 or 0 pending
and the abb transformer deal
with one co pending
please let me know if you are aware of any others
thanks
kay
can you send me a copy of a professional service agreement
i need to prepare one
stephen
wanna go ahead and print the tasking letter and i'll initial it
kay
thanks for the help
i'm sure more questions will follow
kay
thanks
yeah
something i can put on the list and take off
shall i send it directly to tracy
talk to you at 0
kay
i thought you would enjoy this
and i didn't make any comments about being right about not going to a mega university
ok
when are you available to discuss how to deal with the various issues we need to address to get this wrapped up
thanks
kay
let's aim for thursday am
i'll get back to you later today
thanks
kay
hi kathy
i know i owe you a phone call
i'm home with a sick kid today
please email me your number and i'll give you a call
i can't believe i've forgotten it
so how are you doing with the eecc changes
kay
hope it is going well out there
michael is sick
i'm guessing strep
so i'll be calling in from home today
kay
hi scott
it is a sick kid day
i'm guessing strep
with the 0 plus fever
fortunately
i have most of what i need to get a draft of the equipment contract turned
i'll email it later
kay
hi gregg
i'm home with my sick son this am
it was one of those 0 plus fevers at 0 this morning
i've asked the temp assistant to have my enovate stuff sent out so we can get some work done
talk to you later
kay
hi scott
i have some questions
the obligation to try to improve performance about the specific performance
ie minimum
standards frequently has a time limit
say 0 months
do you have a sense for the appropriate time period here
would it make sense to require them to work longer on the first 0.0 and 0.0 than the rest
will we have a drawing number for a standard foundation design
or will we need to put words around it
i know we discussed the need for pilings as the most significant change
do you think that this difference is enough
did i understand that we want them to pay us at the end for non-standard foundations
as opposed to a credit
on termination
are we going with the average value no matter what the reason for termination
with a rep along the lines of whay you wrote
plus some monitoring ability
on assignment
they mentioned a corporate guaranty
i was thinking of using something broader due to various financing/balance sheet considerations
perhaps tying it to a guaranty from a bbb rated entity
do we want an option to have them store these
which would then impact payment
thanks
kay
hi
don't forget you can reach me by email
good catch on the fever this am
love
kay
maybe it is viral
i haven't really looked because i want rey to see him since we are leaving town
so my opinion isn't as important
he is starting to slow just a little
he ate a good breakfast
but he is getting quieter
if it is ok with you i'll let you know in a little bit
more questions
we have two different levels of guarantee values
we have the specific performance levels
which if not met can result in termination
etc
this includes emissions
electrical output
heat rate
water
consumption and discharge
will all of these have more stringent guaranteed levels that fce will have to work to try to fix
i'm assuming there are no sound issues
thanks again
kay
how's annie doing
has she seen her regular
sigh
orthopod yet
do the girls
and i guess you grown ups can probably go
too
want to go to su
are the young ladies interested in spending the night
i'm home with michael
the 0 fever drill
working at home
hi to all
love
kay ps thanks for the traffic tip
do the games last about 0 hours
i can't remember
why not
you can tell how much michael seems to be enjoying school
please print and fax to me at 0 0 0
i'll forward a couple more i need faxed
thanks kay
please print and fax to me at home
thanks
here's what they suggested
yes i'm working
i can do two things at once
there is a rule of halves
you can give half to your kids
you get medicaid when the retained half runs out
there is probably a time period you can do this
kay
here's a redline against our previous draft
there are lots of holes
in large part due to the significant commercial issues still open and some of fce's input due on the language to be used
i'm also not finished with the project management/scheduling stuff
but i wanted you to get a chance to look at it forthwith
scott
i've printed off your emails and will incorporate your input
i don't know when we want to give fuelcells a draft
but i'm going to keep working on this one
kay
good
that lets me massage it
review my notes
and perhaps even read it
kay
i'm getting ready to take michael to the pediatrician
so it depends on how long that takes
i'll find the instructions and email them to you
if i'm not on there but kent is
could you let him know i really need to talk to hiim
thanks kay
the appointment with the pediatrician is at 0
i catch up with you later today
kay
you can open it and hold it
i know what it is
hi barbara
i'm on the phone with the ge folks right now
as we have a standing conference call with them every wednesday at 0
i'm familiar with the people and the contractual terms at issue
and will be happy to discuss it
kay
i'll be glad to handle it so long as it doesn't have to be done this week
as i have strep throat
michael and i got a group rate at the peditricians
office
who should i contact
kay
claude
could you please fax this to heather
you might want to call her to make sure she is still at mccary's office
thanks
kay
scott
your question #0 raises a good point
my thought in bracketing the name is optionality
i'm trying to be aware of potential balance sheet issues
as you know
if this contract ends up in such shape that it can be construed as a committment to purchase equipment
we will need to cross the balance sheet bridge
as far as i know
we have not ruled out that possibility
as well as the possibility that ena or an affilate may be the epc contractor
or somehow in the title chain
i was thinking that if we use an llc we have the option to see
he equity in an llc holding the contractual rights/obligations
for financing purposes or otherwise
in that case
we may want to use an llc instead of messing with an assignment later
i am very interested in your insight concerning possible structures
and what we need to keep in mind
kay
poor carlos
he is almost pitiful
i think it is a great idea to watch for a good networking opportunity
i'm off on friday
too
in fact
both michael and i have strep throat and spent the day at home
i'll probably be in no more than 0/0 day tomorrow
is norman still out of town
will you have the house all to yourself
kay
sz really grows on you
doesn't he
just like carlos
neil leaves tomorrow
he was out one night last week
i am encouraging him to get a hunting lease
he thinks i'm very supportive
sounds good
i'm home with strep
mine and my son's
so i'll catch up tomorrow
kay
i'm planning on taking your emails and revising the current draft to create a new one
your points were very well thought out
so i would like to have the day to get a new draft
it looks like i will be at home tomorrow since i'm still not feeling well
but i certainly feel well enough to work on the contract
perhaps we will get some input from our team in conn
gang by noon
how does this sound
stephen
feel free to weigh in with any comments/suggestions
your input is welcome
kay ps i can now print at home
peter
thanks for the update
by the way
is the new version in word
kay
sounds like a good plan
i can't wait to hear how it went in danbury
sounds like the crra meeting went well
kay
hi charlotte
i'm glad you wrote
as i was going to write you
michael has strep
as do i
so he and i are home today
he is on two antibiotics which he takes twice a day
i'm trying to figure out how to get these to you
since these have to be refrigerated
obviously
if michael isn't doing great i won't go
currently
he feels fine
and only feels bad when he has fever
he woke up with fever again this am
but the fever should go away after 0 hours on the antibiotics
just let me know if you aren't comfortable with the situation
i can always leave on saturday
or not at all
michael's doctor is rey calderon 0 0 0
his wife
and assistant
is delores
and they are wonderful about returning calls
etc
we will be staying at the hyatt hill country resort
0 0 0
saturday night i will be staying in round rock
going to paige's homecoming in georgetown
but neil will still be at the hyatt
michael says hi
by the way
he is watching me type this
kay
that would be great
we can leave his
stuff
by the front door
i know he will have things he wants to bring to show you
michael asked me for advice yesterday
mom
i have a problem
he now has 0 girlfriends
ashley plus a new one
marilyn
he was torn
he decided to stick with ashley
oh
the problems of a 0 year old
michael is very excited about the weekend
he just doesn't think it will be long enough
thanks for everything
kay
he hasn't left yet
but i'll remind him
michael gets his school picture taken tomorrow
carol junell takes the pcitures there
she did our first family portrait after michael was born
kay
will do
hi stuart
i'm home sick
and with my sick son
again today
but wanted to get this to you
kay
hi rose
i'm home sick with a sick kid
but i wanted to make sure you got this little bit of info
kay
hi dale
i thought i'd send this along
it is the first draft of the
break out
contract for the abb transformers which go with the lm's
i thought sheila told me that your stuff is in immediate need to getting this and the lm break out in shape
this has not been reviewed with abb yet
in fact
i haven't read it yet
but just in case you want to give it a look
i thought i would pass it along
kay
fyi
i had previously asked paul to revise the lm contract to remove all of the references to westlb
kay
if jeff is happy
i'm happy
kay
i'm still at home
i'll be in tomorrow
i have a fax machine at home
though
if you prefer
otherwise
we can see who we can scare up at the office
or you can have laura sign and i'll initial later
which do you prefer
kay
it is less complicated for me to initial and fax than to track down someone who doesn't know anything about it and get them to initial it
i can print it here
initial it
and fax it to whomever you want
plus
i work with janet a lot so she may get some comfort from that
instead of having a lawyer she hasn't dealt with initial it
she is very conscientious about what she signs
and who initials what
is the attached form the final final form
where and to whom do you want it faxed
thanks
kay
i'm working on it now
maybe we
enron
could review it tomorrow morning
then send it to fce
i can meet around 0:0
that way
we can get it to them in time for weekend review
does that work
kay
sounds good
the email was a good idea
also
any problem if i add signature lines on the last page of the document
prior to the exhibits
i can do that
here's the final final final
i had to put in a page break before one of the exhibits because it wasn't printing right
michael probably won't be at school tomorrow
unless he really perks up quickly
however
i was thinking of bringing him up there to get his picture taken
if he feels up to it
do you think there would be a problem with that
any idea when and where i should take him
thanks
kay
charlotte
michael hasn't bounced back yet
still getting fever up to 0
i spoke with delores
and she said rey said that michael had a pretty good dose of strep
so it will take 0 doses of medicine to get it under control
i'll see how he is in the early am
but i may not take him to school
just so i can watch him another few hours
if you will be at your office tomorrow i'll let you know how he's doing
maybe i can leave on saturday
i know he will be very upset if he doesn't get to spend time with you this weekend
kay
by the way
did they ever get the acknowledgments taken care of
looks fine to me
kay
michael is still running 0 fever
i spoke to the doctor again today
and he said that michael had a pretty good bit of strep
i'm feeling better
though
and have gotten a decent amount of work done
in fact
christy chapman may give you some original documents i initialled and faxed to her
i'll explain later
if i had your fax number i think i would have faxed them to you
have a great day tomorrow
kay
hi charlotte
poor thing woke up with 0.0
he isn't getting any worse
which means the medicine is doing something
but it just hasn't done the trick yet
i'll give him his sixth dose of medicine in a minute
i just can't take him to school until he is better
i would like to hold the option open to bring him in the am
once the medicine kicks in
he will bounce back quickly
kay
karen jones
in portland
and sheila tweed have been working on just the same thing
so i'm forwarding your request to them
kay
fyi
here's today's version
michael is still running a fairly high fever
so it would be a big help if we can talk via phone
kay
yes
if you called 0 0 0
it is the number my computer is on
i'll log off before 0 so you can call on that number when you are ready
kay
sorry to hear about this weekend
it is kind of sad that mary susan doesn't have other options for her birthday
not that you guys aren't fun
michael and i've been home with strep since wednesday
he hasn't gotten better
but i have
so
i'm not going to san antonion
just heading for gtown tomorrow
i haven't decided whether i'm taking michael
if he is feeling better
i'll leave him with his sitter
charlotte
since he has been ill
i'll probably head back to houston early on sunday
and won't wait for paige to get up
sorry it didn't work out with girls
but i understand
love
kay
i changed the plant stuff around
swapping most of them for facility
i think it is a bit more clear now
let me know what else needs to be done
i'll be leaving in around 0 to buy a bribe
i mean pumpkin
but we won't be gone long
kay
gloria
i need to have a redline generated by comparwrite
as i don't have it loaded locally
the original document is in my fuel cell/equipment contract file
and has the same name as the one below
only it is dated october0
i believe rev 0
the new document is the one below
please save the redline verision in the same directory
and email the redlined document to me
heather kroll
scott healy
and stephen plauche asap
thanks
kay
never a dull moment
it is hard to get deals done at enron
which as shareholders we should probably be glad
chicago is only slightly more difficult because of the utility angle
and mind set
michael's temperature still hasn't gone done
and of course
now the weekend is coming
i guess it is time to call the doctor again
and you
kay
this is suitable for framing
thanks
who was able to do it
kay
neil left town yesterday
i can't really complain since he rarely travels
however
he is welcome to pamper upon his return
kay
she compared the wrong versions
i'll try again
sorry i lost my temper
i guess i'm not accustomed to being transferred to someone else to get things done
no reason to lose my temper
though
kay
i had heard that the big e bought out the minority investors last summer
hadn't seen this coming
so what's next for azurix
i'm just now printing it out
takes about 0 minutes
but i'm fine with sending out the redline
kay
water is just as liquid as gas
so to speak
you'll be happy to know that it didn't take long
you might want to request comparrite
just in case it comes up again
there's isn't any problem getting
both suz and i have it
have a good weekend
kay
dear mr
schrum
i attended sing
last night to watch and support my daughter perform with her tri delta friends
i enjoyed the performances of the various groups
which were within the bounds of what i expected
unfortunately
i am not writing to tell you how much i enjoyed it
i'm writing you to encourage the administration to not take lightly the indecent exposure incident which occured in the second act
the act was beyond offensive
it was criminal
especially in light of the young children present
during the first act
i was sitting on the first row
and there were 0 young children sitting in the front
in fact
at the end of the first act i had regretted that i had not brought paige's six year old brother to watch her perform
i cannot tell you how glad i am that i did not bring michael
even i was offended
and i'm a forty-two year old lawyer
we don't offend easily
who was in a sorority at ut
i was glad i had moved back at intermission to sit with my daughter for the second act
again
i urge you to not view this as an act of youthful indiscretion
it was offensive to the individuals present
and degrading to a fine university which prides itself on
encouraging contributions toward the well-being of humanity
my husband
neil
who was a pike at su in the seventies
joins me in this request
thank you

carlos
you have much wisdom for such a young buckeroo
if debbie can't decide and if you can't use the papercity photo
it realy is a good pic
i'd go with the first one
i must say that all of them look pretty
well
serious
kinda gore-like
you know
ok
that was a low blow
i was just kidding

thanks
kay
hi paul
i would like to change my previous response to this email
i would like to get a cleaned up version of the ge contract
without westlb references
so that i can make a wider internal distribution without having to explain the references to westlb
the intial read from ge was positive
but the devil is in the details
of course
kay
hi kathleen
is the peoples confidentiality agreement moving closer to the top of the list
thanks
kay
hi charlotte
i'm not sure what we are doing at thanksgiving
but at the most we might go to palacios
which means that we would be gone no more than thursday and maybe friday night
i haven't talked to paige about her schedule yet
but i know we need to get organized
also
i think michael is out of school that wednesday
again
i need to check
more to come
as for tomorrow
boo
we forgot to watch for sundown
i know
that is hard to believe
we will update tomorrow
kay
well
once again i'm messed up on my calendar
i thought you were going to be in fw a couple more days
michael tried callling yesterday
i think it was yesterday
but of course we missed
i think i'm in town this week
cross fingers
i was home with michael three days last week
we both had strep
but he was worse
his fever didn't break for a couple of days
so i had to cancel my trip to san antonio to join neil at his officer's meeting
i did make it to georgetown
and had a nice time with paige
we are hoping for cooler weather soon
it is muggy
tell dad hi
and happy fishing
love
kay
i may be able to back up bart if he has a problem
i have a conference call scheduled but it is likely to reschedule until later in the day
kay
su was fun
but there was a little incident with a streaker
more like a stroller on stage
otherwise
it was great
paige did really well
and she was front and center for most of their act
i don't know what we are going to do about thanksgiving
neil and i are negotiating
i neglected to discuss it with paige this weekend
of course
it is hard to believe it is only a few weeks away
michael and i are both better
although he didn't get better until friday night
hi to all
love
kay
gentlemen
here's the most recent version of the equipment contract
i am including a comparrite redline version
comparing this version to the oct 0 version sent by enron
i look forward to speaking with you soon

i don't know the substance of the comments
kay
i forgot about the fence
i'm still planning on leaving early
maybe 0 or earlier
can you leave early
too
michael wanted to do something with the spider web
i would offer to pick michael up
but i'm not sure that i would beat you if i left at 0 and you left at 0

kay
a call works
it will be the enron commercial lead
ben jacoby
stuart zisman
the ge commercial lead and the ge lawyer
it is about the contract he prepared

if he prefers to have whoever will be doing the drafting
that's fine
too
kay
gentlemen
attached is a draft of the facility agreement
without reference to westlb
it just came in
so i haven't reviewed it
it looks like 0 tomorrow will work for this group
unless you tell me otherwise
i'll get back to you with the location
kay
per my voice mail
please print the blackline for me
thanks

in response to new california power market rules proposed wednesday by the u.s
federal energy regulatory commission
enron corp
ene
news
msgs
has canceled some new generator projects it was discussing with the state's electric grid operator
enron said
the generators that are no longer financially feasible would have amounted to 0 megawatts of new generation installed in california next spring
enron said
the company
however
continues to negotiate other new generator projects with the california independent system operator
the ferc wednesday proposed limiting the california power exchange's price setting mechanism to $0 a megawatt-hour
the preliminary order could become a federal mandate by the end of the year
after the ferc takes comments from the public
or it could be modified
enron and 0 other companies
meanwhile
are in final negotiations with the iso for the new peaking capacity for next summer
the iso plans to pay a total of $0 million a year for three years to the power companies for installing the new generators
which the power companies will own
in addition
california's three investor-owned utilities would pay the generators for any electricity the new generators produce
pricing for the power would likely be based on the daily price set by the state-chartered
there's too much uncertainty that we would be able to recover the cost associated with those specific projects
for the purposes of making capital commitments
we view this as a $0 price cap
enron's mark palmer said
earlier wednesday
the iso's chief operating officer
terry winter
expressed concern that ferc's proposed new rules could jeopardize some of the projects
ferc's proposals wednesday are the result of a two-month investigation of california's wholesale electricity market
where prices this summer were three times what they were a year earlier
to meet the state's rising demand for power
california's three utilities have paid billions of dollars more than anticipated to independent power producers in order to keep the lights on

i have these questions
what do we mean by configuration
we are telling them that we will give them the configuration by date x
but i'm not sure what we mean
what was decided on spare parts
if anything
i know it is repetitive
but could you email me a basic timeline of what you see as the key dates for site designation
shipping
anything else you can think of
i've started a timeline but would like to cross check
i was hoping to have it done before noon

for coal mine and remote location applications
the first contract is for a $0.0 million project with the u.s
department of energy
doe
national energy technology laboratory
netl
for the design
construction and operation of a 0 kw dfc
utilizing coal mine methane gas
at the harrison mining corporation coal mine in cadiz
ohio
the second contract
for $0,0
is from the u.s

0 kw fuel cell power system
using methanol for fuel
it is scheduled to be installed during the second quarter of 0 at the cape henry lighthouse at fort story

coal mine methane
cost-free fuel reduces emissions fuelcell energy was selected for the coal mine methane emission reduction project to demonstrate the ability of the dfc to generate electricity
using coal mine methane emissions that otherwise escape into the atmosphere
costs for the three-year program will be shared equally by the doe and fuelcell energy
as a result
in addition to the environmental benefits of reducing emissions
the cost of electricity produced from coal mine methane is reduced by using a fuel that is essentially free
the doe has been supporting the development of fuel cells for more than two decades
said mark c
williams
fuel cell product manager for netl
this application to coal mine methane effectively combines efficient power generation with a solution to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions
according to fuelcell energy
0% of the world's coal mine methane emissions from active and abandoned coal mines comes from the top six countries with coal mining operations
a total of approximately 0,0 megawatts of fuel cell power could be generated using coal mine methane from the two sources
the u.s
alone
has approximately 0 megawatts of unutilized coal mine methane capacity
at an estimated $0,0 kw
the 0,0 mw worldwide potential for fuelcell energy fuel cell power plants is equivalent to a $0.0 billion market
the use of coal mine methane to power direct fuelcells will result in benefits for all concerned
said jerry d
leitman
president and ceo of fuelcell energy
coal mine methane is a greenhouse gas which can be remediated
by using it to fuel a dfc power plant
a customer turns a liability into an asset that gets rid of a polluting gas and produces electric power in an environmentally responsible fashion
an important milestone for the company is to identify prospective early-adopter markets
the coal mine methane market provides a virtually free fuel source to operate the fuel cells
facilitating early adoption by energy users
remote power
clean energy where the wires end the u.s
coast guard research and development center has awarded fuelcell energy a $0,0 contract to provide a 0 kw dfc power plant at the cape henry lighthouse
for a field test at the lighthouse to demonstrate fuel cell capabilities at remote sites
the coast guard operates several hundred unattended power systems at remote site communication stations
radio navigation stations
weather stations
and aids to navigation such as lighthouses
structures
and buoys
stand alone fuel cell power systems offer efficiency and environmental advantages for remote site operation
the methanol fuel allows for simpler
more compact process equipment for fuelcell energy's direct fuelcell plant compared to other fuel sources
this demonstration project by fuelcell energy is the first application of fuel cells at a remote
unmanned site in a marine environment
said walt lincoln
project manager of the u.s
coast guard research and development center
we're interested in the potential of the fuel cell because of its promise of reduced maintenance and greater reliability compared to other systems
in addition to the unattended applications for the coast guard
there are other potential remote power applications in operation around the world
such as pipeline monitoring
microwave relay stations
and numerous other communications and recreational uses that could be served by fuel cells
said leitman
using carbonate fuel cell technology
the dfc
r
power plant produces high efficiency energy through an electro-chemical reaction
rather than through combustion
this method of producing power gives energy users the option of producing electricity on site with the assurance of lower emissions

i just completed a lengthy call with a
k concerning the form facility agreement
a revised draft should be out mid-day today
i have once again called abb
but haven't heard back from them yet
kay
i think it is a great day to work
i asked paige what she was doing for thanksgiving
i could nap in this weather
maybe i'll leave early
hi jordan
i support ena's chicago group in their activities with peoples
peoples and enron have a jointly
0/0
owned company called enovate
which will be involed in managing some of peoples assets and some trading activities
each of the parents will be establishing a line of credit to cover cash flow
it is expected that corp will be lending the money for enron's part
and sarah wesner has been involved in the process
therefore
i thought it would be a good idea to run this transaction through your group for blessing/comment/sign off/whatever is appropriate
i can give additional information to whoever you decide should take a look at this
thanks
kay
i'll send the blackline when i get it
kay
any word
i'll have to check
i haven't heard of any problems
kay
as requested
i went the abbreviated route
kay
please print this monster

have you noticed that almost all my documents are monsters
kay
hi kent
i believe this to be blacklined against the original document
please note there are some comments/questions included
talk to you soon
kay
gregg
joel is a lawyer with global finance
since corp will be loaning the money
i contacted that legal group to get their buy in
they are sarah's lawyers
so to speak
anyway
i thought the change of name from enovate to enervate is priceless
enervate= to weaken or destroy the strength or vitality of
strange choice for a company name
kay
i got a draft of the ca from her this am
i'll give it a look and get it to you today
please confirm the version of the document which was the basis of the compared version

i didn't know they were going to send a request for $
sorry about that
we are trying to figure out paige's plans for thanksgiving
although i'm about to give up on figuring it out
she doesn't know if she can get a ticket to the game yet
i'm kinda in the mood to cook
but that's as far as we've gotten
lisa tells me they may be heading your way on saturday
we'll probably figure things out in the next few days
we are waiting to see if i'm going to be in town on thursday to make plans
i haven't been out of town since our anniversary
so it must be time to go again
generally speaking neil gets home around 0
hope you are enjoying the pretty weather today
i can sure see along way today

joel
mary lynn ruffner has been involved
but to my knowledge has not reviewed the documents
matt gockerman handles most of the tax stuff for enovate

the commercial focus is on keeping things as simple as possible
if sarah doesn't have a copy of the llc agreement
i can get you one
lou stoler was involved in the formation of enovate
although i coordinate most of their legal issues now
i've seem a preliminary dash

kay
hi kathleen

as you know
the request for ben came from janet
not ben
i'll check with her
do you have the llc agreement to see how changes are handled
if not
you can get a copy of my copy
it is not a standard agreement
on the ca
please make the effective period two years from the latest disclosure of info
and the disclosures will be ongoing
i don't have the ca in front of me

i'm going to guess that he is living above 0th
as i had the impression that he was living in a pretty swanky area
the weather is beautiful here
hope it lasts a couple of days
neil loves his pig
i don't think he has picked a place for it yet
though
have a great day
love
kay
de nada
due to the sensitivity of the information
we'll be specific
also
should this be addressed to bill or curtis
or someone else
kay
i know the feeling
please call paul pipitone
houston
and peter thompson
he's in dc
and ask them to call in at 0
i'm not sure paul will be joining us
but peter has confirmed
if we are delayed we'll let them know
how long did you reserved the line
i can see the call going until 0
kay
as usual
the lawyers are the last to know
stuart is working on a transaction to sell the asset
gleason
and therefore this ageement needs to be documented asap
which means in the next few days
please review the attached and give me a call
thanks
kay
thanks for the info
i'll give it a look
kay enron north america corp
jackie
would it be possible for you to mark up the list of comments
highlighting which are outstanding
marked by hand and faxed would be great
thanks
kay
i just opened it
it came in last night
i wasn't sure from your email if you wanted to review it now
or wait until jackie and i sort through some things
kay
here's a rough draft of a different approach to assignment
do you think it fits with the possible structures
kay
hi mike
since we haven't had any luck hooking up on the telephone
i wanted to transmit to you an initial draft of a facility agreement
as contemplated by the contract for the transformer packages for the lm's
i would have sent this to dave
but i don't seem to have his email address
since the westlb financing facility is scheduled to expire soon
we need to get the transformers transferred into our new facility
as well as get them contractually allocated to various projects
please give me a call or have dave call me so that we can handle this as expeditiously as possible
thanks
kay
scott
as i preliminary answer
this language hasn't been approved by deffner's group
although it is based on language they have seen before
it was my understanding that you wanted to keep this deal off their radar screen
as you didn't want them entering into the structuring picture until later
we can ask for a blessing on the language
but that will probably lead to questions about how the deal will be structured
etc
i am happy to access the resources in their group
however
fce hasn't seen any of this language
it was something i pulled together for you to look at
as for fce's desire to assign in case of merger
etc
i think the language is too broad
in fact
i think assignment by them should require our consent
otherwise
it needs to be conditioned on the acquiring party to be acquiring a bunch of stuff
the know how
the patent rights
the manufacturing facilities
etc
if they are going to merge with another company or sell their shares
they don't need an assignment clause
unless there is something peculiar in conn
law
they only need assignment language for an asset sale
kay
gentlemen
attached are ge's comments which i just received
they are concerned that we tried to improve the contract
oh well
i hope to get this resolved today so we can wrap it up early next week
talk to you soon
kay
i can assure you that no improvement in the relative risk allocation was intended
they pointed out what appeared to be some disconnects
and in some cases i ok'd them putting the suggestions in for discussions purposes
i wasn't trying to play games
talk to you soon
kay
as i fix i was going to offer to let ge pick up 0/0 their bill
kay
hi mark
i thought i was in my
final
office
where am i moving
kay
fyi
i expect to be on vacation that week
kay
hi jeff and barbara
i would really like to stay where i am
if possible
i like being close to suzanne
not to mention the good neighbors and the benefit of facing the wall
thanks
kay
we had a very good work session with ge today to iron out the details of the break out contract
we expect to have a draft on monday
which should be close to final as far as the form goes
i have also asked a
k to prepare a memo outlining what will need to be done on a project basis to complete the document
please let me know if you have any questions
kay
barbara has asked that i submit a weekly report about what i'm working on
i haven't had time to fix up anything pretty
but i'll give you the big ticket items
fuel cell energy/crra transaction
enron owns equity and holds warrants for fuel cell stock
we need to sell 0 mw of fuel cells in order to get the benefit of the warrants
the commercial team is working on a deal to place 0 mw with the connecticut resource recovery authority
a state agency
i have been working feverishly on the equipment contract
and we recently completed the loi with crra
we need to move to more definitive docs with crra
and the structuring isn't complete
the decision about whether the state will fund the project is expected in december
this deal is likely to continue to take up a large amount of my time
and requires a fair amount of travel
as i am involved in direct negotiations
this transaction is on dave d and janet d's radar screen
and mark is familiar with it
the potential upside
in a perfect world
is rumored to be in the nine figure range
turbopark
turbopark is the latest financing vehicle for power projects
enron is moving 0+ turbines into turbopark in the next 0 days
this requires a series of contracts with ge
at least 0
which i am working on
we also have to move transformers into this facility
so i have been in contact with abb concerning same
ge general
ena is attempting to negotiate a standard contract with ge
i've been working with sheila on this one
we are committed to finish this project by the end of this year
westinghouse warranty issues
ena has two significant disputes wiht westinghouse concerning a couple of turbines
i'm riding herd on resolving the issues
vepco
we were attempting to negotiate a ppa with virginia power
but ran into some problems
so it won't close this year
theres
some miscellaneous follow up work to do
illinois development
i'm supporting the devolopers who are developing power plant sites in illinois
enron/peoples joint venture
i'm working with the enron commercial team in certain matters relating to getting the joint venture up and running
this gives at least an overview of what i'm spending most of my time on
if it says austin
it must be yours
kay
0 is just fine
we are all so dependent on our computers
i can hardly remember what we did in the
old days
kay
so please let me know if you can't get them printed soon
thanks
kay
hi mitch
my suggested changes are highlighted
please let me know what else i can do
kay
hi john
thanks for your call the other day
the team is currently focused on getting the funding approved
as you can see from the attached
also
we have had some discussions with fuel cells about the contract to purchase the equipment
i expect to forward a draft to you soon for a sanity check
it may be a connecticut law contract due to the state's involvement
the next big item will be the project development agreement
the tax credit monetization is still on the horizon
and if the funding approval is granted
we will want to talk about your sense of how that might work
again
thanks for checking in
kay
here's how it is shaping up
we have a fence appointment for noon
the wednesday before thanksgiving
that is the first opening
but there is always a chance of a cancellation
just in case there is an earlier opening
the utility people will be out tomorrow
therefore
we need to have both dogs put up tomorrow
and the gate open
we have a noon appointment with john foster this wednesday
there is a $0 consulting fee
this is the same day michael's class sings in chapel at 0
so this isn't too bad
i have a 0 staff meeting
but maybe i can miss it
the work will not be done that day
as far as i know
if we have a hope of leaving town the week of thanksgiving
we need a reservation at the kennel
do we have one yet
i would say we might want one fri and sat night
also
we might want to consider boarding jack this week for a couple of days
so we don't have to do the crate trip
we should be ok saturday-wednesday
since i'm planning on being home
and paige will be home on tuesday
kay
hi peter
do you have a new eta yet
i need to manage expectations on this end
thanks
kay
hi geneva
the instruction sheet mentions a gift bag
do i pick this up at drop off
thanks
kay
peter
if i can get the clean version
i'm happy to run a blackline here
maybe getting out of your system would help
thanks
kay
blackline to follow
kay
here's the blacklined version
kay
most recent
but not final
turbopark/ge contract
more to come
kay
kay
print job
greetings
i'm working with sheila tweed and others at ena and eecc in developing a more standardized contract with ge for equipment purchases
the goal is to develop a more efficient contracting process
and to avoid negotiating the same points repeatedly
with varying results among business units
sheila has suggested that i drop you a line to see if this is something you might find interesting and/or helpful
you now have my email address
and my phone number is 0 0 0
please let me know your thoughts about participating in the process
thank you
kay
thanks
not today
let's get feedback from ge today
plus
the document has a lot of formatting glitches and it looks terrible
does that work
kay
hi peter
when do you think we will have a pretty compared document
thanks
kay
scott
here are letters to westinghouse
as revised to reflect our comments
kay
i got lots done saturday
but i can't remember what
you know how that goes
i bought a few christmas presents
which felt good
i went to the grocery store and spent lots of time without rushing
that felt decadent
we didn't get hit too badly
jack ran off during the worst part of the storm
scaring neil and i horribly
a neighbor brought him back
we are having an electronic fence installed soon
so i hope that will help
i'm glad michael got to see uncle bob
he was very impressed that his name was so close to uncle bobby's
i'm guessing that we may come down for a day or two next week
sorry i can't get organized
hope you are enjoying better weather today
love
kay
i thought i had sent it out on friday
but i had just saved it as a draft
must have been the full moon
kay
hi heather
jeff and ozzie
the only issue i have with the testimony is the statement that the units are
extremely quiet
at this point fce will only guaranty 0dba
which some folks might not consider to be extremely quiet depending on how close a facility is to their house
you may have determined that the noise level will be some number less than 0 dba so that the guaranty level does not reflect the expected noise level
kay
need a sitter
i'm working on it
any idea what time it starts
kay
a que hora
what time
looks like they have a rats nest to figure out
your suggestion is probably cheaper for enron
fyi
ok
i'm almost done forwarding emails
heather
i think the clean one is ok to send to bob wright as is
kay
my recollection is that i gave it to sheila around the time it came in
but i wouldn't swear to it
i'll check around here
kay
peter
do we have a good clean copy
if so
please re-send it to me
along with the best of blacklines
i have so many versions that i want to be clear that we are looking at the same documents
i also want to send the best of the best to ge
the enron commercial team and the 0 other enron lawyers who have received the defective versions
thank you
kay
here's the blackline i prepared
so you can see which looks better
here it is as a word file
just in case
hi kent
hope this is helpful
kay
hey suz
is sheila still planning on having the ge call tomorrow
thanks
kay
hi don
i'm not connecting this with anything on my
to do
list
were you looking for someone else
kay
gentlemen
things are heating up
no pun intended
therefore
it would be helpful if you would prepare a closing list for the ge turbines moving out of westlb
i know it is short
but i thrive on lists
i cannot tell you how many calls i've swapped with abb's rep about that contract
without ever hooking up
i see that we will be facing a fire drill quickly in getting at least some of these transformers into the right financing vehicle
therefore
please prepare a list of site specific issues for that document as well
thanks
kay
fyi
okey dokey
mike sandridge and i finally spoke on the phone
here are the issues which need to be addressed to keep things moving
0
which transformers go where
0
how do we deal with the two cancelled units and any cancellation charges
0
abb has not had a good experience with an enron llc arrangement
and the contract allows for them to request payment security
unless they are convinced that they aren't at risk
they will want some form of payment security
the contract does allow for the equipment to be paid off
except retainage
to facilitate the assignment
mike is available thursday to discuss these issues
and how to get the break out contracts closed
i'm available any time
kay
are you going to get a palm pilot
me again
i have a meeting with abb for thursday
could you make me a list of issues like you did with the ge contract
removing the comments from the text
and blackline the new clean
commentless
version against the original master contract
thank you
kay
here's something to look at
i'm heading out soon for master whalley's birthday party at the houstonian
but i'll check messages later today
kay
fyi
i'm printing
kay
yes
such as the side letter
assignments
etc
that may be about it
but i don't trust my memory
since there is so much to do in such a short time
lists help
thanks
kay
i've found comparerite to work with long documents
plus
these documents started out as wordperfect documents and were converted to word
which i think creates problems with word comparisons
i figure it is a gates conspiracy
kay
i'll be calling in from out of the office
as will sheila
will sheila be in the office today
vizsla
i think they are also known as hungarian pointers
but vizsla is the official akc name
what an awful mess
please print and fax the email and the attachment
i emailed jeff and told him what i'm up to today
by the way
kay
last time i checked i didn't have a fax from you
did it go through
here's my list of comments to the most recent draft
it is subject to internal review
but this gives you an idea
could we have a telephone conference to knock out as many of these as possible
thanks
kay
hi guys
this is just intended to be a list of issues to be addressed in each project specific contract
a
to do
list to finish each one
kay
this is the most current clean version of the ge breakout contract
you have also received a list of site specific references in the contract to assist in the preparation of the final document
i will contact kent shoemaker today to see how close we are on the form
it is my understanding that the lawyers involved in the projects will take the laboring oar once the form is ready to go
i'll let you know as soon as i hear something from ge
i am also trying to set up a meeting with abb today or tomorrow
i will send you the current version of that contract as well
although we have not had any input from abb on it yet
kay
fyi
i agree
you are right on all points
especially the punting one
you should have the list of specific
fill in the blank
stuff which i forwarded recently
also
we had a discussion yesterday with ge on the form of the assignment/assumption agreement
so there shouldn't be anything required of you from that standpoint
i'm here today
wasn't yesterday
and will be happy to discuss it with you
kay
i suggest we give ge a time line for completing each of the break out contracts
i'm unfamiliar with the individual project requirements
so i'm asking your help
i believe city of austin is ready to go as soon as the form is complete
and it could be a great candidate for working on immediately
i know the esa project has some time sensitivity as well
please let me know what you think
kay
i left kent a message
suggesting that we start with coa
telling him ena is the assignee
i'll let you know when i hear from him
kay
are they still available
please
maybe it is lisa alfaro
if you prefer that an ena lawyer handle it
i will volunteer
your plate is more full than mine
i just ate at the luncheon
and i'm thinking in food metaphors
kay
i guess the esa lawyers have decided that this is not the time to outsource project work
we are to the point where we need ben to help pull the technical and financial details together
i'll see what i can do to get his attention
dan is still in the midst of his health issues
so he is fasting in anticipation of a 0 physical
roger balog brought a pumpkin cheesecake which was delicious
and one of clerks made the best collard greens i had ever had
i am miserable
which means i ate a lot more than greens and a piece of cheese cake
kay
ben
has the payment allocation chart been updated
and if so
could i get a copy
thanks
kay
hi guys
i thought it would be a good idea to come up with an plan of action to get the facility agreements closed out
from what i can tell here
the esa and city of austin deals are the most time sensitive
sounds great to me
if we need ben
it will need to be after noon eastern
if it is just us chickens anytime after 0 your time is good for me
kay
so
hi john
neil and i discussed this last night
i know we are interested in at least as many games as we had last year
i'll check with him and get back to you
hope all is well
i haven't forgotten you
kay
i never would have guessed smoked oysters
i think i'm cooking for the 0 of us
plus lena and any stray friends we find
we will probably come to palacios on saturday and spend the night
although i haven't discussed it with mom yet
it is dreary here today
but in a nice way
i don't mind it too much
although by sunday we may be stir crazy
we went to michael's school on wednesday
as his class was singing in chapel
roger clements was there
video cam in hand
doing the dad thing
he is a really big guy
much bigger than i thought
he looks like a football player
i see why piazza didn't take a swing
i would say
break a leg
for katie
but with your groups orthopedic problems
i hesitate to use the phrase
love
kay
fyi
i believe we need your help with preparing the first two breakout contracts
one for the city of austin project
and one for the esa project
i heard yesterday that they want the esa contract by november 0
and the coa shortly thereafter
i expect to talk to kent today about where we are on the form
and how to move forward to closure
kay
looks like lee is still in the loop
kay
dale
what is your availability for a conference call with ge today
kay
fyi i'll send you the list of site specific references also
i'm in a conference call marathon
but i'll holler
you might just want to look at the sections referenced in the memo
kay
i haven't heard from ge yet today
is your cell phone still the best way to contact you
how do we look for a conference call today
i'll be open in about an hour
kay
0 sounds good to me
and an hour should be sufficient
per rose's instructions
dale said it was ok for me to send this to you
kay
dale
looking good so far
fyi
kay
per our discussion
i just spoke with ge's counsel
and here's where we are
change the following for the final draft
0.0 delete
remaining
0.0.0 take out the note otherwise
ge had no comments
if you look on the spreadsheet i sent you earlier
it gives the unit numbers for each of the projects
you can figure out the guaranteed delivery dates by matching up the delivery dates from the contracts with the number
also
please fix the use of purchase amount in 0.0.0 as suggested by dale
the esa deal has a change order associated with it
change order 0
attached below
and that co is not reflected in the amounts to be paid
city of austin has no change orders
the assignee is enron south america
thanks
kay
i tried to figure out how to print the whole thing
but failed
did she figure out how to print the entire document
it really has a lot of information on it
kay
lee
i'm in town next week
fishing a lot
though
and can be reached at the kay
dale
do you have the missing info
if not
i can send it to you
kay
i wanted to pass along the resume of carlos sole
carlos and i worked together extensively at eecc
the
reorganization
of eecc has him moving to ees
but he would prefer to work here
he recently met with v
sharp
and she understands that he wants to explore opportunities at ews
i'm learning the new nomenclature
john schwartzenburg understands this as well
i can recommend carlos as a solid
intelligent
hard working lawyer
he's a great guy and i believe he would fit in well here
thanks
kay
hi
got your voice mail
and it reminded me to sent this out
i don't know what is up with jeff
so why wait to send this
next comes finance/m&a
lance and travis
i'm having lunch with dan today
want to join us
we are going to fox diner
kay
does this project have another name
i'm not familiar with fountain valley
is this the same as psco
kay
i'm packing my office
yes
another move
so i'm generally avialable
do you want to come over here around 0
and we'll load up dan and go
this will be a car trip
as fd is on taft
eric
here are some questions from peter
the ak lawyer who is working on the contract
if you can respond by return email
peter can keep this moving
0
payee and address for invoices referenced in section 0.0.0 of the agreement 0
section 0.0.0 agreement reference
you might see if nepco has a reference
0
for the recitals
what is the kw capacity of its plant and where is the plant located
0
according to the spreadsheet
the guaranteed delivery dates for units 0-0 was 0/0/0
the guaranteed delivery date for unit 0 is 0/0/0
are these still the dates we are using
0
please provide the serial numbers for units 0-0 for section 0
please provide the names
addresses
etc
for sections 0.0 and thanks
kay
hi peter
0
i don't think you need to do anything re enron south america
as rob taylor is working on that
were you asking about ena
delaware
0 smith
houston
0
0
i don't know who is preparing all the exhibits
as i'm waiting to hear from ge

0
no
the november payment has been made
you should get the other info by email from eric boyt
thanks
kay
dan just dumped me
so we can go any where you want
do you have a preference
kay
eric
these are already in my list that i sent you
kay
you'll like it
do you want to meet by the garage
kay
peter
enron south america has nothing to do with coa
enron north america is the assignee
as for payments
we can state that as of the signing of the agreements
all payments have been made
sounds ok to me
kay
that paul has a cloud over him
at least he has time to heal before baseball season
we are planning on spending saturday night
neil and i will stay at the b
enjoy this great weather
i hear more rain is forecast for the weekend
hope they are wrong
love
kay

please print
please print and put with other stuff you just printed
thanks
his last day is tomorrow
not wednesday
hi dale
there is another change order #0 which has been signed by abb but not enron
relating to the cancellation of a couple of transformers
i don't think it will be signed until next week
can this change order be used as incentive to get abb to the table on the breakout contract
i'm sending a copy of this to kathleen clark at eecc and ben jacoby
just to make sure there aren't any other change orders floating around
ciao
kay
is it reasonable to expect that enron as well as peoples will be involved in the preliminary meetings

hey suz
i'm off to walk my dog

but it isn't too bad
paige will be home in time to go to lunch
and michael wants her to come visit his school
hope all is quiet

ciao
kay
peter
go ahead and complete the draft with what you have
and transmit it to me with a list of questions which need to be answered to finish it
thanks
kay
that reminds me that i had trouble reaching the pedals in your bronco
looks like the changes are relatively minor
but i feel better
eric
has this info been provided to andrews and kurth yet
it is needed to finish the facility agreement for the lm's
especially if you are trying to move these out of the existing contract on monday
thanks
kay
any problem with this
thanks
kay
i like the changes
i forwarded it to bill to give him one last shot
but if we don't hear from him by noon
i would go with it
good morning
so did i get moved
if so
please don't worry about unpacking
i actually prefer to do it myself anyway
i'm not checking voice mail
so if anyone calls i'm on vacation
period
i've spoken to sheila and gregg penman
and i'm taking care of what they need
but if i take on anything else
i might as well pack michael up and come to the office today
hope you have a great thanksgiving
see you monday
kay
this is the last email i have on the issue of consequentials/lol
as i recall
we have not agreed to the redaction of the carve out of the lol for gross negligence
but it is an important issue for ge
steve swift wants to close out these issues
are we ready
or do we need this for a swap for something
kay
the referenced section are primarily names and addresses for invoices and official notices
i'll pass the other info along
thanks
kay enron global finance
fyi
kent shoemaker
ge lawyer for lm's
is on vacation today
but i believe he will be back in the office next monday
kay
fyi
welcome back
i was worried about you
tooooo much stress
hope you can relax for at least 0 hours

which is highly unusual for me
hope you are enjoying all your guys
kay
hi
matt is over until 0
paige is off with abbey
and i'm waiting for a conference call to start
how many places should i set at the table tomorrow
kathleen
is everything ok
i hope you are just having a nice day to yourself
what perfect weather
kay
i've heard that the turbines are supposed to be moved out of westlb today
the contract with ge is not quite finished
although it is close
kay
fyi
i hope to have a conversation with ge today regarding finishing this document
including the exhibits
kay
do the lm facility agreements for devco turbines need to contemplate ena as an agent
will it specifically be ena
or an ena subsidiary
thanks
kay
hi there
in resolving some issues with westinghouse there was an agreement reached concerning the disposition of the blue girl turbines
as well as certain issues relating to the gleason and wheatland facilities
in connection with this agreement i am forwarding to you a draft letter agreement concerning resolution of these matters
as you can see
westinghouse has requested that nepco
eepc and ljm0-turbine
llc sign the agreement
your comments would be appreciated
kay
i was out on vacation last week
so i just now received this
i'll give it a look
kay
attached is the most recent draft of the facility agreement for the lm0's
this version was prepared for the austin project and therefore lacks any devco specific references or requirements
your input as to any lender requirements
as well as the rights and responsibilities of the agent
would be greatly appreciated
thanks
kay
i love to look up this stuff
kay ps it was great seeing you guys last week
dear turbine torture club members
the purpose of this email is to confirm that we will have a conference call this wednesday
november 0 at 0 ct
the following items have been suggested for the agenda
form of consent to assignment agreement
draft circulated
to be used for lm's and frames
if possible
assignment language
new language being tortured within the enron ranks
to ge soon
limit of liability
indemnity
etc
enron owes ge a position on this
in addition
it seems to me that the following equipment will be
moving
soon
city of austin lm's
to be assigned to ena
then nepco
lm's for the esa project psco
lv cogen
the remaining lm's
pastoria
blue dog
all to devco
right
i suggest that we address any commercial
financial or legal issues outstanding concerning the assignment of these turbines
there may be others who need to be involved in the call
and there may be additional issues
please advise
thanks
kay
rose
i suggest putting
brackets
around commercial operation as the date we can assign without consent
as of now commercial operation is not a defined term
i hope it will become a defined term
so we may want to agree to a different milestone
thanks
kay
i just don't know how many questions they can come up with
i've quit predicting
kay
hi bob
i believe i gave on october 0
so i'll go again around christmas
i'm glad that you've gotten some good news
and here's hoping for a much better 0
kay
you guys must be exhausted with all that activity
congratulations on the grandbaby
that's a big deal
my oldest
baby
is 0
a junior in college
and my michael is 0
every age is special
thanks for the periodic updates about michael
he's in my thoughts
so i appreciate the info
kay
hi peter
could i get a compared version of the most recent austin draft against the original agreement
thanks
kay
sounds good
we went to palacios last weekend
the water was very silty from the rain
and the tide was low
there were a few black drum
but not much else
we did find a stone crab
which was a first
kay
hi guys
i can't recall if you have made any revisions to the exhibits
please advise
and resend
if you have
thanks
kay
here's a new one
michael told me he was hungry
big surprise
i said
michael
do you want some turkey
he said
no mom
did you forget that i'm a vegetarian
i had to leave the room as i couldn't keep from laughing
kay
i think he will just tell us that chicken nuggests are vegetables
have a safe trip back
love
kay
please note
i called cher
hi there
can you dig up peter thompson's number for me
he is in a
k's dc office
kay
here's what i have for an electronic file of the exhibits
kay
please print and fax this to sheila
you don't need to print the attachmenthanks
kay
hi carol
i saw that you posted about getting a nanny
i've used two services
but only one that i can suggest
for my last nanny
i used morningside nanny service
or something close to that
they seemed thorough
and found us a wonderful person
i've also used river oaks nanny
but they sent me a nut case
good luck
kay
thanks
i think this is the most current version
kay
will do
kay
here's a somewhat refined version
with a reference to the financing reps
do we want to be more specific
seller shall only be deemed to be reasonable in withholding its consent if the proposed assignee
i
does not have a credit rating of
___
unless
a
the proposed assignee provides appropriate guaranties
letters of credit or other assurances of payment issued by an entity or person with a credit rating of
__
or
b
the assignor agrees to remain liable for all liability under this agreement until
appropriate milestone
or
c
is a party participating in or providing financing or financing structures
including
without limitation
structures related to leasing arrangements and project financing
including a special purpose vehicle receiving financing to develop and/or construct the project for which purchaser or agent purchased the equipment
if purchaser or agent has provided reasonably satisfactory representations concerning the sufficiency of the financing arrangement
or
d
final payment
except for the retention amount
has been made to seller
ii
is a direct competitor of seller in the turbine manufacturing business
iii
is an adverse party to seller in any material litigation
or
iv
if purchasing the equipment
such assignee is not purchasing such equipment
or rights thereto
as part of a transaction in which purchaser
agent or their affiliates is providing related goods and/or services to such assignee
i just love the law
the next step in the turbine challenge is getting a draft working for the esa transaction
you will find the turbines referenced on the excel chart as esa
brazil #0 and #0
i am forwarding the serial numbers for those turbines
please get a draft going on this one
we want to close on monday
rob taylor is working on this from the finance side
he should be faxing you some language which needs to be included concerning an agency arrangement
he may also have the names of the assignee and the agent
thanks
kay
hi lee
opps
i forgot to send this to you
kay
more complete info
hi eric
i had a computer malfunction and lost your email
could you please resend it
thanks
kay
opps
when you wrote back earlier i thought you were responding to me and not rose's email
so i made a couple of changes and sent it out to everyone
the barnas affiliate language required an affiliate to own or operate the plant
not construct
and i was unclear on the time frame when that had to occur
i'll explain what happened and apologize to him if he thinks we re-traded
and can back off of the changes
the insanity continues here
kay
please send a reminder out to mike barnas
kent shoemaker
steve swift
rose ben jacoby
scott dieball
and sheila
and once again include the instructions
yeah
i know
thanks
kay
and lisa bills
hi scott
do you want to get together a few minutes early tomorrow to discuss indemnity/lol
etc
kay
michael says that you and he will be putting up christmas decorations this evening
straight away
before nightfall
etc
of course
it is a good thing to do at night so long as it isn't raining
i was thinking it would be fun to have a family outing this weekend instead of sitting around the house
maybe moody gardens
that seems like a fun place to go
what do you think
good morning
and fyi
kay
here's the draft form i received this am
look forward to talking to you later
kay
peter
or paul
please call so that we can discuss
0 0 0
thanks
kay
since you both asked the same question
i thought i would send an email
the little i know about rail is that the railroads control the contracts
you do it their way
there is a lot of language in the lm contract concerning shipment
risk of loss
insurance
delivery
i haven't thought through it all
but these issues probably need to be considered
it may be best to work through ge on a change order basis to have them handle the shipment and storage elsewhere
otherwise
we run the risk of having a dispute with them later about any problems or damage
i will be talking to ge this afternoon if you want the topic to be discussed then
good luck
kay
i'll have to ask neil for michael's ss#
i don't have it on me
i know neil's boss and his boss
boss will have parties
i think one in on the 0th and the other on the 0th
stupid day for a party
are those good days for you
i just can't get interested in going to the enron parties
too many people
we could really stand some shopping time
bah humbug
also
kay
fyi
please call me
kay
don't forget mama and gettin
otta jail
this is from my daughter
the first of these two documents contains the key terms of the ge contract for the esa deal
it was prepared by ge
your comments would be appreciated
kay
here's how the numbers are being handled in another lm deal
at the risk of sounding like a wimp
i may just go home after my hair apptment
i don't feel up to snuff
and i think it is my sinuses
check the weather
i can work from there just as well as i can from here
only in my kay
i think he needs meds
including prozac or something like that
he is flat out having an anxiety attack
he needs to stay away from the scales
poor dan
he is making himself miserable
i'm glad he decided to go to the dinner
i bet everyone there heard about all his physical issues
wow
i didn't know i could control anything
change order 0 was initialled by dale and signed by chris on november 0
re stack extensions
i also have a hand marked up change order form from ed danhaus referring to brush power system stabilizers
is this what you are looking for
the procedure has been that the project team/attorney prepares the draft of the change order
or has eecc do it
i give it a sanity check and arrange for signature from ge
the issue now would be whether this change order should be processed in the next week
or be a change to the break out contract
i do not believe the cost has been included in the payment schedule
please give me a call if you would like to discuss this
thanks
kay
more info for your file and use
kay
maybe we should consider going someplace for a couple of days
sans kids
i meant a shopping date
no michael
any place with a fire place
i haven't done anything
i'm just making suggestions
i've always thought it was my responsibility to let me supervisor know if i'm gone
not yours
i'm not usually a galveston person
but it might be worth considering in december
might be best with michael
though
so we could go to moody gardens and the strand
what i don't like about galveston is the water
duh
the san luis is set up for kids
and has a neat view
guess i have itchy feet
i haven't be on the road in a couple of weeks
all i see at the house is responsibility
and we never do anything anyway
any ideas
hi guys
this is the
break out
contract for the lm's
this particular draft was prepared for the city of austin project
but we also need a turbopark version
please advise of any comments you might have
thanks
kay
hi mike
here's a draft of the facility agreement for your review
thanks
kay ps i think i have a redline somewhere
i'll check
attached is the first draft of the esa facility agreement
which i believe is current through yesterday's discussion
i would appreciate it if you could forward this to the persons in transaction support and tax who are working on this transaction
thanks
kay
and now the exhibits
out of habit i sent this to lisa
more
attached is a first draft of a letter agreement relating to the lm 0/coral transaction
please let me know asap if you have any comments
thanks
kay
print job
ditto
they moved it a while back
thanks for offering your previous risk memo
i accept all offers of prior work product
hi carolyn
here are my intial comments on the letter agreement and llc
0
will there be a second set of documents for the llc getting the transformer as well as the turbine
0
tax liability
i think we should broaden the tax section to offload responsibility for taxes related to the transfer and ownership of the equipment
not just the sale
i believe this should be a teh responsibility
0
terminology
breakout contract should be facility agreement
and commercial operations should be as defined in the facility agreement
a reference is fine
0
confidentiality
any reason not to have them agree to be bound by the confidentiality provisions in the facility agreement
if fact
please review the confidentiality provisions in the ge agreement so that we can discuss same
0
creditworthiness
looks like we may have an issue here
we should specifiy that the note should be from a credit worthy entity
or guaranteed by a credit worthy entity
0
timing of delivery of contract and funding
in discussing this matter with our commercial lead
ben jacoby
he indicated that he believed that the obligation to fund would be contemporaneous with the delivery of the facility agreement
or stated another way
a condition precedent to the obligation to fund as opposed to existing
as a signed document
as of the time of signing
0
reps
as we discussed
enron should rep that it has the ability to convey the equipment
or other such language
as opposed to getting into the nitty gritty of our financing structure
i'm still reviewing and collecting comments
but this gives you an idea of where we are headed
thanks
kay
as soon as i hit the
send
button i recalled another issue
enron does not want the llc used for anything other than the acquistion/disposition/adminstration of the equipment
other development activities should be conducted in another entity
at least so long as enron has an ownership interest
i'm going to double check this
as it seems the loi is fairly specific on this point
for the next step
gentlemen
the esa docs are being reviewed internally for financing and accounting issues
thanks for turning the docs in such a timely manner
coa is on stand by
due to our need to focus on esa and two new
identical contracts
remember
we have a lot of turbines
the next two up are the ones previously destined for cal iso
i believe units 0
0
these units also have the dual fuel options included
so the base prices of each will be increased appropriately
we will pay 0% of the price prior to signing the facility agreement
and the january payment will be increased by 0% of the cost of the dual fuel option
the turbines will be assigned to two sister delaware llcs
ca energy development i
llc and ca energy development ii
llc
use ben jacoby at 0 smith
houston
0 for notices and invoices for purposes of the draft
we don't have any of the specifics on the site conditions
so we will have to work with generics
we would like to have a draft yesterday
but seeing as that is impossible
please advise when you think it can be ready
thanks again and again
kay
this is for future reference
a psych student could write a dissertation about that statement
michelle
carlos would be a great addition at ena in any transactional capacity
i worked with him extensively
actually
i hired him
and he is terrific
thanks
kay
i'm sending the stuff carolyn did
and attaching the letter revised to specifically reference the january payment
i suspect that coral may request language like carolyn's version
as it tracts the language in the loi
i can see if i can come up with a reason to go to new york if you want to go there
i know new orleans has deals that time of year
there is also guadalupe river ranch
and some decent b
b's in galveston
team
i still need comments on the ge break out contract which was previously forwarded to finance
accounting and tax
if anyone who didn't get it would like to get it
please let me know
also
i am unclear as to whether the consent form we received earlier this week is the final version from enron's standpoint
any information on that point would be appreciated
thanks
kay
ben jacoby has asked that i forward the attached drafts of the letter agreement and llc agreement
these forms relate to the
turbine only
llc
but once we get the kinks worked out of this we can move forward with finishing the rest
these documents are subject to enron internal review
but in the interest of time we are getting this out for comment
thanks
kay mann senior counsel
here's a form
i'm going to leave sheila a message and let her know about the meeting
kay
i think that him leaving word for michele might be more palatable
hi again
have you been asked to prepare the promissory notes referenced in the letter agreement
if not
please put this on the list
also
what else will need to be prepared to close this deal
i haven't heard for coral yet
so i don't know if they bought in on closing early next week yet
since funding is required they may balk
as soon as i know something i will let you know
thanks again for your help
kay
attached is a revised version of the consent to assignment
this version is specific to the esa deal
but i'm told that the turbopark version can be expected to be close to the same
kent
i'm awaiting final enron input on the facility agreement as well
and i will let you know as soon as i get it
thanks
kay
chris
we won't have any site specific technical info
so we will have to fly without it
i know that seems strange
but there is no designated site for this equipment as of now
here's co#0
each of these units has one dual fuel option
the master list of serial numbers is in this document
we use the unit serial numbers as opposed to turbine or generator serial numbers
i'm sending you the whole enchilada since this is a handy reference
i agree with adding 0% of the cost of the dual fuel option to the january payment
unit 0 to company 0 is fine
the maximum liability price
or whatever we call it
will be the base price allocation
plus the dual fuel option amount
good question on the retention
i guess we should set it up as if each is in a stand alone project
as far as i know they may be intending to put these at separate sites
i'll get back to you on the fax and contract reference number
thanks
kay
i will be happy to review change order #0
and present to ge for their review and approval
first
it needs to be prepared by someone involved with the project
and finance needs to be notified that additional funding will be required
if they don't know already
as i mentioned in my email
there needs to be a definitive decision made as to whether the change order should be funded out of westlb
prior to december 0
or will be funded through i faxed change order #0 to al so that he has the form
if this will be funded through westlb
the current contract value is $0,0,0
here is the electronic form

kay
frank worked every saturday when i was at hmrp
it needs to also go through lisa bills and ben jacoby
it really doesn't matter to me who handles ge signature
i'd like to get a copy just to stay current
plus
it impacts the break out contract
payment schedule and scope
kay
absolutely
kay enron north america corp
please calendar
kay
sorry it took so long to get back to you
today has been beyond frenetic
i agree with your comment #0
i expect they will ask us for a rep like the one in #0
but they still want to hear it from ge
kay
hi rob
we are considering assigning a couple of the lm's to an enron llc
then selling the equity
i've taken a stab at the assignment
assumption agreement
is this ok
has westlb signed of on this form yet
this is the same transaction i called you about this am
any thoughts on the notice question
thanks
kay
coral wants some comfort from ge
this is their proposal
kay
how could resist being part of the light brigade
i really like this one
the word is that giving the notice could put the equipment on the balance sheet
if the coral deal didn't close
the equipment would be tainted
therefore
the giving of the notice needs to occur after we feel certain that the coral transaction will close
the assignment and assumption agreement have been reviewed by rob taylor
and he thinks the agreement is fine
kay
hi guys
in a conversation with ge today
they indicated that they thought it would be appropriate to insert the performance values in the text of the document
and do away with the exhibit
frankly
i like that approach also
could you please make that revision and resend the document
thanks
kay
here's what went out this evening
kay
still working it
kay
team
will esat still be the signatory to the contract as agent for the brazilian power development trust
or will the contract be directly between the trust and ge
thanks
kay
the security desk downstairs may know who he checked in to see
i know who can sign for eepc and nepco
i tried looking up ljm0-turbine and haven't located it
i'll try to track it down
i previously sent the letter to the lawyers i believed to be responsible for the entities
so they have some background
kay enron north america corp
hello
i would like to receive a brochure and room rates for 0
i visited your website and it looks wonderful
please send the info to kay mann

thanks
kay
am i begging too much
can you mail her package tomorrow
i meant to ask today
but i got home so late i didn't get things together
i put one of michael's airplane pictures in there
if all else fails we can take michael to fort worth
my mom would love to watch him as she wants him to be exposed to fort worth culture
a better grade of bean dip
i'm very excited
love
kay
seems like a good guess to start with
just so we are all on the same page
this is the most recent draft of the esa breakout contract in my files
thanks
kay
well i say book all three nights if the cancellation policy is ok
and let's go for it
jack to the doggie spa
michael with paige
the dates are the 0th-0th
so we would be back on the 0th
i haven't read this yet
this is all i've received on this today
i'll try to be home by 0 tonight so i can see my baby boy
and his hot daddy
high class hamburger sounds great
love
kay
the only abb change order i know about is the one that cancelled two transformers
it has been signed by abb but not enron
but it is agreed
it resulted in a cancellation charge of around $0,0
and obviously lowered the contract value
i'll get a copy and send it to you
kay enron north america corp
i've taken a stab at revising the consent agreement to reflect the following changes
adding a material adverse effect clause
lisa/rose
i paraphrased on this
making the consent effective the later or signing or financing
i have zero pride in authorship
this is based on esa
but i would think would apply to tp as well
i think we should get this to ge no later than 0 am tomorrow if at all possible
kay
please send out a reminder of the ge conference call to the following
sheila rose lisa scott mike barnas kent shoemaker steve swift ben jacoby we don't need a conference room this week
thanks
this has sound
it is totally hilarious
hi there
could you send me the word final of the master ge contract which was the basis for the subsequent facility agreements
i don't have it in word
just wordperfect
thanks
kay
mike hasn't sent the new assignment language
to my knowledge we had not discussed including it in this set of agreements
so he may have put it aside to work on the consent issues
kay
good morning
we have made some revisions to the consent agreement
i did not redline the changes since we were looking at two different documents yesterday
we added language concerning material adverse event and the need for the financing to occur before the consent is effective
we could not include paul's request concerning compelling the owner to take action
please call me
0 0 0
or rose
0 0 0
with questions
or we can address it in our 0 cst phone call
thanks
kay
tonight will be late
it is a real rollercoaster
love
kay
i'm going i'm going i'm going
thanks peter
i'm actually looking for the master agreement
not the initial facility agreement
i know that paul
or someone
had converted the original master agreement from wordperfect to word
i thought it would be handy to have the file
thanks
kay
0
i believe swpc further agreed that the assignment to the llcs
and the subsequent transfer of equity
will not affect the terms of the contracts
including the warranties
enron north america corp
thanks once again
i really appreciate your responsiveness
in a recent email you mentioned that you had a couple more changes to the esa agreement
then we would be good to go
can i get that by the end of the day
many thanks
kay
you might want to check the payment terms
remember this is only for one unit
nicely done
let it fly
fyi
feed the dogs and kiss michael
chris
what information is needed for the exhibits to the coral agreement
i don't remember
a taste of exhibits
opps
sorry about the confusion
we are selling the equity in ca to coral
so i call it by that name
i'm looking for a list of what you need as referencedin the last line of this email
hope that helps
kay
yes please
not unreasonably withholding consent and agreeing to the assignment are a bit different in my mind
enron north america corp
sounds good to me
i don't see why the buyer would need the redacted information
other than curiosity
enron north america corp
i'm a strong believer in the team approach
none of us are as smart as all of us
just left you a message
i'll turn back to finishing the letter before i leave
kay
you go girl
please set up a ge conference call tomorrow at 0
and send an email inviting the the following
lisa bills roseann engeldorf mike barnas steve swift kent shoemaker ben jacoby lee johnson sheila thanks

hi mike
i haven't heard anything from dave

thanks
kay
i haven't looked at this yet
but i wanted to get it to you
i'll send the terms and conditions separately
kay

please take a look at this and give me a call
thanks
kay
scott
we have outside counsel looking at this
thanks for the update
kay
there are discussions ongoing today
karen jones and sheila are working it
and i haven't seen a recent draft
it should be ready by friday
kay
hi mitch
here's a darft of the revised letter
please let me know what you think
kay
gentlemen
i'm attaching what we are calling an override letter to accompany the breakout contracts
this letter is intended to preserve the lender requirements/accounting treatment from the westlb agreement so long as the equipment is a part of the financing package
i believe we also want to address an issue regarding assignment
but we are still discussing mike's version internally
kent
i look forward to talking to you tomorrow at 0 cst
if you would like to discuss any of this in the am
please give me a call
thanks
kay
hi mark
i need to addressee's name
is npc here
thanks
kay
more dead trees
kay
ta da
what a great addition to my day
i'm getting close to being finished with the year end crises
i hope i hope i hope
and i'm looking forward to fuelcelling again
thanks for being patient
see you tomorrow
kay
neil
you have my proxy
please let anthony know what you think
thanks
kay anthony
venison would be tough to swallow without teeth
kay
sorry
but due to three closings next week i can't be sure i won't be working this saturday
kay enron north america corp
hi al
my suggestion is that you capture the change order with change order #0 for psco's break out contract
if it needs to be paid before year end
which it probably does
you can put a payment date of december 0th
and it will be paid out of turbopark
this approach has been discussed with lee johnson at ge
and he is fine with it
thanks
kay
call me when you can
kay
is this the same thing we were working on
kay
let's discuss in person
maybe we should ask nancy her opinion as well
kay
your thoughts
kay
i have to confess to having illinois counsel involved
kay
hi
i'm back
i'll give you the short version
i spoke with john
and he tells me he sent mark and vicky a note saying that you had paid your debt to society and are free to explore other options
pretty good stuff
i want to hear what m
cash said
and who else you are meeting with
maybe i can lay some ground work
kay
who is the labor lawyer that you guys use
and do they do plaintiff's work
i've had a couple of people ask me for referrals
and i don't know what to tell them
thanks
kay
that's a lot of money for music
i wonder how they picked that as opposed to something else
i'm betting on a taylor symphony hall
that's building money
hi scott
i'm tied up in a call and i don't know when i'll be out
hopefully
things will lighten up soon
kay
can we meet on this today
we need to reach resolution on some issues
kay
i'm not that wild about the pan sausage
hamburger/italian/smoked are good
kay
thanks
you guys are doing great
i saw you didn't get these
this is so nice
she is one of the lawyers at ena
i feel very flattered that she invited me
surely it isn't amway
please see if you can get a conference room for the 0 call
if there isn't one here
try 0 or 0
thanks
kay
at the time i asked you to set it up i did not not the joe defner and mike j miller would be attending
i forwarded your email
please call sheila and let her know we've made some progress with ge
please see if there is time she wants to talk prior to 0 cst
thanks
kay
please tell mike that i'm on a conference call
but can step out if he wants to come up
obviously
i'm in my office
please call him and tell him
please call me about this when you can
i believe the payment schedule on the spread sheet previously given to ak is correct
if there is a conflict
change order 0 takes precedence as to the timing of the payments
at least 0% has been paid on these turbines
so i don't understand the 0% question
rebecca walker is preparing an updated payment schedule for all the break out contracts
kay
any info
the first facility agreement which needs to be finished is the esa facility agreement
peter and/or chris
could you please send/re-send the most recent version with a email stating any open issues
copying everyone on this email
we need to get this one ready to sign tomorrow
if at all possible
my understanding of the commercial deal is that the scope should include change order #0
with 0% of the value of change order #0 payable on or before dec
0
0
and 0% of change order #0 being added to the january
0 payment
kent/lee
sorry i didn't mention this in our phone call this afternoon
that's what happens when i'm not working from my list
thanks
kay
this is going to be a late night
but if all goes well
it may be my last really late one
plus a little weekend work
we made some progress on some important stuff
thanks
kay
your call
kay
hi guys
we can't sell the acceleration of the put to ge
although off the record they will agree to it
for internal reasons they don't want to go on record with it
i'll catch up later
kay
the good news is they agreed to the current form of the acknowledgement letter
and will send us a letter stating they will sign the letter as is when we close on the facility agreement
i should have that tomorrow
you win a little
you lose a little
kay
big whoop
i just cannot express how wonderful this sounds
kay
hi again
here is the consent to assignment which i believe is ready to go
the only changes i made was adding the requirement to give notice of the financing in 0
f
and making the release of westlb specific to these turbines
0
b
i will bring signature pages tomorrow
and will forward the override letter this evening
please let me know if you have any questions or comments
thanks
kay
here's the override letter for the esa deal
with the new assignment language added
i want to point out that i included the language from the end of the section
i'm having typing problems
notice how i spelled my name below
here's the turbopark consent
please call me if you have any comments
as i want to send it out tonight
sheila
i've spoken with lee johnson and john schroeder
and they are lined up to sign at 0 tomorrow
thanks
kay ps this is consent to send 0 to turbopark

here's the consent form for the equipment going into turbopark
if you have any questions
please call me at home tomorrow
friday
morning at 0 0 thanks
kay
ok sports fans
here's a blue dog
who named this one
override letter
ok
eagle eye
here's the override for your one train deal
i'm about done
how about you
i left around midnight last night
not too bad if you don't have to do it often
i need to deal with abb today
hope you are sleeping
kay
hi ben
i got a call from mike
and he gave me his lawyer's telephone number
he is very interested in the change order
of couse
do i have the pay off number
what would be a good time to talk about the abb payment allocation with herman
i really want to put that issue to be
because i don't know if we can't put the stuff into turbopark if we haven't taken care of it
i'm getting ge consent to put the coral turbines into turbopark
if necessary
that doesn't mean we have to
but i don't want to take any chances
how would you feel about not having the 0 call and just having the noon call
that would give me time to talk to abb
and we would be able to get the llc agreement back to coral
thanks
kay
good morning
i was wondering if michael has settled down
or if he is having troubles attending
thanks
kay
today i'm going my ge's offices
so i'll be in late
if the deals i'm working on permit
0 are supposed to close next week
i would like to take as much time as possible off the week of and after christmas
i won't take off all that time
thanks
kay
i'm out of the office until around 0 cst
but i'll call
in the meanwhile
please have the draft revised to reflect this payment arrangement
this stuff is going fast and furious
and an executed esa contract will be required for esa closing their financing on the 0th
that's why it is first in line
we will need to start on a facility agreement for a project known as the fountain valley project
aka psco
also
i'm going to try to get abb focused on doing their facility agreements
i've asked the commercial team to prepare an update spread sheet for the turbines to confirm the payment terms
i hope to have it this am
what is your direct line
kay
hi rebecca
is email from around 0 yesterday the final version of the payment schedule for the lm's
i need to get the facility agreements organized
and that information is obviously important
thanks
kay
please include these names on the distribution pthompson@akllp.com and thanks
thanks
i'm on my way to see lee and john schroeder
so you can reach me by my cell if you need to
have fun at your daughter's school
how much fun is that
kay
please send it on
you may have told me the answer to this already
but is there a spreadsheet for the transformers similar to what we have for the turbines
thanks
kay ps herman and i are swapping voice mails about scheduling something today
kay
ok with you guys for me to add this
is the procedure for taking something out of turbopark about the same as kay
there may be a possible bust in 0.0
specifically please look at how the math works on the refund due to termination
i think that the baseline should be the maximum liability amount
or whatever the proper term might be
thanks
kay
i'm expecting john schroeder from ge between 0-0
i really need to see him
so please watch for my phone so it doesn't go into voice mail
thanks
kay
ben
are you available at 0am on monday re abb
thanks kay
while we were on the phone i sent ge an email about the issue
kay
i need
the current total contract amount and the payoff amount
george
i agree with your suggestion
and will make the request to ge
kay
there are 0 lm's resident at 0 jacinto port blvd
houston texas
i'm working on the transformers
kay
i left dave onuscheck a voice mail about the issues
and asked him to give me a call
i was going to suggest that we inbed some wiggle in the specifications
but no big deal
kay
a reminder
0am monday
my office
0 we need the spread sheet on the transformer payments
please
thanks
kay
we would like to have the conference call at 0 cst on sunday
any problems
if not
can you get the word out
my number at home is 0 0 0
kay
we expect to have a change order executed by abb on monday
tuesday at the latest
whereby we agree to pay all but the retainage amount
and they acknowledge that we can assign it to whoever
including the agent
right
ben and i discussed the fact that the coral turbines will be moved into turbopark
i believe we will want to assign the turbines to an enron llc the following week
fyi
we have a conference call tomorrow to finish the binding agreement to see them the turbines
if it would work to keep them in westlb
that's great
however
i want to do whatever creates the least amount of stress for you two
i'll manage coral and ben
please advise
ciao
kay ps
just in case you don't know
your efforts are very appreciated
not just by me
michael and i had a great time at the zoo
it was great to not watch the clock
thanks
kay
ena should sign them tomorrow
i assume you are referring to the turbopark set
fyi
most recent versions
matt
sorry i missed you call
roger
does signing the letter agreement cause any balance sheet problems
we anticipate closing a few days later
kay
i forwarded the email to ge and received no comment back
kay
attached is the proposed change order with abb
see you at 0am tomorrow
monday
in my office
thanks
kay
will do
gentlemen
i've revised paragraph 0 to reflect our discussion
also
i made a change to paragraph 0 to include technical bulletins per mitch's request which we did not discuss on our call
please let me know if you have any questions or comments
kay
sounds good
0 inverness parkway
houston
0
i'm thinking ge said
no
janette
i'm available
kay
i forgot to mention something yesterday
0
g
states that within 0 days of closing we will provide coral with the documents on exhibit t
i personally do not know if we have all the documents listed
we need to either verify that we have these documents
or add some language about providing the ones in our possession
thanks
kay
hi john
i'm attaching the current draft of the contract under which we will be able to buy the fuel cell equipment for use on projects in connecticut
the contract will likely be a connecticut law contract
could you have someone give it a fatal flaw check
or should i use connecticut counsel
one issue which is nagging me is their request for a security interest in the equipment
as i think this might complicate financing
i assume that an equipment supplier has certain lien rights under connecticut law anyway
can you have this verified
i only want the simplest of explanations
thanks
kay
david
i believe you sent me some comments to the fuel cell equipment purchase contract
i now cannot locate those comments
could you resend them
thanks
kay
here's a good place to start
i'm including a memo from andrews
kurth
our outside counsel who drafted the form
thanks
kay
mitch
the language in the draft i sent out yesterday reflects our agreement during the conference call
they requested something along the lines of what is in the email you forwarded
but i believe they accepted the following language
swpc agrees that the gleason and wheatland contracts and associated warranties may be assigned to limited liability companies owned in whole or in part by an enron entity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the gleason and wheatland contracts
and that enron will not be required to maintain an equity position in either of these companies
swpc further acknowledges that the assignment of the contracts and the transfer of equity will not impact any warranties or other provisions of the assigned contracts
how does this sound
kay enron north america corp
i hope so
too
re
esa
getting close
he asked me for the comments
this is really weird
i do not know why i can't find your email with your comments
i really think i saw them
unless it blew itself up
or operator error on my part
i will look for a hard copy
kay
i know how to get ljm's signature
enron north america corp
please print
resending since you didn't get it earlier
dave
here's the change order we would like to process today
thanks
kay
i would line up ca next
let me look over what lee sent then i'll call
or you can call when you get free
how was the game
thanks
kay
hot of the press
this should be very close to the last version
kay
there is one completed unit going into turbopark
the address is listed below
kay
$0.0 million
team
i do not know if we have a full and complete set of documents
and if so
how long it will take to get these documents copied
ben
can you address that issue
i don't want to assume that this is a slam dunk
as this is the kind of thing you can trip up on
especially since they are on a tight construction schedule
i'm not sure i understand his second comment
kay
hi ben
have you talked to janet about you being a director in the llc's
thanks
kay
ben
i suggest that we get eecc
or whoever
to put the stuff together
you can't count on the right people being around after the 0th of december
and 0 days is nothing
kay
i circulated today's drafts to finance
tax
and accounting
but have not yet heard back from them
i'll have to confirm when enron will be ready to go forward
kay
please print
the latest
greatest
viola
ben
it would seem to me that the retained amount on each transformer would be based on the total purchase price
including the option payments
any reason to assume otherwise
thanks
kay
look what just came in
any comments
guess neil better start moving the plants
too
gentlemen
since we are moving the equipment from westlb and into turbopark
and since we are just about there with the breakout contracts
we need to process this as change order #0 to the fountain valley contract
i also believe we need the site specific stuff for this project
kay
lee
and others
exhibit b is the eecc spec
right
i do not know if i have an electronic version
if locating it is a problem
we can copy what we have unless there is some reason to handle it otherwise
exhibit h-0 is the s
s training program dated 0/0/0
lee/mike
do you have more copies of that document that we can attach
kay
you are in charge of your own destiny
kay
michael is sick
so he's at home
and taking him to the doctor
more strep
my baby had 0 temperature last night
he was so pathetic
i will probably stay home tomorrow
kay
you are difficult to keep up with
the ground should be warm enough to keep anything from sticking
we got a half a cord of wood this weekend
and chili fixin's
yum
it was a compliment
i'm thinking this is a good one to ignore
hi sheila
i'm not up on this part of the deal
i plan to be there
i didn't think about the champagne
nice touch
i like wick fowler's
really easy
very tasty
i just may have to have some
i don't mind a few days of cold weather
it kills the fleas and the skeeters
if all else fails we will just make copies from the other agreement
we have deleted exhibit u from the break out contracts
in other words
the version they received has been superceded
i'll have to see what i can figure out about where the old reference came from
ben decided to send the exhibits to coral
so that's where this question came from
will we have an exhibit u
i know we owe you some answers from your email of the 0th
kay
hi dave
i revised the change order to segregate the signature page
thanks
kay
i changed the 0nd paragraph so that abb is receiving money
not paying it
i corrected a typo under summary of charges
changed
by
to
to
seller
kay
i thought we weren't going to have an exhibit u anyway
since we are plugging things into the text of the document
i think the real point of the question is the reference to the liquid fuel guarantees
and where these will be reflected
kay
this shows the additional amount related to the fountain valley change order
formerly known as change order #0
hope this helps
kay
hi suz
please print the exhibits and fax to me it home
i thought you might enjoy this one
kay
i like that idea
do we know what the guarantee is supposed to look like
i don't have the agreement with me
see below
at last word the coral deal was sidelined
more to come
i'm at home with a sick child today
when you have a redlined version of the esa stuff
redlined against the master
please email it to my assistant
suzanne adams
so she can print it and have it delivered to my house
if it is being printed by ak in houston
please have it delivered to my house at 0 inverness parkway
houston
0
thanks
kay
i wasn't clear if the new b-0 is supposed to supplement or replace the old b-0
it is up to you as to which specifications you think are pertinent
that gets a bit more technical than what i'm capable of judging
you might want to give the old stuff the once over to make sure there isn't anything which in a worse case scenario you might miss having in there
kay
suzanne
on my desk
on the window side
you will find a bound volume of a contract for 0 turbine generator sets
between ge and a bank with a long name
could you please fed ex it to peter thompson at a&k in dc
peter
could you please give suzanne the information of where to send it
pete
this will give you a full set of exhibits
since you don't have everything
suz
you don't have to make a copy
as i believe that copy to be an extra
if we need a copy pete can send us a copy later
thanks
kay
hi dave
i wanted to check in to see how we are coming with the change order
thanks
kay
the original ge west lb agreement
please
i suggest that you contact lee johnson via email
copying his lawyer kent shoemaker
asking for a proposed form of liquid fuel guarantee
kay
it is my understanding tha twelve lm 0 turbines will go into e next
the esa and city of austin lm's are the only ones not making the trip
kay
lisa is a real hoot
smart
tough as nails
she pulls no punches
michael seems to feel better
but he has terrible circle under this eyes
i'm going to insist that the doctor give him 0 rounds of antibiotics
being a boy
it isn't so bad
i just know that the strep is hiding in his sinuses
so a week after he gets off the antibiotics he gets sick again
he slept until 0 today
and hour and a half later than usual
i think that must be his body healing
he is so excited that 0 flakes of snow might fall tonight
paige wrote me today
said she is freezing
she's north of austin
kay
ta da
i thought this seemed like a good way to handle it
in fairness to pete
we have him working on all the ge and abb break out agreements at once
i'm going to be reviewing the esa agreement
which is priority one because of financing requirements
this will be my final review of the
form
break out contract
we have not had a tax
insurance
accounting or finance review of the form for ena
and with turborpark closing this week it may be difficult to have completed within the next 0 hours
however
i don't expect any big issues
since it is so close to the original form
that being said
from the epc contractor's standpoint
it is so close to being done that there shouldn't be any big issues
just thought i'd mention all the pieces which are still coming together
kay ps
dale
does the lv co gen project involve a lease
a/k/a enron getting off take
i haven't heard anything so far
although i need to check my voice mail again
kay
have i received a fax from abb
i used to work at eecc
so i know that noone controls that group
there is a place in the agreement for a contract number
i think we ought to use the same contract number as before
but add a distinguishing number or letter
like fv or lvcg
how does that sound
kay
dave onuscheck left me a voice mail message that frank had not yet reviewed the change order
dave predicted it would be tomorrow am
that's getting close
but if it is done by then we probably won't be subjected to bodily harm
kay
i'm home today
michael has strep again
but i will check email and you can call me at home
this is a good start
bear with ar
and call me about barbara
sheila knows all she needs to know
we are getting the enron treatment from coral
i hope carolyn told you i called yesterday
coral was looking for shell approval
i'm guessing it is in a coma
i usually have 0 voice mails
and i have had 0 today
which tells you something
good time for michael to be sick
carlos has interviews today and tomorrow with ena
i think he is looking good for mexico
you guys are the absolutely best qualified for that business
and i'll start planting that seed when i can
by the way
thanks for the great job on coral
did you hear from rose on the hsr on turbopark
we do want astros tickets for next year
at least 0 games
are more available
i heard that hampton had an issue with patty biggio
thank goodness
these salaries are absurd
and i guess i'm glad to see ausmus come back
however
he is not a substitute for a pitcher
and how is shane
ciao
kay
nope
not mine
two of the deals i've been working on died
i've had almost no voice mails today
and a third as many emails
this is great
maybe neil and i will get to take our vacation after all
kay

hi there
just a note to say hello
hello
nit noi sounds good to me tonight
if we don't eat out of the fridge
i'm having a craving for ethnic food
love
kay
good morning
i'm soliciting commitments for those wanting to go to the nutcracker this year
i was thinking of trying to get tickets to a daytime performance
any interest
the sugar plum fairy
fyi
i need to finish up an agreement and have it sent to a man by the name of john
steinbow
please call him and get the correct spelling of his name
his address and his fax number
if he
or his assistant
needs an explanation
i need the info to complete an agreement requested by mark bernstein
mark doesn't have the info
but doesn't want john to know he doesn't have it
so please don't call mark to ask
thanks
kay
i had a really big lunch
even cake
so now eating out of the fridge
if at all
sounds ok
i got a really nice bottle of white wine from andrews
kurth
i put it by the window to cool off
i've worked with three trial lawyers from k
s
and they are really good
however
k
s represents american express
keffer tells me that you used a guy at bracewell that you liked
and that this person has now started their own firm
john drew a blank on the name
but will call me back with the name and number
enron also likes gibbs
bruin
a litigation boutique in houston
i believe the main contact's name is robin gibbs
but that is also the name of one of the bee gee's
so i could be wrong
can you check the internet and see
if not
i will look in a minute
love
kay
yes
yes
whichever
hi sheila
did you ever come across the retention letter for pmrw reflecting a fee discount
who would have that
thanks
kay
these documents do not go to a third party purchaser
for instance
they do not get the change orders or correspondence relating ot all of the turbines
what needs to be pulled together are the technical documents
and any project type correspondence relating to the units being sold
kay
very minor crisis
a penny for your thoughts
kay
the end is in sight
the break out contracts for the turbopark lm's need to be finished up
not news to anyone
each of these agreements will be between ge and e-next generation llc
devco
and ge
unless the project company is already owned by devco
i suggest that each agreement reference be the same as the original
with an adder which makes it clear which project it belongs to
lvcg
fv
ciso0 and ciso0
for example
al
your contract needs to be fixed up
please contact pete thompson at ak in dc to get it rolling
if you haven't all ready
0 0 0 pete
the ca development agreements should now be in the name of e-next generation llc
for indentification purposes we can call the contracts ciso0 and ciso0
thanks
kay
but i want you to be in the same group as me so we can work together again
ok
can you get me a draft by friday am
thanks
kay
good
i didn't want to ask ed
he's very busy
so which curse word did you use
at mark bernstein's request i am forwarding a confidentiality agreement for your review
if it meets with your approval
please sign and fax back to me at 0-0-0

this language is different that what ge was told was requested before
i am more comfortable going back to ge with what was requested previously
kay
i need the phone number for tom heatherington

at bracewell in houston
someone should have a directory
kay
it would probably be easier if paige picked him up at the cc
don't you think
kay
this is the language in front of ge
i am optimistic that they will agree to this language
kay
hi dave
i received a signed change order from randy milcer
not sure about that
yesterday
the form he signed indicates that abb will be paying enron
and has one small mistake in the amount of payments made on the cancelled transformers
$0 off
with your permission i will substitute the correct version so abb gets the money
thanks
kay
thought you might want to see it
kay
how's hop-a-long
dick
i'll forward you the copy of the contract on a separate email
i do not know if there are any additional insurance requirements specified by the lenders
kay
this letter is the last part of the contract
oh my gosh that is so sweet
you caught me by surprise
fyi no action required
i've redlined the document against the previous version
but i don't think i picked up all the changes
in addition to the marked changes
there are these changes

my number is 0 0 0
could you send me the full name of the buyer
and we'll get the documents moving
thanks
kay
i forgot about the happy hour
where is it
i think that carpool could be pretty hectic
and since you and i haven't picked him up we don't know the drill
picking him up an hour later might be a lot easier
and it doesn't bother him
are you going to any of tomorrow's activities
kay
nrg thermal and millenium energy are the parties
more specific names to come
next week is twas the night before christmas
fyi
the champagne is flowing in new york
as turbopark closed moments after ge agreed to revise their consent to meet westlb's last request
kay
per rose's instructions
kay
here's the latest
please print
no
why is rebecca walker telling cheryl how to do this
due to rose being out of town
i thought i would respond to a question concerning giving notice to westlb
and the preparation of the assignment and assumption agreement
the giving of written notice to westlb may result in the equipment being subject to the notice coming on the balance sheet
if there is a subsequent problem in closing
the equipment is tainted
i believe enron has coordinated this with westlb
so that the notice period can be shortened until there is a certainty of closing
a&k has prepared the assignment and assumption agreements in the past
and i will go out on a limb and suggest that they conform their form for this transaction
we will have a couple of changes in the ge consent and assignment agreement
based on changes requested by westlb in connection with the turbopark transaction
i'll make the changes
hope this information is helpful
kay
my only warning is that working for sheila is that she takes over most of the big stuff
even if it is your deal
everything that she is working on now was one of her lawyers
deals
but
things just weren't getting done
she can be very unclear in what she expects from you
she is the ultimate micro-manager
she may hire the outside counsel on
your
deal
then tell you about it later
not consulting you to find out who you want to use
this style may not bother you
as you may in fact get comfort from working closely with someone
clearly
she has a lot of experience to impart
and she is very
very nice
i'm sure there will be a downside to working with jeff and barbara
i just haven't been in the group long enough to have an opinion
kay ps
i thought this time i would give you full disclosure
peter
the distribution list on this is different from the esa deal
each contract has a different list
isn't that special
i will forward it to the correct people
lee johnson and kent shoemaker get copies on all of them from ge's side
thanks
kay
hi carolyn
in order to discourage ben from continuing to direct outside counsel
please address as much correspondence as possible to me
or to me and him
ben is terrible
and shameless
about violating enron policy in this regard
and i don't know that i can stop him
but i do need your assistance in curbing him as much as possible
thanks
kay
michael has some stuff at school today that i would like to attend
i hope to leave here around 0
kay
how about a conference call at 0
central
time
kay
scott
i'm handling outside counsel
and spoke with him this week
i'm prepared to give legal advice on the issue
you'll be delighted to know that the call has moved to 0 your time
noon central
kay
things are getting better since turbopark closed
in the turbopark world there will be certain impacts on how power projects involving physical capacity are structured and implemented
i know some
but not all
of it
i can say that it is fairly easy to bust the structure and wind up with assets on the balance sheet
and that the commercial folks aren't always
or even usually
sensitive to the issues
maybe after the first of the year those group members who will be working on the power origination and development side could get briefed by the finance and accounting folks
kay
paige wrote me at 0 this am
and said that since she was still up at 0
she probably won't be home in time for michael's parties
should i just leave him after gymnastics
i don't really want to come back the office
but i do want to go to anne's
hmmm
if paige is home by 0
everything might work
is it foggy or raining
i can't see anything out my window
each project must have its own break out contract
that's the deal struck with ge and with the lenders
there will be no change orders to the master contract relating to specific projects
the break out contract must be entered into
as soon as practicable
this appproach has been taken with austin
lv co gen
and esa
and all of those contracts are just about finished
please call me if you have any questions
sheila also has a good understanding of the structure
kay
with high hopes that this is the final final version
i'm attaching what i believe to be the execution copy
some things have been cleaned up
and brownsville has been added to paragraph 0
i'm going to start collecting signatures
thanks
kay
the attached is a letter agreement reflecting the resolution of certain issues with westinhouse relating to the gleason and wheatland projects
it also reflects that enron isn't going to go after swpc for a return of an option payment for the blue girl equipment
swpc has requested that everybody sign on the dotted line
including nepco
eepc and my dog jack
please review and advise if there is any problem with you obtaining signature for your respective groups
i'll handle the ljm and ena signatures
please call if you have any questions
kay
not exactly a
yes
we can close on wednesday
i'm at home with a sick child today
but should be in the rest of the week
lee
if this will be a dual fuel unit
it seems we should at least have a place holder guarantee
even if the details aren't included
any problem with that approach
kay
i haven't tried yet
things are ok
michael is mad because i won't let him open a present
it won't hurt my feelings if you want to contact abb's lawyer directly
his name is dave onuscheck
and his email is david.onuscheck@us.abb.com
i'm home with a sick kid
and i don't have his telephone number with me
peter thompson has worked on the form
do you have the draft with the memo of issues
kay
this may sound like a silly question
but why
is this something ben wants matt doing
0-0 are all the co's i know about
i'm out today
but we can discuss it tomorrow
and i can explain my point of view
kay
looks ok to me
i've heard of some of the stuff
these items should be dealt with in the facility agreements for the individual projects
abb has had a form of this agreement to comment on for a while
but we haven't heard anything
hope this helps a little
kay
hi dave
i was wondering if you have had a chance to look over the draft facility agreement
we would like to make some progress on the form this week
in fact
you may hear
or have heard
directly from dale rasmussen
who is an enron lawyer supporting one of the projects at issue
there are also some change order type changes which need to be captured in words and made a part of the individual facility agreements
or integrated as changes to these agreements
thanks for your assistance
kay
after 0 parties
i'm getting party burn out
how bad is that
kay
dale tells me that he really needs abb to get with it
i sent an email
yet another
to abb's lawyer asking for comments
kay
michael is sick with some nasty virus
i'm a bit afraid to commit until he starts looking better
poor kid had strep last week
maybe he'll perk up by thursday
but the doctor says it is a 0 day ordeal
i bet you would just as soon not be exposed to it
kay
i will be there
i'm in today
it is basically the same
thanks
kay
planning on it
free food
i know ben wants us to substitute the one signed by the other guy
i'll take care of it
hey
they are making me crazy and i'm just reading your emails
kay
thanks
i rsvp'd
rose
fyi
i wasn't sure you had this
kay
hi heather
hope you got situated in your new
swanky spot
can't wait to see what you've done with it
i'm attaching paige's resume
since she is interested in a summer internship
any help you can give in directing it to the right person would be appreciated
thanks
kay
please send out an email reminding folks of the ge conference call tomorrow
thanks
kay mike
scott
steve
sheila
rose
ben
kent
lisa
i will initial and handle signature
i believe the amount should be calculated through the date of funding
will closing and funding take place tomorrow
or will funding be a day later
kay
the assignment and assumption document has been signed by ena and is being hand-delivered to rose engeldorf
kay
de nada
these are the current drafts of the proposed documents relating to the intergen transaction
kay
please print attachments
thanks
kay
i suspect we will need a d
b on the sweetgum entity being proposed by the new counterparty
we are waiting to hear
we have received documents from them
but no definitive word
kay
the name is in the draft agreements i forwarded
maybe fred can find out from the commercial people where the main office is located
sounds good to me
fyi
0 am this am
for your info
crazy day
attached is the override letter which was used in connection with the lm0 turbine contract as it was moved into turbopark
this letter highlights the 0-0 and lender requirements
i hope you find it useful
this is the type of letter that was included for the pastoria and blue dog equipment
this shows one approach to assignment under turbopark
this is also included in the other override
it is just easier to access here for assignment
kay
so true so true so true
hi john
i took very poor notes from your phone call
did you want to see a form of loi
for what type of transaction
thanks
kay
did sheila want scott to participate
looks like the call will be too late for him
i presume you haven't heard anything or else you would have said something
i haven't heard a word
can't hurt
boyd
i would think that at the least we would want you to attend the hearing
i also don't see any harm in you reviewing the data responses
kay
latest docs
i don't believe ben agreed to absolutely free transferablity on their part
to ponder
here tis
gentlemen
this is now back to being the ca development i and ii deal
please change the name
please send it to me and lee johnson tomorrow
if possible
kay
lee johnson would like to come in tomorrow or friday to sign the facility agreement
are we ready to go
he really wants to get this done before the holidays
thanks
kay
pete
please call me after you have reviewed this
kay
can someone in your office
or the houston office
put together the execution copies of this agreement
we will need three originals
thanks
kay
per your request
hi matt

kay
i have a 0 closing at king

kay
re
notice letter
we sent out a notice letter to ge last friday regarding closing of a financing
could you print me a hard copy so i can show you what changes need to be made
we need to send out another letter this week
kay
for the purposes of completing the facility agreement
we need the name/address of the contact person for invoices
etc
thanks
hi carlos
could you please get dick to sign this
can he sign for nepco also
two original sigs is enough
thanks
kay
i'm trying to clean up after blue girl
can you tell me again who signs for ljm so that i can get signature
who does their legal work
thanks
kay
first installment of finance comments
the attachment at the bottom is the turbine letter
kay
hi janet
the attachment at the bottom is the llc agreement
kay
brett
i think friday is perfect
i will confirm which is the final version
and send to you and john
kay
did they have anything later than 0
you won't get me to bet on this one
i suggest taking out contact information and say that purchaser will notify seller in writing on or before january 0
0 as to the name/fax of the contact
kay
otherwise known as ca development i and ca development ii
attached is the form of override letter to be executed at the same time as the ge facility agreement
it addresses accounting issues and lender requirements
i should have a final draft of the ge facility agreement later today
kay
how about notices going to ca development
care of
this contact
ca doesn't have any employees
placeholder
guess we need to make the final decision
jim
we are meeting with them at 0 cst to see if we can reach final agreement
kay
i'll be in a meeting at keffer's office for the foreseeable future
i'll turn on my cell phone when i leave the office
not really
it was a format agreed to for all the lm's because the intent in most cases is to sell the project
and the equipment
and the terms in the override letter only apply when the equipment is in the financing structure
kay
i had the call anyway with mike and steve
we actually made progress in outlining the issues
mike should be generating an email
we voted to take next week off
hope that's ok
kay
no ben
i know you were anxiously awaiting these documents
kay
more fun for your file
mark
how do you feel about their changes
note that we must mark everything confidential and they don't want to agree to the non-circumvent
kay
for your information/approval
kay
i asked fred to check into what it would take to have enron set up a third party escrow arrangement
kay
eecc may have this
can you check with whoever your team is working with
or do you want a copy job of what was in the master agreement
kay
as you predicted
i've had to do multiple ca's this week
i miss you
hope you had a great holiday
kay
please accept changes and print two execution copies
thanks
kay
no one has said anything to me about closing next week
lee johnson is on vacation next week also
so ge won't be around
kay
per carolyn's request
per carolyn's request
please print
don't want you to feel left out
carlos

etc
unfortunately i have about 0 things getting signed today and i'm perplexed with what i need to do here and i can't these to figure out
which one are you thanks
kay
lee johnson is coming in today to sign off on the turbine contract
is esa ready to go with this one
thanks
kay
i'm looking for the eggnog

it may require a dash
mark tells me you two have his proxy
so i want to let you know that i may be searching for you later
kay
please take the form of the cayuga confid agreement
and substitute this name
this is ca day
kay
sorry
but i don't know

maybe jeff will be around
i have this feeling that i will be turning off the lights tonight
kay

kay
carlos
please email the document to me when it is done
thanks
kay
please include pthompson@akllp.com and ccobb@akllp.com on the email with dial in instructions
thanks
kay
hi george
i'm looking for the ge acknowledgement letter which we need for this deal
can you email it to me
thanks
kay
carolyn
i wasn't sure you had the last version
this is the version agreed to by ge
which should be attached to the letter agreement
i will email an exhibit which needs to be inserted
this is an exhibit to the ca agreements
here's the draft of the facility agreement that abb has had to review
along with a memo for ak about certain questions
kay
i don't have any language like that on hand
i suspect it will be in great demand
have a great holiday
kay
hi kathleen
let's discuss this sometime this am
kay
carolyn
please forward all original documents to me
thanks
kay
hi carolyn
please email me the execution version of the documents signed last week
as well as the current version of the other documents
were the originals put in the mail
my assistant isn't here
so i can't tell what i have yet
thanks
kay
happy new year
i'm available all day except 0-0
thanks
kay
we've handled the notices on a project specific basis
kay
good morning
i didn't wake paige up this am
i told michael he could wake her up when he wanted to
which i presume didn't take long
it feels good to be back
last week really wasn't a very good week to take off
and i was really stressed
it helps knowing that i have a holiday in two weeks
i'm glad
since michael is off then as well
did you make friends with your venison
or was is pork
love
kay
please print and put in binder
thanks
kay
thanks
suzanne just gave me the documents
i like having the electronic versions as well
i can't believe it feels so good to be back
i must be crazy
kay
hi again
i'm looking for the language regarding invoicing which was requested last week
i want to address it with ge today
thanks
kay
a small change
matt
do ca energy development i and ii have federal ein's
thanks
kay ps to all
my answers to other questions
carolyn has corp documents not registered to do business in texas
what would we have on the llc's
thanks
kay
fyi
i've been meeting with the finance folks at enron
i'm still unclearon when we will be able to close
i do know that they believe 0 businessdays notice will be required to close
which is problematic considering the
earlier of
language relating to closing within two days of approval of thfacility agreements
i doubt that there will be
minute books
for either of these entities
idon't expect any documents to exist other than what you've received
i'm confirming this fact today
kay
ge is asking for invoicing instructions for equipment currently in tp
i don't recall that being addressed in the documents they signed
and i didn't see an obvious answer in the documents i reviewed
any problem with ben receiving the invoices for now
then he can process through gf
etc
thanks
kay
they need to have their partner sign a confidentiality agreement
or at least we need to add language that they won't disclose it to them without having them sign a confidentiality agreement in substantially the same form as this one
kay
do you know if the books are done
or are the papers in a stack
i don't wato make extra work
thanks
kay
fyi
i haven't checked yet
hi there
and happy new year
i have a stack of turbine contracts which were waiting for signature
i believe the override letter needed signing as well
should i send the unsigned originals somewhere
thanks
kay
hi guys
here's a suggested revision to the invoicing language
lee
i've asked the question about the other invoices
if we don't get an immediate answer
i think you can send the invoices to ben
and we can process them here
i'm always happy to volunteer ben
by the way
i haven't given ben his signing party favor
as he hasn't been in houston since we last met
kay
looks good to me
george left me a message looking for an update
if you talk to him
would you let him know that i sent the invoicing language to ge
but my contact wasn't in the office
i expect to hear from them soon
kay
hi guys
i'm faxing you some changed pages as requested for the ca development deal
for some reason my email wouldn't go through
i should have an answer to the invoice question tomorrow
if all else fails you can send the invoices to ben and we can process them here
kay
mr
jody pierce 0 smith
eb 0
fred
i forwarded you the notice prepared by global finance
it requires essentially the same information
kay
please do
give lil a big ol hug for me
i miss her
did you hear that carlos is joining us
i don't think he has told john s.yet
kay
hi brett
i haven't seen the fax yet
i'll check around
maybe it got stuck in the wrong pile
kay
i am attaching a revised draft notice of intent to exercise the purchase option for the equipment for the ca transactions
we need two separate notices
one for ca i and one for ca ii
ben/fred/rebecca
could you please prepare a draft of the two exhibits
lisa/catherine/rose
i revised the form of notice to make it track the participation agreement and the development and construction management agreement
i've tentatively dated the notice as of this friday
by my calculations
monday is our drop dead date since a waiver of the 0 day period is not an option
and the deal dies if not closed by the 0th
ben mentioned that i should be drafting a
release letter
for the banks and/or devco
it would be a big help if someone could point me to the section in the documents which set forth the requirements of the release
since i'm still wading through it all and haven't found the relevant language yet
also
please advise of the results of the conference call which you had with the lenders
and/or their lawyers regarding the issue
i am working on the assignment and assumption agreement
thanks
kay
hi roger
we are going forward with the first deal to move stuff out of turbopark
i don't know if you want to see these types of documents
but what the heck
here it is
kay
i haven't seen it come back
i spoke with lynn around christmas
and he said the person who would sign was out of town
but was supposed to be back last week
i'll be glad to follow up
i was out last week and just haven't worked to that point on my
to do
list
nepco and eecc have signed
by the way
kay enron north america corp
i am working on a deal to move turbopark equipment into enron owned llc's
with a simultaneous sale of 0% of the equity to a third party
this deal is supposed to close by jan 0
so i'm getting a crash course on turbopark and how to get stuff out of it during the early phase
i thought i would share what i'm learning
if nothing else as a form of therapy
attached to the email is what i believe to be the proper form of notice to take something out of turbopark
five to fifteen business days
notice is required
there will be other documents involved as well
bill of sale assignment and assumption agreement ucc releases
if applicable
ucc filings are made on all delivered equipment
i suspect a consent by the equipment seller may also be required
more to come on this one
as i learn more about the process i will keep you advised
kay
i've been told by global finance that this is how turbopark stuff gets invoiced
i'm thinking it might help if copies are sent to project people
what do you think
kay
i need ljm
someone in global finance has offered to help with that
kay enron north america corp
lee
the best way to go about it would be to send the invoice to jody
but copy the enron project folks you have been dealing with
are we ready to sign the fountain valley contract
i would think that we could sign the change order at the same time
and payment terms can be whatever the enron project team has bought in to
the banks won't care
have you seen sig pages for esa yet
kay
i went to sheila's meeting
barbara and jeff were there also
hmm
don't know about the faxed signature
feel free to call carolyn campbell at king
spalding and ask
0 0 0
find out about faxed signature
and whether tomorrow is too late
we need the escrow account in place by friday
is mike miller in
ozzie would be fine
i guess
thanks
kay
you know me
i don't care one way or the other
is there a reason why you want to skip it
we don't have to go to fw for the rodeo
i just thought that would be fun to do
and my mom wants michael to come so badly
we can always just go for a visit
in fact
michael and i can go alone some time
like i said last night
you would make a great guide
you'll be michael's guide one of these days
i think it is two separate documents
one for each purchaser
caed i and caed
any response on the amendment to the letter agreements
whoa
we are not wiring money
we are receiving money
this should occur either jan 0 or 0
minor detail
kay
please email me the execution version of the escrow agreement
are we using one
two or three
thanks
kay
sorry about the serial emails
i need electronic versions of the final acknowledgement letters for both abb and ge
so that these can be emailed to them
please prepare a closing list
between this and the financing side
i'm chasing quite a few documents
i hope to have the escrow agreement signed today
but i would really like to know we have the amendment finished
thanks
kay
i prefer the weekend
it gives us a reason to get in and get out
opps
we do have to pay for the account
i was afraid we were going to send the big hunk of dough
please print
it is amazing what i find if i check my email
disregard the request for escrow agreements
kay
this could become interesting if it holds up
kay
sounds promising
hi mark
i thought i would forward this to you for your information
since dave may be getting involved
kay
when do you want to go
the weather should be getting nice later this week
and i need to gush about the iaoc
kay
fyi
note the closing list
kay
sounds good
i prefer to keep it kind of small
if that's ok with you
thanks
kay
i don't want to be the one that blows it
so i'm glad to keep you in the loop
lisa
the previous draft of the notice just mentioned the assignment and assumption agreement
so i went generic with closing docs
happy to list them individually
however
i live off of lists
kay
it happens to all of us
i still have a bizillion roses in my yard
i love them
and i don't baby them
i figure if they die
i replace them
since they aren't that expensive
i would love to include my friend carlos sole from eecc for my birthday lunch
kay
i'm proof reading now
i need a sanity check
does the ge acknowledgement look goofy
maybe i should set it up in a separate letter
i lifted the language from the consent
for your review
any interest in extending it to jan 0
i'm checking
pete
i'm getting comments that people are having trouble opening the abb docs
please send the docs directly to
david.onunscheck@us.abb.com and michael.o
thanks
kay
here's a conformed version
per lisa's request please find a revised notice
kay
attached please find drafts of the following
notice assignment and assumption agreement
with ge acknowledgement
bill of sale exhibits for bill of sale and for the notice i expect that there will be sets of documents for ca energy development i and ca energy development ii
ca energy development ii will include a transformer as well as a turbine generator set
please let me know if you have any comments
kay
this is a deal that will close soon
please print and put these in a file folder
there will be other docs coming
thanks
kay
for your review
i won't do anything about this until you reach a consensus
kay
brett wiggs tells me that he faxed me signature pages last week
he is with enron south america
did you see anything
kay
looks like your stuff
rose
have you seen the signature pages
we need the agreements and the override letter
kay
hi there
thanks for taking my car in
i admit i feel like men get treated better by car servicing people than women
i'm not just saying that
either
on the issue of charlotte
is it your idea that she will take care of tuesdays only while you are going to rodeo meetings
i know in her email she had a preference for not doing the sharon thing
and i do think we lost something when we
well
you
weren't communicating with sharon or amy in a regular basis
i know it is easy for me to say since it is an inconvenience for you
they still have to fund at the same time
works for us
hi brett
we haven't been able to locate it
could you resend
where should i send your set of docs
thanks
kay
even more current
are we ready to sign these today
how many originals do we need
thanks
kay
the abb breakout contract and the ge breakout contract are just about done
i'm not volunteering for change order duty
do you think this is a good roger task
fyi
hi jeffrey
i'm not handling change orders for the individual projects
i'm checking with stuart
he's the coa deal lawyer
to get a consensus on the best way to handle this
kay
lisa
thanks
i forwarded roger the docs separately
but thanks for the reminder
i am capable of forgetting
kay
the ge facility agreements are nearing completion
there will be facility agreements for fountain valley
aka psco

i'd better meet you downstairs or wherever we are going
we need to change the alcohol and drug stuff
please call me to discuss tomorrow morning
i'll be in after 0
thanks
kay
sounds good to me
we really need to get this amendment signed today
please do what you can to expedite
thanks
kay
perfect
sure
the fix we want to make on the drug/alcohol policy is as follows
instead of a reference to a specific numbered policy
the purchaser will provide abb with a copy of their policy
and abb will comply with it
kay
john
enron owns two ge 0ea turbines
which may be sold in a structure similiar to the ca development structure
we would like to update the letter agreements to address this possibility
and would appreciate k
s's assistance in that regard
the counterparties are not yet known
but i have heard evista and cayuga mentioned
if this sounds good to you
i will initiate the approval process for your retention in this matter
thanks
kay
i've contacted john keffer and asked them to help
i will initiate the approval process to get he and carolyn retained
kay
we discussed this with mike last night
he is going to get the number for us
as it is buried in a data sheet somewhere
kay
team turbineb
number one priority is the amendment to the two letter agreements
we are also trying to get the abb and ge facility agreements finalized so they can be tendered to intergen today
meanwhile
on the turbopark front i am revising the relevant documents so the drafts can be sent to the banks today
once the assignment and assumption agreement form is approved
it will need to be signed by ge
this doesn't have to be done today
we are also trying to get both the ge and abb acknowledgement letters signed today
carolyn
have the escrow agreements been fully executed
kay
i'm at home this am
as i want to go by ge's offices this am to get some signatures
kay
hi
i'm at home
trying to waiting to visit ge's offices which are at 0 and 0
michael has been invited to have pizza with stephen this evening
tommy and julie are going out
and stephen has a sitter
sam won't be there
so he wanted to have a buddy over for pizza
i told julie that michael's calendar is open for this evening
hope that is ok for you
i kinda hate to leave the premises since the sitter isn't sitting for us
however
it is supposed to be a beautiful evening
so we can have some adult time on the back patio
i put a couple of steaks in the fridge
love
she didn't leave me a voice mail
who's the lucky counterparty
lee
you should be receiving a package shortly containing the following
0
changed pages for ca energy development i and ca energy development ii facility agreements
these are the same pages that were faxed to you and kent a few days ago
i also included a couple of original pages
0
0
i think
which were missing from one of the originals
this need to be initialled and executed
0
acknowledgement letters for each of caed i and caed ii which need your here's the form
0
assignment and assumption agreement to move the equipment from turbopark to the caed i
there will be one for caed ii as well
this document is being reviewed by the bank
so i'm not convinced it is in final form
you will note that there is an acknowledgement section for ge
i cut and pasted from the consent to assignment from the turbopark documents
but shortened the whole thing considerably
here's that document
0
signature pages
signed by enron
from the esa deal
both the facility agreement and the override letter
obviously
we need your signature
i will forward the final ca facility agreements to you once again
along with the blacklines against what you initialled
thanks
kay
first flight out in the morning to national
i'll check on the return flight
for now book me on the 0 out of national
i can never get both of your email addresses right at the same time
i'm trying to figure out how to have a birthday party in dc or nyc
sounds good
mike will be here in a bit to sign
thanks
kay
please prepare for signature
thanks
kay
this will need to be signed by abb today
i would guess 0 originals
ben
i suggest we let kathleen coordinate the assembly of the docs to be signed
kay
use this one
please send a copy of the abb facility agreement for ca ii to ben jacoby and kathleen carnahan
thanks
kay
yes
no one is signing for ca development today
ben or someone from the commercial team initials
not legal
i just initial the signature
please call todiscuss
please call to discuss
i've sent jrigby the execution versions of the break out contract and the override letter
i've asked him to call me to discuss
fyi
the turbine contract was originally drafted by brian barto
then kathy clark took over
scott dieball
eecc legal
was actively involved in the negotiations
as was i
in facct
it was the first deal i worked on after i transferred to ena from eecc
kay
the abb and ge agreements for caed were signed by abb and ge
there was a revision to the abb agreement
deleting irrelevant data sheets
that kathleen carnahan will send to you
thanks for all your work on these
we are definitely making progress
kay
don't know yet
i'll decide monday
it is hard to get a hotel
so claude made me one in connection with heather
who is there on other business
attached are drafts of the documents to effect the transfer of two ge turbines and one abb transformer to caed i and caed ii
the dates and amounts are bracketed
as pending the determination of the closing date
we will need sets for both caed i and caed ii
with ii receiving the transformer
these will be prepared with the forms are agreed
these documents are subject to internal enron review
but in the interest of time i am sending the documents to everyone
thank you
kay
i'm working like a dog
so it is going quickly
how about 0 am on monday to discuss the next deal
it works for john et kay
fred
is the abb transformer currently in existence
already delivered
thanks
kay
here's the electronic file
this goes with the ge contract
i can't believe we have a puppy
everything smells like puppy to me
even though i took a very long shower
michael and pal had a nice visit this morning
pal is still whining a bit
i brought one of our puppy books to the office
and i'll sneak a peak when i can
i did read about the up at night stuff
and it says that so long as you don't let them get in bed with you
the whining should stop pretty quickly
i hope the resting on the chest didn't mess it up
but boy
was i desperate
he did great using the grass when we got up
he definitely knows why we go outside
kaley picked on him a little
but she was at her food bowl
i set up the little crate where she can't look in it
so he has an escape
we should walk the perimeter to make sure there aren't any escape routes
we probably need to protect the air conditioner wires until he is old enough to train to the electronic fence
thanks for taking the pig rat back
love
i'll put it on your desk
i sneaked in 0 minutes of reading
the book made me think that we shouldn't let kaley growl about food
i'll double check
how's your day
kay
looks like this needs to be cancelled
thanks
kay
i don't remember seeing an agreement
which isn't to say that i haven't
this is the turbine contract for the 0ea's
kay
the dcma states in 0.0 that notice can be given by the designee
karl thinks the notice must come from the dcm
ena
does it matter
i don't mind ena giving the notice in this case
but i wanted to see what the team thinks
kay
i believe this letter is applicable to the blue dog turbines
peter
i can't recall if i've sent you this override letter before
essentially
it is a letter which is in effect for as long as the equipment is owned by e-next generation
but which ceases to be effective once the equipment is assigned to a third party
we will need something along the same line for the abb equipment
if you can send me a redline of the final form of the abb facility agreement against the master
we can discuss how to proceed
thanks
kay
hi suzanne
i haven't seen a revised flight schedule from tap
have they made the change yet
thanks
kay
hi elizabeth
i've had a couple of originators approach me about working on asset management type deals
optimizing third parties
power assets and/or purchase/sale of commodities
a little birdie told me that you worked on something somewhat similiar to that a while back
but the deal didn't go
when you have a minute i would appreciate hearing about what you did
thanks
kay
carolyn
these should be the correct blacklines to include in the transmittal with the ge facility agreements
carolyn and i are coordinating the delivery of the facility agreements to kay
please print on letterhead
kay
do you want to print
sign and fax
or shall i take to janet or someone else to sign
kay
looks good
i'm checking to see who will sign
have you received the delivery yet
subject
re
comparison of abb agreement
you should have also received the original ge agreements and acknowledgement letters
the transmittal letter has been signed and is being faxed to you and delivered
kay
looks to me like notice will be given wednesday or thursday
the changes are being made to the ca i documents now
kay
i had ozzie sign it
and it has been sent to carolyn
kay
the stuff is being delivered in accordance with the notice provision of the letter agreements
which means the original goes to
president
a copy is also being delivered to george
so he would be a good one to make distribution at intergen
kay
will he be there tonight
or shall we go for tomorrow am
kay
i will be travelling to washington dc tomorrow
tues
with mark bernstein
if we finish up tomorrow
i will travel back to houston tomorrow night
and will be in the office on wednesday
i hope to take this friday as a vacation day
kay
is the notice the only change
if so
it looks ok to me
here's a set of ca i revised docs
if these are ok
we will get ca ii lined up as well
i'm on the road tomorrow
but should be back in the office on wednesday am
kay
please create a duplicate set of documents in my ca development folder
just changing the name to ca energy development ii llc
i'll need both sets
thanks
kay
hi lisa
i'm back
and will finish up these docs this am
the notice provision does not require that all the closing documents be completed as of the date of the notice
although i expect to have the package finished anyway
including the ca ii documents
we expect the escrow to be funded today
so as far as i know we will want to give notice today
although it might be later than the am
depending on when the escrow is funded
ben
fred
are you ready for us to give notice
kay ps
laurie mahon says
hello
i'm attaching the notices for ca i and ca ii
please pay particular attention to ca ii
since it is the first time it has been circulated
obviously
we will need to insert the final purchase numbers
lisa
i set it up so ena is consenting
which tracks the language in the dcma
kay
so long as the equipment is held by e-next
jody pierce needs to get the invoices
although copies can be sent elsewhere
kay
sounds good
but if today isn't a good day
it is not a problem
i would like to have a chance to read it
which i haven't
i still finishing up the intergen docs
the reason we were using a summary is that we don't know how ge is going to react
which might result in some changes to the contract
in the case of the lm's we had already agreed with ge concerning the terms applicable to the equipment after assignment
kay
she says you worked together at chase
i haven't talked to anyone
i've got 0 docs going out this am
but i'm almost finished
well
you must be famous in the i bank bidness
as she claims to know you
attached are assignment and assumption agreements for ca i and ca ii
the only changes to the ge form were those changes suggested by lisa
and a little clean up
kay
opps
didn't mean to leave you out
here are the two bills of sale for the intergen transaction
the only change to the form was the insertion of the date
the ca ii bill also reflects the sale of the transformer
i love vincent's and it is close
so i say we go for it
i'll be forwarding multiple emails containing the intergen documents
this is a new transaction
so you can put in your two cents worth early
kay
here's the guts of the deal
fred
as we discussed
we need the physical addresses where the equipment in turbopark is being stored
as i understand it the equipment is in at least a couple of places
and we haven't advised the banks of that fact
thanks
kay
sounds great
i'm starving also
i still plan to be out on friday
guess i should use my discretionary holiday first
i should be in nyc wednesday and thursday
i don't need you to do anything in that regard yet
thanks
kay
i'll hang it up
kay
viola
lisa
ge is asking for fully executed copies of thedocuments they signed in connection with the turbopark transaction
if i can get copies i will be glad to make distribution
kay
it looks like things are moving forward on the intergen/ca deal
if we can verify the status of the wires we will want to give notice today
fred mitro is working on this and will give you a call to up date the status
i have not seen the final numbers to plug into the notices
is this information available
kay
hi lisa
sounds good to me
we will be sending unsigned docs
with signature pages to be provided later
kay
the closing dinner for the big financing will be on feb
0
just thought i'd keep you current
love
kay
please locate jody pierce's fax number
and send it to peter
thanks
kay
one
when i asked the question
i was told that the invoices needed to go to jody
if there's a desire for the invoices to go elsewhere
it will need to be addressed with lisa bills
with roseann engeldorf being consulted
i do not know if the financing documents limit or otherwise specify the handling of invoices
hope this helps
kay
i haven't talked to ozzie today
when i spoke with him last night
we were arranging to meet in nyc next wednesday
and i told him we could celebrate there
i expect to be out of town wednesday and thursday of next week
don't worry
ben can always find me
i would like to review the stuff before i leave town
could i come over tuesday and give it a look
do you guys think we need or should give intergen the assignment docs and the bills of sale
kay
so do we have someone to watch the menagerie
i can probably get out around 0
i could probably leave sooner
but i wouldn't get anywhere any quicker
sounds fine to me
i had a huge lunch
vincent's
so something light sounds good
we could do the usual appetizers at grotto
thanks
did you have a good one
michael was all
cracked up
over the card you sent
kay
hi pete
please send a copy of the fv break out contracts to sheila tweed
al works for her
she needs the info this am
and doesn't want to wait until al gets in
she would also appreciate a list of the outstanding issues
i'll talk to you in a bit on the abb override letter
i don't think there will be much to it
kay
sheila
here's the latest i have
but there may be another turn in the works
i've asked pete to send it to you
along with the ge
i need to do an override letter to pick up the agency stuff as well
i spoke with lisa about that yesterday
kay
neil left to go hunting this am
paige leaves for school tomorrow
leaving me
michael and our new puppy
mid life crisis dog
to our own devices
i'm taking the day off tomorrow
and monday is an enron holiday
so i'm looking forward to some kay time
working in the yard
weather permitting
watching oprah
etc
hi there
i'm attaching the final forms of the assignment/assumption agreements for ge's acknowledgement
it is pretty close to what you saw last week
it would be a big help if we could have these executed by ge today or tomorrow
a faxed signature would work
then we could have the originals picked up from lee's office
please let me know if you have any questions
thanks
kay
attached are electronic versions of the final docs for the ca development transactions
if there are no other comments we will get the enron signatures
how many originals are needed
noticed was faxed to the admin agent this am
please let me know if you have any questions
kay
i never get both of these email addresses right on the same email
kay
here's what i have on h-0
sorry pete
i thought i had sent it to you previously
kay
i think you can just include the electronc file and the appropriate person can print it off when they print the word file with the rest of the contract
i don't have any better idea than that
kay
please print four sets of originals of each of the documents you faxed this am
name in footers
thanks
kay
i haven't seen the originals
i can send you an email which has the name of the files
but i do need them printed so that the footer appears with the name as opposed to the temp file number
thanks
kay
viola
carolyn
on the insurance
i would prefer that we go with set insurance requirements
$0m in coverage
without aggregate
deductible no greater than $0,0 for which they are responsible
we also need a best rating of a-xiii or better
also
we need a specific reference to the fact that the new member will be responsible for the insurance required in article 0.0 of the turbine contract
the certificate of insurance should be a buyer deliverable at closing
would it be better to address our ability to put the member interest to them on or before
some date
maybe dec 0
just to get it on the table
term
i'm thinking we may want to be indemnified for longer than 0 days after commercial ops
as a claim could be brought against us for something they did
and for which we should be indemnified
for longer than that
but we would be out of luck
except to the extent insurance took care of it
maybe we should address reps/warranties separate from indemnities
with the indemnities lasting longer
i'd make the confidentiality agreement last for 0 years in this deal
i'd broaden 0
xii
to include the acquisition of the equipment
not just the facility agreement
0
i would reformulate 0 to negotiate around the statement that the equipment is being acquired from ena
i would also eliminate
or any other third party
on the fifth line
defined terms
commercial operations
isn't in the definitions of the turbine contract
although there may be a definition imbedded in their somewhere
an eecc specialty
please verify
do we intend to attach a form llc agreement
thanks
kay
i just sent my comments to you and carolyn
kay
kidding
i'd go with bubba
but that's what we call our cat
pete
i have a question
is it necessary for the amount of consideration to be listed in the final lien form
exhibit r or s
something like that
if so
what amount goes in there
will this defeat what we are trying to do in keeping the original price a supposed mystery
thanks
kay
attached is the ge override letter to accompany the facility agreements
i'm trying to figure out the abb form
kay
i would think that the loc's for #s 0 and 0 should be for ca energy development i and ca energy development ii
since we will close on those transfers next week
the practice has been for someone from enron familiar with the project
not a lawyer
initials each of the pages for both contracts
inlcuding exhibits
so
we need to make arrangements for that to happen
each of ge and abb do likewise
so
who is the lucky person for your project
kay
it doesn't need to be a vp
it was a function previously performed by eecc contracts people
ben initialled on the intergen form
and john ayers
i think a develop engineer
initialled for esa
i'm off on a day of vacation this am
the enron kind
so i picked up email early
kay
hi kathleen
i left a stack of initialled docs on the appointed chair in my office
if you will email me janet's telephone number
i will call and leave a voice mail about you bringing her the docs to sign
thanks
kay
i agree
please revise the form accordingly
thanks
kay
fred and rebecca should be talking to accounting about this
do you want me to respond to your email and copy them
have you talked to karl yet
do you mind calling him
thanks
kay
i think your suggestion about the effective date was quite logical
but it seems to me that it is more of a sweetgum issue than ours
unless you think we have a problem
i'm ok with going along with george on this
i presume the original llc agreement allows for either the member to sign or an officer of the llc
i also assume that janet dietrich is an officer of both ca's
therefore
i'm fine with your suggestion
kay
the agreements haven't been executed
so please revise
could you also set me up a stand alone release
so that i can replace the release ge submitted on some of the other turbines
thanks
kay
i ordered these for christmas
and am totally aghast that these orders are just now being processed
what is going on
i am appalled that this wasn't handled weeks ago
kay mann
thanks for hanging in there and getting it done
how come you didn't tell me that you didn't get ben's initials
i never expect to have to follow up with you to see if you did what we discussed
i just always assume that you've taken care of it
unless you tell me otherwise
i don't want to change my expectations
deal
kay
ok
i'm out of it
where's she going
please do what you can to find out what is going on
i know you forwarded these to carolyn
but i would still appreciate it if you could investigate
or ask carolyn to do so
kay
congratulations on your promotion
you deserve it
kay
hi elizabeth
congratulations on your promotion
kay
unless someone else volunteers
i guess i'll do the abb override letter
i've mentioned it to pete thompson
but he is in our offices today
so he can't do it
rob taylor did the initial draft of the ge version
but rose finished it
with a bit of help from me
it should be a fairly short letter
this is where i will be this afternoon
kay
my trip may be back on for tomorrow
i'll know more later
i have a meeting from noon-0 this afternoon
at the hyatt
today looks crazy
does charlotte know how to pick up michael
and about rosco
love
john
attached is the term sheet concerning the matter we've been
voice mailing
about
please call me at your earliest conveneince concerning conflicts
thanks
kay
kathleen
there were three original assignment and assumption agreements
one of caed i
ge
and two for caed ii
one for ge
one for abb
i only see two in my packet
and only two are referenced in the transmittal letter
help
this is obviously urgent
kay
i'm thinking that the 0st paragraph of the ge override letter needs massaging
since it refers to the master agreement
i'll be glad to do it when i can
but i'm knee deep in the abb agreement at this point
kay
the intergen loc should be in caed i and caed ii's names
issued after closing on the 0th
the psco deal team should handle the psco loc
which should be in the name of the psco project company
i think
after that deal closes this week
al larsen and sheila tweed can address these
hope this helps
kay
here's my stab at it
i'll be in an off site the rest of the day
i have no pride of authorship
i'm unclear which entity will be signing the agreements
so i've left some
ge posts an loc in lieu of retainage
please cancel the hotel
i suspect the whole trip will cancel
but i don't want to give up the flights yet
kay ps thanks
hi
my trip was postponed until next week
there's a happy hour
official/formal
for my client groups
it would probably be a good idea for me to stop by
but it isn't mandatory
fyi
seems like this is something you should ok
if the transformer contract will be assigned later to a wholly owned sub of e-next
aka the project company
it would seem that the transfer date should probably be redefined to reference an assignment to an unaffiliated company
same thought on the ge override
this is because the override will still be in effect if e-next owns the equity in the assignee
kay
hi ben
i got an opinion from outside counsel
i'll give it a look so we can discuss
i'll move it up on the list
kay
i feel fairly confident that you received change orders 0-0
if not
please advise
one of those change orders changed the delivery dates for the lv co gen equipment
pete
i sent change order #0 to you and paul on november 0rd
via email
i will resend it if you can't find it
kay
see attachment
i have a conflict
how about 0
pete
i'm sending you a fax regarding some changes requested by nepco/eecc
our affiliate
from what he has sent me
it does not seem that the fountain valley contract contains the optional guarantee that is in effect for plants comprised of 0 or more units
it would seem to be applicable in this case
was it deleted intentionally
thanks
kay
please add back in
you might want to hunt down that fax and see what you think about the suggestions
kay
enron is entitled to an additional output guarantee when we have 0 or more units installed in a facility
peter missed the point
and i didn't catch it because i really didn't look at fv very closely at all
rigby caught it
he disagrees with how we massaged his original language for this additional guarantee
and i will try to figure out his point
kay
good question
i'll ask around
here's the slide presentation from yesterday's meeting with the ne power team
kay
pete
i suggest that exhibit s state that ge has received all sums owing
without a reference to who paid it
since they will have been paid from multiple sources
thanks
kay
just wanted to confirm that we are moving ahead for the intergen closings
lisa
i spoke with karl
and he has promised to let me know if there any hitches on their end
his preliminary assessment was that everything was ok
but he wants to check
ben
kathleen will be bringing the documents to you to initial this afternoon
then i will sign off so janet can execute the documents
rebecca
please confirm that carolyn has the final wiring instructions for the movement of money out of escrow
i presume that we would like to close early enough to see money move tomorrow
since the payoff amounts have been calculated based on closing tomorrow
i don't know what is required to make the payoff to turbopark
so i hope someone knowledgeable is handling that end
my trip was postponed
so i'm around
kay
wow
rebecca was reading my mind
please make the requested change to the signature blocks on the following docs in my ca directory
executioncopy bill of sale
caed i
execution copy assumption with ge ack
caedi
execution copy bill of sale
caedii
execution copy assumption re abb
caedii
execution copy assumption with ge ack
caedii
i think this is the correct name
when this is completed
please email these agreements to karl
copy to me and kathleen carnahan thanks
kay
for your review
pete
i intended for you to call me about rigby's comments to discuss
i don't know that ena is willing to accept all of what he wants
please call to discuss implications of his comments
kay
evidently we are experiencing some technical difficulty on this end
the task should be finished shortly
gee
when's the super bowl
that was nice of her
my day is hectic
but what's new
i can't seem to get any traction on getting things done
michael wanted to go to jilian's tonight
but i told him no
enron has signed the docs
except for the revised escrow instructions
yet to be received
ben will be coming to your offices at 0
so he can sign the instructions at that time
i've pulled the financing documents from the stacks
i hope to have a copies of the docs tomorrow
and if so
i'll have something to give intergen
see you tomorrow
kay
i love these stories
i'll be in meetings in and out of the office until around noon
i sure would like to get out of here by 0 tonight
wish me luck
thanks for putting the dogs out and taking michael to school
sorry about the doggie accident
it will take time
i checked the kindergarten website
but it didn't have any info re wear white day
i can pretty well figure out what he is supposed to wear
white
but i'm not sure why
i believe the 0th is mlk's real birthday
if that has any significance
that's not much info
i know
hope you have a good day
he also has white tennies
yes
please
hi chris
happy new year
hope all is going well with you
we miss you
i heard a rumor that the ui deal had an asset management aspect to it
the guys around here are kicking around some different asset management ideas
so i'm trying to get my hands on any docs which might give some insight into some different approaches
do you have anything you can email me
thanks
kay
heather
attached is the ca we discussed
i changed the last paragraph to add the expiration of the exclusivity provision
as i think this is probably a bit easier to enforce
kay
john
i appreciated your help
i'm glad we got to do a real deal
even if it was a strange one
more to come
i'll check on the sitter
but dinner on the 0nd sounds great
kay
hi
hope things are going well for you and your shadow
i don't feel so good
so i'm seriously considering going home
you raise a very interesting question on how eecc and ena will interface in the future
i understand that ena now has a technical support group
something like that
and some of the folks are eecc personnel who have transferred to ena
i do not know their function or role
as for the integration of eecc legal comments into a document
i would say that it would depend on the comment
essentially
the deals are ena deals
not eecc deals
which means ena has decision making responsibility
also
ena is the project sponsor/owner
until sold
and nepco is usually the contractor
the conflicts arise when nepco
usually not eecc on ena deals
is asked to wrap certain contracts
so eecc or nepco takes a position as a contractor
so it is difficult for eecc to act as the owner's engineer and the epc contractor
another interface issue is that eecc contracts personnel do not typically involve the eecc lawyers in major equipment contracts until the end of the negotiation process
perhaps this has changed since i left
but that was how things worked when i was with eecc
on the finance/deal lawyer front
my question is who deals with the lenders and their counsel once the financing vehicle is in place
i'll let you know if i think of anything else
i suspect sheila will have some insight
also

antitrust division won't challenge electricity distribution cooperative washington
bna
a proposal by 0 rural arkansas electric power distribution cooperatives that would allow them to market electric power to retail customers passes antitrust muster
according to a jan
0 business review letter by the justice department's antitrust division
which could find no lessening of competition in any electric power market
the distribution cooperatives are 0 nonprofit cooperative corporations formed under the electric cooperative corporation act of arkansas to provide electric service predominantly to rural consumers
each distribution cooperative is owned by the individual member/consumers that it serves and is legally obligated to distribute annually all its income to its member/customers
due to the 0 enactment of the electric consumer choice act
which mandates competition in the retail sale of electricity beginning as early as jan
0
0
the manner of selling and buying retail electricity within arkansas will change greatly
consumers now purchase electricity only from the regulated electric utility serving the territory in which the consumer is located
under the act
a consumer will be allowed to purchase electric energy from any entity in the competitive marketplace
and the consumer's incumbent utility will have to deliver that electricity to the consumer's door under regulated distribution charges
the new legislation's primary focus is the separation of the retail marketing activities--which will be completely competitive--from the electric utility's regulated transmission and distribution activities
to ensure that the utility's marketing operations do not benefit improperly from its relationship with the utility
the act provides that employees engaged in the transmission and distribution system operations are required to function independently of employees engaged in the marketing or sale of electricity at retail
the act creates an obligation for each incumbent utility to offer a standard service package to any consumer who has not been willing or able to secure an alternative energy service provider
distribution cooperatives
under the act
may serve these consumers
referred to as default consumers
directly or they may assign them to an affiliate
the rates for the standard service package will be a market rate
unless the incumbent utility chooses to offer a regulated rate approved by the arkansas public service commission
the proposal advanced by the distribution cooperatives would enable them to create a joint venture to market electric power to retail customers throughout arkansas
all retail marketing activities outside the traditional local territories of the distribution cooperatives would be conducted through the joint marketing venture
if a distribution cooperative decides to withdraw from the joint venture
it may compete with the joint venture for any and all consumers
the proposal provides that each distribution cooperative would decide individually whether to serve its default customers directly or to assign its default customers to the joint venture
each distribution cooperative has a relatively small amount of the electric power generating capacity in arkansas
and the combined generating power capacity of the 0 distribution cooperatives is approximately 0 percent of the total generating capacity in the two areas of arkansas in which the joint venture is likely to market
the joint venture is expected to achieve economies of scale that would give it significantly lower distribution costs in statewide or regional markets than would be attainable by individual members
procompetitive effects in the business review letter
acting assistant attorney general a
douglas melamed indicated that the proposed joint retail marketing venture does not appear to have any anticompetitive effect
he commented that
while the distribution cooperatives could be viewed as potential entrants into each other's local retail markets
regional markets and a state-wide market
their small size and relatively high operating costs make it unlikely that they could enter new markets on their own or that
if they tried to enter
they would offer effective competition
melamed added that
the existence of other
larger potential entrants into
the local retail markets
would significantly diminish
if not eliminate
any anticompetitive effect that might otherwise result from the joint venture proposal
it seems at least as likely
if not more so
that the joint retail marketing proposal would have the procompetitive effect of creating an additional entrant into retail markets not currently served by the distribution cooperatives
the business review letter is available at antitrust division's web site
and a file containing the business review request and the division's response may be examined in the antitrust documents group of the antitrust division

did you check out the link to the spandex picture
hope you feel better soon
could you let me know how many there are
so i'll know how we want to handle this
i'm feeling fine today
shall i check with charlotte about dinner at keffer's
hi
we can get a computer hook up through time warner for $0 month
could you ask john if he likes it
can it be installed anywhere in the house
thanks
kay
sandra
can you confirm that a non-smoking room was requested
thanks
kay
hi charlotte
we've been invited to someone's house for dinner on feb 0
can you take care of michael
the dinner is in river oaks
so we could just drop him off
michael got a hair cut this weekend
i think it makes him look taller
i wish it worked that way for me
it is very short
and i think very cute
kay
your vote
i think i'm going to be in nyc tomorrow
otherwise i'd say your place
i'll find out what neil thinks
thanks
kay
john
we have a sitter lined up
so feb
0 sounds great for dinner
neil and i are looking forward to it
kay
i am scheduled to be out of the office tues-thurs of this week
i will be in new york with mark bernstein negotiating a term sheet for the co op city deal
this is one of the asset management deals i'm working on for the ne power team
i haven't confirmed with mark that the trip is still on
so there is still the possibility that it might cancel
kay
this looks like too much trouble
hi there
is this required by our agreement
or just a nice touch
we have a fairly long list of people who we would have to track down
and it seems to me that these people can be replaced
or have been
without the formality of resigning
i'll send you the list separately
thanks
kay
yes
but you would have to track down all those people
you might have this info anyway
please calendar for sheila and me
thanks
kay
are you ok
i didn't go back and check
but i believe the bills of sale or the assignment/assumption agreement may help
as one of these should have the serial number
i think you may have a spread sheet that ties serial numbers to unit numbers
at least i hope so
let me know if this doesn't get you what you need
kay
here
tis
i don't think it compared the charts
but it found lots of other things to compare
kay
i think you should send them back to lee and let him dispose of them
here's something to look at
kay
i figure longer life expectancy is just to make up for all the crummy female days we have
we probably have the same number of quality days as men
if that
i saw pictures on the tv screens on one of the floors
but i didn't hear about the capture
how did they do it
this term sheet relates to a new deal of mark bernstein's
we haven't responded to it yet
i suspect you will be consulted about it soon
so i thought i would give you a heads up
roger and herman have heard a bit about the project
and joe d has been briefed
looks like more for turbopark
kay
yes
this is issue is still around
thomas
i had some correspondence faxed to you today
in it sw is clearly taking the position that the damage to the generator occured after delivery under the contract
i thought you addressed that well in your memo
however
i have another question
what impact does the use of ddp
incoterms
have
is it just one more part of the contract to be taken as a whole
or might it have some greater significance
will the passage of rol impact the ld claim
i assume not
but i want a sanity check
thanks
kay
he is chatty in the am
i enjoy the ride with him
i'll let cb know that i'm in town
kay
should have included you guys as well
here's the current draft for a sanity check
does this mean they didn't have to induce
please tell her congrats if you talk to her
kay
my trip cancelled
so i'm around
i can pick michael up at your place if this is easier for you
kay
you might check out this link and look at the classes
i haven't been able to take anything but orientation yet
but i hear great things about the classes
this needs to be
turboparked
parties changed
gfinance advised
is there any special deal on payment for the change order
i'll figure out how to change the signature lines
etc
kay
sounds fine to me
kay
could you forward the attachment referenced in your email
we all do that
fyi
hi ben
has anyone asked you to take a look at this
if not
i would be interested in your comments
kay
hi there
i'll send you the final doc's so we can discuss
i generated the forms
then finance and the banks commented on the forms
kay
as promissed
for tom h
are any of these available
sheila would like to re-schedule tomorrow's call for friday
could you send out an email to the ge/enron group to find the best time
thanks
kay
i think sheila probably got this invitation
i'm planning on going assuming i'm in town
hi
charlotte is taking michael home because they were going to mcdonald's
will you be leaving for home at 0
mitch
i need to get the ljm signatures
i've spoken with the finance folks who can help with this
and i'll try to get that wrapped up asap
kay enron north america corp
i'll follow up
you sound so pitiful
i haven't forgotten you
kay
abb is asking for its original of the facility agreement
in fact
i need to get originals of the abb and ge facility agreements to abb and ge
when can i get those docs
thanks
kay
hi
who can meet when
here's the latest
i can only open it if i launch it
i can't view it
you might try that
i think i can print it
please see if you can get me 0 minutes via phone with john klauberg at 0 today
he mentioned in his voice mail that he might want to bring in someone else from his firm
which is fine
mark bernstein will also be on the call
i'll call him at 0
cst
if he is available
thanks
kay
so are you gold
if not
go ahead and use the miles if you want
i'm glad that michael had the opportunity to meet dr
b
thanks for making that happen
kay
tomorrow is fine

just got it
so i haven't read it
please let me know what you think
kay
looks fine to me
i'm sorry
i thought that you would remember that this is one of the chicago/people things
since we recently discussed jones
day
etc
my bad
kay
i presume that you would just as soon continue to follow this
kay
fyi
these is in essence the sale of two of the illinois development sites that i worked on
i'll follow up
kay
no turbopark
no ge or abb issues
i feel like i'm missing something
i'll get up to speed asap
kay
fyi
no action required
well
i hope this won't be too complicated
did you hire cory
and if so
what did you think
here is one option
the problem would be getting him picked up when i'm out of town
charlotte might be able to help
also
there's the presby church
i wonder if sotw has something
he might enjoy a visit
i just got to work and got my computer up and going
yes
the whole ordeal was 0 0/0 hours
i just noticed that i forgot to send you the originals of the letter agreements
i will have the abb contract picked up at the same time
thanks
kay
i'm all for getting as much booked in q0 as possible
at this time it appears that i will be going to nyc on wednesday
returning friday afternoon or possibly thursday night
i'll miss the turbopark closing dinner
which is not all bad
as it will save me a lot of calories and a headache
i will miss getting the pat on the back
i didn't want to miss michael's open house
though
as that was more important
as you know
things are subjec to change
kay
hi charlotte
we are starting to check out our options for the summer
and one of the things we are considering is the day camp that enron is involved with
they pick up and deliver from the enron building
and i was wondering if you might consider picking michael up from here
enron
i suspect most days he could go to your place
i have no idea if this is the direction we will go
but i thought i would run it by you early on
i have to think about how much travel i might have
as it might be hard on neil to take michael downtown in the morning
paige has applied for a job at enron
though
so if that worked out we would be in good shape
here's a link
they have some neat themes
have you heard of any other good day camps
you seem to be plugged in fairly well
thanks
kay
hi kathleen
i'm having difficulty reading parts of paragraphs 0 and 0
are these jumbled on your screen
thanks
we have 0 of each of these available at $0
or whatever face value is
just let me know what you want to do
thanks
kay
well
there's an argument to be made that the remedy for breach of an option agreement is us suing them for specific performance
ie
making them sell us the land
since we shouldn't have any obligations under an option agreement
i don't worry about arbitration
let me think about it
though
guess what
the closing party isn't until feb
0
i had the wrong week
glad i didn't show up on the wrong day
beautiful weather
might want to sit outside and have a little cocktail
or equivalent
tonight
i had mexican food for lunch
so popcorn for dinner
love
kay
i called him
good idea about taking the sausage
are you going to the store
if you do
i could use some diet coke
silver and gold
well
this is the same lady from yesterday/this am
how does the fifth ticket work
ok
my hubby tells me the tickets you want are available
and he'll put your name on them
so to speak
kay
note change from def to clay
ok
ann
i'll be there
thanks
kay
any idea what the going rate is for a limo on a thursday
nothing extraordinary needed
just your basic version
thanks
kay
it should be under diaz
ann
if she got an invite
surely she got invited
corey
thanks
was the doc based on any previous enron transactions
thanks
kay
i wanted to make sure that you saw this
i was supposed to make a
to do
list of the world hunger team
limit of liability/indemnity
steve has provided a draft
assignment
although we reached an accord for turbopark purposes
the basic issues remain for discussion
confidentiality
mike has circulated a revised draft
termination
this ones on my list
warranty
scott has some comments to discuss
we also discussed streamlining the time lines
etc
kay
i don't think carolyn needs them
but i will think about it
hi clark
good to hear from you
i'm headed to nyc this week
so lunch doesn't look good
i would love to see nancy
though
she did a very nice job for us
i can't find any information on corey
can you give me a little background information
i couldn't find him in the bp directory or website
hope all is well with you
and i hope we can get together soon
kay
per barbara's request
here's a summary of much of what i'm working on
co op city asset management arrangement
in this deal
enron would build a small power generation facility for a housing co op in the bronx
co op city
we would arrange for o
m services
supply the fuel
primarily gas
market their excess power
and
for the first 0 years
take 0/0 the offtake
we are currently working to structure the transaction to keep if off the balance sheet and maximize the mark
we are working on a term sheet
and i will be in nyc later this week to continue negotations with the customer
mark bernstein is the originator
debbie chance is the developer
and nepco houston is involved
i discussed outside counsel with jeff
and i would like to use john klauberg at lebeouf
sell of two development projects in illinois
two of the sites we have developed
sans equipment
are up for sale
and fred mitro has contacted me about supporting the transaction
lisa mellencamp had previously contacted bracewell about working on it
but i'm a little concerned about the amount of experience of the person they have designated
i've asked clark thompson for some information on his background
sw 0d
our claim against swestinghouse
and possible sale of the equipment
we have issues with the vendor concerning the late delivery of this equipment
we are also trying to sell the equipment
a turbine/generator set
to calpine
fuel cells
last year enron made a $0million investment in fuel cells
a company which is developing an almost green form of power generation
we received contingent warrants which we can cash in if we arrange for 0 mw
we are working with an instrumentality of the state of connecticut about them buying 0 megawatts
we are working on the purchase agreement with fc
and the project development agreement with the state
it is quiet right now
as funding is figured out
there's turbopark maintenance stuff which pops up weekly
ge
sheila and i have a weekly phone conference with ge to work on a standard contract for buying turbines
i've heard a rumor that we will be buying some more
although neither sheila nor i have been contacted yet
i think this is a fair summary of the big ticket items
kay
i have a meeting at eecc which is scheduled from 0-0
but there is a risk it will run long
0 would be better
thanks for setting this up
kay
do we have a ca with either co op city or a company called riverbay something or other
thanks
kay
works for me
i saw scott dieball at mr
izzo's going away reception
and shared the happy news that we voted unanimously for him to set up the next conference call
kay
there's a monthly birthday party thing at 0 up here
i know you don't always get the word
so here's the word
how's your brother
how about a ca with pb power
or parsons brinckerhoff power
thanks
kay
gotta hear about your trip
was it fun
how about some new carpet
i hate the carpet in the bedroom
although it does hide dog hair well
if we want to stick with dark carpet
i like the green upstairs
well
there's no instant gratification with that
although it is logical
fyi
you are welcome to join us
kay
yes
please
i need a reciprocal confidentiality agreement with
one penn plaza new york
ny 0 attn
mr
stephen losi re
potential asset management transaction with riverbay corporation relating to co op city
one year term
thanks
kay
make that brinckerhoff
did i write you back
everything is going well here
i like the work a lot
and i have some nice clients
i can't wait for carlos to get here
though
i went to izzo's going away reception last week
boy
there are a lot of new faces over there
in in new york the rest of the week
maybe next week
i hope you keep baby pictures with you at all times
kay
geez
lots of choices
your vote
you're right
it sounds better spoken than it looks written
i get the point
though
0ish my time looks good
kay
could you check with ben to see if he wants a set
when you get a minute i need to discuss the last attachment for the co op term sheet
the asset management one
here's the current state of the draft
we do not have a current ca with pb
i will have one in the am to send out
do you want jude
et al to look at the epc contract stuff
kay
absolutely
lisa
i've made some preliminary suggestions on the term sheet
we will have some comments on the asset management attachment
but i don't have those together yet
in looking through our files i don't find a confidentiality agreement
therefore
i'm attaching a draft of what we would like to have executed so that we can send you other documents
thanks
kay
this is important stuff
pop quiz material
kay
have you asked rusty
i believe kathleen gave him a hard copy yesterday
i made the changes myself
here's the option we discussed yesterday
it has some farm tenancy stuff which i want to make sure you see
thanks
kay
let's discuss
sorry about this
i forgot
i'll give it a look
i ran a redline from the last version i had electronically
i've forwarded the current version to herman for his review and approval
due to some of the changes
enron may need some revisions as well
kay
here we go with a renewal that puts us to 0.0%
but the purchase price is not so much
hi david
the owner is willing to do this cost plus
do you have a cost plus form that you like
it was good to see you yesterday
by the way
do you want me to include you on follow up emails on this
kay
view it
don't launch it
then you can print it
hi
i paged you soon after i left the school
but never heard back
i also tried your cell
but it said it wasn't on
are you plugged in today
ace
i'm a lawyer at ena
we are selling some of our peakers
and in conjunction with the sale we have agreed to not contest siemens westinghouse retaining the blue girl reservation payments
sw has asked that ljm sign off on the agreement
and rose has suggested that i send the original agreements to you
and indicated that she would help coordinate signature
your help is appreciated
please let me know if you have any questions
kay
i've sent it to the finance group who will obtain ljm signature
if i have any problem
ie
it looks like it won't be done this week
i'll let you know so maybe you can expedite on the commercial side
i'd like to give them a day or two first
kay enron north america corp
i need your exceptional help with this
i just noticed a glitch
which i'll fix
do you have any comments
imagine that
i made it to nyc with no problem
the weather is nice enough
but windy
i'm on my way to a meeting
fred
if we have the same purchaser for both
it would be a lot easier to agree to the form
then duplicate it
do you see any problem with this
i will have to have the electronic form emailed to me
then i can make the changes
i brought the hard copy
but i don't have access to the electronic form
have they indicated if they want to go forward with this
or are they still kicking tires
i need to set priorities
so it would help to know what's most important
especially since i'm on the road
do we want to continue marketing the sites during the time period between signing and termination
i don't think 0 weeks would be a problem after signing
no turbopark
on the issue of the conference call friday
i have a meeting with the customer which starts in the am
then i'm on the road
monday would be 0 times better
if this is at all possible
in that won't work
i will have more details about timing of my friday meeting tomorrow
thanks
kay
please give this a look and take a first stab at it
thanks
kay
ok
friday was going to be really difficult for me anyway
kay
hi
there's a document in my o drive directory called kendallsale
or something close
i can't remember where i put it
probably under general loi
could you email it to me
thanks
kay
please email me whatever version of the doc you sent to them
when it is time for discussions meaningful discussions i would like to be involved
thanks
kay
hi john
i'm out of town
but will give this a look when i return
kay
did i send this to you yet
kay
i'm flying home tomorrow
but i won't be in the office
does today look better
we need carlos
i've picked up several new deals this week
a couple of them would be perfect for carlos
kay
hi john
mark and i are still working at the hotel
waiting to hear from the counterparty
could you forward this to jon
i don't have his email address
thanks
kay
i agree that we don't need outside counsel on the call at this point
if i'm available
i'm happy to participate
the scheduling problem is due to my travel plans
i'll join in if the call is at a time i can fit in
otherwise
i'll catch up with you later about the results of the call
kay
thanks
do you have some free time today
i'm not sure about our schedule
but if we have free time which matches up with you
i would like to spend some time discussing the issues
kay
gentlemen
as dave and john know
i'm working on a deal for ena
and with jude
which has as one aspect a cost plus epc contract for the construction of a power plant
we need to put together the t's and c's for a cost plus contract
and since it is possible that nepco might be the contractor
i wanted to use something that is acceptable to nepco
i will then take the laboring oar in order to get a working draft prepared for this project
as always
i'm on a short time frame
so your response would be appreciated
thanks
kay
kinda cute
here tis
suzanne is out today
so would you mind finding this document and having someone fax it to me
i'll email my fax number to you
much grass
kay
thanks
here's the first one
thanks
kay
please print the second agreement
the letter agreement
and fax to me
thanks
kay
it doesn't look like it is going to work out to meet today
we should be back next week
though
kay
many thanks
when i first started in the e
c bidness all our company did was cost plus work
i may have some old exhibits about how the mulitplier was used to capture benefits and burdens
both for field people and home office
you know the goal is to never create an original document
kay
i'm in nyc
returning tomorrow
neil hasn't mentioned mac calling
but i really didn't think we would hear from him again before today
we meant to leave the stereo
hope you don't mind
paige got a new one for christmas
and her old one seemed perfect for the pink house
we enjoyed our visit also
thanks for everything
sorry to hear about the girls
tis the season
i hope lisa has a nice birthday tomorrow
even with sick kids
gotta go meet someone
love
kay
you might hear from mac tonight
hope so
you can give him my cell phone for when he gets in
and we can leave a key under the doormat
gotta go meet mark
love
kay
yes
but let me review it before anyone else sees it
thanks
kay
i know we don't do the bbq
but i would think about this
not yet
we are working on a solution
kay
how's about we talk about it
i think that's more efficient
as long as we talk before the next call
we should be in good shape
kay
hi there
this came in while i was on the road
mac mentioned his girlfriend
but he didn't mention the rice thing
hmmm
we would love to have him at uh
since he won't aim any higher
and we thing it beats swts
he and his friend were wonderful house guests
i hope no one got worse on your b day
many happy returns
love
kay
hi there
nothings comes off the list
new additions are as follows
new transaction with morgan stanley dean witter
relating to the creation of a jointly owned control area to address generation
transmission
and retail load delivery
it is brand-spanking new
so i don't know much more than this
it is being handled by ozzie pagan
new opportunity with new jersey natural to develop projects using fuel cells
heather kroll is the contact
sale of blue dog
ge
turbine
likely buyer
at last word
is nrg
could be complicated if ge protests
there's a rumor that we are buying some new turbines from ge
but i haven't been contacted
the rumor came from ge reps
who asked if i was working on it
sheila isn't handling
either
last i knew
everything else is the same
i expect to be in nyc in the middle of the week to continue negotiations on the co op city deal
with mark bernstein
please let me know if you have any questions
kay
this is a slam dunk
don't screw it up
ok
seriously
carlos
you missed a wonderful evening on friday
john
it is hard to believe that you could have acutually have married up
good for you
please thank debbie for a perfect night
john
more details on the platimum amex with president's club membership
for real
i'll process the assignment to john on monday
i don't expect a problem
and am ready for it if it surfaces
no big deal
kay
i checked all my emails
and i don't have any indication that i received/reviewed this version of the document
the redline is the redline against the last version i have on file
if the other folks sign before it has been reviewed internally
it is possible that changes will be required
it won't be extensive
i will ask karen way to call me before making changes to drafts
or at least advising me via email so that things will flow more smoothly
kay
this should be good enough
thanks
kay
attached is a red-line of the revised form against the form john s
sent me
please advise of any comments as soon as possible
kay in the interest of time i'm sending it out before i've reviewed it
so forgive the typos
etc
please email the letter to me before ben signs it
thanks
hi pete
here's the contract we discussed on the telephone
to make life easier
please set the exhibits up as a separate electronic file
it is a heck of a cut-and-paste job
but it will really help when we start blacklining docs
thanks
kay
it is a comparerite document
if you
view
it in email
then you can save it as a word document
if this doesn't work
let me know and i'll create a word doc
kay
yes
i got someone else to help me
thanks anyway
hi there
i've made some suggested changes on the co you sent
in the interest of time i'm sending this to david marshall
since this largely deals with rol and insurance
and i couldn't tell if he has read this previously
thanks
kay
i should have included you
sorry
i had mexican food for lunch
so lite dinner for me
i had lunch with oz and heather
oz drove us in his new mb convertible
really nice
it is a 0
silver
how's your day
please check the last couple of pages and see if i'm close
kay

thanks
kay
i'm having copies made of the due diligence binders

i usually take my computer and use it on the road
hope you are enjoying this perfect weather
love
kay
i hear erik kingshill is moving on
also paul myford is looking for a new spot
what a lot of changes
opps
i thought we were talking about the same co
could you please send me a copy
or electronic file
of the letter you are incorporating by reference
this co will need to be signed by janet dietrich
managing director
is the replacement n-0 the same as the replacement n-0 in co #0
i'll give this the final once over as soon as i get the letter
thanks
and sorry for the confusion
kay
hi there
please get someone to hang my white board behind my door
thanks
kay
jd approved referral of this to keffer et al
fred is anxious to get something to the counterparty
his preference is yesterday
i would think that a discussion with fred about the deal might be in order today
even if by phone
what is your availability
john/carolyn
have you had a chance to review the draft i sent you
and do you have any notions about how to structure this deal
is the format ok
can we make it more seller friendly without being ridiculous
when the initial draft is ready
it will need to go to matt gockerman
ena tax
and herman manis
structuring accountant
ciao
fred
i suggest a phone call among the team today to make sure we are all on the same wave length
what is your schedule
thanks
kay
that just means there is plenty of work to go around
here's a first draft
i can't find a working printer to print to
what a way to work
so i haven't printed it yet
if you can print a copy
i would appreciate it
kay
i'm tied up but you don't need me anyway
they put it in the middle of the wall
please have them come back and put it behind my door
thanks
kay
here's the answer to the tax and accounting questions
come look
we need to finish up with the site specific agreement for the equipment
then they can have the whole enchilada
i would think it could be ready in a week
i'll get a
k to dust it off
kay
hi there
did i ever send this to you
this one is back on the radar screen
thanks
kay
hi pete
i'm attaching parts of an email i received from one of our technical folks regarding the c of austin turbine contract
i have to send it in pieces because it is so large
thanks
kay
here's what eric wrote
i revised the contract you sent me to make it site specific
those changes are redlined
please note that i have reinserted sections 0.0.0 and 0.0.0 as well as the defined terms that go with them
these were related to exhaust temperature and energy
i know this is a simple cycle plant and they typically aren't required
but i wanted to see if ge would guarantee it anyway
it maybe helpful in the future if austin energy goes combined cycle
if for some reason ge's lawyers specifically want to leave that out
then they will probably also want to delete sections 0.0.0 and 0.0.0
and their defined terms
since those also talk about specific exhaust guarantees
let me know what they decide
exhibit a
site basis conditions
which i also revised was not attached to your file
it's right behind the sign-off pages in my hard copy
i therefor hand marked up a copy and scanned it
it is now attached as a separate word file
exhibit f is
boiler plate
and shouldn't change
exhibit
u
is not in my hard copy
my copy only goes up to exhibit
t
if you get something from ge on exhibit
u
send it to me and i will be glad to review it
for your reading pleasure
i would add that i told them that their role would need to be defined by you
the developer
and technical support
i'm faxing a page because the email wouldn't go through
kay
next monday
i'm a little concerned about the neighborhood
no offense
but i thought you could drive by at lunch
they also have a facility at the st
regis school
lastly
if you watch as you drive home
i know you are looking around anyway
you might see a church with a sign up
etc
maybe grace presby might have something
i'm concerned about bringing michael downtown because of my travel schedule
kay
by the way
i was talking to my friend and colleague rose
and she tells me that the company has hired a car to take rose
another person and me home on thursday after the big party
nice touch
huh
we all live close to each other
lee asked that i pass this along
please let me know if you want some tickets
kay
i will have a minute in about an hour
hey there
i'm back in the saddle again
i'll get crackin
kay
i'm not leaving town
yes
i'd be glad to talk to him
i know we want to build generation in new york
the next state to have brown outs
until carlos gets settled in send the guys to me
trust me
it won't take long to get him settled in
kathleen
do we have a land holding company for that region
i want to think about a two-tiered approach due to balance sheet issues created by expensive land
i'll think about it from a turbopark standpoint also
kay
yeah well
next week
it is just too far out of your way
i'll try to see if i can catch a ride somewhere
innovative is a euphemism for something
but i can't figure out the right word
what every means
company most likely to exhaust its lawyers with impossible structures and processes
gentlemen
this was my first written request for a cost plus contract
the request was made to nepco because at that time nepco was supposedly still involved in the project
i left subsequent voice mails for dave and john schwartzenburg
then mailed a follow up email to the gang at noon on thursday
february 0st
copying various folks at eecc
john schwartzenburg was out of town
but went out of his way to accommodate my request so that by thursday evening
i had a form from eecc
i worked over the weekend to adapt the form to this project
and forwarded it to eecc on monday
i received no response to the revised draft
i have recently heard that the eecc form that i spent worked on is being scrapped
and we are starting over
is this true
kay
as a follow up to my previous e-mail
here is the second request
which was in my opinion adequately addressed by john schwartzenburg
i am frustrated with beginning the process over again
kay
where's ben's name
i never talk to him anymore
i haven't talked to him in two weeks
i usually don't go more than a day or two
at the most
good one
nothing worse than an aimless off site
renee
question
are the ge performance guarantees completely voided by the use of inlet chillers
the first sentence in the first bullet point concerns me
i'm not sure how the stuff included in the second series of bullet points fits in
are these changes in scope
suggestions
conditions
i think we would be better off increasing the length of the change order to include the pertinent stuff
but not attaching the letter as a reference
thanks
kay
do you need the electronic file
all i sent was the redline
hi randy
could you fax or email me a copy of the eecc mou with pb or riverbay
or whoever
my fax number is 0 0 0
thanks
kay
per your voice mail
kay
does this mean the lv co gen deal has fallen apart
or are there some new lm's in our future
makes sense to me
dick
thanks for your reply
i have since been assured that we will build on what has happened thus far
which is a huge relief to me
if we see forward progress tomorrow we will be all smiles
again
thanks for your reply
kay
one thing to put on the list
which may be there all ready
is that we want our officers/directors to effectively resign at closing
another detail
and note who is getting this email
i've had three instances recently where agreements have been forwarded to the counterparty prior to legal review
as much as i hate to suggest this
it may be best to have the drafts forwarded to enron legal before the commercial team receives the docs
kay
has herman seen this or the 0st amendment
please let me talk to ben
thanks
kay
just use a regular ca
yes
i changed my mind
describe as a power generation transaction
no equipment reference
thanks
i don't think we need the language
especially since the guarantees won't apply to retrofitting the plant later
ben jacoby is having an offsite friday at the hyatt for the east development group to discuss 0
he has asked me
and i think roger
to sit in
i'm planning on attending
i'm sure either or both of you are welcome
although it won't be a problem if you don't attend
kay
here's a first stab at the loi
i just guessed on the attachment
i have a couple of questions
any thought as to how we get/split money
other than the obvious up side for us
do we want to work toward a
project development agreement
which will set forth the basis for how we develop projects on a project-by-project basis
or do you envision a different next step
talk to you soon
kay
please call lee johnson and tell him that one of our development lawyers
roger balog
would like 0 tickets for friday
i hear ben wants a ticket for thursday
but i assume he communicated that to lee
thank him for me
but i have my closing dinner tomorrow
and no sitter friday
thanks
kay
do you mean literally across the street
yikes
that's making it tough to ignore
steak doesn't really appeal to me
maybe a ciro's salad
lee just called
and he is here
so if you haven't called him yet
please don't
kay
hi there
lee doesn't remember getting a fax from me yesterday
did you get a confirmation back
it was the same fax that was sent to pete thompson
thanks
kay
i'll forward the email and you can print and fax
no big deal
thank you
gregg
i think i'm in good shape and can look at what john sent tonight
ed
just stand by and i'll holler if i need anything
thanks
kay
brian
i didn't get the revised draft
kay
ok
i thought it was a lot to ask
here
tis
hi there
i'm forwarding a draft epc contract for your review
this form of contract assumes that the equipment will be procurred by the owner
with the understanding that we have not resolved the issue of the timing of the procurement of the equipment
and how it will be procurred
this is intended to be a discussion draft
and is subject to further enron review and comment
thanks
kay
karen
it appears to me that revisions were made to this agreement
and the agreement was presented to the counterparty for signature without me being consulted
perhaps you did email this to me and i can't locate the electonic file
in any event
in the future
please call me on the telephone before revisions are made to documents and presented to the counterparty
if you can't reach me by phone
send me an explanatory email
also
please email me redlines against prior drafts
this will faciliate my review
faxing drafts does not work for me
i will send you the required changes tomorrow
thank you
kay
hi
things are going just fine here
i'm looking forward to spring
baseball and gardening
i want more weather like last weekend
i was in nyc last week
i managed to get lost walking around midtown
i know
that's impossible
i was talking on my cell and walking
i walked from bloomingdale's to somewhere east and slightly north of the theater district
oh
i should add i was headed to the omni at 0nd and madison
when i realized i was walking downhill with only warehouses ahead
it clicked that i was off track
my feet hurt so badly when i got back i could hardly stand it
are you going to spring training this year
gotta get back to work
thanks for writing
kay
scooped me on ray
i like him
i heard debbie chance is transferring to another group
and that reagan is going to be an originator
not a developer
here is a draft for your review
and if you think appropriate
distribution to njr
please let me know if you want changes made
kay
same city
different westin
this one is on the riverwalk
the other was near the hyatt
i like san antonio for the trip though
easy
busy as usual
love
kay
i'm getting hourly updates
i haven't talked to john today
carlos tell you about the security guard by hr
opps
i registered twice
i'm just taking up one seat that day
kay
hi
how's it going
any more thoughts on tomorrow night
we could ask your mother to sit for a little while
i think it is pretty neat to get invited to the enron one
the head of the power trading legal group stopped by and said to let her know if i ever want to change groups
i thought that was nice
i'm contemplating doing something special with michael over spring break
i figure you guys have lots of
guy only
stuff coming up
but there aren't a lot of
mom/son
opportunities
be realistic
maybe we should take a disney cruise
since that's something you wouldn't like to do
love
could you check out the sitter thing
we could drop off michael and take the enron field shuttle
i don't need to stay late
i'm sure 0 hours would do it
hi john
the enovate version looks fine
i suggest this change to the peoples version
iv
is required to be disclosed to comply with any applicable law
order,regulation or ruling or to enforce enovate,s or pmw,s rights in court or in an arbitration proceeding in connection with the limited liability companyagreement of envoate dated april 0
0
as amended
modified
and supplemented from time to time
the
llc agreement0
if pec is requested or required
by oral question
interrogatories
requests for information or documents
subpoena
civil investigative demand or similar process
to disclose any confidential information
pec will promptly notify ena of suchrequest or requirement so that ena may seek an appropriate protective orderor waiver in compliance with provisions of this agreement
if pec and enaare both parties to the proceeding
pec will agree to an appropriate protective order
thanks
kay
john
i think i misspoke
or miswrote
the change i suggested would belong in both versions
pardon the delay
but i inadvertently left you off the email
kay
he's going to be at the birthday party or at matt's
maybe we should drop him off
attached is the form of option agreement for the schaeffer option which passes muster
the changes are relatively minor
but have significance from an accounting and legal perspective
kay
looks good to me
hi john
just opened my email
i have a meeting tomorrow off campus
next week looks good
though
any free days
kay
sounds great
here's where i'll be tomorrow
i think it is fine to send it to lee and kent
chris
your invoice for december reflects final revisions to the documents through december 0th
so i'm assuming the draft the schaeffer's signed was done subsequent to anything transmitted on december 0th
however
emailing documents directly to me and calling me on the phone will be a big help
thanks for your response
kay
i appreciate the heads up
i'll try to chase down the fax
it hasn't been delivered yet
can you email me the blacklines just in case
thanks
kay
in your presentation today you mentioned an assessment agreement and an interconnection agreement
roger says he isn't working on it
who in legal is handling those docs
thanks
kay
how many times do i have to say email it
fyi
gentlemen
attached for your review is a draft of the letter of intent
please let me know if you have any difficulty opening this document
kay
i'm leaving now
fred
when you need something for a project
please come to me first
or whoever might be the appropriate ena lawyer
going directly to the outside lawyer creates problems
for instance
it is enron policy that we do not pay outside counsel for work not referred to them by an ena lawyer
thanks
kay
i have your rodeo tickets
the total is $0
kay
my only advice is to be very specific in their scope
these guys run up bills worse than anyone
fyi
another instance of work being sent directly to outside counsel
in this case it was an additional assignment related to an ongoing project
kay
previous correspondence on the topic of assignment to outside counsel
see 0/0 email from me below
hi there
any comment
thanks
kay
lee
i've forwarded your email to eric
and have asked for his response
the changes were his
thanks
kay ps thanks for the invite friday
we had a great time
hi mark
here's the latest
incorporating the
arrange for
approach on the epc and kay
good morning
just checking in
michael and i had a good morning
no weird outfits today
figures
since i now have a camera ready to go
so what do you think about the stone thing
i like the way bob's front yard looks
i'm not sore today
but then again
i didn't do all that much
our yard is looking better
though
hope you are having a good day
love
fyi
we have staff meetings on the first and third wednesdays
at 0
the meetings usually last an hour or less
did anything get set up
i'm booked at 0
but otherwise available
kay
please draft a letter to the guy listed in the first email below
hartzell at itm
using the stuff in chris
email as the body of the letter
save under general loi
and i'll finish the letter
thanks
kay
hi
this is one of my top priorities
i think it looks fine
what do you think
kay
fyi
i have jury duty on wednesday
feb 0
kay
hopefully you will get some credit for it
also
i just love lisa
i think she's a ton of fun
looks like it is ok to keep the same
how's the ge master form agreement coming along
when do you think we will have a draft
thanks
kay
fyi
note that pseg wants to sign a binding loi
carlos and i will discuss how to move forward
thanks
kay
fred
sounds
do able
please contemplate what would be acceptable as
outs
for them and for us
a,lso
will you be getting rac involved soon since we are contemplating a binding agreement in the near future
my best guess is that the loi will be prepared in house
but i will discuss this with carlos
and we will advise k
s of their role
thanks
kay
i sent him an email earlier
and he left me a voice mail back
i'll call him and see what i can find out
hi pete
we want the ge form to be on an individual turbine basis
as for work priorities
i would put it in front of the city of austin agreement
thanks
kay
sheila
i have jury duty on wednesday
how depressing
i really was liking the idea of a durango
i do think lisa and bobby have been pleased with theirs
but maybe they've just been lucky
mitsubishi isn't attractive to me
but i don't know why
i really can't think of much unless i go back to the idea of the small lexus
the big one is just too expensive
i don't want a ford
that knocks out a lot
you don't like the 0 runner
and the land cruiser is too expensive also
i don't remember being particularly impressed with either the yukon or the what else is there
please print
thanks
kay
i'm having a set printed
kay
maybe we should have the ge call on thursday
or maybe friday am
poor baby
at least it is only twice a year
or in her case
this one last time
i think i may take him fishing with my dad and mom in palacios
he really loves it
and my dad is in declining health
but can still get around
i hate to waste the opportunitty to let them spend time together
i ate at the met
so i had a big lunch
fridge foraging is fine
i would get the stone delivered as early as possible
so that i can pace myself
bob said he ordered 0 pounds
if i am remembering correctly
guess i should go look
my dad has the same thing as sheila's mom
athlersclerosis
he gets tired easily
and doesn't walk very well
but at least he can still walk
he's only 0
but this stuff is progressive
a long future is unlikely
michael adores his poppop
and march is a nice time of year on the cost
if i'm there i can do a lot of the hard stuff for my dad
which helps
what kind of vehicle to you have
i've decided that i need an suv
did you know that one out of every 0 cars and trucks sold in the u.s
is a lexus or a toyota
with the new highlander
toyota will easily cement itself as one of the best-selling brands in north america
how can we be so sure
because the highlander represents an optimum blend of three utilitarian types of vehicles
the station wagon
the minivan and the sport-utility vehicle
based on the same platform as the lexus rx 0
which itself is based on modified toyota camry mechanicals
highlander is longer
taller and wider where the wheels meet the pavement than the lexus
despite its greater size
the highlander is lighter than the rx 0
so acceleration should equal or better its upscale cousin
braking will likely prove impressive
too
highlander comes standard with four-wheel disc brakes equipped with electronic brake force distribution
ebd
and brake assist
which maximizes braking power during a panic stop
highlander is rated to tow 0,0 pounds
when properly equipped
helping to meet that specification is the same 0.0-liter v0 that resides under the hood of the rx
making 0 horsepower at 0,0 rpm and 0 ft-lbs
of torque at 0,0 rpm
the v0 features variable valve timing with intelligence
vvt-i
the standard engine
also using vvt-i to maximize power and efficiency
is a 0.0-liter inline four making 0 ponies and 0 ft-lbs
of twist
the four-speed automatic transmission provides a
snow mode
for easy starts on slippery surfaces
with 0.0 inches of ground clearance
0.0 on front-wheel drivers
and a fully independent suspension front and rear
highlander isn't designed to tackle tough terrain
but it'll work great during heavy snowfalls
toyota's vehicle skid control
vsc
system
which includes traction control
is optional
and is designed to recognize when the highlander isn't responding to the driver's steering inputs
vsc will then apply selective braking to bring the truck
car
back under control
in the event it fails
not likely
but possible
highlander protects occupants with whiplash injury lessening
wil
front seats
five three-point seatbelts equipped with automatic and emergency locking retractors
alr/elr
front seatbelts with pre-tensioners and force limiters and iso-fix child seat anchors
daytime running lights and side airbags are optional
inside
highlander delivers 0.0 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear 0/0 split folding seat in use
and a whopping 0.0 cubes when it's folded
air conditioning
cd/cassette combo stereo with six speakers
cruise control
tilt steering wheel
bottle holders
and grocery bag hooks are standard
opting for limited trim gives you jbl sound
automatic climate control
remote keyless entry
woodgrain interior trim
alloy wheels with full-size spare
fog lights
privacy glass and other upgraded features
leather upholstery is available on v0 models
toyota is planning to sell 0,0 highlanders in calendar year 0
we'll bet demand outstrips supply
thank you
i really liked don
edmunds
review nissan's hardy pathfinder has always been our vehicle of choice for seeking a new path to the premium outlet center
though the exterior may exude that tough-guy outdoorsy image
the interior has always been comfortable enough for the dilettante woodsman who doesn't like to get his nails too dirty
though the old 0.0-liter v0 engine provided acceptable levels of low-end grunt
the coarsely produced 0 horsepower it made was meager when stacked against newer competitors
so revel
all you who seek liberation from urban ennui
the pathfinder is finally energized by a stouter v0
based on the maxima sedan's stellar powerplant
when mated to a five-speed manual transmission
the 0.0-liter
dohc v0 engine produces a mighty 0 horsepower and 0 foot-pounds of torque
matching it to an automatic tranny will usurp 0 ponies but add 0 foot-pounds of twist
still ample power to haul plenty of equipment and go mountain climbing
as well as merge onto freeways without fear
the pathfinder comes with rear-wheel or part-time four-wheel drive
the latter of which provides a shift-on-the-fly transfer case that can be engaged at speeds up to 0 mph
on le models
an automatic all-mode four-wheel-drive system can be specified for 0
giving you one more reason to skip paying the extra tariff the infiniti qx0 commands
all-mode operates in 0wd
automatic 0wd
0wd-hi and 0wd-lo
all selected using a simple rotary knob on the dashboard
we've long admired the pathfinder for its excellent ride and handling
further enhanced by solid unibody construction
the interior
one of the friendliest of any suv on the market
is spruced up for 0 with an updated instrument panel
a new dual level center console with a padded armrest and 0-volt power source will organize all your gewgaws
you can choose from three trim levels
the xe
which for the 0 model year comes with standard power windows
mirrors and locks
and a security system
the sporty se
which gives you a choice of automatic or manual transmission along with sporty trim
and the top-of-the-line le
which includes fog lights
bose audio system
and fake wood accents
all models come standard with 0-inch wheels
full-size spare tire
a cd player and abs
side airbags can be ordered as long as they are contained in leather-wrapped seating
which is available only on se and le
those same models
when power is transferred to the drive wheels via an automatic transmission
can be equipped with a mobile entertainment system
which includes a 0.0-inch flip-down lcd screen
video player
and ports to plug and play a playstation 0
and we all know how important that will be after christmas
don't we
a
birdview
navigation system
shared with the infiniti qx0
is also available
but we don't recommend it
while the
birdview
perspective is interesting
teensy
tiny
little
itty-bitty buttons control the thing
along with some of the climate control functions
get a map
items that remain static from last year include a substantial maximum cargo carrying capacity of 0 cubic feet
surprising for what appears to be a relatively small vehicle
some of this space
in our humble opinion
should have been used to alleviate the still-cramped rear accommodations
despite a few quibbles
we're thrilled that nissan finally rectified the pathfinder's main problem
horsepower
with this updated
competitive package
we're betting fat rebates and dealer incentives have gone the way of the dodo
here are the aes documents
did i miss anything
this might be really helpful
i had a nice trip in
i tried a slightly different route
and it was uneventful
kinda slick
though
how much does it cost to mail a letter now
is is $.0
of course i have a bunch of 0 cent stamps
i have no clue how much rock that would be
i should measure the length of the beds
then i could compute how much to get
at least sort of
there's some grass to be dug up also
i think i will start with the advil today
i've been researching the pathfinder today
nissan has a pretty good website
i like the little videoscreen
how's that for a toy
i'll go back and look at the toyota
please call john keffer and re-schedule thursday's lunch
two meeting have come up
friday is good for me
the posted number was a mistake
i'm going
hi randy
here's what you missed
my personal preference is to not spend the money to check out the licensing issues at this point since i don't have the outside counsel doing anything now
when john called me last week and asked the question i gave him that opinion
and i had assumed that it had been communicated to you
sorry about that
kay
john and randy
i got a call from bob sevitz regarding a change i made to the eecc revisions to the co op city epc contract
specifically
i deleted language he had added to the waiver of consequential damages
bob had added a provision that said that the waiver was
subject to
the indemnification section of the contract
i felt this was too broad of a carve out
especially from the contractor's point of view
any tweaking of the indemnity language
to blatantly reconcile it with the waiver
can occur during the drafting process
just wanted to pass this along
kay
hi
lisa
mellencamp
and chuck are getting married
date unknown
he has given up his apartment and has moved in
that makes 0 teenage girls under one roof
although 0 of them are there every other weekend
i really like both of them
so i think this is nifty
kay
i want to go to this on thursday
i rsvp'd myself
hi charlotte
what's your preference today
i can either meet you at our house
or pick up michael at your place
kay
this looks good to me
we'll track down janet if that is ok with you
kay
yes
at least now i don't also have lunch with john
as far as i know it is fine
do you want to include mike sandridge also
kathleen
i'm happy to volunteer my assistant
suzanne
to help with the logistics
restaurant suggestions
keeping track of rsvp's
kay
i'm all for that
i may take him out very early to look at the tractors
oh
yeah
that's right
hi sharon
michael will pass on next week's appointment
he and i have the day off together
so i'm making some special rodeo plans
his winter report from his teachers was good
he is meeting or exceeding expectations in all categories
we recently visited at school and watched him for about an hour
and he was attending very well
sitting still
well
relative to the other kids
following instructions
raising his hand to be called upon
etc
you should have heard him speak spanish
it was so cute
we visited in the am
and i haven't seen him in the afternoon without meds
the class schedule hasn't required an afternoon dose as of yet
hope all is well with you
kay
hi tana
a little birdie tells me that you have a supply of the energy
power risk management glossary booklets
am i getting close
i've found it to be very helpful
and i think it would help one of our new lawyers
carlos sole
could i get a copy for him
any other good power references
thanks
kay
good afternoon
i'm forwarding a revised development agreement term sheet
showing revisions from your original version
we look forward to seeing you soon
thanks
kay
i don't know the dynamic between the intergen team and team coral
assuming there's no bad blood
i don't suppose it would hurt
i just don't know enough about the situation
i have jury duty today
by the way
kay
thanks for agreeing to help
please call ben jacoby to get things going
kay
you might find stephanie and ask for a copy
this is a very nifty reference tool
hi mark
i don't know what these folks are up to
in fact
i didn't know that scott laidlaw was involved
when i spoke with eecc i told them that they needed to get direction from you
someone from mike coleman's group
or an ena developer
any word from the co op/pb team
i have jury duty in just a little while
so i'll be out of touch for a short while
kay
please calendar
i don't know if i'm going to be out of town
anything for the grocery list
my sweetie pie
hi steve
here's what njr received
kay
i thought you might enjoy this
you should have seen michael's eyes while he was riding in that mercedes convertible yesterday
he was speechless
and you know how rare that is
i suspect we will be hearing about it now
kay
we had a good time
i always enjoy ozzie and heather
carlos joined us
too
ozzie has a new mercedes convertible
and he drove me to michael's babysitter to pick him up
michael's eyes were the size of saucers
must be for real
let's discuss
rusty
i will get with kathleen and we will prepare on a form
however
you will need to provide one of us with the details on a case-by-case basis
so that we
kathleen
can generate the ca's and track them in the legal department database
if we have the following information
a ca can typically be generated on a same day basis
name
address of counterparty
including name of contact person type of deal contemplated what type of information is being provided whether both parties are providing information whether exclusivity/non-circumvention provisions are desired thanks
kay
thank you
i appreciate it
sounds like a good approach to me
0
remedies
jurisdiction
arbitration and governing law

i set up a directory called
confidentiality agreements
and put a form in there based on what kc sent me
i'm so proud of myself
yes
choice of law doesn't impact place of arbitration
we just need a starting position
hi pete
here's some language to be included in the form contract
thanks
kay
more for the contract
hi there
on the options we should delete the reference to the federal arbitration act
so that the sentence with that reference ends with
binding arbitration
i changed it on the confidentiality agreement
but missed it here
carlos caught it
kay
one of us can
carlos tells me that he has had difficulty forwarding emails
so i'm sending this along
kay
hi john
i haven't been able to find you number
i wanted to discuss the confidentiality agreements
and whether you envision that other confidentiality agreements may be necessary or required
thanks
kay
hi gregg
i've sent john an email
didn't have his number
if you have it i will follow up with a phone call
i was out yesterday
jury duty called
and janet was out-of-pocket this afternoon
i'll try to track her down tomorrow
i will forward the finance agreement to a finance lawyer and tax
and will send you a copy so you'll know who is in the loop
kay
as you know
enron and peoples jointly own enovate
our group in chicago is looking to manage some funds which belong to enovate
we had initially envisioned having a cash management policy which would outline how enron would invest the funds
etc
the other owner of enovate
peoples
has proposed that we use the attached document in connection with this arrrangement
this is taking me a little far afield of my area of expertise
so i'm writing you guys for input
direction
etc
suggestions
gregg do you want to correct any of what i wrote
kay
gentlemen
i think we also need to be certain that we have a decent amount of discretion in whether we close
otherwise we have to consider the dash process at this time
kay
hot off the presses
i'm looking at it now
hi
my meetings in florida are scheduled for feb 0
march 0 and march 0
i do not know when i will be leaving
but if there is a way to leave on the morning of the 0th
i will do so
more details to follow
kay
steve
my best days are
kay
i worked out for the first time in a bizillion years
oh my gosh
at least i know how to work out
and i know not to take it to the limit the first time out
but it is still hard to move
i didn't exercise my legs or my back much
figuring that's what i'll need most this weekend for yard work
i think i saw our neighbor kim playing basketball
i took an abs class
since i need to get my abs
and back
in shape to protect myself from injury
i could really mess myself up after such a long hiatus
the met was plenty convenient
they have a spa there now
with all the spa stuff
no can do
thanks anyway
so when are you leaving today
talk to you when you get back
pete
these comments are from our finance group
these are fyi at this time
further discussions to follow
kay
hi
i was off work yesterday
so i just got your email
you gotta love president's day
we went to the rodeo last night
and i'm really tired today
i'm too old to go out on a school night
mom said that the dr wants to do a sonogram on dad's neck to check out the blockage
when i talked to her they didn't know when it would be scheduled
evidently there is some unclogging procedure they can do
sounds dangerous to me
but i don't really know anything about it
too bad about katie's asthma
i was worried that paige has it
but she went through a bunch of tests and they said she doesn't have it
just really bad allergies that make her wheeze
i'm not sure of the difference
but i believe this dr
michael still isn't interested in playing team sports
we asked this spring and he said not yet
i don't know why he doesn't want to play
but i don't want to push him either
maybe i should take him to watch some little kids play
maybe we can come watch annie play
neil's rodeo stuff will be over next week
everything else is business as usual around here
say
hey
to everyone
love
kay
i think it can be accomplished so long as we have no obligation to agree to any particular terms in the definitive docs
i don't see why we would need to dash exclusivity
see you soon
kay
barbara
here's the latest word i have on the meeting
which sets it for tomorrow
is there something later which sets it for today
thanks
kay
hi shirley
is this meeting still set for tomorrow
i heard a rumor that it had been changed again
but i don't know if it is correct
kay
no problem
i appreciate the help in trying to keep track of it
kay
bronco is on the sofa upstairs
just a reminder
i think tuesday
0/0
looks good
hey there
i'm going to try very hard to make it to dick's farewell party
who did the invitations
it is so clever
kay
this has sound
hmmm
very interesting
i doubt aig thinks of itself as being in the middle
pop quiz to follow
hi there
could you send me three brochures
i'm working on getting a couple of friends together for a 0-0 night retreat to las
please send the info to kay mann
0 inverness park way
houston
texas
0
thanks
kay
hey
at least you can sew
speaking of tennis
michael asked neil if he can teach him how to play
neil said no
since he doesn't know how
i told him i can play
and now michael thinks i should play with him
then he will teach neil
very elaborate plan
remember how we used to hit tennis balls against the house
can you believe we never broke a window
we have a detached garage
but the door is metal
i can't imagine how loud that would be
i remember trying to encourage paige to swim
bike
whatever
pushing never helped
she can swim and ride
so i guess it worked out ok
she never showed any interest in playing on a sports team
even though she used to go to my softball games
whatever
time to go home
love
kay
congratulations on your promotions
which demonstrate that ethical standards
coupled with stubborness
deserve to be rewarded
kay
hi pete
here are some comments from ge re confidentiality
please hang on to the comments pending further direction
if you are available today for the conference call
it might be helpful for you to listen in for a while
if you have a conflict
don't worry about it
thanks
kay
i haven't worked with any workout folks
do you know lisa mellencamp
in ena legal
she isn't in that area any more
but she used to be
she might know the players
kay
as i mentioned to scott
we are engaged in active discussions with pb
on behalf of co op city
concerning whether enron will have any role in the epc activities
in light of those discussions
i suggest that the meeting scheduled for today be postponed until after mark and i speak with pb tomorrow afternoon
i discussed this with mark
and he is fine with postponing the meeting
thanks
kay shelby malkemes
hi there
i'm thinking of working out after work
hopefully kind of early
ok with you
i should still be home before 0
michael took bronco to school
i'm sure he will have him at the cc
kay
well
i told michael that bronco could ride in the wagon
so i guess he needs a wagon big enough for bronco
i have a new pager
and although i'm not positive i will keep it long term
here's the info
to call by phone and enter a page
0 0 0 to send an email message
0@pagenetmessage.net i'm still trying to figure it out
i now have a pager
my number is 0 0 0
you can also send me an email at 0@pagenetmessage.net
kay
alas i've been caught
i am working on a crra deal re fuel cells
you may have seen this
very interesting
mercury's mountaineer debuted several years ago as an upscale version of the best-selling ford explorer sport-utility vehicle
the problem was
ford's explorer could be just as luxurious as the mountaineer and
in some cases
was even more expensive
for 0
mercury has attempted to further distinguish their sport-ute from the popular explorer
the result is a fine suv
with improved handling characteristics and generous feature content
this near-luxury sport-ute comes with either a 0.0-liter v0 making 0 horsepower or a 0.0-liter v0 pumping out 0 ponies
both engines come mated to a five-speed automatic transmission
the new v0 offers copious and refined power delivery
but unimpressive mileage numbers
mountaineer has been redesigned inside and out
and the results are pleasing
now easily distinguishable from the explorer from the a-pillars forward
its
new edge
theme makes use of a satin-finish grille and bold headlamps
meanwhile
the interior gets satin-aluminum trim accents
lending a distinctive
high-tech flavor to this former explorer clone
improvements to the mountaineer are much more than cosmetic
however
an all-new independent rear suspension featuring a unique porthole-in-frame design debuts this year
this setup allows the rear floor to drop 0 inches
thereby making room for a third-row seat
while increasing ground clearance to 0.0 inches
at the same time
ride and handling have been dramatically improved
the mountaineer now feels more stable on the road and exhibits flatter cornering characteristics
a 0.0-inch wider stance improves handling even more
while increasing interior room
noise
vibration and harshness
nvh
have also been improved in the 0 mountaineer
a 0-percent reduction of air leakage into the truck's cabin and a refined automatic transmission make for a more serene driving environment
although some vibration from the available all-wheel-drive system does intrude through the floor
new convenience features in the mountaineer include a standard six-way power adjustable driver's seat
along with optional adjustable pedals
heated front seats and heated exterior mirrors
among the mountaineer's new safety features are optional side curtain airbags
a stiffer body shell and a lower front bumper for improved crash compatibility with other vehicles
later in the model year
rollover protection sensors
and a new advancetrac traction/stability control system will also be available
the mountaineer's strengths lie in its feature content
powerful engine choices and improved rear suspension
there are plenty of suvs on the market
but if you want an explorer
yet can't stomach the thought of owning the golden retriever of sport-utility vehicles
the mountaineer just might float your boat
hi there
does anyone have a finance/accounting blessed professional services agreement
thanks
kay
i'm worrying again about summer
maybe we should check out the y on voss to see what they have
if anything
what do you think
i know i will be hearing from gregg about this soon
any progress
thanks
kay
here's the ca you requested
kay
mr
sorte
michael brown and janelle schueur have requested that i forward this confidentiality agreement to your attention
regards
kay mann
my opinion is that there is that the letter agreement is not ready to be sent out
and won't be for a day or two
it can't be sent out until the ca is returned to you signed
hi carolyn
is this the most current version
thanks
kay
the form we have has this as the first paragraph
which is different from the form attached
could you conform the nw one to the form
enron north america corp
ena0 or the
protected party
is prepared to furnish
__________________
*0 or the
receiving party
with certain information which is either confidential
proprietary or otherwise not generally available to the public in connection with
i
the potential salof one or more of the protected party's power plant development projects and/or one of more of the special purpose companies which own such projectsin
states
collectively
the
projects0
for purposes of evaluating one or more transactions between protected party and * involving the projects
collectively
the
proposed transaction0
no biggie
and understandable
when we sell the equipment we structure itlike we did on the ca deal
we sell the special purpose companies that wilown the equipment at the time of sale
sorry
i lost track of the versions
here are my two questions/comments
what are we gaining or losing by putting a drop dead date of march 0
on 0.0
i think relinquishing them from
damage
is broader than it needs to be
since the contract language is
risk of loss
however
if the deal is that they are off the hook for cosmetic deterioration during storage
i think that can be addressed specifically in the change order
kay
well
maybe it makes more sense to write it like this
see below
hi karen
sorry i haven't sent the notice
brain cramp or something
when are you here next week
kay
in fact those are the only two days i'm around
hope to see you
i'm in
hi steve
i wanted to send this to you before i send it out to others
since i feel like there were changes we had discussed that somehow didn't make in the last draft
guess you can say this is a sanity check
if it looks good to you
then i will send it out
unless you prefer to make distribution
kay
bob
my husband and i will continue to keep michael in our prayers
by the way
i really appreciate your updates
i'm eligible to give blood again
so let me know when michael needs more donations
kay
good afternoon
i'm attaching for your review a revised loi
thanks
kay
hi rusty
since carlos is working on the pontiac and plano sale
i'm going to forward this to him for his handling
that way things will stay better organized
thanks
kay
is the promissory note structure still necessary
given the increase in thehsr threshhold
my memory has failed me once again
fyi
we are staying at the marriott sawgrass
or something like that
i will be in jacksonville florida this week negotiating a transaction with new jersey natural gas
it is a project development deal utilizing fuel cells
the commercial lead is jeff ader
i will leave tomorrow afternoon
returning on friday afternoon
kay
the dynasty begins
i have a psa which needs to be made 0-0/turbopark compliant
could you work on it
i'll bring it around
thanks
kay
hi carlos
here's the psa i mentioned
kay
hotel info included at the bottom
i think the pager is just too cool
i don't think mark has talked to jeff or barbara about the move
kinda awkward
no idea
whenever he gets around to it
i guess
sheila
if you are working on this i think it makes more sense for you to have ed handle the ca
i don't want to get in the middle
thanks
kay
fred
dale rasmussen has been handling the breakout contracts for the lv cogen project
and i think the form is in good shape
however
the breakout contract is for all the lv co gen units
but that is easy enough to fix
does ge know this is coming
what are you projecting for a closing date
we need the unit numbers
original and serial
associated delivery dates
price attributable to the units
maximum liability amount
price to sell the llc member interests
and the contact persons from panda for the contract
will there be a development fee
and if so
how much
if you get me the particulars of the deal we can work on it in house
we have the forms
so we can get cracking without outside counsel
in fact
i've been working on the form letter agreement today in connection with the other deal
retaining outside counsel requires internal approval
which i'm sure we can get in the next day or two
assuming no conflict of interest
i can get started on the process if you are ready
if you think these guys are serious
we can set up the llc's
we may want two llc's if the total price is in excess of $0mm
kathleen
please talk to me before we do this as i think we should discuss the slate of officers
kay
i'll get kathleen to do it
as she has my current favorite form
thanks anyway
kay
please get with fred to get something working
thanks
hi pete
can you send me the most recent version of the lv co gen facility agreement
also
in a separate email could you send me the c of a
i want to make sure i have the latest
greatest of each
thanks
kay
fred
do you have the names/addresses of the interested counterparties
it saves time to do all at once
thanks
kay
hi
has reggie made any progress on the short file cabinets
thanks
kay
sounds good
hi chauncey
are either of the restaurants very formal
i want to make sure i bring the right clothes
thanks
kay
here's a new deal for you
i've got two follow on deals for k
s
so this one might be a good one to use someone else
if you need and want to
i hear the rustling of the pines
clear outside counsel selections with jeff
then mark
etc
kay
hi there
did you come up with a
form
llc agreement in conjunction with the form letter agreement
or is the coral llc agreement the latest thing
thanks
kay
here are my car questions
how much would a tricked out sequoia cost if ordered from the manufacturer
is there a 0 escalade available with the cargo doors
i think i probably want to drive each one more time
off to a meeting
feast or famine
if you are available i think it would be a good idea
no big deal if you can't
well
i just don't know what to tell you
if nothing else i think the ball was punted to the east
kay
maybe this is more like rugby
i passing the ball to carlos
who will get with you and kathleen to figure out what's what
i set it as my new wallpaper
the file was too big
su wouldn't let it come in
southwestern university
i've just learned that this is a
west
deal for the sale of the lv co gen units
this deal was described as being the same as the intergen deal
king
spalding helped me on that one
and when i thought this was an east deal i contacted keffer for a conflicts check
there is none
i haven't gone to mark with it yet
though
we have forms
etc for this
and i'm happy to provide whatever support i can
please advise as to how you would like to proceed
kay
more information
thank you
this is very helpful
please print and fax the redlined version to me at the hotel
thanks
kay ps i'm in room 0
here's another document i need to have faxed to me
thanks
kay
hi
please let me know how you would like to proceed
kay
charlotte
great story
neil is at the astrodome now
you might be able to reach him on his cell or by pager
if i hear from him i will have him give you a call
i'm in florida
and looking out my window i saw an alligator swim by
wouldn't michael go crazy
bye
kay
i haven't heard back from dale
sheila and i have swapped voice mails
kay
westinghouse has agreed that ljm doesn't need to sign it
i sent sw a letter confirming that agreement
lynn tells me that they should sign it soon
otherwise
the agreement is fully executed
lynn dekrey is the guy mitch negotiated the deal with
lynn left me a message on monday and said he didn't see a problem
but he didn't give me a day we could expect the letter
i would expect it this week
gentlemen
does the mississippi constitution impact the issue
the munies are specifically citing section 0 of the mississippi constitution
and have faxed me an opinion of the mississippi ag interpreting this section
if you will email me your fax number i will fax it to you
kay
here's the revised form for the blue dog equipment
kay
hi carolyn
could you check this and see if i did anything stupid with the revisions
thanks
kay
sorry for the delay
i ran into some complications
i left it
in blank
so we can fill in the commercial specifics depending on the purchaser
etc
kay
i did write it for them
and sent it to lynn
we are waiting for them to sign it and send it back
kay enron north america corp
here is the form of llc agreement we used for the intergen deal
tweaked a bit for lessons learned
i will forward the updated letter agreement which has been improved also
it relates to the blue dog turbines
so some of the defined terms are different
i will also forward the intergen docs so you can see some of the definitions
etc
one thing which wasn't addressed in the intergen deal was the potential hsr issue
there wasn't one
which arises when the put or call option is exercised
i also have the turbopark docs
which i can forward when it gets closer
i don't know if i have the electronic versions of the other closing docs
kay
see my previous email
i don't know if this was the final one
we had to amend the agreements to give us more time
the new version i sent you fixed that
as i mentioned
i think the
new and improved
versions are better starting points
but here's what we used
i don't recall whether the concept of a development fee has been vetted with the accountants
as it wasn't applicable to the intergen deal
kay
i've sent sheila and dale electronic copies of the documents
hi there
please look this over
spell check
print and fax two copies to me
as we will be signing this doc this afternoon
ciao
kay
anyone know any good lawyers in mississippi
or any lawyers knowledgeable about mississippi law
power background would be nice
but i know that may be too much to ask
thanks
kay
stuart
if you need a copy of the executed westinghouse letter
you can find the original on my desk
i believe on the left hand corner
looking out
the letter we are waiting for is merely an acknowledgement that ljm doesn't need to sign
i think getting the letter is probably belts and suspenders
but i requested it anyway
kay
yes
just let me know when you get bored
thank you for your helpful comments
good points
on the timing issue
we still have the time sensitivity
but i hate to give it a precise day
maybe the way to address that is within 0 bd's
as mutually agreed
i don't have the doc in front of me
i'm in florida
but i thought it said ena was taking responsibility for increases in the purchase amount as it exists the date of closing
i'll check
i agree with deleting co definition
it doesn't add anything
again
thanks
kay
greg
i've read the opinion and agree with your summary of it
however
it doesn't answer the question for me as to whether a mississippi court would uphold such a clause
or how other contracting parties have dealt with the issue
due to the importance of the issue i will consult with a mississippi firm to get a handle on the question
thanks for your help
kay
i'm so ready
travel plans for monday
hi leatha
neil and i went to d taylor and looked at an escalade
we liked it
however
we want to price it with a couple of extra features
i like the extra wood package
and neil likes it with the gold trim package
when we asked for a price
it added around $0
which i thought was ridiculous
they offered to discount it by $0
which i again thought was ridiculous
when we priced these options at mcginniss
the price was less
$0 for the wood package instead of $0
for instance
and they offered to discount the options by a third
so
we can get the deal done if they will get reasonable over these options
the sales guy
nathaniel
was going to
work on it
the fellow you had told us to ask for wasn't in
by the way
i will be out of town on monday
but neil will be in
and will have my lexus
thanks
kay
rosco was in for his shots today
on feb 0 he weighed 0.0 lbs
he now weighs 0 lbs
his paws look too big and his head is too small
what an adventure
please find his contact information for me
thanks
kay
ben
what are these folks supposed to do for enron
i had heard a rumor that we were looking to hire someone to lobby for us on a success fee basis
is this the same deal
i know on the international side there were hoops to jump through before such an engagement could be signed off on
i'll have to check to see what the drill is on this side of the street
kay
latest on my system
but i'll check
hi cindy
would it be possible to block some rooms for a couple of weeks while people make their reservations
i'm thinking maybe ten rooms for may 0
0
and 0
out on the 0th
i would like it best if the individuals could call you directly to make the reservation
how does that work for you
thanks
kay
this is the one i get to go to
right
i'll check
thanks for the help
kay
fyi
comment
have you checked this out
i have a staff meeting and will be unable to join
i do plan to be on friday's call
kay
i had to cancel due to my travel schedule
i have a staff meeting every first and third wednesday
which i've told sheila about
on those weeks i'll miss the call
ta ta
kay
many thanks
that is very cool
rosco has gone from 0 pounds to 0 pounds in one month
that's a half a pound a day
great trip back
i spent yesterday in clarksdale mississippi
don't make a point of spending your vacation there
can you email me glenn's info so i can send him the hard copy
i enjoyed our time together
and look forward to more adventures
kay
hi marchris
i'm in ena legal
and i'm looking for the right person to discuss this with
christi nicholay suggested i get you involved
please give me a call at 0 0 0 to discuss
thanks
kay
they haven't signed the other ones
we moved the equipment straight out of turbopark and into the llc
then on the same day sold down the equity of the please call to discuss at your convenience
thanks
kay
here are my responses
0
development fee is a commercial question
this will need to be vetted with herman if we go with it
personally
i'd skip it and push to sign next week
0
i have a call in to dale
0
no llc
kathleen will handle
the closer the creation is to the signing of the letter
the better
taking into account the time required to get the docs back and set up
someone needs to name it
we should also look at a minimal list of officers
0
i don't have the attachment in front of me
so i will have to look it up
i'll get back to you
the concept is that ena is only responsible for changes in the amounts owed to ge as of the closing date
i thought the language was awkward
and tried to make it more clear
but obviously failed
as soon as i get the break out contract from dale we can check on the definitional questions
it should be the same as in the ca breakout contract with ge
but i won't make that assumption
drop dead date on put/call dec
0
this needs to be discussed with ben
0
this should be set up as a new matter
since these aren't the blue dog turbines
you can send the bill to sheila with a copy to me
i'll open the doc and take a look at it asap
kay
re
enovate/peoples
i heard a rumor that you have turbopark closing docs
could i get a copy
thanks
kay
0 jeep cherokee laredo
good condition
0wd
a/c
automatic windows and locks
cruise control
0,0+miles
will take $0
please call jonathan at 0-0-0
this is who sheila suggested
the deal i'm working on is an asset management/control area services transaction
it will be an odd one
so i'm not expecting someone to have specific expertise
i need help on the general contracting under miss law stuff
especially since there are some quirks involved
your input would be appreciated
thanks
kay
you know so much
i guess someone thought of this again
i'll wait to see what ben says
this is when i'm out of town
which is fine by me
kay
obviously this is going complicate
and increase the cost
of the transaction
is there any way to push back on this
we will now need four break out contracts
four sets of every other document
0 sets of assigning docs out of turbopark
etc
not hard to do
but a challenge to do on your time frame
kay
chris
please come see carlos and i about the transaction
kay
hi pete
would it be possible for you to be in houston this friday morning for the ge meeting
it would be great to meet you in person
and have you participate
what is your availability
kay
a treat for you
an exhibit
loan amount term
maximum
fixed rate
apr
to 0% of purchase price 0 months 0 months 0 months new auto only 0 months to 0% of purchase price 0 months 0 months 0 months new auto only 0 months
i have a couple of questions
do your numbers assume $0 down
in addition to the tax etc
and is the term 0 months or 0
both time frames are mentioned in your explanation
have we heard anything on the remarketing of my lexus
does the cost include the tax trade on the lexus
thanks for your help
kay
carolyn
i believe the commercial operations terminology is appropriate
not takeover
please verify with the lv cogen documents which i forwarded just a few moments ago
the changes i made to the definitions in the prototype letter were a result of the fact that the blue dog contract with ge uses slightly different terminology than the lm 0 contracts
we need to revert to the appropriate underlying contract
thanks
kay
it is an hour and a half west of memphis
no where
you can smell the meat processing plant
hey
you would probably like that
0 central
so you should be in decent shape
kay
jeff
are you up-to-speed on this one
kay
this was supposed to be to jeff and barbara
but the phone rang
i can't recall who knows what
kay
i hadn't heard the 0 0/0 hour deal
but then again
i wasn't on the call
i'll check on pushing the meeting back to 0 to give you a chance to get downtown before it starts

what do you think
kay
please call jake thomas and steve thome in portland and see if we can have a conference call at 0 houston time
thanks
kay
hi carolyn
in addition to my comments regarding the definitions
here are some other thoughts
letter agreement
i would bracket
spawn
since we don't have it formed yet and we probably haven't checked on availability
0
closing date should be at least five but no more than 0 business days
0
a
facility agreement is probably the more appropriate concept than turbine contract
not a big issue if anyone disagrees with this terminology
0
make the guaranty for this agreement and the llc agreement
0
b
does this make sense
should we also have the right to specific performance
0
iii
consents won't necessarily be obtained at the time of the signing of the letter agreement
should say by closing such will have been obtained
i haven't done a reg evaluation
so i would delete the reg rep unless you are comfortable
i want the hsr risk to be with them
so i don't want to contradict it with the rep
i'll review the llc agreement next
kay
good
i hadn't heard back from them
hi sheila
i don't recall seeing a bill from bracewell on the vecpco deal
did you ever see one come in
thanks
kay
in case i forget to mention it
when the next round of panda docs are ready
you might want to send them to herman and matt
thanks
kay
cindy
how long would we have until we need to release the rooms to avoid the charge
i think your suggestion will work
kay
we will be in bay city on saturday
but i don't know if it will be overnight
mom
ben and i can make it
kay
i'll be available
and will let you know how it goes
kay
before you send out the next draft we need to talk briefly
please put on my schedule
dale
has ge initialled all the pages of the break out contract
if so
it would be very helpful if you could ship me the originals
that way
we only have to change the names
which will make it easier for lee when we have to ask him to sign
also
has someone from the enron side initialled all the pages
that helps
too
kay
no headaches
i don't know who started the initialling kick
and i don't know if i care if it continues
i don't know if lee cares
it is probably an eecc artifact
if ge doesn't care
then i don't care
i hear strains of a show tune
i don't care
i don't care
i think i've lost my mind
kay
carolyn
please use newco instead of spawn
also
please give them only one business day to review the final facility agreement
also
we need the duplicate forms for sunlaw energy corporation
will we be getting the drafts tonight
please call me if you have any questions
thanks
kay
no big deal
i'm just trying to tie up loose ends when i can
i suspect they must have gotten paid
or else someone would be complaining
i made a couple of minor revisions
jake has given us until when he gets in tomorrow
i changed turbine agreement to turbine contract
one place in the loi
and added responsibility for filing fees in the llc agreement
perhaps it it redundant
i'm not sure i'm on top of the llc agreement
maybe we can discuss in the am
sorry to hear about bobby's wreck
i hope he feels ok tomorrow
neil's number at work is 0 0 0
and his email is nmann@erac.com
i know you probably checked this
but are you sure you don't have car rental insurance under your auto policy
always good to check
paige got a kick out of seeing bobby
i'm sure he enjoyed the fine cuisine
i feel the same about going up next week
there will probably be a more appropriate time later
paige is coming home for sb next week
i suspect she'll come friday or saturday
but don't know for sure
we are probably going to the matagorda livestock show and auction this weekend
and maybe the rodeo
it must be good
like the belton rodeo
hi and hugs to all
love
kay
i like this one
i know you wouldn't forget
but ms
bills will need to be advised
see you tomorrow
kay
we are in the process of refining the form in connection with the left coast transaction
and it will be easy to
de-westify
it
kay
i didn't ask for the conference call
but i wil make time in my schedule to participate
it is the last two weeks of school
i believe
you have correctly identified my financial advisor
although i figured this one out by myself
i think i'll join the credit union
chris
global finance
lisa bills
needs to be kept in the loop on this
since this is in turbopark
kay
here's the latest drafts
kay
hi there
i think a good next step while the counterparties are reviewing the docs is the creation of a closing checklist
since we have a good starting point with the intergen closing list
we can get organized on putting together a package of the next traunche of docs
such as the parent guaranty
escrow agreement
etc
thanks
kay ps
you might want to check the docs i sent out to jake to make sure i didn't put a panda in a delta doc
i checked
but i need to be double checked
another good reason to use xyz's until the finalist is selected
i think what i will do is send out an email today to have people call you directly and reserve a room
we can then see how many short we are
and deal with the deposit
i will tell them to inform you that they are with the enron group
names of the individuals should be as follows
kay mann
i'll call with my card soon
i want the premier
heather kroll barbara gray peggy banczak lisa bills rose engeldorf nora roberts anne koehler lisa mellencamp christi nicolay gail brownfeld maybe this will help identify those who are really in
there may be a couple of new ones also
thanks
kay
thanks so much for your help
lv co gen deal
funny
she didn't ask me
$0 never hurts
atta girl
you should have heard ben complementing you to jeff
ben said he wished you worked for him so that he could participate more in your prc review
the point was not lost on me
neither have us have spoken to ge
i think sheila spoke to lee
but i don't know the substance of the conversation
we asked his permission on the intergen deal
i believe
i told jake last night that there are arguments which can be made on both sides as to whether ge needed too consent to having the contract distributed to a potential partner
he said he wanted to talk to you about it
my suggestion would be that someone on the commercial side discuss the general status
and ask if it is ok to send out a redacted contract
that is the most conservative approach
kay
time for a battle field promotion
i'll be tanto
you can be him that sabes
well
that's one reason why i don't think there's a lot of risk to it
i know in previous deals the ge frame guys have agreed that we could give three redacted copies to suitors
and the real one to the one
i think a casual conversation will work
the guarantees are nothing special
although the ld ramp rates sometimes matter
lastly is delivery
but again
i don't think it will be a big issue
maybe if jake knows that he probably won't have to tell lee who the suitors are
that might help
kay
hi gregg
i spoke to john n
and i think i understand what's up
i'm in a conference call
but will holler later
kay
this confirms our agreement we reached today that we will start the meeting at 0am central
kay
aren't you something
from now on
you are mr
psa
he did go out of his way to sing your praises
so job well done
scott stopped me on 0 to tell me what a good job carlos did
thought i would pass it along
kay
please put the friday ge call on my calendar
as well as a 0 call tomorrow on northwestern
thanks
nothing from leatha
any news there
kay
hi jeff
i need more in-depth information than what i could get from king
spalding
so i asked around for a mississippi firm
sheila suggested this firm
and stuart said he thought they were an ok group
as you can guess
it is a short list in mississippi to chose from
please let me know what you think
kay
the document on the bottom is the one you are looking for
i will send one of the exhibits separately
kay
thome
sole
hey
that rhymes
you can run but you can't hide
kay
here's more for you to enjoy
we need to make this into an xyz form to match up with the letter agreement
thanks
kay
this is the turbine contract to print and put on your desk
kay
having fun yet
i am attaching the final form loi between ena and crra
as well as the current working draft of the fuel cell purchase agreement
please let me know if you have any comments or questions
kay mann
he doesn't know that sheila undermined his authority with his client
and intervened
remember her saying she wasing going to stay out of it
just shoot me if i do that to you
or at least kick me
kay
it has now clicked that you were looking for a letter in addition to the settlement letter
that didn't sink in before
here tis
frightening roster
no action required
fyi re
blue dog
the east deal
and project salmon
the west deal
and a tough crowd it is
i'm up for it
he seems genuinely happy for you
you are destined for political greatness
please print the clean version below
my computer won't let me print
i tried two different printers
attached is the blue dog llc agreement
this time i mean it
please print the form agreement
i think it is the fourth one below
i had coconut cream pie for lunch
also tuna
i feel so guilty
light dinner for me
and maybe a vodka
no wine
if i can get time to call nathaniel
i will
i'm in a conference call now
i feel guilty about being gone sat
night if paige is home for sb
it does sound like a good weekend weatherwise
i can check with her to see her preference
kay
i need staples and the stiff green folders
i forget what these are called
thanks
kay
i think you'll find there isn't that much to a site sale
witness plano/pontiac as compared to the peakers
don't forget that herman reads everything
and to ask fred if this deal will be dash'ed
i don't know if it should
but probably so
i would want to make sure that the structure of the deal goes through herman
there may be a tweak or a change which can have an impact on what gets booked on mark to market basis
etc
he may have absolutely nothing to add
but i wouldn't take the chance
do not take this too seriously until we talk tomorrow
look forward to meeting you
kay ps
hope it isn't too inconvenient for you to come
sheila really wanted you there
attached is a clean and red lined version of the loi
i'm expecting a call from david hunt
so i haven't dealt with the limit of liability stuff yet
the beck comments are good comments which we need to discuss internally
but since we haven't
i'm happy to take the position that the comments seem to fit better in the drafting of the definitive ageements
kay
hi marisa
please send the forms to carlos also since for 0
0
and 0 we will use the same forms
obviously
we want the economy of doing this once for both transactions
also
please bill the time for these forms to carlos
deal
since blue dog is paying for some of the development of the letter agreement and the llc forms
it sure sounds like we won't be tendering a facility agreement
but until the structure is agreed i would keep the letters in as place holders
once the llc is formed you will get the complete corporate books which will have the certificates
thanks
kay
hi john
i asked to have one guaranty prepared and one escrow agreement for carlos and i to review the forms
now i've got two sets of docs sent by two k
s attorneys
additionally
we are drafting against ourselves
the letter agreement and the llc have been given to the counterparty
seems to make more sense to wait for comments
help
kay
please print
fax for car loan 0 0 0 my contact is ms
sammy marroquin
borrower is cynthia kay mann
we have an agreement which resides in turbopark
kathy clark did the contract
this was the emergency
the outside lawyer for northwestern
marguerite kahn
would like to speak with you concerning the structure of the llc
specifically including the promissory notes
guess i didn't explain it all that well
i asked her just to call you directly
and gave her your number
thanks
kay
turbine team
for future reference we should add in the put/call language
similiar to the language in 0.0
c
of the intergen deal
which allows enron to put the equity to the buyer at any time ge consents
we should soften the approval rights of the purchaser
thanks
kay
please don't
i enjoy the laughter
i was just jealous
ann elizabeth
can you handle this
this is another florida lobby deal
kay
jake mentioned delta but not panda
i'm with you
go delta
who wants to mess with the broker issue
ciao
kay
hi
i'm interested in joining
what do i need to do to join
thanks
kay
please check the cancellation policy for next week's seminar
i may not be going
thanks
kay
ok
i'll let you know tomorrow
i'm leaving at 0 to take michael for a check up
routine
kay
any idea what will be on the agenda
it would be very nice if they would respond to the drafts we've sent them
kay
we need a name for the llc for this transaction
any suggestions
kay
i'm calling in
conference call
for this one
hi ed
i can't find
or recall
that i received the subsequent email referenced in this email
can you direct me to the right place
i looked under administrator and legal net x
and all my emails from 0/0
thanks
kay
i kinda like coyote llc and black hills llc
no spruce
yes
thanks
hey guys
psa's are a hot topic
and i have a call into lisa bills to discuss it
lisa has been out of town for a few days
as has the gf turbopark lawyer
rose engeldorf
rose is being seconded to ena for turbopark issues
and will be back in the office tomorrow
we should sit down with rose and puzzle through the issue
as for the
standard
eecc form psa
it is a real bear
carlos has recently worked on a turbopark/0-0 compliant form
and is waiting for global finance blessing
he was going to talk to bart about his experience
which could also add some extra insight
when you guys have some time it is probably worth taking a half hour to discuss it
kay
hi randy
just wanted to let you know what it up on coop city
i don't know the agenda for the meeting
i'm planning on calling in
kay
hi john
i still need a connecticut lawyer to look at this
do you have someone available
i need input by monday
march 0
nothing comprehensive
just a fatal flaw analysis under connecticut law
thanks
kay
hi jeff
i don't know if you are picking up email
but just in case
here's a description of the roundtable
kay
john
i would hestitate to give up the option to turbopark this project
unless the commercial team commits that there is no way enron will ever want to progress with the site beyond permitting
as you know
there is no going back once we give up that optionality
good catch
renee
kay
hi there
could one of you send me one email with the final
well
we hope
forms of both of the two change orders we are working on for the bd turbine sets
i want to make sure i'm looking at the right stuff
thanks
kay
here's the thing i'm doing on thursday
do you have a form of bio for anybody around here
i need to make something up for the paper
thanks
kay
john
i've received internal approval to participate
i'll see what i can come up with for a bio
thanks
kay
well
you know enron
no boredom
ever
kay
well
i'm glad i get to edit
not really
mark approved it this am
hopefully
good publicity which will make mark glad he approved it
they usually take pictures to go with the article
so i have to see if i need a new
clean
white shirt
gotta look good
makeup and everything
wonder how i lose 0 lbs by thursday
kay
i cleared not going to atlanta with elizabeth
so i should be able to take michael to palacios as soon as monday
supposed to rain this weekend anyway
so monday is soon enough
i would just as soon not have a sharon appointment so we have that flexibility
plus
there is the possibility that i might need to go to fw for my dad
michael can go to fw with me if i need to go
he would be great company for me
i've thought about taking him to moody gardens
or do some other fun stuff as an alternative
the long term weather forecast for houston and palacios is glorious for that week
but you never know
i don't mind taking him by myself
i can do most of the fishing stuff
although i don't know squat about artificials
if i do go i would like to take rosco
since my folks have an internet connection i can keep up with a little work and write you
too
what do you think
hi chris and ben
wanted to make sure you had seen/approved these
i'm looking now also
kay
for your info
thought you might find this interesting
in some sick way
just a reminder that i am planning on being on vacation with my son next week
my clients are aware of these plans
and i have hopes that things will go without a hitch
i will be able to retrieve email and voice mail
kay
well
i know jack probably won't know where to pee since won't have rosco to aim at
i guess kaley will have to growl at jack just to stay in practice
i should add that kendall is due at the end of next week
and if something urgent comes up
i could have to cover for carlos
not likely but you know how the baby stuff goes
i think rosco is going to be at least 0 pounds
although i don't have any information to go on
you mentioned that his pop is a big dog
so i guess we should expect him to be big
maybe one of those tall labs
i just hope his personality stays the same
kay
my dad is having some health issues
so they couldn't commit to next week
i cleared cancelling the conference with elizabeth
so please take the steps necessary to call that off
carlos
wife is due the 0rd
so i may need to cover for him
we'll see
i do hope to take michael and rosco to palacios where we can hang out
fish
play in the sand
etc
in other words
no big plans
which i'm happy about
i think neil will miss rosco as much as michael
but he probably looks forward to having the house to himself for a few days
kay
pitiful
charlotte confirmed for today
delmis is cleaning as we write
i spoke to paige
she is going to try to get an appt with cher for cut/color
i told her we would buy
do you have the ge contracts in the ca stuff
thanks
kay
it seems that i remember seeing something about this in the titan claim file
maybe a copy of it
fyi
one of my guys got a call from one of your band of merry men concerning selling the 0eas
kay
hi cindy
any more sign ups from enron
i'm thinking of sending a reminder out in the next day or so
and i wanted to see if you have anyone other than me
heather and anne
thanks
kay
i guess ed hearn
dear mr
keffer
thank you so much for agreeing to pass my resume along to the appropriate person with the astros organization
in keeping with our family tradition
i am a huge astros fan
and would appreciate the opportunity to get a
behind the scenes look
at how a professional sports organization works
this should be an exciting season for houston baseball
and it would be an honor to be a part of it
any assistance you can give in putting me in touch with the right person would be appreciated
sincerely
paige record
please see insurance groups
request re
equipment warranties
one alternative is to send equipment contracts to david marshall for his reviekay
hi back
reagan
specifying it is for infrastructure costs may cause heartache
don't worry
i'll do the legal work
kay
anytime in the next hour is good
since i didn't eat breakfast
i would love a caffeine free diet coke
got it
good hint
thanks john
i got a huge kick out of paige struggling with the email to you
she's a terrific writer
but had horrible writer's block
i think it was the dose of reality which comes from looking for a job
kay
hi
i saw your posting concerning the kayak
do you still have it
where is it located
i may be interested
thanks
kay
details
do they want one of the turbines before sept
did you look at it on the website
it looks like fun
michael and i could probably have fun on the quiet water days
i'll need a ladder
so i'll have to break the news to pop pop
kay
maybe on saturday
i'm still on it
we are still working on the term sheet
no
we can talk about it when you we meet in a little bit

life's pretty tough when your mom
opps
he calls me
mother
now
won't let you watch tv on the way to school
you guessed right
i really enjoy our time together in the am
and i don't want to compete with pokemon
kay
great
we would like to take a look at it
sounds like something fun for our family
i'll call to set up a day/time
if that's ok with you
kay
for calendar
i may go straight there in the am
are you available
i thought you might be interested since dduran will apparently be there
i'm scheduled for vacation
i'll arrange an invite if you are interested
kay
sounds like a family man
how's the weather
attached is a general bio
please let me know if you need something different or additional
i sent it to j
cogan
but i can send it to other folks as well
i think he will absolutely love it
our wedding is at 0
but we can bring him over earlier if that helps with the museum trip
ok
enron north america corp
i need to have a form filled out that says i don't have health insurance coverage through enron
can you find out who i need to send it to in hr
thanks
kay
i have a change in plans next week
my dad is having surgery in ft
worth
so i will be heading that way on monday
i was planning to be on vacation anyway
but i may have some accessibility challenges in ft
worth which i would not have had otherwise
i will manage client expectations accordingly
kay
i'm not planning to get involved since this is your deal
is that ok with you
yes
but this time it is his carotid artery
the one that transports blood to the brain
big deal kinda stuff
for better or worse
all the folks under the heading
origination
and
development
are ours
although kathleen has a special role with development

peggy banczak is the ena lawyer who handles mexico
hi wilson
i spoke with david hunt
and he has no problem with you representing enron power marketing in the proposed transaction with clarksdale and yazoo city
please let me know if you have any other potential conflicts
thanks
kay mann
look at you
more work
i'll have to send the notice separately
john's number is 0 0-0
kay
i believe this to be the applicable assignment language
i'm confirming
kay
hi rose
was the blue dog override letter signed for turbopark
i didn't see it in the turbopark closing docs
of course
i could have missed it
thanks
kay
sounds like a good match with ruthie and murphy
my old dog
kaley
is really sounding bad
she has a cough that just won't quit
which has gotten worse over the last couple of years
i think it is her heart
she's 0 years old
and moves slowly
rosco owns the familiy now
he is so quiet
but friendly
just likes to hang around close to everyone
i'll miss him when i'm in fw
i took her in a while back for the cough
plus she goes in every 0 months for kennel cough and hearworm test
they haven't said much and i haven't asked
afraid to
i guess
i got kaley when i was with my former boyfriend
and she's been through it all with paige and me
needs to be vetted with herman at some point
if jake wants to negotiate something else with ge
i'm all for it
you lost me
we talked to jake about it
and the two issues were ge consent and accounting treatment
at least that's how i remember it
kay
i didn't redact it
but ben might have a copy
i can email you the electronic file of the intact document
we are also working on a couple of change orders
hi janette
if the tickets are still available
i would love to have them
i realize i was a little slow on the draw this time
thanks
kay
my guess would be the week of the 0th of july
then again sometime in august
i agree that he really should see it
if you want to take him
that's great
or we will be glad to take him
kay
big surprise
you're on
he's getting to be such a good age for theater
wow
that was quick
now i'm out of excuses
kay
i figured it was a long shot
have a great weekend
hi pete
there's been a plan b developed on the lv co gen project
we are seriously exploring the possibility of selling the current lv co gen turbines to a third party
by selling the equity in a project co which acquires the turbines
sound familiar
yes
it is ca development iii
only it is called i anticipate that the most recent version of the lv co gen contract will need to be adapted to the ca form
no e next generation or ena as agent
i believe dale has been working on some tweaks to the form you last worked on for lv co gen
and i assume these tweaks belong in the
new
salmon contract
i will forward you the most current form that i've seen
and dale can protest if he thinks this is the wrong one to work with
carlos sole is the lawyer in houston who will be herding these cats
his number is 0 0 i will be out of the office next week
but will periodically check my voice mail if you have any questions
thanks
kay
as mentioned in my other email
ok
by now you think i've lost my mind
i can accept that
i believe this is the most current version which should form the basis of the salmon llc contract
formerly known as lv co gen facility agreement
kay
jake is ready to tell lee who the purchaser is and get permission to
tell all
i think that's a good way to go
i have to confess that i didn't look at their comments to the turbine contract
i will be glad to do it if you want
jake said that bill williams had some discussions with delta
and he thought maybe some of their comments were no longer germane
bill has received their comments
but i don't know his reaction
kay
thanks for the quick turnaround
kay
don't be too grateful
i think jake wants you to weigh in no matter what
he obviously values your opinion
my personal opinion is you put the comments in front of lee
and if he doesn't like them
the answer to delta is no
we have no leverage to get your changes
kay
is that a general offer to help
or just an offer to help me find the blue dog contract
kathleen
we need to set up an llc for the blue dog turbines
chris had proposed some names at some point
then ben had come up with something
i now can't remember what it is
anyway
it needs to be on the list for next week
thanks
kay
hi john
sounds like we are now reunited in the same legal group
ews
true
kay
i really like that one
well
welcome to ews
i like mark frevert
and i've heard good things abougreg whalley
also
i like working for mark haedicke
kay
reagan
i haven't received an email from david hunt yet
i will make the changes you and i discussed last week
and perhaps we will get david's changes sometime today
kay
federal jurisdiction and limit of liability verbage
that's what comes to mind at this point
could you email me the most current version
i think it was march 0
thanks
kay
i don't have any significant comments
but i picked up a couple of minor typos
from a structure standpoint
i think enron doing the construction
and taking price risk
may be a structuring challenge
but i understand that's a bridge to cross later
kay ps i hope mark isn't reading this today
great wedding
reagan
i don't suggest it
especially since this is not an
off the shelf
deal
there are so many moving parts to this deal it could slow it down in the long run to get someone else involved for a few days
it is like getting a new commercial guy involved for 0 days
i'll defer to the great and powerful oz
i should be available most of the day
so let's see how things go
kay
gee
i was kinda hoping we would have the opportunity to dump stuff on eeosnot the other way around
please confirm that beck's comments nos 0 and 0 are acceptable for the loi
i would include in this email
but i don't have an electronic version with me
reagan
if you have an electronic version
could you forward it to me
thanks
kay
i cannot imagine a shirt larger than the one you received
yikes
sounds like neil still has a chance for a new shirt
we'll have to allow extra time next monday for a double de-brief
kay
reagan
fyi
it would bother me if marvin called our outside counsel
if you want me to call david
just ask
i'll be glad to do it
although i don't suggest bugging the other parties
counsel too much
it uses up relationship capital
and it causes the counterparty to incur expenses they may not want to incur
another fyi
i don't much like enron commercial folks calling enron outside counsel unless we've discussed it in advance
it violates enron policy
so once we have outside counsel on board
you still deal directly with me
and i'll manage the outside resources
it really works better that way
kay
don't mean to lecture
especially via email
just trying to give some constructive suggestions
sheila
if i were starting over again
there are a few things i would change
first
the development fee as presented in this draft doesn't work
second
i would put all the put/call details in the llc agreement
third
i would make the put/call available anytime ge agreed to it
the development fee has been discussed generally
but not fully vetted with herman
kay
here's a general description of the steps
letter agreement signed final form of break out presented to purchaser
not executed by enron llc
$ deposited in escrow turbopark notice given closing date
turbopark closing docs signed
bill of sale
assignment
assumption
llc signs breakout contract amended llc
other closing docs executed money released from escrow to enron enron pays off turbopark this is how it worked on the intergen deal
i was unsure from your email if you see a problem with this process
kay
well
there's a little lesson in the value of being polite to everyone
hey andrea
we are going to fw tomorrow
as my dad is having surgery to unclog one of his carotid arteries
i'm kinda nervous about this one
everything else is going well
michael
paige and neil are all well and happy
paige has applied to the astros for a summer job
seems like a long shot
but she really wants to do it
michael has a kid in his class named colin waters
his dad is the travel secretary for the astros
unfortunately
i haven't met him yet
i can't wait to hear about your reunion
i know it will be a blast
have fun
kay
i sure hope it is this week
it will either be this week
or a while
how's that for keen analysis
it would seem to me that if we end up with breakout contracts signed by e next
we should use the break out form
plus an override letter
what do you think
attached for your reading enjoyment is an indicative org chart
as you might guess
there have been some changes since this was published in december
kay
more org stuff
randy must now be with ews legal
since i see he is in an office on 0
kay
nothing is simple
ben
i will try to be on at least part of the phone call on thursday
technology permitting
kay
fyi
i'm working at home today
headed to fort worth tomorrow
i spoke to carlos shortly after you were up there
and he mentioned you were looking for an org chart
and he recalled that i had sent him one
kay
every day
carlos and i are discussing options right now
i like it
sorry i didn't come up with more concrete examples
i'm really concerned about my dad
although i try to deny it
i still think that we should insulate ena on the next deal
kay
i heard a rumor that carlos sole has been tasked with the mitsubishi consent
i'm sure he will do a great job
kay
hi carlos
i should be easy to reach on my cell until around 0 tuesday
feel free to call
in my absence you can feel comfortable talking to jeff
he seems pretty reasonable and easy to talk to
plus
he knows a lot about enron stuff
you will want to discuss the risk memo with him
copying sheila i guess
ask jeff
like i said before
i'll back you up on whatever decisions you make
for whatever that's worth
my folks number
just in case you lost it
is 0 0 0
ciao
kay
did i send this to you yet
i'm out of pocket the rest of the week
i think the best description is the general enron corp description
it is very generic
and is found at the bottom of all enron press releases
if i get access
i'll forward it to you
unfortunately i can't access it now
it is one of those
enron is a leading blah blah blah
things
lots of help i am
i know you don't have enough to do
i can't access the press release part of the enron intranet site
there is a blurb that appears at the bottom of all enron press releases
which is one of those enron is a leading blah blah blah
if you can easily find that blub
would you mind forwarding it
sorry for asking
kay
here is the current draft for your review
in addition to the changes which were made
there were some valid comments made by beck and christi
which i think need to be addressed
but can be addressed in the definitive agreements
please revise carefully and let me know if you have any comments
kay
jeff
it looks like ben has made some good progress with ge re
blue dog turbines
this really helps
as you can see
i now have email access
kay
i've spoken to the brunini firm in jackson
kay
fyi
please call me on monday to discuss
if possible
thanks
kay
i'm out of town
but can donate next week
kay
first order of business
again
we can discuss this on monday
i think ben
or one of his minions
called carolyn and asked her to be on a telephone call today
i have reacted with righteous indignation
and carlos is going to tell her it is not necessary for her to be on the call
i really hadn't intended for carolyn to work on this transaction
talk to you monday
kay
as best i can tell it isn't essential
however
it would probably be helpful
i know you are on holiday
so if you have something else going on
i wouldn't worry about it
i can always call you later
kay
we are contemplating selling the blue dog turbines to northwestern
i've been out of town with a sick dad
so i'm not clear who has been in the loop and who hasn't
however
since these are turbopark turbines
i wanted to make sure you are aware of the deal
it is the commercial teams desire to enter into an exclusivity arrangement as soon as possible
sorry for the short notice
today is the first day i've been able to pick up my email
kay
hi dan
what's the latest with suzanne
is she home yet
do you have her home thanks
kay ps i'm still out of town
thanks
we'll call you around 0
kay
chris
please do not ask outside counsel to participate in a call
undertake a task
or do anything without talking to me
carlos
or another enron lawyer first
you do not need to call carolyn and tell her not to participate
carlos has taken care of this already
kay
will there be a
pre-call
for the enron team
kay
i'm still out of town
but now i have email access
did your ca get taken care of
you mentioned that you feel like we can use tex-mex as a go-by
do you have electronic copies of the development agreement
thanks
kay
i saw that michael young was included in the email regarding the 0 conference call
so i thought he was planning on phoning in then as well
when will he be calling in
kay
hi john
i'll be glad to consider using aaron
let me take a look at the agreements first
before we commit
did bob carter work on these agreements
he might have copies
and he won't charge us for them
at least i don't think he will
thanks for your understanding and patience this week
kay
that will help
evidently ben told chris to call
this is an on going problem
kay
sounds perfect
unfortunately
bart works on west deals
i'll talk to my boss
jeff hodge
and see what he says
hi bart
i think it is an east deal
so i wouldn't think it would be dumped on you
i just think it is nice to see the good stuff
kay
please put carlos sole on the notice list
thanks
kay
hi there
feel free to leave me an email about anything you are working on
as i will be available next week and onward to cover for you
in fact
if you want to stay home and go with ks to her dr's appt on monday
i'll be there to cover
in fact
just plan to not be there
and if you are
it is a bonus
i don't you worry about anything when it gets to be baby time
if you do figure out remote access
i can email you questions and you can answer when it is convenient
paige is almost 0
michael is 0.0
it goes fast
ciao
kay
my cell phone is charging
give me 0 minutes
john or marissa
please call me at your convenience on my cell
0 0 0
thanks
kay
fyi
i don't know what i think about this email
i will say that i've heard good things about clark
but haven't worked with him
also
there is a big difference between a transmission project and a power project
since tranmission assets are treated differently from an accounting standpoint
obviously
i don't consider the question of who is handling this
internally or externally
to be resolved
pending further discussions
kay
hi there
just confirming a 0 cst enron team conference call
is this going to work for everyone
with the exception of carlos
who is now excused
kay
opps
i should add that mr
hodge has a free pass to miss this and all other nw phone calls
kay
ben
i'm at home if you need to reach me before the call
0 0 0
kay
so how do you say
bitch
in spanish
i have a better chance of remembering
mamona
i have to build up to the good stuff
my home number is 0 0 0
if call notes picks up
try me on my cell at 0 0 0
did you find the fax
you can fax it to me if that speeds up you getting out of the office
call and let me know
thanks
kay
unless something new comes up
i think we finished the letter agreement
i'm awaiting a revised draft now
and if it is acceptable to nw
they will sign it and fax it to me tomorrow morning
maybe on ben's layover we can have a discussion about where we go from here from a schedule standpoint
talk to you tomorrow
kay
i'm looking at it now
the changes look fine to me
kay
wonder how much worse it would have been if we had started with a doc that you and i liked
john
thanks for driving in to the office so you could send these emails
don't forget to mail the hard copy
i appreciate your help
this deal will need it
ciao
kay
hi bob
any info
kay
hi reagan
sure
i'm digging out now
kay
kathleen
carlos has illinois
so keep him copies please
kay
thank you so much
i'm really looking forward to seeing the rangers
and what a great place to see them
kay
works for me
kay
suz's temporary replacement can't find the matagorda fair receipts i left for suz
we may been to call to get duplicates
i thought about you every day
but i figured you'd be better off with peace and quiet
my dad is doing fine
he is very relieved to have it over with
last week was just nuts
are you still in a lot of pain
it takes a while to get your strength back
so don't push it
your body has a lot of healing to do
aren't you glad you used the torso track so that you had decent abdominal strength
it is amazing all the things you use those muscles for
i can't tell you how much i miss you
take care
and i'll write if there's any good gossip
kay
what's your phone number
wilson
please call me when you have a minute
thanks
kay
could you re-send that summer camp website address
the one i got on the page didn't work
thanks
kay
it was operator error
do you know the hours of summer camp
i put a call in to ask
just in case you didn't know
i kinda like the methodist angle
and the swimming pool
he needs more swimming lessons
kay
hours are 0-0
program runs 0-0
maybe we should try church there
i found the receipts
we should have taken the forms with us to the auction to save time
oh well
live and learn
pork chops and spinach
gentlemen
attached is a clean version of the loi
originals are being sent to bob and marvin by fedx tonight
regards
kay
let's see if i get your address right this time
i was wondering what i was going to do in my spare time
good morning
how about 0 today for a conference call with john's new best friend
i'll leave that up to you
we can make faces and pass notes if you come over
but i suppose that isn't essential to the transaction
my recollection is that the original abb contract was assigned into turbopark without revisions/restatement/consent
or a break out contract
i think eecc had the typewriter on the original contract
i quickly looked in my turbopark binders
but didn't immediately find the abb contract
there was a breakout contract done for the ca development deal
and pete thompson
with ak out of dc
would have generated that document
it wasn't approved by the turbopark team since it was entered into by the enron llc post turbopark
i wasn't involved in the fountain valley transformer contract
but my guess would be that pete thompson worked on it
the footer you described sounds like an ak footer
kay
pete
please send john schwartzenburg a copy of the fountain valley transformer contract
thanks
kay
right
i'm thinking mk may not be email proficient
also note wordperfect documents
i bet her secretary had to come into the the office on sunday
are these ok with you
these are both pending
but just so you know they exist
i'm sending this along
once these are signed i'll send you copies
kay
i had a brief conversation with herman manis
and he tells me that there is a different interpretation of accounting rules relating to power plants
strangely enough
the change is one which should
i hope i hope
make power development projects easier
in the past
we ran into problems anytime we wanted to build a power plant and take megawatts off of it
herman tells me that the current interpretation now focuses on the operation and maintenance of the plants
and not the power purchase agreement relating to the plant
this change in focus should make power development deals easier to structure
i would still like to set up an intro to turbopark meeting with rose engeldorf
rose is currently involved in a push a couple of deals in the west this week
so it may be a bit before we can get it set up
a meeting with herman would also be helpful
maybe we can buy him lunch and quiz him on these new developments
kay
thanks for the reply
i found it on her desk
kay
tonight is yoga night
much grass
whichever is better for charlotte
for your information and email folder
hi karen
sounds familiar
i'm sure you checked this
but in some of the ge contracts
the parent guarantee provision is under the purchaser's responsibilities section
near the beginning of the contract
a strange place for it
good luck
kay
hi wilson
can you open this attachment
kay
michael is off school april 0 and 0
i have 0 deals which are supposed to close around then
so i'm not optimistic
if possible
i will take at least one of those days
on the summer camp
if we use a camp by you
we will probably lose charlotte for the summer
does that matter to you
kay
remember the count down
suitable for printing
i'm not aware of an override agreement with abb
if someone can give me the name and address of montana power
i can finish the exclusivity agreement today
kay
i agree it is matt
and i believe he has reviewed this tax stuff
or at least other turbine k's
before
his concern will be us getting some amount of advance notice before title transfer
ie
delivery
obviously
he might have some other comments as well
i'm happy to send him the latest
or maybe he can access the site
kay
i got this from carlos from a deal he and carolyn have worked on
note that the language sounds familiar
someone must have sent this form to northwestern
i suspect an enron person
kay
i didn't know there was one
well
ben's poa is executed
it is just a matter of getting some of the poa's for the subs worked out
come see me whenever you want
i haven't read this
so i don't know if it is anywhere close to your deal
but here's a bootleg copy of the frontera agreement
just to give you a sense of some type of starting point
kay
here's a draft for your review
we should talk about the generator before this is sent to mpc
kay
yes and no
they were supposed to call at 0am to see if they should come in at 0
space permitting
if no space is available
they are to go in at noon
i'm guessing they went in at 0
since i think he would have called to say they haven't gone in
just a guess
though
he has his computer at home
so i think if he was sitting around he would drop us a note
kay
i only have you out on april 0 and 0 on my calendar
is there another day
we need to cancel michael's appt with sharon for that monday
also
why don't you try to find at least 0 people to go with you to the astro's game on tueday
i'll come if i can
i'll nose around here
here's the form of loi i was thinking of using
in draft form
i don't know how much information we are prepared to fill in on the term sheet
if we don't have enough to fill in we can always skip the term sheet for now
kay
per your request
good
does that mean i'll see you there
when you get a minute please send me your favorite option agreement so that i can get it hermanized
thanks
kay
no room at the inn for today and probably not tomorrow
carlos says he will be here tomorrow unless something happens tonight
kay
you shouldn't have told ben
hi carlos
jake called and said he wants to sign up delta tomorrow
friday
i had a conference call with john
carolyn and rick vincens
and we are pushing forward
if you read this
could you tell me about any critical issues
also
has there been a risk memo started
and has accounting signed off on the structure
i'll get up to speed on this during the evening
and will take your deal toy when the deal is done
kay
john
note their lawyers are paul hastings
we need to take that into consideration
kay
excellent observation
is this for the turbines being sold to delta as opposed to the new replacement equipment
thanks
kay
what do you think of this
thanks
fyi
well
things are hopping around work
dan and i have barely had time to say hello
and you know how i am about getting my dose of dan
i've got several deals going great guns
so you know how that goes
i had lunch with stuart and kathleen today
and that was fun
neil and i have a date night tomorrow
so we are trying to decide what to do
i suggested we just walk around the downtown hot spots
if the weather is nice
i've got diamond seat tickets for next tuesday's opener
i'm going to tell ben that i have female problems and have to go to the gyno so he will leave me alone
i figure if that doesn't do it
nothing will
neil gets to go with me
which is really nice
it is a 0 o'clock game
which i think is a neat time
daylight savings time starts next week
so i guess the sun will be setting as the game ends
i'm glad baseball season is back
although i did gave away our tickets to tomorrow's game
carlos and his wife waited around all day to be called in to go to the hospital so she could be induced
texas women's was too busy to take them
they finally called them in at 0 tonight to come in
so i guess they will have a late night
you bottle of bubbly is in my kitchen
i keep hoping to have an hour to bring it by
i figure it will be good no matter when you get it
my transfer to power trading is back on
i think some of the work i do is transferring with me
but i'm not sure
in short
i don't know what the difference will be
it isn't supposed to happen until may
so i'm not giving it too much thought
elizabeth gave me a brochure for another seminar
this one in newport beach at the four seasons
i'm liking the sound of it
i miss you terribly
as does neil
take care and get well quickly
it isn't the same without you
kay
hi there
i don't know who has or wants to look at the deal docs
but here's the main one
i'm giving it a close look this am
since i haven't been involved in this deal for a little while
herman
this is the transaction we discussed on the phone a couple of weeks ago
lisa and catherine
i'm pondering the logistics of selling the new turbine in the pack with the current ones
i have a call in to lee johnson to discuss it with him
just to make sure he is on board
i know it can be done
we just have to figure out the paper trail
chip
i haven't received the hancock letter yet
stephen
your close review of the document would be greatly appreciated
talk to all soon
kay ps
anna claire sole arrived at 0am today
hi pete
i have a fire drill for you
this contract needs to between salmon energy llc and ge
with no agency reference
in other words
a ca development form
any chance of getting this today
the delivery dates on one of the turbines will be changing
as is the payment schedule
also
the designation of one of the turbines will change
salmon will be receiving units 0
0
0 and 0
a new one
thanks
kay
i don't know why i have trouble with your email address
hi again
i'm going to have some tweaks on the letter agreement
but please go ahead and distribute to delta for their review
thanks
kay
yes
how's that for an answer
i think you want to revise against this version
since this is the latest version lee has seen
then blackline against the 0th version
thanks
kay
did you mean for your home number to be on the out of office message
kay
just go ahead and turn it
putting in a
note
for any missing pieces
that will make it easy for me to search
thanks
and have a good weekend
kay
most recent version
becky
i had four days of vacation
march 0

thanks
kay
stephen is trying to set up a conference call at 0 re delta
please advise if this doesn't work for you
thanks
kay
have i written you back yet
it is such a zoo
i can't remember
i've started this email 0 times
i'm going to the astros game on thursday in the diamond seats
i'll watch for ric
both neil and i will be there
i love those seats
that's where i'm sitting on opening day
also
i'm sure you will be at a game soon
remember how nice it was this time last year for those first games
it is no nice with the roof open
how many games do you have tickets to this year
they have james coney island outside today
i ate most of two hot dogs
i bet i'll be sleepy soon
i brought them back up here
so my office will probably still smell like chili when you come back
guess i'd better get back to work
rest up and get well
kay
chris calger wants the financing cp removed
and we have a call scheduled at 0 to see if we can get to agreement with delta
0
if during the term
mpc determines it does not desire to proceed with thpurchase of the turbine
mpc shall promptly notify ena in writing
and thisagreement shall automatically terminate upon the earlier of the date of enareceipt of such notice or the expiration of the term
without any furtherliability of either party to the other hereunder
if
during the term
enadetermines in good faith that it is unable to negotiate for the sale of theturbine due to circumstances relating to the generator
it shall notify mpcand refund the consideration
i got a form that consultants sign
and i'll compare them
kay
larry left me a voice mail
would you mind calling him and telling him that i am tied up on a conference call that is likely to last until 0
so i can't call him until after then
i would really appreciate it
i'm on a conference call which i hope will end by then
a deal we are trying to close today
yikes
kay
i would guess
yes
i don't know that i like the idea either
i feel bad
i'll at least leave a message for him this weekend
i'm on the phone with mark h
the big guy
i would love to take you up on it
but i'm already lined up to go
i'll take a raincheck
thanks for thinking of me
kay
i'm an expert at being a rabid fan and excellent arm chair manager
i keep waiting for the skipper to call for advice
we are trying to close with delta
and they saw a march 0th draft
also
i had it revised to take out e next and substitute the llc
so now i have two versions
just trying to get it clear
i've spoken with lee about revising the contract to pick up the new contract
leaving the
old
turbine in the master agreement
to be included in the lv co gen break out contract
couldn't be simpler
kay
you have excellent sources
you might check to see if this looks like the one in the binder
i believe it is one and the same
kay
hi lee
here is the new turbine contract
blacklined against the march 0 version
i look forward to speaking with you soon
kay
i have taken what i believe this is the most recent form of the ge turbine contract
changed to reflect the difference in purchaser
and filled in some of the blanks
i have compared it against the delta redline that rick sent me this afternoon
after having accepted delta's proposed changes for the purpose of running the comparison
the notes included are placeholders since i wasn't clear if these items will change with the equipment swap
ge is also reviewing salmon energy agreeement version 0
redline thanks
kay
for your reading pleasure
hi there
i suggest that we have an enron only call at 0 central on sunday
in advance of the 0 call with delta
i believe the call in number is 0 0 0
pass code 0#
kay
comments from enron finance
i came in too late to know whether it was offered or asked for
but yes
it is a deliverable
the delta deal is being financed
so they are asking for a lot of docs
including a letter from ge counsel
to make it more fun
there are complications with the ge consent on the pastoria deal
it is not a happy time between ge and enron
but i hope it will smooth over quickly
more to come
kay ps
still no comments from northwestern
we need to talk about how scheduling problems easter weekend if this thing drags on
i agree
they are really taking their time
it makes me think that they would sign up as is
what an optimist
kay
is this your flight
have you seen your ticket
it isn't in my name
is it
wow
you are up early for a man of leisure
kay
that's my one pass number
here's the latest revision of the delta letter agreement
i'm reviewing it now
kay
i wouldn't call them until after you've taken the flight
hi kent
i don't know whether lee has mentioned the delta power deal that we are working on
we are taking 0 turbines and putting them in an llc
and selling some of the interest in the llc to delta power
three of the turbines are turbines formerally known as lv co gen turbines
and we are buying new lm's to replace the ones we are using here
in any event
delta power is financing the deal
and they have asked that we get ge sign off on the attached documents
therefore
i would be interested in your response to the attached
i understand that lee is in new orleans today
but i'll send him a copy anyway
thanks
kay
hi karen
could i get a copy of whatever the latest version is of the ge consent for pastoria
we have a potential deal coming up to move some frames out of turbopark
so i would like to see the current state-of-the-are version
thanks
kay
hi pete
are the performance numbers the same as the original master numbers
i recall some email traffic on this
thanks
kay
i didn't tell them
so the rumor mill must be working
that sounds really interesting
let me see if i can change one appointment to make it work
thanks
kay
i guess go back to the original contract performance numbers
the other numbers must be specific to the site for the las vegas project
kay
i would think the policy would still be in place
but i don't remember what it is
units will be 0
0
0
0
no serial # on 0
i think the amounts and pricing stays the same
carolyn and/or john
could one or both of you give me a call as soon as you are available for a conference call with chris calger
steve and me
thanks
kay
hi danetta
i heard a rumor that you are the one to look at this stuff
i know that you recently went through the process in connection with the fountain valley transaction
i'm happy to serve up those forms to freshfields if that makes it is easier for you
my number is 0 0 0
thanks
kay
anything else for the term sheet
feel free to add it and return to me
here's what ge is signing up for this week
i would like to see their opinion letter
kay
we have a conference call at 0 with delta
if you are interested in returning to the deal you are welcome to jump back in
i suspect the letter agreement will be signed sometime this week
with closing to occur later this month
it is up to you
kay
yes
this stuff is for the purchaser's bank
no problem
danetta worked it for the fountain valley project
how long has she been here
i didn't know there was anyone other than you
sheila handled fv
today was the first day i had seen them
hi chip
have you seen anything from hancock re delta
i haven't
thanks
kay
we are going to hold the limits the same in this contract
and take the extra on the purchase on the replacement equipment
kay
the issue is getting an assignment agreement that ge will sign
i've requested copies of the docs signed on the pastoria deal
which is the most recent ge frame assignment transaction
that should be our starting point
kay
opps
no
i don't have anything yet
i got a message from ben 0 hours ago that said to hold off on montana power
did you hear differentlly
hi lee
i haven't checked to see if the ps stabilizers are included
how does this look
kay
this will be yours when you get back
same counterparty as tex mex
i think
i'll finish this and forward you some other docs
you may have these for tex mex
john expects to use something similiar on the coal plant
but obviously that is up to you
kay
new and hopefully improved version
changing confidentiality and the statement in the term sheet on structure
kay
i'm ok
theresa zucha has generously offered to help me with my expense account
which i really wasn't comfortable asking warren to do anyway
thanks for asking
how does wednesday look for a conference call
kay
ben called this am and said we can go ahead
i remember that the longer i played softball
the bigger the women were
when i was in my late 0's and early 0's
i played men's league
and i think they were smaller than the women
i had a momentary lapse
too many turbines
not enough time
carolyn
please send to the counterparty
subject to further enron review
i suggest a conference call with delta at 0 to discuss where we are
kay
hi wilson
it would be great if we could talk this week
i'm under the gun right now
but will you be available on friday for a chat
thanks
kay
well
you know how casual lenders are about commitment letters
i thought you were supposed to have your toes in the sand in florida
i'll have to check with kathleen on the details of the documentation for the various development companies
if there are a couple most active we can put those on the top of the list
kay
lets at least get the florida ones done
any idea why she didn't go
attached is a slightly revised turbine contract
the performance values have been modified
as i believe the previous draft had site-specific numbers
it is redlined against the version you received last friday
kay
please see the two additions below
hi rhett
i'm working on one of these turbine transfers via the sale of 0% of the equity of the llc
i'll forward the operative docs to you right away
in any event
here's a change the counterparty wants to the tax language in the letter agreement
kay
here's the letter agreement i referenced in my other email
kay
hi again
delta power will be making revisions to the llc for tax purposes
i've given them your email address to include you in the distribution
kay

not that this is a big deal
but i heard a voice mail from mark stating that lance is the dash guy while mark is in dc
maybe that was deal specific
maybe we can grab something quick and eat upstairs
i am underwater
i'm swamped
i got up at 0 to work this am
got here at 0 yesterday so i could go to the game
those young uns recover quickly
don't they
still missing you
kay
warren helped a little yesterday
and theresa has offered to do my expense account
i'll limp by miserably until your return
kay
maybe mark doesn't know about lance's trip
i don't think so
it would help if you could take a quick look at these few changes
kay
hi lee
can you confirm that the retention amount for the
old
turbines
i've got $0,0 per
thanks
kay
best wishes
hi carlos if things aren't better next week
i may need ask for your help
ie
dump this
it depends on how delta and yazoo city shake out
hopefully
it won't be too bad
be sure to check out the black line
kay
we have a conference call at 0
and you are welcome to join us
hi there
could someone email me the latest version of the aip
thanks
kay
never mind
lee sent it
i hear your deal blew up
what happened
hi jeff
i'm tied up on an endless phone call
but wanted to drop you a note to let you know that i got your voice mail
and will get back to you shortly
kay
steve is in my office and he agrees with the approach
i'm checking with steve
thanks
kay
hi carolyn
i can't recall whether delta et al have seen a draft of the escrow agreement
and instructions
yet
is this one in the works
i suspect ge may want to see it in connection with the giving of their consent
thanks
kay
hi pete
per my voice mail
kay
here's a starting point
i've tried to bracket stuff with open issues like this
but i'm sure there are more questions than
s
i'm really unclear on the financial aspect of the deal
reagan
i didn't stop to put the exhibits you sent in
as i thought it was better to get the doc in your hands
and mr
fairley's
for a detailed review
kay
i've sent a draft to you and reagan via email
there are questions and blanks in it
kay
well
don't get too excited until you read it
there's lots of stuff i just had to put place holders on
but we'll get it all filled in
kay
it is good airplane reading
#0 sounds like the ca development structure to me
i don't really like the organization of it much
i think things need to be moved around and re-organized
looks like our exposure is less than $0,0
please call me
kay
see you there
wrong week
that's next week
maybe he cancelled this week since he is out next week
i need a legal opinion
what is a non-purchase order
could you please email me what we think are the execution version of the letter agreement and the substantially complete llc agreement
also
how many execution copies will we have
thanks
kay
hi charlotte
just confirming that you will be picking michael up today
and i will pick him up at your place around 0
he has clean clothes to change into
thanks
kay
oh boy
it may be closer to 0
is this still ok
i'll call first
of course
hi lee
pete thompson is preparing the lv co gen break out contract based on the version generated last week that you and bill williams had agreed to
or so i think
but incorporating the aip stuff where approproiate for the new turbines
we need to have the delta break out contract signed by april 0th
so i'm hoping to have the lv co gen contract today or early tomorrow for all to review
that way
you can look at both at the same time
and sign both at the same time
pretty nifty
thanks
kay
re
coal fired plant we discussed with mitch and john
hello there
here's the lv co gen break out contract with the assortment of turbines
including the 0 turbines from the new order
i haven't quite figured out the route
but i think this is the correct destination
due to the delta schedule
it would be very helpful to get closure on this form by april 0th
kay
this is the form which needs to be cleaned up
i may have a cleaned up version
i'll check
kay
roger ondreko left the company
or is leaving soon
herman brought billy flemmin
sp
yesterday
and billy seems to be involved in a bunch of stuff
your tax guys are matt gockerman
state
and rhett jackson
federal
kay
i didn't pick this email up until this am
and i don't have the beginnings of the 0nd draft with me
will df be in today
kay
deborah
this is the most recent email i have from mark
it gives an overview of the project
i'll check for other pertinent emails
kay
any ideas
thanks
kay
nice touch
sending this the day after the letter agreement was signed
can you enlighten me on the ena procedures and sensitivities to these types of docs
thanks
kay
i believe he is going to reliant
they have a financing out in the letter agreement
we have to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver ge consents
but i don't recall anything about in other financing docs
is someone in the dept designated as the opinion reviewer
kay
here's a new one
kay
christi
per your email
kay
i would really appreciate your advice
i have to learn it somehow
and i know that you have an excellent idea of what works
thanks
kay
hi tax gurus
here comes another turbine transaction similiar to ca development and salmon energy
this one is with northwestern
i need to run some tax stuff by you
so here
tis
thanks
kay
hi kent
i can get a redline done for you if you want to tell me what it should be redlined against
i don't know about getting rid of the requirement for the inhouse counsel opinion
maybe after you look at things we can discuss it
thanks
kay
0nd try
hope it works
we are supposed to try to have the break out contract by april 0
and i think the consents and stuff that same week
kay
final version agreed to by april 0th
i had to leave early friday to pick michael up
so obviously
today
monday
is fine
i appreciate your advice
especially on the opinion
thanks
kay
the balance due to ge is being escrowed at closing
with standing instructions to release payments to ge on a fixed payment schedule
i will email you the current draft of the instructions
kay
hi there
i decided to work from home this am due to a headache
kay
they've asked for much the same from ge
kent is reviewing the docs
i'm at home with a sinus headache
but i'm working
kay
hi reagan
could you locate
cut and paste and email me the definition of
native load
from the entergy tariff
i need the location of the interconnection for the defn of delivery point
aren't we missing some time in the defns of on/off peak that you gave me
aren't 0 hours missing
is on/off peak an everyday thing
or seasonal
what are we going to do about defining profit
and costs
do we need to give a place for meetings
and if so
where should these meetings be
0 c
more to come
thanks
kay
would you mind faxing me the schedules you emailed me last week
0 0 0
i'm not hooked up to my printer
and it isn't working so swift
and i would like to be able to look at everything at one time
kay
would you rather do lunch tomorrow
my computer is plugged in to my phone line so i can sit on the bed and work
i feel puny now
but maybe i'll feel better later
how do you feel about making enron an advisory member of the marketing committee
i'm concerned that we will run afoul of miss law regarding control
would this create a problem for us
kay
big hole in the doc without the profit stuff
any ideas
i'm sure friday will work well
it should be quiet at work since it will be good friday
i know your pictures will be spectacular
christi is the one who told me to ask you about native load since you have the tariff
small world
this is getting tricky
we could ask oz but i wouldn't want to upset df
it just seems like a big deal to leave out of the draft
kay
my printer just froze
and i want to look at the doc to finish the reorganization
could you pretty please fax me the first 0 pages
i have the last
also
could you look at the stuff i've highlighted in yellow
i haven't put all your comments in
but i will in a minute
don't get discouraged
the draft is closer to finished than it looks
it is just the changes are in my head
it won't take too terribly long now
i've set up the exhibits as a separate document to make it easier to move around the doc
i think it would be kind of strange to send a draft without the most basic of commercial terms included
stranger things have happened of course
many thanks
kay
i heard pat radford is leaving
and you know bob carter is leaving
right
i don't feel as bad as i did when i woke up
my face hurt so badly
neil was so sweet bringing me hot washcloths
it really helped
i'm running a low grade fever
and i know it is a sinus infection
i took a really hot shower around 0 this morning
but it didn't help much
advil helped
i spent a lot of time outside yesterday
and i'm paying for it
i figured you knew
but i thought i'd better be certain
i'm wondering about bart
too
bob said he
bob
is getting a nice raise
and i heard he got a signing bonus
oh
i heard it from dan
so you probably know
are they looking for someone to replace pat
i like glenn
the temp on 0 who was working for ben
i don't know his skills
but he is great on the phone
pp will own 0% of se
enron owning the remaining 0%
damn
i hate it when i do that
this is a big deal
let's see if i can attach it this time
i'd better ask delta on that one
since there is a financing involved
i believe pp to be a wholly owned sub/project co
but i'll confirm
kay
would it help if i found the name of some finance contact at delta power
kay
hi carolyn
ge has asked for an explanation of the relationship of pegasus to delta power
in other words
the equity structure
could you please ask greg if dp can send an email with that explanation
so that i can pass it along to ge
thanks
kay
carolyn
please make arrange for distribution to the delta team
thanks
kay
carolyn
please send ge's comments to the delta team
thanks
kay
thanks
i'll pass along your comments
kay
i think i'll just take off until you get back
i checked with chris earlier today and he hadn't heard anything
the ball is clearly in their court
so i guess we just stand by
i plan on being back in the office tomorrow
talk to you then
kay
i should be in the office in the am
actually you picked a good week to make the transition since we'll be at the law conference wed-friday
you can ease into things again without us hovering
kay
steve
i know that we specifically included the stabilizer in the salmon deal
please confirm that it belongs there so that we can finish up the break out contract
thanks
kay
what a mess
cc
do you still have the contact info for the escrow agent
if so
it would be great it you would contact them directly
the turbine contract is going back and forth between us and ge
i expect that it may well be ready tomorrow
i expect the enron opinion letter to be an issue
kay
hi david
reagan struck all the references to the fuel plan
i think the specific obligations would fit nicely in the scope exhibits
but we can put the stuff in the body of the contract if that's better for you
it just seemed that it would easier to work with in the exhibits
kay
does bill know this
lee is going to want to know that you guys are on the same page
kay
pete
could you call bill and discuss
thanks
kay
what is wrong with these people
who faxes
chris
i haven't heard when they expect to have their financing
we are finishing up the break out contract with ge
and assuming we tender it tomorrow
they will have until april 0th to fund the escrow
kay
sounds like both need to stabilizers
kay
jerry
i didn't receive the fax you referenced yesterday
please resend to me at kay
i was referencing your question about power and gas activity obligations when i raised the issue of putting it in the exhibits
which we have done pursuant to discussions we had last friday
my point on the fuel plan was that reagan deleted it
which was fine with me
there is language in the contract addressing enron's responsibility to buy gas and fuel oil for the facilities
kay
english as a second language
this will be a big help
thanks
kay
even then we could send faxes to the right numbers
this is ridiculous
tick tick tick
isabel
if you will email me your contact info
i will pass it along to ge
thanks
kay
did you ask lee for a finance contact
i can't remember
kay
team salmon
carlos will be working the enron consent/opinion docs
i suspect he is looking for a seat at the closing dinner
but the help is appreciated regardless of motive
carolyn
the form of the escrow instruction letter looked fine
i spoke with ge about the turbine contract
and i am optimistic that we will have the
final form
today
ciao
kay
thanks
fine by me
john
the fax is coming in as we speak
guess it takes a while to fax it to all those addresses
would you mind call jerry jerry boberry and see what he will tell you is the substance of their issues
and share with him our issues
i don't see a reason to kirk the whole clan for that experience
thanks
kay
it finished arriving around 0 cst
thanks
kay
of course
this doesn't apply to any funds held in a jointly owned bank or trust account
right
and when you say
do not
what do you mean
does that mean do or does it mean not
you are confusing me
what does
is
mean
after all
as i'm sure you recall
bob vote handled the last one
richard sanders is the ews litagation manager
so mark would probably like for him to know about it
richard seems decent
kay
you're a better man than i am
gunga din
kay ps
please tell me you shared this info with rob w
depends on how much time you give me
i have a 0 meeting
so i'm sending this as is so that david can print a copy
i have not yet integrated all of his changes
although i have dealt with the profit/savings and qse
is the scope of scheduling services in the exhibit the same as the scheduling
aka qse
stuff
later
kay ps reagan has the latest exhibits
when we were part of julia's group
waivers of consequentials in ca's were not standard
i don't know if this was due to an ena policy
doubtful
if we are the one giving important information
we shouldn't want to waive it automatically
because consequentials will be the most likely result of the other party's breach
therefore
in unilateral agreements where we are giving the info
i wouldn't want the waiver
in the reciprocals it would depend on the circumstance
if the other party is doing most of the sharing
i would want it
what say you
carlos
kay
wow
i wonder how long it will take for me to get a good handle on this stuff
thanks
kay
i have a few comments from our finance folks which i am reviewing now
kay
cool
believe it or not
they have not mentioned an extension
they figure we can sign on friday
when do you want to talk
kay
scott
carlos sole
is supporting mitch and john's efforts relating to bpub
ie
coal fired generation
any contracts for that effort should be coordinated through carlos
carlos will assist with the coordination of the finance and accounting requirements
due to the complexity of the issues some lead time is necessary
unfortunately
there are no
forms
for generation projects
given accounting/finance requirements
or any assurance that a contract that worked a month ago will work now
my preference is that contracts not be sent to counterparties prior to ena
or eecc
legal review
thanks
kay
cynthia kay mann i approve invoices and work from remote locations
yeah yeah yeah
i'm back
last night my little boy was sick
so i guess it was a virus
i feel good today
ca time
kay
thanks
kay
welcome back
i know you are probably really busy
paige will be coming home on thursday
i told her we might not be leave for ph until saturday
i want michael to be able to go to the easter egg hunt here if he wants to
i don't know paige's plans beyond thursday
since you've been out of town so much
would it help if i took off friday so that you can catch up
that still leaves monday
glad you are back
kay
i love free stuff
even agreements
any calls from 0
kay
for your info
hi tax gurus
i was out when you called the other day
since then
we have another version of the docs anyway
would you like to schedule a time to discuss this with me and outside counsel
kay
monday is bad for me
the rest of the week looks good
kay
hi there
i thought i'd check back to see where we are on the delta
salmon
break out contract
now that we know that the stabilizers should be included
how's it looking
thanks
kay
are you and herman ok with this
kay
hi herman
this is another turbine transaction
i think there will be another turn of this doc soon
but i want you to have a heads up
kay
are you in the loop on this
kay
hi wilson
i haven't forgotten you
i just got tied up
this is a very preliminary draft
but thought you should take a look at it
i don't need a detailed analysis
i just want you to have it so that we can discuss the impact of mississippi law
i am specifically interested in discussing the following
waivers of consequential damages
limitations of liability legal status of mdea
i'll send you the info of what i have
dispute resolution and jurisdiction restrictions on confidentiality restrictions any other aspects of the agreement impacted by mississippi law i don't need any memos
just a discussion
thanks
kay
yep
me again
here's the version i referenced in my earlier email
i believe we need to restore the stabilizer stuff
but i wanted to get agreement
thanks
kay
ge has been negotiating with freshfields
just like you will be soon
so i don't know what the current version looks like
kay
again
kent is negotiating this directly
so i don't know what the current version looks like
kay
i'll forward your email to neil
thanks for writing
i deleted your message and then hopped on another conference call
how about 0
here's some stuff for us to discuss
kay
want to join me
it isn't necessary unless you want to
this is the first of two emails i'm sending you
lee revised the salmon contract you did
and now it needs to be
unrevised
in these ways
kay
thanks
kay
sounds good to me
do you want to come to my office for the call
if so
could you please please bring me a caffeine free diet coke
thanks
kay
hi ben
the conference call went fine with northwestern
they really want to get their hands on the contract and the change orders
i told them you were talking to ge about it
and we will get them the contract asap
here are the issues
if we terminate due to their default
they want the additional $0m to be liquidated damages
ie
our exclusive remedy
they still want the right to talk to ge
specifically about the terms of the assignment to the llc if we are having difficulty getting ge consent
they want to be able to exercise their call
or take an assignment
of the turbine contract earlier
they are willing to take the risk with the ge warranties
this is a relationship issue
it is also their biggest issue
on an interesting note
intergen wants you to sign a consent to the transfer of all the equipment to sweetgum
do you know if lee knows about this
ciao
kay
this is preliminary
i'm supposed to get with our finance folks tomorrow to get it finished
this is ok to send to nw with that understanding
kay
good morning
please call these folks and see if you can set up a meeting of the east development team either tuesday or wednesday
ann elizabeth white carlos sole kathleen carnahan barbara gray jeff hodge the meeting shouldn't last more than 0 minutes
please reserve us a conference room on this floor
thanks
kay
i think lima would make a great bobble head
you better get there early
i received an email from alfons telling me he was resigning from technip
i'm clueless why he sent it to me
talked to gerry last week
he says he is going to put his kingwood house on the market
hmm
i hear lots of the old gang is working with him now
have you gone to your reunion yet
how was it
gotta go home but i didn't want to not write back today
hope you find all your easter eggs
kay
this should be it
please circulate
including lee
thanks once again
kay
hi warrren
could you please print all of these attachments for me
thanks
kay
i hope this is the last version
stay tuned
kay
nothing from ben yet
if i don't hear from him in the next couple of hours
then i think we should be ready with an extension letter
giving them a couple of days extra for free
ben indicated to me last week that he would give them some time once they asked
mk called with questions on the assignment
nothing serious
kay
just in time for the weekend
i hope to take tomorrow off
by the way
paige is coming in tonight
and michael has the day off from school
kay
maybe having 0 kids and an suv makes you feel older
i'm tellling everyone that i'm taking off tomorrow
does that mean we will do the pre-pay
me again
i forgot to ask you to look at 0.0
0.0 and article 0 of the llc agreement
just want to check
kay
i don't know either
kay
i'll look but nothing comes to mind
these are the current drafts
not the ones i sent earlier
kay
we are getting close on this one relating to the blue dog turbines
i'm reviewing these drafts in detail
and expect that there will be another turn
just wanted to give you a heads up
kay
carolyn
i think we should tender by email
kay
thanks for all your efforts
and consistent responsiveness
i hope you have a great vacation
kay
i've raised some of the issues with nw
we are working on some of it
a meeting is a good idea
kay
please do
i
m on a long conference call
thanks
kay

this triggers delta's obligation to fund the escrow
which now must occur on or before april 0
if they get their financing in order
it will fund sooner
therefore
carlos is working on the drafts of turbopark documents

i would go with sheila's approach
i don't see a reason not to

i think this will change a bit
but it gives you some history
we had our daily phone call with nw
i don't know that we really have significant points of disagreement
they understand that we are working some accounting issues
and they have a general idea of what we want to do
i suggested that we come up with the work arounds with our accountants
and i will think about it this weekend
i have a couple of ideas but i really want to mull it over
they look forward to receiving the turbine contract
chris
could you forward the draft change orders with it
one point they raised is that they want the ability
with ge consent
to have us refund the future payment due to ge
less 0% for time value of money
retaining the payment obligation
all of this is post closing
they are putting up a full blown parent guaranty to ge for the turbine contract
and since the payment should only be around $0mm
that would probably be acceptable to ge
keffer et al will issue revised documents tonight
there are no calls scheduled tomorrow or this weekend
giving everyone
quiet time
to review the contract
other than the accting issues
this should be about it
we deferred discussions about an extension until monday
kay
here's the electronic file
i'm sure this doesn't matter
but i'm in jeff hodge/barbara gray's cost center
just so long as i get paid
0-0 was a vacation day
thanks again
kay
sounds good to me
i think we'll still have the breakout contracts
which are essentially finished
kay
fyi
steve should work with ms
clark to determine amount of payoff is required for turbopark
obviously
this is impacted by the date of payoff
we have discussed with ge et all the prospect of a changed order to the existing master contract for the new ones
so far
no one can find a problem with that approach
kay
fyi
i haven't read it yet
kay
i don't know if this helps
but here is the mdea charter info
kay
hi bruce
there's a christie patrick who is a vp of government affairs
i'm wondering if this isn't the same person you referenced
i don't know her
regards
kay
enron as the buyer or seller
i have an enron as the seller
kind of a weird deal
but at least it has most of the issues
but i can check around to see what else is on the network
kay
we have our staff meetings the 0st and 0rd wednesday at 0
i missed the last one
so i should make it to this one
kay
thanks
i've been trying to puzzle my way through this
kay
i don't think she's in
you might want to leave her a voice mail
i would like to sign up for the new garage
please
thanks
kay
0
one director 0
probably global finance
depending on the structure of the deal
0
i guess i see the question as the overall role of outside counsel in the transaction
good discussion item
kay
you deserve to be pampered
i hope it works out so you can go
i think it would be a hoot
kay
got it
hi there
i suggest a brief status call tomorrow at 0 central to assess where we are and what we need to finish
how does this time work for everyone
thanks
kay
that would be great
thanks
kay
0 pm
i wouldn't worry about the call
we are just collecting to do lists
i'm thinking a half hour
kay
carolyn will send out dial in instructions
hi there
i am meeting with ben tomorrow to discuss nwestern
i'm fairly confident that he will be willing to extend the letter agreement
but he hasn't called me back today to confirm
ms
kahn and i have exchanged voice mail
could one of you return her call for me
i'm tied up
you might get an idea on some times tomorrow for a call
i'm booked until around 0 for anything which would last more than a few minutes
i'll check with ben

vice president

hi reagan

hi rose
i hate to be a pain
but we are trying to sign up northwestern this week
and the last thing we have to do is the assignment and assumption agreement
any break in the log jam with mckay
kay
please print and put in folder
northwestern documents 0/0
thanks
kay
nearly final docs
the change they want in the llc is the addition of a statement indicating that for tax purposes this is a single member llc
or something like that
the promissory note is felt to be necessary due to the adjustment mechanism for any change orders
has something to do with them getting all the basis
kay
congratulations on your new adventure
i'll miss having you as a neighbor and a colleague
kay
can you sneak me a copy of the latest draft
maybe i can negotiate with ben
kay
no comment
you asked for the exhibits
kay
ever get the por info
hi guys
here's a list of questions as i'm working through mdea
actually
some are questions
some are reminders of things you were going to send me
receipt point
need def'n rr load info
i was going to plug in something
or we were going to have an exhibit to describe
rr off peak defn
rr transmission
we've added transmission services
but it isn't defnd
any suggestions
scheduling equipment
do we want to refer to the list
term
previously i was instructed to take out the evergreen renewal
now is it back in
if so
is the mechanism in the first draft ok
contracted resources
i've added in a def'n
we need a schedule
name
date
subject matter of contract
more questions to come
but i wanted to get this to you asap
reagan
you might want to look through the comments you gave me for more open items
thanks
kay
check
kay
what are you talking about
are you going to be a granny
where do you want this to go
someone
i think dave
asked that this be added
each day epmi shall provide epmi's native load projection
and gas and power projection
would it be a projection of mdea's native load
are we providing it or is mdea
by what time is the made and is it made 0 days a year
so now i know why sheila had a lock installed on her door
hi lee
just wanted to check to see if you will be around tomorrow
i'm trying to get things lined up on multiple fronts
and all roads lead to you
thanks
kay
you made a comment on page 0
it says
c
purchase of power
i think this is one of your comments
what does it mean
i'm on a conference call
so an email response would be appreciated
yes
hi warren
i'm going to forward a couple of emails relating to the delta transaction
please print and set up like you did the northwestern stuff
thanks
kay ps i'm on a long conference call
but feel free to walk in
here's a second email
another to come
re
my prior email
when you print these
please attach the email to the attachment
hard copy
thanks
gentlemen
here are some points which require commercial et al input
do we intend to include gas transactions in our calculation of profit
we will be buying electricity to serve their load
how should be be paid for those costs
how often
jim homco questioned whether we should buy the fuel oil
what do you want to do
i've added the definition of scheduling equipment costs
how should it be used in the agreement
are we limiting our provision of scheduling equipment to the equipment listed in the exhibit
what financial security will be required of them
are we attaching marketing strategy and trading/risk policy
or establishing a time line
how do we deal with the possible cost of establishing a control area
are we absorbing it
will there be additional infrastructure costs
have the exhibits been updated
if so
could i get the latest version
kay
hi steve
we need wiring instructions for the account that will receive the $ from escrow
it should be an account where money goes in and out in one day
can you track down the info
we are waiting for the lenders to comment on the proposal that they will close once we deliver our deliverables
stay tuned
kay
here's what delta would like in the salmon break out contract
how does it look to you
kay
is there anything we need to get them to consent to
kay
she called me
too
i'm not betting the farm on the escrow funding tomorrow
i'll manage expectations on this end
i don't want to let up on delta
however
i think she will have a great time
the moms and dads are very friendly
she'll probably know some of them
good idea
i wouldn't mind something that says that funding of the escrow is tantamount to closing of the financing under the letter agreement
so thatthe financing condition is satisfied
something to that effect
it willcalm jake down considerably
kay
here's the latest
not-yet-final-but-getting-better agreement
i may not have sent this to everyone who needs it
but i know reagan will take care of it
speaking of reagan
he is generating exhibits
kay
lisa mellencamp used to have a list of local counsel
kay
gee
one more item for your review
kay
any recruits
kay
thanks
cindy
i haven't given up hope yet
kay
i believe it is the e-next generation lv co gen contract
i believe the last draft was around the beginning of april
i can check for more specifics
kay
carolyn
i prefer that closing event #0 preceed #0
thanks
kay
oh why not
you probably need to get an overview of the entire deal
as you may want some outside help
if we are building a plant and selling power
there are lots of folks at enron who weigh in on it
kay
any comments
thanks
kay
looks good to me
could you email me the final form of the assignment/assumption
not compared
thanks
kay
hi there
here's the assignment and assumption agreement with the ge consent included
please let me know if you have any comments
thanks
kay ps
in discussing the mechanism to move the turbines
it seemed that it would work ok to assign the turbines out of the aip
i can't find a flaw with that approach
guess we might want to lob this one in to delta
just for fun
kay
please print and review to let me know if there is anything stupid in these
kay
can you help me with these
i need to get them fixed up today
thanks
kay
hi rose
northwestern has requested these minor changes
what do you think
kay
thanks for the offer
and the call
but i haven't been able to secure a sitter for michael
my schedule should be getting better
famous last words
and i hope we can get together soon
i would like to introduce you to carlos sole
if you haven't met him yet
thanks again
kay
yet one more round
it wouldn't be the same without you
0 nights out in a row would be a bit much for this ol girl
any other rumors
i have my ca expert
kathleen carnahan

kay
i'm available any time monday morning
the sooner
after 0
the better
thanks
kay
opps

hi jim

good luck
kay
please add this to the defn of confidential information
confidential information includes

business strategies

we will call it the
michael brown burn me twice shame on me
clause
thanks
kay
i decided to go a different route
what do you think
kay
i told jeff hodge that you were putting him on the list for baseball tickets
guess the pressure is on now
attached is the king
spalding power transaction deal team
i'll update the information i have for a
k and b
p
since some of the designated lawyers on their lists are no longer there
kay
well
aren't you the quick one
jeff is a terrific guy
well-respected in the legal department and on the commercial side
kay
hi clark
could you fill out this chart for us with names and contact info for the bracewell person
or people
you think would fit the bill the best
we had a list previously
but i believe some of the folks on it have moved on
thanks
kay
jhodge@enron.com i checked his business cards on his desk
he's left for the day to pick up a car at the shop
so don't be offended if you don't hear from him immediately
kay
i wanted to review where i think we are in this transaction
0
escrow account
we are still awaiting closure on the issue of the lender's security interest in the escrow account
a proposal was discussed with them to ensure that we could still close the transaction even if delta had defaulted under their loan arrangement
indications were that this approach was generally acceptable
and delta/hancock are to send a letter agreement concerning this approach
this has not yet been received
this prevents the establishment of the escrow account
we have sent the escrow agreement to the bank
but delta has not completely signed off on the agreement
0
ge turbine contract
delta sent requested changes yesterday
and these were forwarded to ge
i have not received a response from ge
0
miscellaneous docs
enron has responded to all the documents requested by hancock
we are awaiting responses to our drafts
0
ge consent
hancock requested some changes to the current draft
and a new letter agreement
ge hasn't responded to the requests yet
ge has dealt directly with freshfields
so it is possible that there are discussions we aren't involved in
i've left lee a message concernig the ge items and the timing of signing
carolyn
please correct/add anything you think is important
kay
0st group evalutes promotions to vp

kay

okey dokey
aren't you on holiday

kay
nuttin from nobody congrats on the ride

i didn't know if the seat or the feet give out first

i do think the banks
lawyers weighed in
kay
hi warren
hope you had a nice weekend
my weekend went too quickly
could you please print this email and the attachments for me
thanks
kay
michael brown
do you have the standard offer service agreement
it isn't in stuart's file
and it is referenced as being entered into at the same time as the ppsa
we need to see how these two agreements fit together
has nimo given the bidders access to the contracts listed in the schedules
we especially need to see the ones that they can assign to enron
pseg and nrg
given the size of the transaction i think we should have klauberg
or another new york lawyer
take a look at it
it is an interesting deal
kay
didn't i mark his up all ready
hi jerry
it would be helpful if the tax point person for northwestern could contact rhett jackson with enron
rhett's number is 0 0-0
thanks
kay
maybe next time
i understand that you are just back from holiday
so obviously this comes at a bad time
see you in sa
kay
i hope this is the last thing
here's the latest version of the contract sans these insertions
hi guys
is the lv co gen break out contract ready to go
lee johnson was asking this am
thanks
kay
in speaking with lee johnson this am
he mentioned that he is still missing final contracts for psco and ca development
i seem to recall that sheila had asked someone to pull this together
and that i had given kathleen the ca development stuff
i could be off track
but that's how i remember it
there's probably someone with a better memory
thoughts
thanks
kay
please confirm that the changes to change order #0 reflect nw's request
thanks
kay
needless to say i had a pretty good idea of the location of the bottleneck
otherwise
i would have called you
peggy banczak quit
she told me herself
so it must be true
you got it
i asked carlos if he still speaks espanol
you should have seen his face
he looked like he had swallowed a bug
lee
i'm reading your email to say that their requested changes are fine by you
please let me know if i'm wrong
thanks
kay

kay
hi wilson
i've decided that it would be helpful to have a brief written explanation of what limits of liability and waivers of consequential damages are permissable under mississippi law when contracting with the cities or an energy authority

ge has agreed to the requested changes to the parent guaranty
kay
moving forward
inch by inch
hi kent
these are some requested changes to the salmon a/k/a delta break out agreement
i'm not comfortable that lee has reviewed these
as the comments were previously forwarded in another email
in any event
we are looking for ge's blessings on this addition
it seems to me that we are approaching time to gather ge's signatures on the various docs
i will forward separately the email i received from our outside counsel with the final forms of everything but the break out contract
the assignment and assumption agreement and the ge parent guaranty
thanks for your assistance
the
ok
i give up

although we are likely to find different purchasers want other stuff as well

your opinion would be most appreciated
thanks
kay
hi theresa
i'm not sure if steve thome mentioned this to you
but enron is opening an escrow account in connection with a transaction with delta power
he suggested that i forward the wiring instructions for the payment of the escrow fee of $0,0
please let me know what other info you need to tee this up
thanks
kay
ed is the only one i've heard from today
i've forwarded his questions to our local counsel in mississippi for their input insofar as the questions involve capacity to contract
you'll be pleased to know that i understood his questions
i'm so proud
kay
jerry

kay
isabel
please confirm before 0 central this morning
when ge's rep will be in my office to sign docs
that these documents have final approval of ge's counsel
as i believe kent is not available to review documents today
obviously
i cannot present revised documents to a commercial representative of ge without knowing that his lawyer has signed off on the documents
except to the extent that the changes are obviously minor
kay
have a good trip
warren
the other party changed all those docs i asked you to print
not the ones in the book
the ones for the folders
so you can skip that one
thanks
kay
i guess we know now that they weren't waiting on us
since they hadn't finished the ge docs
kay
isabel
unless i'm missing something
two of these documents are the same
0
and we are missing the no objections to forms letter
kay
did kent review the changes to
h
of the consent agreement
re jurisdiction
kay
isabel
who is the
intial purchaser
and why are the documents dated tomorrow
thanks again
kay
looks to me like they aren't ready to close their financing
hope i'm wrong
hey
i thought you were out
i hope you noted that i was watching out for you
it would appear to me that the closing of the salmon equity sale will not occur until may something or other
so that the documents which are deliverables at closing should have may something or other dates
and not april
anyone see it any differently
kay
i haven't seen the escrow disbursement letter lately
is it circulating
kay
as i understand it
if the escrow is funded tomorrow morning
the earliest closing date would be may 0nd
kay
it is our responsibility to pay the fees
which i hope will need to be paid today
thanks
kay
for your review and approval
i have your signature on this one
i have the executed signature pages and the certificate of incumbancy
i'm going to print today's other ena deliverables and fax to jake for signature after i initial
kay
might close on the letter agreement today
you didn't miss much
mostly negotiations with ge re
change orders
our tax guys are happy
and accounting is hanging in there
we have revised the payment schedule in the doc
but nw doesn't have the change
i'll send it to you
the change is minor
i need to revise the assignment/assumption agreement
then we'll be ready to go when ge signs up to the co's
kay
per my previous email
nw doesn't have this change
redline of revised assignment and assumption agreement
kay
please delete michael miller
it would be helpful if i don't have to get the certificate today
as that entails signatures of folks in two locations
isabel didn't have it on her list
it is also helpful if the certificate is signed by duran or calger
kathleen
is chris calger an md or vp
thanks
kay

there were some comments which were either discussion points or not readily decipherable
so those will need to be addressed in the next version
there's still some harmonization/nit stuff which we will pick up then also
hopefully
david hunt
mdea's lawyer
and i will hammer out the more legalistic
yet important
stuff while he is in our office tomorrow
ed
maybe we can schedule a call with our local counsel to get some more comfort on the authority issue
in addition
we can ask for an authority/enforceability opinion from mdea's counsel
we'll beef up the reps as well
reagan/david
ed's availability is best first thing tomorrow
thurs
morning
see you soon
kay
hey
good questions
i'll check
will you be providing an execution version with questions removed/blanks filled in
please send it directly to kent.shoemaker@ae.ge.com
copy to me
thanks
thanks
kay
didn't go through the first time
kay
can you tell me to whom we send the originals
kay
hi estelle
have you or barbara sent the email etc out re establishment of the account
we are on a conference call now re funding
thanks for your help
kay
hi guys
delta has asked when the loc can be issued for the final payment
we have every expectation that payment will be made on may 0nd
and we will know for sure by later today
would it be possible to have the loc by tuesday
thanks
kay
salmon energy
fed ref now available
john
just wanted you to be aware
no action required
water under the bridge
kay
bill
i don't have any information about the abb contract
at last word
lee johnson was reviewing the latest version of the ge contract that pete thompson had sent out
kay
i'm about to fall face down in my computer
i'm not as young as i used to be
kay
fyi
dale has the lead on this one
thanks
kay
don't forget that global finance is supposed to review these
they have the turbine contract
this is none of my business
but the turbines are owned by enext
hows does the llc give the assignment
should the turbine contract be in the name of the llc
because it isn't at this moment
maybe i messed up
kay
thanks thanks thanks
this change really helps me with babysitter problems
thanks
kay
i would think that dale would have the legal lead
since he is the project's lawyer
lisa bills
roseann engeldorf and catherine clark are the people i send turbopark stuff to
kay
fyi
we are hoping to get together at 0 to continue to work on our interim gameplan
i don't know the location yet
kay
by the way
they have seen the turbine contract
this is the counterparties
first draft of the one month agreement
kay
you may have seen one of these before
fyi carlos is working on it
i made some comments/revisions
i'm not sure i understand the profit/savings
but i didn't take the time to contemplate it
i thought i did help
i'm lost
lee johnson just called to see when he can sign the agreement
i told him i would ask you guys
kay
glad you made it safely
i have a new home email address kay.mann@worldnet.att.net have a nice afternoon
and enjoy the cool mornings while they last
love
kay
the first couple of pages sort of explains whose on first
i may make the tour through the going aways
esp oz
i called the spa to make appts
but got voice mail
love
kay
starting point for exhibit 0
fine by me
i think you can send it just so he has the form
and we can figure out what we need to do with it
kay
many thanks
pardon my ignorance
but is there a list of riders to select from
the transaction that we are contemplating is with a municipality
so we need some muny language if such thing exists
thanks
kay
i think there's lots which will need to be fixed
i can't fix it now
though
here's where i am on the ila
i think it should be distributed internally and to the cities asap
with an explanation that we are still pondering it
kay ps
i didn't redline because there were formatting challenges i couldn't figure out
kay
we are going to do a one month deal while we work on the long term deal
talk to you soon
kay
terrific
have a great weekend
kay
instinctively it seems that the agent for concept would be stronger
i'll check into it for the longer term deal
obviously
it is a mississippi law issue
so i'll have to get an opinion
kay
this shows changes as if they were revising the doc that we generated on friday
here are the issues i see with their draft
does not allow for us to sell them power
only buy their power and sell to others
this means that we can't sell them power until we get the full contract in place
fuel transactions include fuel oil
and i thought we weren't managing fuel oil
incentive fee
in main contract
defined to only include the sale of gas
doesn't include the language we need for internal approvals
payment section doesn't address payment for sale of power to them from the market
hi carolyn
as far as i know
we are still on board for closing on wednesday
kay
consistent with my discussions with reagan
i have revised the body of the interim agreement
some of the exhibit references will need to be cleaned up once we know where we are headed
kay
i think we are supposed to do this tomorrow
monday
kay
i have a closing scheduled for wednesday
so i don't know when i'll be getting to san antonio
better leave me off the list
thanks
kay
kay
no
for future reference on the long term deal
kay
need exhibit b added
redlines are against most recent version sent by reagan
i've asked ge for the loc by wednesday
but i haven't gotten a response
i'll have difficulty getting executed docs by tuesday
since sigs are coming from portland
i'll have to check to see what can be done
kay
the problem is in getting the original in their hands
where
by tomorrow.does it have to be an original
kay
please confirm absolutely that fax signatures will be sufficient
i need the address of where to send the membership certificate
there is nenough time for the document to pass back through houston if the portlandteam wants to sign the documents
kay
i did
and it is fine
kay
hi ed
here's the language they offered
m
each of the cities has obligated itself to be responsible for and to payto
or on behalf of
mdea
if required
that proportion of the minimum monthly fee which that city,s hourly demand was coincident with entergypeak hour demand in the year 0 bears to the sum of both cities
hourldemand during such hour
provided however
that each city has further obligated itself to be responsible for and to pay that portion of empi,smonthly fee which the economic benefit to that city from transactions bearsto the total economic benefit to both cities from such transactions duringthe month
it is a bit cumbersome
but i think i like it
what do you think
i'll forward the entire doc soon
kay
during the term of this ila
epmi shall be entitled to be paid a fee for for performance as follows
i
epmi shall be paid a fee equal to the sum of 0
the incentive fee whichshall not be less than $0,0 and 0
a fee of $0/mwhr above the deliveredprice for purchases of off-peak power
the fee of $0/mwh shall not be included in the calculation of savings
and 0
payment for the deliveredcost of market power purchased to serve mdea,s and the cities native load in accordance with the transaction confirmation
individual transactions willbe confirmed by written confirmation to be acknowledged and signed by epmiand jointly by mdea
ycpsc and cpuc
ii
in the event that this ila is terminated early
the minimum monthly incentive fee amount shall be $0,0 divided by thirty
0
and multipliedtimes the number of days in may in which this agreement was in effect
iii
the incentive fee shall consist of forty percent
0%
of the total daily savings
total daily savings is the product of
0
the savings per mcalculated for the day
times
0
the total mwh for the same day of marketpower purchased to serve system load
iv
savings per mwh is calculated as the positive difference between
a
thmdea target production cost for units that would have run if market powerwere not purchased to serve system load
and
b
the delivered cost of market power purchased to serve system load
this is really just an excuse to write
did you give me the executed pages
thanks
hi guys
lee johnson is asking about the break out contract for lv co genn and when it will be ready
i need to return his phone call
especially since i need one more deliverable to be able to close the delta transaction
what should i tell him
kay
i think we will be able to get the documents you listed signed tomorrow
bujake won't be here before 0pm
so anything he is signing won't be ready until wednesday am
it seems to me that this isn't a big deal
but i would appreciate it if you could confirm
thanks
kay
i suspect they are accustomed to people wanting to structure for an mtm deal from a commercial standpoint
doesn't sound like our objective here
hi john
it would probably be better for me if we could reschedule
since i will be out of town wed-mon
rain check
kay
perfectly
thanks
i'll check
i remember signing the faxes and signing the originals
but not the return
however
last week was the week from hell
so i easily could have missed it
kay
here's what i have on my list as original deliverables ge turbine contract
any officer of llc amended llc
any officer of ena membership certificates
signed by md of llc
which isn't jake the only things i have which must be signed by jake are the written consentof the llc
which aren't on the original deliverable list
these will beready first thing wednesday am
i'm sorry
i don't recall you telling me that the original membership certificates had to be in new york on wednesday
however
we will be able thandle this
this pre-closing drill is why i asked for a definitive
signed off closinglist by mid-day friday
thanks
kay
carolyn
please revised the signature page for escrow instruction to reflect chris calger as a signatory
thanks
kay
you sound like carlos
good morning
in order to finish up delta/salmon tomorrow
please note we need the following today
ge parent guaranty loc
so that full payment can be made to ge tomorrow
opinion of counsel and once funds are received by ge
we need the receipt of funds letter
lee
i haven't heard back from the portland gang to find out if the lv co gen contract is ready
maybe jake can help shake that loose
thanks
kay
it depends on what time i get the signatures
if i can get things signed uquickly
i'll have them delivered to you in plenty of time for you to sendthe docs
i would prefer that it work that way
chris calger is in our offices today
a terrific break
now if i can jusfind him
plus
i thought i would have him sign the escrow disbursement letter instead of jake
since he's here
kay
duran is fine
i had it in my mind that calger had signed the incumbancy cert
my mistake
i'm trying to set up a closing table and have these guys sign this am befori lose them
kay
don't have it
but we can ask local counsel
if you can email me the question you would like asked
i will pass it along to our miss lawyer
kay
that would be better
although i will tell them that they don't get it until closing
kay
i've asked for it separately
second item below
did i misunderstand your question
i'm setting up a table with all the stuff for signature now
kay
kathleen is coming up to help me set up
how about 0
if you see kathleen
can you give her the membership certificates
i'll have a stack for duran later
kay
here's the long awaited form of option for your review and comment
i'm sending it to rose
lisa and catherine for their review also
thanks
kay
i'm supposed to go to the law conference tomorrow evening
may 0 it is
go go go
as we say at enron
please review numbers
any chance d
duran can come with you guys
we should be ready in about 0 minutes
thanks
kay
isabel and greg
i'm having a logistical problem
the only managing director of salmon is not in the office today
i can have the membership certificates signed by
0
a vice president or
0
the managing member or
0
elect a new managing director
what's your preference
kay
could you email me the last version of the turbine contract
thanks
kay
i know that ge recently had a small comment
technical or scope related
but i don't recall if it was before or after the 0th
i was unaware of tom's involvement
so i want to make sure the comment was addressed
i'm happy to hand the reins over to someone else to handle signature
i suspect i'm creating confusion as well
kay
if it will help
i will see if i can find the last version transmitted to lisa et al
so they don't have to start from scratch
kay
one comment which was taken related to the applicable change in law date
i sent this email from ge to dale/bill after i received it
since peter's last draft was april 0
i'm i assume this wasn't included
bill says he agrees and accepts our comments to the a&a
one change required to the rev 0 document
in exhibit b
add item
0
one additional human machine interface
hmi
per unit
desktop pc type
include these changes and we can get this done tomorrow
thanks
lee
this is the same version you sent today
right
done
i may be wrong
but i believe the version sent to day is the same one i sent to rose
lisa et al on april 0
kay
i think now we should all just log off email and turn off our phones
and let fed ex
the fax machine and citibank do the rest
kent
are you sending this
and the opinion and loc
to me today
i wasn't sure where this landed
thanks
kay
could you get me that cert of sec asap
i need to get this stuff to carolyn soon
kay
in conversations with ge
it is their understanding that their guaranty will not be transmitted until there is a fed ref number tomorrow
the opinion letter will be faxed as soon as the gc is available
or kent can sign for dan rowley if that is acceptable
drowley can sign originals on thursday
the loc is in the works
and ge understands that 0% will be retained in escrow until the loc is delivered
there will be three original opinions
there is one original guaranty
and i'm not certain of ge's willingness to give more than that
obviously
there will be only one loc
kay
i know michael wants to go to your apt this afternoon
if you do go there
just give me a call to let me know you're there so we can coordinate pickup
see you soon
kay
what do you think
general counsel
0 smith
room 0a
you are my hero
kay
john
i humbly beg your forgiveness for not calling you
now i owe you
i will check my directory to see what i have
as i recall it was part of some special scratch my back i'll scratch yours deal
although the details now escape me
seems like there were some minor defects which could be repaired while ge stored the stuff
so we let them put the stuff in storage based on their rep things would get fixed
kay
good morning
i haven't seen the insurance certificate she references
anyone know where it is
is the retention letter of credit available yet
i know it has been requested
but i don't recall seeing that it has been delivered
thanks for everything
kay
ignore my last email
lee
i'll rev up the austin facility agreement again
eric tells me that we arefine with adding the additional td of i to the facility agreement with a scope/price change
ignore the insurance certificate question
my bad
i've heard that the loc made it
so ge should be receiving payment in fulltoday
lv co gen is still moving
there are some of the turbopark stuff which wasin the agreed form of override letter
it is being actively worked right now
sorry about your trip
kay
looks good
jake thomas signed for us
so signature block on our executed version has him instead
please confirm that ge's originals of the documents they signed should be sent to
lee johnson ge packaged power
inc
thanks
kay
thank you so much
we promise to be good ambassadors for las
kay
herman
this is the document i called you about
ae is out-of-pocket
and has some questions about this agreement
so she asked me to forward the doc
this is a doc for a 0 yr ground lease for a power plant
it is my understanding that the counterparty is not interested in an option arrangement
kay
call me on my cell 0 0 0
i would like to move to the new garage
thanks
kay mann
the memo was very helpful
it would be great to meet in person and discuss issues
i'm out of town now
but i believe either the 0th or 0th would be great
thanks
kay
john
i suggest eliminating the statement in iii that we are proposing to perform the the market price servises in accordance with the terms of the market price service agreement
i realized that we have a disclaimer at the end of the letter
but the statement in iii seems to directly contradict the disclaimer
i am not confident that the statement that the enron structure is proprietary is sufficient to protect the information
i will need to check the confidentiality agreement when i get to the office if this is a real concern
i thought we weren't submitting a conforming bid
is there anything in the rfp which indicates that any proposal will be considered a firm offer
or anything to that effect
talk to you soon
kay
hi steve
good to hear from you
your right
my job is completely different
funny how things evolve like that
i love it
though
very few hurt/sick/deceased folks
paige is finishing her junior year at southwestern
and michael is in kindergarten at st francis
we are very blessed
hope all is well with your family
kay
deal killer
sounds fine
kay
perhaps it is operator error on this end
but i couldn't get this going
kay
well
here's the nearly final draft of what was submitted
evidently
we decided to submit a bid on the original transaction structure
as well as two alternatives
not what i was lead to believe before
i spoke with john about adding more disclaimer language to the letter to say that by submitting the bid we aren't agreeing to enter into a transaction or even negotiate for a transaction
also
i advised him that the confidentiality statements in the letter were not great protection
kay
sounds like gas to me
kay
i'd really appreciate it
thanks
kay
great
i'll come around in a bit and fill you in
kay
0 smith
morning would probably be better for me
kay
business casual is the order of the day here
ties are definitely not necessary
are you spending the night downtown
if so
you may want to just park at the hotel
lots of the streets downtown are under construction
so i'm a little hesitant to give directions
enron is located fairly close to the hyatt
and their garage is easy to find
enron just opened a new parking garage
but i'm not sure if it is open for visitors yet
alternatively
the allen center garage is connected to the enron building via an above-street walkway
if it was me and i was working and staying downtown
i would take a taxi
this is partly because i have an under-developed sense of direction
and partly because of the construction downtown
hope this helps
kay
i accused carlos of being a deal killer
count me in
how about commercial folks
fyi
certain aspects of this presentation will relate to ppa's/tolling agreements/interconnection studies and agreements relating to enron developed generation assets from which we intend to purchase power
etc
the cost/benefit would probably be marginal for you
but i will be there
and will get you any interesting handouts
kay
i can give up my seat and sit in with the commercial team
if that helps
team
i think we should make a list of issues today
pete will be a big help
if we are to the point of deciding critical issues
i believe sheila's input is essential
and worth waiting for
i'd still like to sit in when my commercial team hears it
if possible
plus
i suspect we run the risk this week of getting very bogged down
the attached file is a draft of an asset management agreement prepared by stu zisman
the later version obviously contained more negotiated points
so i think this one is more helpful
i'm working on a transaction now which involves serving load as well as selling power
i found this one helpful for issue identification and exculpatory language
however
kay
wilson montjoy will be in our offices
probably starting around 0 or 0
any progress
kay
no
i believe it is one of teco's subs
but i'm not sure
this gives you the gist of it
since it was a ge generated letter i will need to check for the final hard copy
eric
did you have any comments on the turbine contract for austin that i sent you
obviously
before we can execute a change order we have to execute a contract
thanks
kay
hi pete
we will want to get the cofa contract fixed up shortly
i don't remember if we have addressed these issues
i do think that ge may resist the combined cycle language
and i don't suggest including it
eric
can you still live with that
thanks
kay
hi john
i left you a voice mail
but thought i'd try email as well
the language that they added to paragraph 0 raises some issues since they want to restrict ena and its affiliates from future potential transactions
please call me at your convenience to discuss
thanks
kay
looks like we should see if lee is ready to go on this one
kay
refresh my recollection
did we
enron and northwestern
agree to the form of the escrow agreement
if so
then we will need to see if the escrow agent has any comments
chris is on vacation
ciaoing down in italy
sorry
couldn't resist
he should be the point man
though
on the delta deal we ran into some complications in moving money because citibank had the money invested in a money market account
does the current draft allow for that
i guess the easiest thing to do is to send it to me and let me see what's up
thanks
kay
looks like friday will work
please put it on my calendar so i won't forget
thanks ckm
you know i just can't remember that far in advance
probably the week of july 0th
nothing better than a free trip to sf
where will you stay
good suggestion
why don't you run it by george
and if you get positive feedback i'll suggest it to ben
kay
hi ben
imho
your team needs a basic understanding of the finance and accounting issues
legal should have a bit more of a developed
and probably current
understanding of how to address the issues
between development and legal
we should be able to get docs about 0% there
we then take the almost compliant docs to accting/finance for fine tuning
a key action item is getting a presentation set up where there is a good download of information from acct/finance to the development group
we had one yesterday for legal
and it was helpful
i want to sit in when your troops get the presentation
if at all possible
because i can help translate on both sides
i believe
i also want to make sure that development and legal are on the same page
fire drill avoidance is a key objective
look forward to discussing in detail
kay
hi
happy mother's day
i was kinda hoping for a post-graduation family event on that saturday
as hopes were raised when the ticket issue came up
doesn't sound like that's happening
i don't know when we will be up that way
but it wouldn't surprise me if we headed up sat am
that's memorial day weekend
so traffic out of houston on friday will be horrific
neil and i haven't discussed any details yet
though
paige is supposed to intern with the houston aeros this summer
no pay
which is a bad thing
she is currently on the way to colorado with some friends
and will be back a week from sunday
i haven't even mentioned mac's graduation yet
i just finished a really busy time
and i'm optimistic that things will resume a more normal pace
i hope to catch up on yard work this weekend
maybe clean out a closet
i have the urge to purge
i would say the katie got the clarke math gene
but paige is a math whiz
it must be a recessive characteristic
it is great that the girls have different arenas in which to excel
i sent mom a table top cactus garden
hope it gets there
no clue on what to get mac
i guess i should ask paige for ideas
if i get some good ones from her or mikey i'll let you know
love
kay
another point
how do we price gas/power we sell to them
especially in light of our duty of good faith and fair dealing
not expecting an answer via email
this is just a topic for further discussion
herman and rose
thank you so much for the presentation yesterday concerning accounting/financing issues in power development projects
the presentation was extremely clear and informative
the whole group stayed interested
which is a tribute to your preparation and delivery
kay
hi ben
how's about the acccounting/finance presentation at noon on may 0rd
then we can all go to the astros
game at 0
kay
how about 0
i think you'd better stick close to home and smile when she gets back
please calendar for me
i'm planning on going
it should go without saying that you are welcome also
kay
what do you think
kay
i don't know anything about shelby
but i take it that you don't think it impacts haywood at this late date
kay
looks fine to me
kay
john still wants to hold off on a document review
as we don't know if we want to go forward
kay
those bizness whites are the best
gentlemen
could we schedule some time for a conference call next week
i would appreciate the opportunity to work through some of the legal issues
i have the lofty goal of not working memorial day weekend this year
so i'm trying to get as much done on this deal as soon as possible
thanks
kay ps
i'm open tues am and most of wednesday
i can probably work my schedule so that i'm available quite a bit of next week
wilson
good morning
what is your availability this week for a conference call with david
thanks
kay
hi jeff
did you want stacy to take a look at this
kay
hi there
i believe chris should be back today
so i wanted to follow up on this
i don't have any recollection of where we left the escrow agreement with nw
please get with mkahn or jerry deberry to see if we can get consensus on the current form of escrow agreement
once we have that
enron
chris
will make contact with citibank
thanks
kay
hi john
enron is ok with signing the consents
after the assignment of the contracts out of llcs
we would like to exercise our put
please share this info with george
i believe ben will be in town tomorrow
right ben
so we can get it signed up this week
thanks
kay
how does this look
kay
john
i made the changes you suggested
the prior version contained a non-circumvention
you can't pursue the project without me
versus the current exclusivity
you must work only with me
which seems somewhat more restrictive since it would keep us from bringing in additional participants
i've changed language in the next paragraph to avoid a contradiction
if we go with this approach then i suspect we will want to work on an loi which divides up responsibility going forward
let me know what you think
kay
are you available any time this week
we are getting down to the nitty gritty
kay
hi there
do you have to be a licensed claims handler
or a lawyer
to handle a third party's insurance claim
same for selling insurance
thanks
i do recall the conversations you and i had
actually a series of pages
i believe
so i'll check with rebecca and see if she still has those signature pages
kay
fyi
i've reviewing at heather's request
kay
gentlemen
i'm with ews legal
and i'm working with john llodra
east power origination
concerning a confidentiality agreement with ameresco
the proposed transaction is described as follows
a potential power plant site development and asset management services related to the island end generation project
a nominal 0 mw combined cycle power generation facility
proposed to be located in everett
massachusetts
the current draft of the ca contains this language
from the time of the signing of this agreement until october 0
0 neither party shall pursue the proposed transaction without the participation of the other party
unless the other party consents in writing or notifies the other party that it does not intend to pursue the proposed transaction
in accordance with policy
this issue is being submitted to you for your review
john can be contacted at 0 0 0
my extension is 0
thank you
kay here is the entire ca
i've received error notices
so i'm trying again
kay
i thought of you yesterday
i planted an eggplant plant and a pepper plant
what a great weekend
i lived outside
what about you
hi catherine
would it be appropriate for me to call karl or someone to try to get the original docs
i have this urge to get something off of my
to do
list
and this looks like a good candidate
thanks
kay
it is carlos
territory
please review for compliance with this month's rules
thanks
kay
carolyn
ge is calling for the original turbine contract
i believe i previously provided lee johnson's address
could you send him an original
thanks
kay
i've tried sending this 0 times
please see if you can figure out the problem
i've used the autoaddressing and his long internet address
if all else fails
just print and have it delivered
i guess
or send it to his assistant
thanks
kay
tom
i agree that this helps
we can also put something in to indicate that the price we sell to them may not be the same price we bought from a third party
depending on market conditions
something like that
kay
three glitches he probably just changed over to outlook
hi dale
did you just do a tolling agreement re
lv
i'm looking for forms
and thought i'd check
thanks
kay
nothing fatal
here are some thoughts/comments on the ama for your general consideration

i've previously been advised that corp performs this function

are we helping them get eeim's with the approved counterparties

sounds silly
is there an eeim in the works between epmi and owner
0.0
f
i suspect by now you've figured out profits
etc
relating to
day of
transactions
0.0 last line
should it be interruptible instead of contingent
assume owner has transmission risk
is there a
no third party beneficiary
clause
i might have missed it
not life or death
interesting structure
could i get a copy of the final document
thanks
kay
me too
it is my filing system
carolyn
your approach makes perfect sense to me
but i think lee wants his turbinecontract sooner
i still haven't received the finance stuff yet
i've asked again today
kay
hi ben
i've been working on the letter
but i've got to fill in a bunch of blanks before it is finished
proper names
etc
depends on how complete you want it to be
i've got to check to see if this is the final version we agreed to
it is very close
here's the version northwestern approved
letter to follow
kay
in addition
we can add language that says we are specifically not prohibited from
and list what we care about
kay
hi rebecca
i'm trying to locate the sig pages for the nw guaranty
these were the docs that i approved after i had approved the letter agreement
these signed pages weren't with the letter agreements and change orders you brought me
to you remember if you brought them to me before
i haven't really searched
i thought i would ask first
thanks
kay
is this what you were thinking about
tam pham
ma'am
thanks for the clue
hi stacy
i don't know if jeff or debra mentioned this to you
but this is a master we need in place in connection with a gas/power asset management arrangement with the cities of yazoo city and clarksdale mississippi
as you can see
jeff suggested you take a look at it before it is sent to the customer
thanks
kay
i figured it would
the master is now in the hands
or on the email
of stacy dickson
one of the gas lawyers
let's see if we hear anything by noon
kay
ps
you might warn bob p
that this is coming
and needs top attention
we can send it to his lawyer at the same time
if he wants
i think it is someone other than david
though
can you find out who he wants to receive the draft
thanks
kay
fyi
stacy just got the draft this am
gotta love the passion
can we swap days with charlotte and go tomorrow
we need her to pick up michael if we are going to go together
it is worth a try
but it would be unusually generous of the power systems group to go along without push back
at least now we will see where we stand
did herman leave you a voice mail telling you that getting ge to sign off like this wouldn't do the trick
i'm guessing you've decided to appeal
kay
i will
john
i noticed a different file name on this draft than the version pete thompson sent out
how is this version different from pete's
i sure hate to have more than one version of this monster being vetted at the same time
thanks
wilson
you should get a call from suzanne
my assistant
we're trying to set things up for thursday am
how does that look
kay
due to the size of this possible transaction
i thought i would keep you in the loop on its status
we submitted a bid with caveats as to its non-binding nature
and suggested an alternative structure
in response
navigant issued questions
john llodra has compiled answers
which appear to be fine to me
we
legal
have been instructed to standby
awaiting commercial guidance as to whether we will be going forward
i believe klauberg has either cleared conflicts or initiated the process
so if we go forward
he should be our man
i will let you know once a go/no go decision is reached
kay
herman manis will need the opportunity to review
also
opps
i didn't notice c sherman's name
i'm unclear as to whether herman needs it also
hi matt
i understand that john rigby sent you a draft of the standard turbine contract
just thought you should know that it will be a e-next type doc
thanks
kay
hi there
i am attaching for the group's consideration a red line that i ran comparing the current working draft
v0
with the draft john r
recently circulated to tax and insurance
i suggest that pete thompson keep the typewriter on this
we are getting so close to the end
i would really like to try to avoid confusion
i am also attaching a clean copy of the current active version
and the current list of issues under consideration
i suggest we work through this list and turn another draft before soliciting cris/herman and lisa's comments
we should also give the ena commercial reps the opportunity to review it at that time
kay
please prepare sheila and i notebooks with the following emails and attachments printed
all located in my ge general email folder
stephen swift may 0 re warranty stephen swift may 0 re performance tests thompson may 0 issues list thompson may 0 agreement version 0 thompson may 0 exhibits thanks
kay
sheila and i discussed using the time at 0 cdt for an internal discussion
bringing her up-to-speed on the issues and discussing action items
nothing set in concrete
though
kay
i have michael's name pinned on my bulletin board at work
so he is in my thoughts and prayers daily
good luck
kay
john
after considerning what you told me about the job
and what you didn't tell me
i've decided to decline the job you aren't offering me
kay
fyi
i have a call with wilson and david scheduled for thursday am
i'll defer to sheila on timing
fyi
maybe i should take this project if we want to keep ae
kay
looks like 0 friday
may 0th for a status/download meeting
suz
please find a room and notify folks and their assistants
thanks
kay
i have 0 minutes at 0
0am meeting
i think we need an internal review to develop responses to positions as outlined in pt's memo
kay
hi there
we need the exact name of the yc entity which will be buying the gas
is it yazoo city or the ycpc
or what
same info is required for clarksdale
although not as urgently
if you will email me the addresses of all who need to review this
the yc contract will be ready tomorrow
thanks
kay
absolutely
i took a crack at tightening up the e next assignment language as it exists in the overrides
for inclusion in wh form
peter
could you take first cut at the override letter
we may be having an internal meeting at 0 central
and if so
will you be available by phone if necessary
suz
please put the attachment in the notebook
thanks
kay
i have a conflict at 0
rose has been reliable at showing up and participating
so i suggest that she be included
although it sounds like she
ll be with john
anytime 0-0 friday if fine
between 0-0
0-0 today
almost anytime friday
other than 0-0
hi kara
michael has been seeing a speech/language therapist
and recently she raised an issue about michael's ability to
blend and unblend
sounds in words
specifically as it relates to reading readiness
she had this conversation with neil
so i don't know the details
we are meeting with her today to get more input
but i wanted to mention it to you
just in case you had a comment
i know this is something we can discuss at michael's conference on may 0st
but if you would like to discuss it before hand
i can be reached at 0 0 0 0
cell
0 0
0
office
just tell my asst you are michael's thanks so much
kay
i knew you would figuer out something
otra mas
we'll need to change the date of the doc once we have an idea of when it will be signed
kay
taking asset management to a new level of pain
commericial vision is to form a joint venture with nrg to manage a portfolio of generation assets
i'm meeting with janelle et al at 0:0 to discuss what we want to do
kay
i suggested yesterday that you ask sheila about the timeframe
and you told me you would just go ahead and do it
i'll just tell her it isnt
ready
it doesn't matter to me
kay
i think that's fine
thanks for the note
i was wondering about that
no more than an hour
yes
wow
i haven't seen dan like that
thanks for the books
i don't remember a ppa for homestead
i'll check
though
kay
i'm remembering now
it was a term sheet which was never executed
as far as i know
i believe fpl prepared it
and we may have commented on it
let me see what i can find
kay
i've made some revisions the bill's document to make sure we are on the same page before i prepare the loi
do we want to give any sort of description of how the benchmark will be set
do we want to mention the cancellation provisions
thanks
kay
ben
here's what you requested
i do not recommend this mou
as there are several problems with it
is there something i can help you with
kay
are you here
i wanted to get those intergen consents done and out of the way
also
dduran needs to sign the northwestern guaranty
oz signed but they want more copies
and i thought it would be best if you initialled
well
aren't you hangin
with the big dogs
no big deal
kay
fyi
don't know if any of your folks ever attend this kind of thing
kay
i'll give it a look
hi carlos
just a reminder that you emails may be discoverable
especially when you include any
lay person
other than ben
i know you know this
but as a former trial type
i just can't help myself
kay
we aren't required to
but i don't see a downside to sending it
we need a confidentiality agreement relating to asset management services for intergen
we may have a confidentiality agreement in place
please check with k young
it probably won't cover this
plus
i think this should be in the name of epmi
reagan
what do you think
thanks
kay
this is still very early in the process
but some thought as to structure options for earning recognition might be worthwhile
kay
herman
i mentioned the bridge loan
and ben was concerned that it might be difficult to get that done before the end of q0
a topic for friday
kay
hi kc
it would be a big help if you could take the northwestern guaranty sig pages to marissa after d duran has signed them
thanks
kay
fairley loves bill bryant
however
bill have given us some bad advice re
florida siting act
marchris has the authority to hire who he wants to on regulatory side
but i wouldn't touch him for deal counsel
sheila has details
kay
it will take me awhile to find it
please ask linda simmons
hi there
i have not received my password yet
do i use the one from the end of 0
thanks
kay
can't think of anyone
by the way
bryant's bill should go to marchris
not you
marchris will know that
did steve s ask that it be added to the list
i would let them bring it up if he didn't
we spent quite a bit of time and effort on the lol clause
and it was subject to lots of give and take
kay
doug
here's the revised ca
i highlighted the changed terms
in addition
i deleted the prior paragraph 0 which said that the agreement supercedes a prior ca
i don't know if the intergen indentity and signatory are the same
but obviously i left that for you to determine
i expect that the enron entity which will bid will be epmi
so i used that entity
i beefed up the definition of confidential information due to the complexity of the issues
and i added 0 months to the term since things won't get cranked up for a while
i look forward to talking to you at your convenience
have a good weekend
kay
please prepare a bcc on the siemens letter as indicated below
i will be impressed if they can close by july 0
when they don't have their financing lined up on may 0
oh well
i'll send the assignment doc to js via email
ben
i'll be down shortly
kay
i would like to attend
thanks
kay
tell him he is dropping to the b list
it was sent via fax to her
kay
i like your letter
please print two originals of this ca
in my ca directory
intergen north america ca may 0 rev 0
thanks
kay
i have revised the option form consistent
except where noted
with comments sent by herman and lisa
and have attached a redline version
herman
i dealt with your comment regarding the defn of optionee by tinkering a little with the 0st paragraph
i also construed your comment regarding enron's right to terminate the option to not preclude termination if our counterparty is in default
please confirm that this is acceptable
lisa
i did not change the notice info since the first entity will the the project co
with ena legal receiving a copy
please advise if you have any comments
kay
this look ok
it will be presented to dave duran to execute monday am unless you suggest otherwise
kay
this is the most recent thing i have from ge specifically on lol and indemnity
our memories appear to be correct this time
unless i'm missing something from my file
kay
here's a rough cut
let me know what you think
the fuel cells will be subjected to testing after installation to ensure that each fuel cell meets the performance criteria prior to crra accepting the units
these tests will measure heat rate
electrical output
air emissions
noise levels and water consumption
and will last at least one hour each
in addition
a seventy-two hour test will be run to ascertain that each unit is capable of producing the required output without outages
the final test protocol will establish the number of tests to be performed
heather
there was a proposed asme standard relating to the testing of fuel cells
but i don't know if it has been adopted yet
if it has been
we could make reference to that fact that the tests will be conducted in conformance with asme pt-0
or whatever it is
i'm sure ric knows
kay
hi stuart
i believe the plant manager was going to call someone at sw
to keep the communication lines open
i'll be glad to draft a friendly letter to follow up
kay
0.0 additional factory testing
in the event that purchaser reasonably determines that a factory test conducted by seller or its subcontractors was not conducted properly or theresults of the test were inconclusive purchaser may required seller to repeat such test in a fashion as to obtain conclusive results
purchaser may request seller or its subcontractors to perform one or more of its factory tests using more precise instrumentation than planned
or conduct a test not in seller,s or its subcontractor,s standard factory test program
in the case of a purchaser request for an additional non standardfactory test the conduct of such test shall be subject to mutual agreement by the parties
in the event as a result of such purchaser requested repeat test
ormore precise instrumentation or non standard test the equipment is found to notbe compliant with the requirements of this agreement
seller shall correctsuch noncompliance and the cost and time associated with such testing shallbe to seller,s account
if the equipment is found to be compliant with this agreement
seller shall be eligible for a change orderfor the cost and timeassociated with such testing
reagan
i've requested the issuance of a draft master
gas
for clarksdale
yazoo has theirs in hand
but i haven't heard any of any comments
the power side is a bit more complicated
yazoo city and clarksdale have not cut a deal between them to determine how to buy power
whether it should be bought by mdea
easier in some accounting respects
but credit is more of an issue
or by the individual cities
maybe this should be on the list for our 0 meeting
kay
thanks
i'll discuss with carlos
i'm leaving now anyway
ben
i'll take a look at it today
you night owl
hope the kids cut you some slack after your late night
you're missing our last week of nice weather for the season
it was 0 degress this am
i'm taking herman to the game tonight
which will be wonderful in this weather
next comes 0 degrees
michael had his first soccer practice yesterday
actually a skills assessment to put them on teams
he loved it
his big sister and her boyfriend took him to buy soccer clothes afterwards
he is wearing his shin guards and soccer shorts to school today
too cute
hope you are enjoying your little ones
kay
hi david
either email or handwritten works for me
i would just as soon have everything now
if it is possible to get it to me in the today or tomorrow
in discussing the extension yesterday
the consensus was that we should extend until june 0th
if the deal gets done sooner
we can always have the new doc supercede the old one
i'm copying heather and reagan so that they can let me know if i've got it wrong
thanks
kay
one point you were checking was the ca
any luck
i called pulled off track on a couple of things
but i can get back to this now
billy fleenor says he has some thoughts on structure from a m-to-m standpoint
are you guys interested in having that conversation at this time
kay
please advise if you think this is ready to go to ge
if carlos has reviewed it i don't need to comment
since aewhite will be out of the office for the next two and a half weeks
i've volunteered for to cover her power development work in florida
just in case you don't have my numbers
office 0 0 0 home 0 0 0 cell as a heads up
i believe rose engeldorf
the global finance lawyer who helps us process documents
will be on vacation beginning june 0
anything which may need to be blessed can probable be done a bit more easily before rose leaves
thanks
kay
here's a free look at someone else's deal
i don't know what role enron has in the deal after sell down
kay
hi there
i need to get with lee johnson on another deal
and i know he will ask about lv cogen
anything i should tell him
thanks
kay
do you know if we had teco sign a confidentiality agreement
who is the counterparty to the participation agreement
i thought we were just sending out the public documents
thanks
kay
hello
i gave the matagorda county fair
livestock association $0
and filled out the form for the match
please advise if this has been paid
as they are sending me a bill for the $0
plus a finance charge
thank you
kay mann
anything posted on dealbench
lisa
i haven't gotten the executed docs back
but i'll send you the electronic version if that works for you
timing is as follows
northwestern gives 0 days notice of readiness to close
if the closing does not occur before july 0
they make another $0m payment
0 days after notice
they fund the balance into escrow
and we close 0 days later
if they fail to close on or before sept 0
they forfeit their previous payments
unless we have failed to provide the ge consent to assignment
which we are working on now
i've given this timeline without looking at the doc
so i will let you know if i missed something
hopes this helps
kay
did you tell her yes yes yes
bad kay bad bad bad kay
i'll do it now
i have a tolling arrangement to work on
i'm trying to get my hands on the black hills tolling agreement
can someone point me in the right direction to find it
thanks
kay
i'm on a conference call
could you call charlotte asap and review the plan for tonight
paige is in her car if you need her input
this ppa has a good overview of scheduling of power
no gas element
and was fully vetted with the power group
hi john
i believe ben jacoby has mentioned our deal with northwestern
in connection with that transaction
we have prepared the attached assignment and consent
which is patterned after the pastoria form
we would like to get it wrapped up in the next two weeks
if possible
please let ben or me know if you have any questions
i know a couple of their lawyers from a prior transaction
doug turner and their gc
whose name i've now forgotten
don't know who they will have on this one
i'm off to the astros
but would like to visit with you tomorrow
if you will be around
thanks
kay
greg
you can call me on whatever you have
including midway
sdec and medley dunn
if i have a problem getting to something
i'll find help
kay
here's what we sent them
i wouldn't use an llc with an prior history
we might have to get the old stuff approved in order to put the equity into turbopark
if the llc paid for an interconnect study
it could be a hard cost and we are dead
i know this seems silly
but hey
it is
question for the team
if it appears that we may have land which may not be able to stay off balance sheet
is it preferable to have the land held by a different llc than the project llc
with a lease to the e-next/obs compliant project co
if that is the case
what about the possibility of burdening the land with some low dollar hard costs
i don't have anything in particular in mind
it is more of a theoretical question
thanks
kay
how much is it and should this be the final amount
one thought i have is that maybe we can retool the option agreement so that we pay them a flat fee
which is enough to cover the expenditures
don't know if this works
but it is one thought
what do you think
kay
i'm on the phone with ge
their initial response to the assignment stuff is positive
they want a letter which sets out the ownership of the llc and what we are doing on payment
i've been working on teco term sheet
but i'm not sure i'll be done by 0
depending on this call
kay
steve swift and jeff darst
although jeff is off the call now
i was waiting but he did not bring it up
probably saving it
yikes
at the risk of making you crazy
i've come up with a suggested rework of the term sheet
as i was having horrible problems with formatting when i was doing revisions
now all i have to do is fill in the blanks
i'm ready when you are
could you email me the option agreement
i'm working
not a choice
a necessity
good night to grill
i've skimmed it
i see that the option expires august 0th
are we planning to renew it
if so maybe we can renew early and fix what we can to preserve some optionality
no pun intended
and cover the fee issue
might take too long to address the immediate issue
i don't see anyway we can get around the balance sheet issue unless we let the option expire and then reoption
but in that case the option payment would have to be smaller
acct says an option of 0% creates a problem as it would be considered a down payment
just fyi
kathleen
was the option recorded
or just a memo of option
or neither
i'm just wondering what is public info
herman is out of the office today
but i can discuss the fee issue to get his vote
more to come
here are issues which i'm unclear about
all of which impact the drafting of the agreement
how are we setting the heat rate
do we have the gads
is it a daily average
weekly average
flat rate
adjusted
if so
how often
are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions
we have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil
right
we aren't making money on gas
right
do we have a defn of costs that we like yet
and if so
how does it fit in to the picture
is there an up-to-date set of exhibits
it would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following
in words and/or formulae
the defn and method of establishing the bogey
target production cost
formula can be an exhibit
which would be great for the commercial team to work on
are we determined how we should deal with imbalances
part of cost of power
how are we setting the bogey
formula
subject to audit
two bogeys or one
gas and oil
what is defn of profit
i think i have the general idea
but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check
what costs are included on the buy and sell side
re stack model
a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used
updated exhibit on facilities
contracted resources
operating limits
what information does mdea need for us to provide in order to split costs/profits
are we clear that cities buy gas
mdea buys/sells power
it would be great if i could get one set of answers to these questions/issues
which has commercial buy in all around
thanks
kay
one project co is good enough
gentlemen
i've been told that the parties have agreed to extend the letter agreement until june 0
and that we will have a signed long term document by then
david
i would think i simple letter agreement should work
i can get it working from here
i'm working on what was the most recent form that i had re the long term deal
which should address some of david's issues
i'm not sure yet when i'll have it done
but it has moved up the list of priorities
talk to you soon
i'm sure
kay
hi
did the ca get signed and sent
and did it come back
thanks
kay
unless the first option expires
and the original premium is expensed
you add the original payment to the renewal premium to determine the percentage
if we can't beat the percentage game
we can have the land on the balance sheet and that won't put the entire project on it
don't ask me to splain that
because i can't
if the land is going to be on the balance sheet
you would think that it would be better to have $0.0 on than $0.0
however
one thing i don't know
haven't asked
is what the environmental restrictions are with our financing vehicle
i don't know if the land has to be clean before it can go into the vehicle
i can ask
if it is required to be clean
then you may be back to the $0.0 anyway
kay ps
feel like alice in wonderland yet
okey dokey
as far as i know the commissioning period we have in the current lm contracts still works for the lms
i haven't heard any differently
you just plugthose things in
right scott
from the owner/power seller standpoint
the predictability is more importanthan the time period
within reason
of course
no matte what we have onlds with ge
the penalty for not moving megawatts will be more
as for standard of conduct
do we have language in the warranty section abohow the service techs have to work
maybe something similiar would be work
the discussion shows that it is a good idea to get them committed to performing the td of i at the time we sign up to buy the turbines
way cool
i'd let reagan follow up
don't know the answers
we need to visit with herman manis to get his buy-in on an approach
i have a call in to him on another transaction
so i'll ask
are you in houston today
didn't really deal with her
hi greg
the agreement isn't attached
i do that all the time
looks like 0 today is good for all three of us re
option issues
we will meet in herman's office on 0
kay
who will/can sign the turbine contract for enron
thanks
kay
more
we need internal agreement on the cancellation fee schedule
to be included as an exhibit
what is the status of the yazoo city master gas agreement
do we still want a master gas agreement for clarksdale
also
do we want it now
thanks
kay
0
need details re item 0 below
please suggest language
band of acceptability
etc
which i will massage and incorporate
0
do i have the latest draft of marketing/risk policies
0
bogey calc only addresses gas
what if the fuel of choice is fuel oil
does the fuel cost and heat rate change
please point me to the defn of profit by cutting and pasting from wherever it is
i did a quick search and couldn't find it
but i didn't do a page turn to locate it
thanks
kay
question
do we have a schedule of assets to be involved in the transaction
i recall that janelle had some stuff that wasn't on the list
thanks
kay
calendar
please
here's the first draft re the deal which needs structuring help
please let me know when you are available to meet on this
thanks
kay
check out q and a #0 below
they all have it now
i thought you would enjoy this one
did you hear about the protest in enron's chicago office
0 acorn members stormed in
demanding that gregg penman fax a letter to ken lay
no kidding
i've volunteered kathleen to help process the paper
the other deal i did with teco had the same inhouse lawyer
he's just fine
glad i gave you such a glowing review
how depressing would it be to be at eecc
not a word
hi wilson
we discussed asking the counterparties for opinion letters
could you outline what you think we should ask for
or alternatively
just draft it
thanks
kay
absolutely
kay
please print all attachments and make a folder
tolling
enron tolling
thanks
kay
hi there
i would like to have one email with electronic versions of the letter agreement
and all the attachments except the turbine contract
thanks
kay
here's a first draft of the nrg loi
kay
thanks
did i tell you that i spoke with ge about the assignment
and their initial response was very positive
northwestern is predicting closing in july
kay
wouldn't it be nice to not have a fire drill at the end
at least we will be ready
i'm can't wait to see what their lenders will come up with
ben's hoping it will fall through and he can sell these again
i think
kay
yes
e-next
you might advise jeff that we will probably need a substitute kay
you might check the letter agreement re escrow and see what it says
never received a pass word
hi kara
i haven't written because i haven't figured out what we learned at the meeting
we can discuss next week at our conference
we are arranging to have michael re-tested
i think it is more of an issue of a difference between potential and performance
michael has been tested in the past
and tests as extraordinarily bright
but he has had some performance issues which don't match up
at least that's how i understand it
he just has some disconnects which we are working to overcome
but i must admit to not understanding it all
i left you a note about michael possibly missing next week
after i dropped him off this am
i had a thought that next week might be when they visit in 0st grade
in which case we probably wouldn't want him to miss that opportunity
i think he is excited about 0st grade
so you must be doing a great job of getting the kids prepared
thanks for everything
and see you next week
kay
my suggestions
schedule reflects amount due for cancellation on or before the stated dates
when i was at the site it said that it had sent a new password to me at kay.mann@enron.com
didn't get here
i give up
i don't understand the last sentence
it is too big for ben
maybe dave duran
here's how i would do it
llc and its permitted assignees hereinafter referred to as
optionee
a____________________________________
l.l.c
a delaware limited liability
this is consistent with option
revise like this and send out again to herman
thanks
hi ben
i've given it a quick look
looks a lot different from when i last saw it
i don't see a triggering event on the obligations in 0 a
was there another fix agreed to by all
maybe the
as required by law
language
also
any idea why the service charge language was deleted in b
maybe it isn't a problem
also
do you have a copyy of the site plan approval
talk to you soon
kay
tough question
what happens if they don't pay their legal bills
won't they have difficulty closing
we can pay their consulting fee up front
maybe we can pay it into an escrow account
what is our concern
they don't have to use lawyers if they don't want to
and shutts doesn't have to work for them if they are uncomfortable
obviously
shutts has the ability to quote an upfront retainer
i'm sure they've thought of that all ready
i guess i'm not clear on our level of involvement with their lawyers
i believe my availability is good for wednesday
kay
0st thing 0st
here's a draft of the extension letter
kay
herman blessed this letter
but i think it needs to pass through your hands also
kay
i've taken the liberty of drafting a form of extension letter to extend the ila until june 0
i suspect reagan will be distributing to the commercial folks
but i thought i would give you a heads up
david
i'm at work on revising the longer term doc
if you have your preamble stuff ready
i'm happy to put it in now
thanks
kay ps the salutation is to
gentlemen
are the members of the commission and mdea all men
i don't want to commit a blunder
congrats
i sent this on to the lawyer for global finance
turbopark team
also
as part of sop
yes
yes
and yes
you're on a roll
print job
please
how was your weekend
i had a good one
what is your preference when there is a conflict between the interim agreement and the last draft
v0
of the esma
for instance
the definition of ancillary services
shall i just ignore the ila
or does it represent the customers
expectations
kay
it needs to be sent to lisa bills
roseann engeldorf
and ben jacoby for approval
thanks
kay
i have a pretty cool portable play pen you can have if you want
this stuff is so much better than it was 0 years ago
it is amazing how things have changed
did you know that they now tell you to have babies sleep on their backs
that is totally different from when paige was a baby
it was hard to get used to
kay
so have you figured out how to use the portal from home
i just discovered it yesterday
while at the office
we went to arlington for my nephew's high school graduation
which was fine
sunday we had dinner with dan lyons and spouse
which was wonderful
yesterday i cooked
shopped
and puttered in the yard
got the last caladium bulbs in the ground
i like to wait until they are on sale
the weekend just flew by
they
say sleeping on backs reducing risks of sudden infant death syndrome
go figure
at least you can see their beautiful faces while they sleep
car seats
strollers and diapers are 0x better now
especially the diapers
yesterday i had a feeling that your grandbaby is a boy
just came to me in the kitchen
i have a 0/0 chance of being right
when i was in austin i used an
above the water
pedal kayak
talk about easy
neil is talking about us renting to see what we like best
the above the water is more stable than i expected
i had assumed that it would be tippy
but it really wasn't
hope you have high water and not hell next weekend
need defn of above
sounds good if you would like to forward to counter parties
i've sent a draft to their counsel all ready
d hunt and hemleben
rogelio
congratulations
that is quite an honor
regards
kay mann
i need a heather deal to work on
good luck in conn
kay
i have a note on my calendar that michael has an appt with ss today
has it been cancelled
i'm available any time friday
and tomorrow afternoon is fine
especially after 0
kay
well
that's something i hadn't heard before
they should let that be known
don't you think
at least now we know it
kay
please email me a brief overview of what these documents are
how they fit into the overall picture
and the issues which need the most scrutiny
additionally
have these been evaluated in light of enron's balance sheet and financing issues
thanks
kay
this place is more difficult than it needs to be
i don't know if david hunt will have comments
in any event
marvin
bob and the mdea rep needs to reveiw it
reagan has my current requests
kay
i'm thinking my last email was unclear
i assume that someone from the commercial team will send
or has sent
the extension letter to mdea
yc
and clarksdale's commercial reps for their review
i assume that the commercial reps with yc
mdea
and clarksdale will get whatever legal input they want from their own lawyers if they think it is necessary
may not
but as a courtesy
i sent drafts to the two lawyers i know about
kay
figured you did
but better to be safe than sorry
could you email me the list of issues you have encountered thus far
ben really wants me to check with you
i'm so proud
kay
both of these are capitalized terms in rev 0
is there a difference
load projection model is in definitions
but load forecasting model is used quite a bit
done
yes
however
i could use an electronic version if one is readily available
i have the pdf
thanks
kay
anytime which works for you is fine
as this is more important than my other meeting
chris
the docs you sent me that i asked about are titled
declaration of covenants
conditions and restrictions for midway grove
and articles of incorporation of midway grove property owners association
inc
i'm a bit unclear as to how the attached relate to those docs
but i must confess to having not read all of the previously sent documents or the two docs on this email
it would help if you could connect the dots for me
thanks
kay
for calendar
especially 0
how's glenn doing with my binder
lots of midway activity this week
thanks
kay

i'm all for the limo taking people home at that time
i am concerned about michael and about imposing on donnie and lynn
are you taking friday off
kay
if it were me i'd go for the standard limo
mostly because i've never seen the other kind
i'm desperate
help
we have a meeting with duran et al today

i'm not doing a good job of time management
so yoga is looking doubtful
i would like a copy of the pompano beach and deerfield site plan approvals
please
thanks
kay
here are my initial comments
there's no clear triggering event which would expedite the internal approval process
for instance
paragraph 0 is a current obligation
re landscaping
it would be easier to process this agreement if the effectiveness of this agreement commences when we file for a building permit
i understand that we would have to pay some of this prior to the time the permit is issued
but again
magic words help
paragraph 0 on right of first refusal for power
looks like a free call for the next 0 years
just want to make sure you've bought in on this
other than the obvious valuation impact
it could impact a purchaser's ability to obtain project financing
kay
how do i get on the list for the form
could you pretty please check for me
thanks
kay
this place amazes me
thanks for your help
i have no patience for it
we went to michael's school conference today
his teacher raved about how everyone just loves michael
he is so sweet
he is staying with my folks this week
and the 0 of us miss him so badly
i can't wait for him to come home
neil is going to meet my folks and michael in palacios this friday
and spend the weekend there
bringing him home on sunday
i've got to take roscoe for his last mange shot
so i'm staying
plus
i spent last weekend with my folks
and too much exposure doesn't work for us
i hope to purge the house of all the junk i have
i hope it is raining
because that is great cleaning weather
i want to see bare space in my closet
i think i'll call the women's center and see what type of stuff they need
i'm planning on taking next thursday and friday off
next thursday is paige's 0st birthday
so we have great plans
do you know anywhere that can enlarge a photo and mount it on a board
i still get a bill for the card they used previously for my phone
go figure
i need to send off my tx tax and bar dues today
i'll want to fed ex
just in case you are sending anyone else's today
thanks
kay
yes
because they are deducting pretax dollars for parking
so where are you kayaking this weekend
i would mention carlos in the email
or have it shown as sent by him
if it were me
and not him
i would have you send it under your own name
but explain that you are helping carlos
thanks
but i'm throwing away junk all weekend
neil will be gone
maybe it is on the development phone list
i don't have it at hand
i've got the crib
a playpen
red and blue check bumpers for the crib
a never used airplane baby swing you hang on a trees
our trees were too tall
perhaps a jogging stroller
don't think we gave it away
and i don't know what else
all have
baby carnahan
on it
will she give the baby her last name
that would be cool
i met someone
a guy
named kayne
yes
i know it looks like kay
but i thought it sounded cool
kayne carnahan
opps
sounds like a bull rider
i'm still waiting on david hunt to send me some stuff
which would really help move the document along
i'll ask again if i can get it from him
there are still internal questions in it
which i have annotated
i'm happy for you to look at it fairly shortly
especially if you can give definitive commercial direction
do you feel that the commercial team is finished with the exhibits
i haven't worked on them
but i suspect the exhibits need work
i know the bogey calc doc is a bit rough
do you still owe me the emergency transmission cut stuff
early next week is better than later
and thursday and friday are huge problem days for me
when are you thinking of meeting with beck
anyway to combine the two at once
given the short timeframe
has dave signed the extension
by the way
kay
it should be signed and on its way
i've heard that they are trying to schedule a meeting for monday
so i'm trying to get a draft of the agreement out
do you think you will have a chance to send me the preamble stuff
i know it doesn't seem like a big deal
but i will feel better if i understand who's on first
so to speak
thanks
kay
that reminds me
there used to be a
gift department
that blessed such things
i don't remember where it is
pr
i wonder who would know
how cool is that
i can't locate the electronic version of costs that david prepared
can you resend it to me
what about this
is this the qse defn
scheduling entity0 means an entity contemplated to be recognized by spp
and fully qualified under spp rules and regulations
to schedule the transmission of energy
capacity and ancillary services from the facilities
thanks
that means it is recognized
not
contemplated to be recognized
then
ithere such a thing as a recognized scheduling entity
or do you just scheduon their behalf
please fill in the blank
first contingency transmission outage0 means
if there are any other resolutions
etc that they want
i would let them prepare them
thanks a bunch
kay
you're killing me
we have no definition for first contingency must run
isthis the same as first contingency emergency dispatch
yes
thanks
yes
i'm officially in elizabeth's group
i need to ask her for a flat screen monitor
i just like to make margie work
so do you think they'll fire dierker
i guess you heard lima is heading to the bullpen
you know es doesn't work fridays
so that takes away one day of opportunity to approve them
plus she hasn't had an assistant
maybe things will improve
she is very excited about her new assistant
here's where i am
i haven't finished all of your changes
please look for bold stuff
that's where i have questions
if no question is given
i'm looking for your confirmation
good afternoon
i am circulating a draft of the long term agreement for your review
there are still holes
but hopefully it sets out the basic commercial deal
please note that we are anticipating a monday meeting
therefore
we have sent this out without the usual internal review
we hope to have a set of exhibits shortly
talk to you soon
kay
have i signed this yet
hi greg
i just wanted to mention that if we are going to bust the percentage rule on the option payment
there is no incremental damage in having the option payment credited to the purchase price of the land
as for officers of the development company
i would use dave duran
ben holds a power of attorney
but isn't an officer
hope you get email
kay
hello
the commercial team has asked that i forward this document to you for review
it is a development agreement for a project in florida
we have attempted to address the accounting/e-next issues
but please advise of any desired changes
thank you
kay ps pardon the formatting
it will be cleaned up by those with the ability to do so
hi there
is the site plan approval a different document than the development order
thanks
kay
please calendar for me
i give up
how in the world did you jump to that crazy conclusion
hey
you're on vacation
no working
i think ben's time frame is realistic
i assume we will enter into an assignment and assumption agreement with sithe
to which ge will consent
in addition
we may need an override letter to the turbine contract to address the e-next/accounting issues
ge is familiar with what we need in for e-next
which should help expedite matters
kay
steve
merchant energy ventures doesn't have auditable financials
but northwestern corporation will give ge a corporate guaranty for mev
let me know if you run into difficulty verifying their financial status
as i'm sure we can get you something
in addition
enron north america will have the responsibility to make the future payments to ge as these payment obligations exist as of the closing

mark haedicke approved the hiring of king
spalding for this matter
i will drop mr
derrick a voice mail
but i would faint if he objected
john
we need to talk about the sale of the llc
and the generation of a draft doc re same
please let me know if you are available today to discuss this transaction with sr
jacoby and me
additionally
it would be helpful to discuss the tolling arrangement with ken
thanks
kay
i haven't heard anything from david or scott
have you heard anything from marvin or bob
is there a meeting confirmed for monday
i'm on another conference call re landfill
yikes
kay
elizabeth
i would like to have a flat screen monitor
if possible
thank you
kay
well
let's try someplace else
what can you think of in walking distance
it is a lunch for a new lawyer in our group
kay
attachment contains overview
ben
i made a minor adjustment to the loi re
exclusivity
policy states that any time we sign up to exclusivity we are supposed to get it approved by mark metts
tim detmering and the ceo of the affected business unit
seems a little silly in this case
but it can't hurt
yes
i know we didn't do it with the turbine stuff
kay
you are referring to the purchase and sale agreement
right
i'm not asking him to do anything on the loi
i haven't spoken to him in person
i'll address it when we connect
are you available this afternoon to talk to him with me
kay
i don't believe we need keffer's input to process the loi
i can have their power guy look at the term sheet if we think we are done with it
fyi
please read
i need the name of the other party involved in ft pierce so that john can clear conflicts
i can't open the form
but i'm good for $0
is this something enron can match
enron is trying to buy some ge turbines to use in projects
fyi and ken's review
no offense
john
good luck
hi billy
can you take a look at this since the hermanator is out
thanks
kay
as requested
here is the current draft of the midway loi
the counter party has not seen this draft yet
so this is still preliminary
i'm reviewing the term sheet re toll
kay
david
do you know if we are meeting on monday
i haven't heard the final word
kay
kathleen
john keffer
bill parrish and andy schifrin need access to midway on deal bench
can you handle this for me
thanks
kay
i'll work on them over the weekend
if you insist
very out of date
but indicative of the current structure
stay tuned
hmm
not typical
reorg
i hear oz will be there
too
how fun
another puzzle piece
much grass
i vote for you
any first class upgrades available
i'll be there
too
attached are draft of more of the exhibits for discussion purposes
see you tomorrow
kay
i believe i land in memphis around 0 central
i'll try to call in if mycell works
kay
i can't find any call in info for the conference call on monday
i may be reachable on 0 0 0
or maybe someone could leave me a voice mail message at the office if there is a dial in number
thanks
took about 0 months
a new record
i was in clarksdale yesterday
and have a dr's appt this am
but will be glad to give you what i have
in fact
i could use some help with the eei if the offer is still good
maybe you could just talk me through it
thanks
kay
wilson
we are trying to finalize this transaction by next tuesday
and i could really use your help
i believe you owe me a draft of an opinion letter
also
do you have any comments to the draft agreement i sent out last week
i also need an opinion that the language in the agreement re the cities obligation to financially support mdea is sufficient
thank you
kay
just a reminder that i have a drs appt this am
nothing special
just one very overdue check up
kay
very good
i was in miss yesterday and have a doctor's appt this am
i'll call later
kay
i go back for more tests this afternoon
thanks for the info
rest well
is this for the escrow or other docs
i know citibank does not require a corporate seal
what bs
kathleen is out sick
so it will be a day or two
kay
gold rose today
nope
only the new ones
i can't make the call on thursday
i'm not sure that sheila can either
i'll leave the go/no go enron vote to sheila
kay
next time you vote for me
please copy me on the email
kay
i haven't read this yet
so it is not ready to be sent to teco
just wanted to give you a look as soon as possible
kay
sometimes john forgets that he is not a lawyer
i'm available for one hour
so long as i can call in from off campus
i'll need a new cell phone battery first
my old one finally died a tragic death
kay
maybe i'm wrong
but i don't think we've done that on the other two deals
kathleen would know
for something that doesn't matter
it seems to matter
i wonder how well the auto approval works when you are backdating something
how much involvement has a
k had on midway
i have other counsel engaged for the sale
but this falls into a different category
kay
ben
if christi has reviewed an interconnect agreement
i ususally don't have outside counsel review it unless there is a specific reason
she's the queen of interconnects
i suppose that after i review it
next stop is finance/accounting
carlos has given me a couple of comments
kay
please advise which comments you are willing to accept
skipping the nits and legal stuff
one response from the group
please
kay
it is father's day and we will do what you want
if you want to go there
that's great
i'm happy to tell tom
his wife and all the world that what we do that weekend is 0% up to you
it sounds like he has the impression that i'm the hold up
kay
got it
wilson
we are running short on time
we are planning to sign on tuesday
and i hesitate to put a new document in front of them at this late date
would it be easier to work with reps/warranties
i definitely need an answer from your firm confirming
0
enforceability
0
obligation of the cities to financially support agreement
also
could you provide me with the mississippi law defn of consequential damages and a couple of examples where enron could be responsible for same under this agreement
also
can mdea and the cities be liableto enron for consequentials
absent a waiver
your comments to the previously forwarded draft would be greatly appreciated
kay
yes,which is what prompted my email this am
i'm looking for a way to simplify the process since closing is less than a week away
i'm in 0-0
0-0 today
kay
please print two copies
on the stuff you had copied for me
please have the copy sent to john keffer at king
spalding
i'll keep the originals
thanks
kay
i should have sent this to you
sorry
might save time if you got financials from mike re
northwestern corp
kay
amazing that they stayed afloat
0 year history probably helped that happen
kinda sad
though
i liked those guys
i received a fax in yesterday
so i'll review it
kay
billy
it is expected that by the time the hard costs referenced in #0 are incurred
the project will be in e next
or its successor/take out vehicle
since construction will be nearly complete
costs incurred in #0 should be phase 0 e next costs
since this should be in the construction period
although it could be immediately prior to that time
lisa
i skipped rose on this email since she is out of town
and reviewed this agreement before she left
kay
yes cant miss those boxes
awaiting test results
you know how that goes
i give you details later
i may go
i'll let you know
figures
no
he thinks he is god's gift to contracts
neil
i thought you were going to tell her to just answer that he gets nothing at school
she has no independent information on the rest and shouldn't worry about providing that info to them
sounds like it
but it is in southern florida
i didn't think you were being difficult
fyi
one of ae's
ge wants a letter outlining the structure of the deal
at the 0 ft level
who owns which companies
and who has payment obligations to them
could you draft a letter to that effect for my review
thanks
kay
attached is the master gas agreement
ready for clarksdale's review
we haven't had any feedback from yazoo city
when can we expect their feedback
thanks
kay
0 months goes by quickly
how polite
life being what it is
i've received a mark up of the tolling term sheet
which crossed in the mail with the mark up you sent
kay
looks fine to me
will you accept the changes and send out
i would like to receive a bcc of whatever goes out
if possible
thanks
kay
lloyd is a good guy
he is head of the services group
he probably does other things as well
but that's how i know him
i can send it to lloyd if you want
kay
teco tolling
with my comments
could i get a copy of the revised loi which was sent to teco
i want to update my electronic file
thanks
kay
greg and ben
so is it about time to get lisa
herman and rose involved in the pad stuff
kay
never stayed there
my current favorite is the omni
which is in one of may favorite locations
it has a little deli like shop across the street
where i can buy reasonably priced bagels
cokes
etc
last year i also stayed at the marriott marquis
big
right on times square
and the mark
too snooty
i stayed two other places i didn't like
but the names escape me
i've seen some other smaller hotels which look nice
and if i check a map i might remember the names
kay
don't know how i missed this
must have put it in my midway file without looking
thanks
kay
i've answered all their questions
and have suggested to chris that he ask northwestern for audited financials
marissa is preparing a letter which briefly outlines the deal
since ge had requested a letter identifying the parties
the payment obligations
etc
i've given them all this information previously in phone calls and by email
but i think they want something official looking
probably be a good idea for you to sign the letter
i don't think they will trade payment for a consent
but i could be wrong
it just isn't enough money
and ge isn't strapped for cash anyway
i'd want to be careful that we don't trip up on e
next obligations
kay
when you ask a question you usually have heard a rumor
what did you hear
don't know if i'll participate
but please put on calendar anyway
would you read that to mean the authority to buy power
as agent for
the cities
seems not entirely clear but not entirely out of the question
kay
i'm working through the
agent for
issue
and thought i would share the info
i've asked our local counsel for a bit more direct answer
ie
his opinion
kay
as i understand it
if the option is exercised
and the property bought
prior to the time the llc is owned by enext
there is a balance sheet impact
why would you ask a question out of the blue
harlan murphy started last week
nice guy from dynegy
put the land on the balance sheet is a forgiveable sin
incurring any other type of hard costs puts the entire project
whatever that may be
on the balance sheet
kay
i think asking david the question is a good idea
kay
correct
if all we were doing was buying the property
you wouldn't have the timing restriction
you lose one layer of optionality
i'm no oracle
but there would be no current balance sheet impact
david
is it possible for mdea to purchase power from epmi as an agent for the cities
this will obviate the need for any type of security
thanks
kay
whatcha think
hi gerry
i don't remember anyone signing a notice of lien in arizona
i remember seeing a bunch of lien notices
since they have to send a notice even if payment isn't due yet
i always thought that was strange
and sure created clutter
i can't remember if there was any requirement that we sign
does dewey remember
if you didn't sign and dewey didn't sign
that doesn't leave many folks who would have done so
i guess they could have changed the laws
though
sorry i'm not more help
i've forgotten more than i've remembered
if you are near town this evening
we are celebrating paige's 0st birthday at keneally's
staring around 0
i'll buy
i can't believe she is 0
very disruptive of my self-perception
ciao
kay
please calendar
i have a phone number on a post it note on my cabinet
just to the right of where my computer would be if i was there
it is a lawyers name
which of course i can't remember
male
with a 0 or 0 phone number
it may be david something or other
could you email me that name and number
do you know if there is a way for me to save my emails that i have in folders
bet the weather is better than this in san fran
kay
there's nothing special here
just cloudy
i took roscoe in to get neutered
neil just couldn't handle it

your kind thoughts are appreciated

your voice cheered me up

thanks for the plant
that was so sweet
kay

hi
i'm planning to drive back today
and will take tomorrow off
i
ll need to come back soon
but i think it is time for me to go
thanks for all your support
it has made a big difference
kay
i will have to check to see who handles the paralegal hiring
what is up with ene
i
m still in fw
kay
ok
i have 0 minutes then
marisa sent the invoices
today has been hard for me
i don't have the distraction of taking care of mimi
i am going to gob to work tomorrow
but i dread it
you are welcome in palacios this weekend
of course
love
mom
i have lotus notes emails which i can't forward since we've migrated to outlook
kay
hi eric
i'm back in the office
and am working on this deal again
seems like there are a couple of items which need to be obtained so we can go forward expeditiously
specifically
we need copies of the following documents
lease agreement between ces and ust
nortel rtu terms
bankruptcy order allowing the sale of the switch from tcp to ces
i can speak with us telenet's attorney regarding these requests
if you can get his/her name and number or email address
i know there are some other issues
but getting these documents will really help
thanks
kay
if i'm remembering correctly
it could be connecticut
that narrows it down quite a bit
here's what i got from eric on the lease
the numbers don't seem to match
but we won't worry about that now
the nortel rtu info is supposed to be here by wednesday
sherry
please make the few changes to the draft equipment lease tammy previously prepared to incorporate the new terms
to the extent necessary
just bracket any questions you have
especially commercial questions
we won't tackle the security agreement or the license agreement yet
just send the revised lease to me
not eric yet
please see if you can find the bankruptcy proceeding
if the docs aren't available on line
please get back to me before incurring any additional expense
i don't want to spend a lot of money on this until things become a bit more clear
thanks
kay
i signed up for the nov 0/0 risk management seminar
and i wanted to confirm my registration
thanks
kay
let's wait until monday
i was trying to remember what bobby said
can you remember
tied st jerome 0 to 0
they played dirty
michael hung tough
he played goalie almost the entire game
rosco was great
we are on the road to palacios
love
mom
i received word that the switch deal is off
thanks anyway
just got this
i know several who work there
john keffer is the one i know best
we went to palacios to fish
it was very nice
wonder what next week will bring
i would not say that we are
near junk status
on our credit rating
i called her office and they told me
what time friday
what's his name
do you have a handle on what she was working on
i wouldn't want to bother her about anything
kay
i'm sure she had things put together well
thanks
kay
it appeared to me that a gsa would be most appropriate for this work
in speaking with some other ebs lawyers
i was told that adriana could craft the work order/addendum to go with the gsa
please let me know if this is incorrect
kay
will you incorporate the provisions of the document that brenda forwarded
kay
feel free to ignore
i'm talking to adriana now
i'm happy to look at another format
this was the one michelle gave me
kay
i predict that we will not prevail in an objection to consolidation
judges love to consolidate unless there is a compelling reason not to do so
a one month delay will not be enough to persuade the ajl to not consolidate if you consider the advantages to the judges
so we would need a better reason
do we have anything else to go on
i don't think the margate issue is enough
either
i doubt we will have the settlement buttoned up by the second week of december
which could leave us in the position of needing to continue the hearing until january anyway
kay
the document below contains the guts of the tasking letter
i believe
the gsa was in the other email
the gsa
without name and address
could you forward me the tasking letter once you are done so that i can understand how the pieces fit together
thanks
kay
ok with me
thanks
good to go
haven't done anything with it since there hasn't been any activity
if we think that we want to do something
it would be helpful to get a copy of the master
i don't think i still have a copy
i can probably look it up on spotlight
but if you have an electronic file handy i would be most grateful
kay
kerri
could you call me about these at your convenience
thanks
kay
got it
does genuity know that we want some changes yet
for sure
please print and make file folder
genuity
for ebs
thanks
kay
i'm big on the blackberry
i will be late on day one
i haven't heard anything on this
i'll wait to hear from steve and mike
kay
ok with me
getting warmer
could you send me an email with a brief description of how you see us marketing their energy
day ahead only
how do we work together to set the bogie
i know on the mdea deal there was an agreement on how it was calculated
including an agreement re the heat rates of the various units
is this a gas only facility
how do we handle the transmission costs
or will we be selling the power at the same spot they are delivering it
are there minimum units of energy they will start their facility up for
thanks
kay
i think i get this everyday now
can you help get this cleared up
thanks
i think in this case specific is better
also
please check with k young to see what is in place
we don't want to look bad to dyn
hi there
we need to get to closure on how to respond to motion to consolidate
and how to deal with the 0 vs 0 issue on deerfield
shall we try again for a conference call later today
karri is available up until 0:0pm
central
thanks
kay
obviously
we barely survived without you
kay
can you have someone set it up
including kb and ryan reitz
thanks
kay
i'm disappointed that ge didn't call
must not have wanted to take the enron credit risk
i think we will also need to report it to the merger legal team
which i will take care of once we know what is up
kay
i checked the docs
closing is supposed to be 0 business days after notice
subject to regulatory approval
i believe they will need to make a hart scott rodino filing
it should not take very long for to get it
seems delta got it in a matter of days
kay
hi carolyn
could you resend the docs
our computer system deleted everything more than 0 days old
thanks
kay
i'm supposed to talk to ben and steve today
will you and kb be around this afternoon
sounds good
i gave the ip transit deal a quick look
and it appears to me that what we need to do is prepare an amended confirm
with the capacity and price varying
depending on the month
may want to revisit the starting dates based on our letter agreement
please take a look at the confirm and see if there is anything else you think we need to change
i suggest that we make a capacity/price schedule and attach it
amending the confirm to refer to the new schedule
what do you think
kay
i think fmv is probably less than fifty
thanks
thanks
it would be terrific if i could see the tasking letter before i give final approval to the gsa
since this is really a one-off deal
and i will need to approve and initial both the gsa and the tasking letter
thanks
kay
should be here
kinda wish kortney would have talked to me and cc'd me on this
does this happen much
don't know that i have a big problem with it
but it just seems like it isn't purely a credit issue
what do you think
kay
and me
ben
i need to get you to resign from the montana megawatts bod
will you be in this week
if not
we can handle it with fax/fed ex
kay kathleen
please prepare a letter of resignation for ben
leaving the date of the letter as november ___
thanks
i will have to find a form
if you think the deal will extend more than a couple of months
or could develop into something bigger
i really suggest an eei
once i find a form we can determine if we need a separate services agreement
or we can bake it into the gtc's/long confirm document
kay
we don't want to pay them until we get agreement to the form of the docs
i don't think much will be required
but i just want to make sure it is coordinated
kay
they've changed the cogentrix deal
in fact
it is even a different cogentrix counterparty
i couldn't find the long form/gtc in the power forms
can you help
guess you would like the name of the counterparty
i'll send it to you
thanks as always
kay
thanks
the closing docs are on top of my cabinet
near my name plate
help yourself
thanks
kay
cogentrix eastern carolina
llc
ruth
could you print theirs and ours for me since i may not make it to my desk before i come over
thanks
kayne and rahil
please give this term sheet a look and advise of any changes you think might be necessary
for instance
it gives the delivery point as the cpl/cogentrix border
and not the bb of the facility as kayne suggested
i am drafting off of the term sheet
so your input is very important
i need the name of the generation facility and approximate number of megawatts we will be marketing for them
also
are we still planning on dealing with some ppa's they have
if so
what will our involvement be and how many more megawatts are involved
are we only going to pay cogentrix after we have received payment from the third party
if they fail to remit other costs
transmission
for instance
i presume we will want to deduct that from what we owe them
what other costs might we need to be reimbursed for
what are resource costs
how often will we email or fax them a sales summary
will we be reporting to whom each delivery of power was sold
kortney
please confirm that credit will not be requiring any particular language
etc in this deal since we aren't using an eei
thanks for your help
kay
where are you
i'm on 0
probably tomorrow
i got a feeling that dave would like to visit with you about it
dismal here
how are you
they are supposed to give no less than 0 business days notice prior to closing
the earliest notice i saw was nov
0
i counted the 0th
0st
0
0
closing on the 0th
page 0 of the amended and restated llc agreement
kay
jerry deberry called
and asked that chris call liz evans to get a handle on the correct number for the wire transfer
once it is agreed
please send me an email with the revised number
we were working off of different receipt dates
i received the fax on monday
and they believe it was delivered here the friday before
that is the reason for the different expectation on the closing date
dave duran would like to be advised before the transfer is made
i presume that chris or ben will take care of talking to dave so that the transfer can be made tomorrow
thanks
kay
i have asked for something from ge indicating that jeff d
had the authority to sign the consent
i would think that this shouldn't take very long
please print email and attachments
thanks
john
there is a $0 charge from ct corp
on invoice #0
re blue dog
can you send me an email with a brief explanation
i want to get this in the queue
ciao
kay
in hindsight we should have had them pay it
oh well
got your fax and will check in to others
does that look right
lorie says it is a wbs code number
greek to me
gentlemen
pursuant to my discussion with mr
swift
i am enclosing a draft letter for your review
kay
hi jerry
steve told me that he had asked whoever he spoke to at northwestern to take steps to extinguish the letter agreement that enron and ge regarding the transaction
i have prepared a letter to that effect and sent it to steve for his review
basically it just says that enron doesn't have any continuing obligations to ge under the previous letter
before we release the funds we would like to get an executed
revised letter from northwestern concerning the revised set off amounts and final total to be wired
my fax number is 0 0 0
i did not have the certificate signed
but will dig it out and see what i can do
quite frankly i just overlooked it
kay
the form was fine
kay
the power is executed
i just need to get the cert signed
have a good evening
hi ben
it would be great if you could expedite the invoices
thanks
kay
i was having trouble with the system last time i tried a couple of hours ago
i'll try again later
will do
and thanks
kay
no need to hold off
i'm not worried about ge
i need dave to sign one more document
is he around
how do you like your new digs
kay
dynegy is getting a very nice building
see you in a bit
hi kathleen
would you mind printing this letter on letterhead for ben to sign
i'll be over in just a bit
thanks
kay
looks good to me
jeff
what's your suggestion
we are looking at a pa in connection with tennessee pipeline's open season
did i get that right
i'll ask jeff what he thinks
i only have 0 in my box
and none were the ones i gave you
thanks
have you faxed the docs yet
last time i checked i was told that the wire was in the queue
kay
i'm talking about the member interest power in particular
we don't have to have to send them the darst stuff today
i have another piece of paper that dave needs to sign as well
yes
but since we signed the power it seemed that someone else would actually execute the certificate
by the way
it was certificate #0
so i changed the language in the power to reflect that
closing list
0
power
executed by dd
0
certificate
as is
0
darst letter
waiting for ge to sign
copy to be sent to nw later
0
letter regarding setoff
need to have wdd sign
0 and 0 should go to northwestern today by fax and fed ex
0 and 0 can go tomorrow

thanks
i have made spa appointments at urban retreat west for friday afternoon
beginning at 0
in the interest of moving things forward
it would help if you could provide the following info
0
hand-marked copy of the portions of the current contract which need to be changed
0
a brief description of the new deal
especially the index language
i know vepco may be preparing a first draft
but i think it would be good to get some focus ahead of time
kay
and that's what it's all about
good
gives us something productive to do
we are considering submitting a bid to provide standard offer service to commercial and industrial end users
can you tell me if epmi is licensed to provide retail service in maine
if you aren't the right person
who should i ask
thanks bunches

i'm bored
my pleasure
thanks
could you send me the format you are using for your resume
kay
thanks
my 0 format is a bit out-of-date
so how come no one will buy for $0b
i just couldn't help myself
i see they've halted the sending of replies
i will see if you should prepare them anyway to send tomorrow
here's the list of what we have so far
i'll give you the letters and debra is in charge of the files
it may be we don't have to look at every contract to get this done
kay
we should also have forms they previously approved
since we have negotiated a couple of ca's with them in the past
r u going to call
you might check with the bank
my paycheck should have hit by now
new program
the only termination notices we are responding to are those with termination payment calculations
some of the letters were something other than termination/suspension notices
so you might want to check to see if you think we need to reply for other reasons
kay
good op ed piece
there will be no holds barred with the times and the wash post weigh in on this one
yes

unbelieveable

including the mexico stuff
have you inherited peoples
enovate
yet
i suspect there may be a default there
i'm helping gather some of this info
and your help would be appreciated
thought i would ask a more specific question
do you know of any transactions which enron may be in default due to recent circumstances
i'm excluding trading deals
maybe some of the asset management deals
joint venture companies
enovate
thanks
kay

i think i still need the data sheet for this corp

yes
john is picking us up in 0 minutes downstairs
still not resolved
at the risk of asking a stupid question
are we in breach under the project agreement
i didn't comb it
but i also didn't see anything that screamed breach to me
if we have a paid up call on 0 mw
that is probably something we would want to preserve
more to consider
are you still having yours
understood
i think kayne needs some help in working through mdea
kay
they are talking termination
which may not be justified for the asset management deal
don't know whether that would be a good thing or not
i would like to cancel
thanks
kay mann
i'm in a meeting but will check when i get back to my office

thanks
kay

i stopped by to ask richard or lisa

i picked the one with the smallest retainer and the lower amount

it would be helpful to see the lease and the letter before commenting
thanks
kay
probably until 0
the lease is freely assignable
the lien rights are based not contractual
but exist in texas law
i used to have some info on texas lien law
don't remember if i still do
i haven't worked a warehouseman lien issue
however
in general it is one thing to have a lien
and another to be able to foreclose on it
especially that quickly
in short
i don't know if whatever morris is saying they will do in the timeframe described is permissible
rigby
you have any info on warehouseman liens in texas
still looking for a copy of the letter from morris
my fax number is 0 if someone has it handy
thanks
kay
that's fine
i found $0 coming to me
stuart had a suggested change
i'll email it to you
i will tell them
thanks
in a couple of weeks
neil has been asking around
can't get anyone at enron to think that far ahead
i hate doing this
but i owe it to michael
since i really want to keep him in private school
we've already eliminated his speech therapy
geez
i sound pathetic

emily
thanks for all of your help on this
bill
raquel
look under my general file in the j drive
there should be a folder labeled
fast track
in that folder
there should be a document titled either
fast track swap agreement
or
swap agreement
there could be multiple drafts of this document
so use the one with the most recent date
the amendment that i think you're referring to was not signed
we sent it to starwood and then nothing happened
if you can't find a hard copy
you can call rell tipton at v&e and ask him to e-mail you the latest version of the starwood amendment that he's been working on
if you can't reach rell
his assistant
birdie cortinas can probably help
rell's number is
0
0-0
hope this helps
thanks for sending me copies of the pleadings in the enforcement action that we've filed against socal gas at ferc
just a quick question
should we initiate a state court action against socal gas now so as to minimize any claims that could potentially be cut off by the applicable statute of limitations
i notice that the controversy goes back to 0
it may take a while for ferc to resolve this
have we concluded that even if ferc rules in our favor we would have to file a separate action in state court to enforce our rights under the transporation agreement
s
with socalgas
even if we file a state court action now
socal gas would probably argue that the state court action should not proceed until ferc reaches its decision
i don't know how strong an argument this is
but even if socal gas keeps us from moving forward with a state court proceeding
would merely filing suit in state court stay the statute of limitations
i'm sure you've thought through these issues already
i'm just trying to get up to speed
thanks
raquel
could you please have my expense report folder hand delivered to me

deborah
the latest commodity agreement amendments were not yet filed in the binder
they were signed right before i left
however
i gave those to raquel as well
so you should have them
as i mentioned this morning
maureen palmer also has copies
maxine
i'll be in the office all of next week
bill
yes
i already have a call into her
any objections to mary kay's suggestion
if not
i'll probably need the help of one of you in contacting jeff mcmahon
actually
there was one new development late yesterday
frazier wasn't entirely comfortable with having andy fastow in that role in the first place since he may have had access to transportation/capacity information in his capacity as cfo of enron corp
the same concern would
of course apply to andy fastow's successor
that was why frazier had suggested cindy olsen
i spoke with mary kay and told her about this concern
she understands
but continues to feel that we should be able to come up with someone who is more substantively involved in enron's underlying businesses but who does not have access to transportation/capacity information
i'll work with frazier to see if we can identify someone
so
let's hold off for now in contacting jeff mcmahon
i'll keep you updated
thanks
joel
yes
i would start with michael
he did a calculation a year or so ago when owc first filed for bankruptcy and should be able to update that
another source is maureen palmer
who
if you haven't met her yet
is the ees business person who is responsible for the owc/ees relationship
you should probably speak with maureen in any event to get her input on whether ees really wants to pursue this claim
when i spoke with her about this several months ago
there was apparently a difference of opinion among our business people on this
good luck
let me know if i can help on anything else
i have no idea
i have never heard of these swaps
i don't know when these were implemented
presumably after we signed the original deal
although i don't know
apparently
the people on our trading desk dealt with the customer without getting legal input
scary
you may want to check with jim keller's/mike smith's group to see if anyone there knows anything about this
this is a test
drew
steve harris and the other transwestern commercial people are seeking guidance on what limits will be imposed by the new credit facility on transwestern's dealings with affiliates
most notably ews/ena
will it be necessary to obtain the consent of the lenders before transwestern may enter into any transaction with an affiliate
are there de minimis exceptions
are there any plans to obtain pre-approval of either certain categories of transactions or transactions up to an aggregate dollar limit
any feedback would be greatly appreciated
thanks
steve and kim
i spoke with drew after the staff meeting today regarding what limitations would be imposed by the new credit agreement on transwestern's dealings with its affiliates
most notably ena/ews
drew said that this and a number of other issues are still being negotiated and that it's not yet clear where we'll wind up
obviously
we'll try and negotiate as much flexibility on the affiliate issue with the banks as possible
drew indicated that the agreement should be finalized in the next day or so and that he would issue guidance on this and other issues as soon as it is
paul
attached is a red-lined version of the eog interconnect agreement
which reflects some minor changes that i made
please call me if you'd like to discuss the attachment
chris
good to hear from you
i didn't bring the starwood documents with me when i moved
can you believe that i forgot them
so i'm going off of memory
i believe that we are obliged to at least offer lease financing to starwood if the conditions precedent to financing in the lease documents are satisfied
however
we do have the ability to pass through increased costs of capital that we incur as well as other appropriate costs to starwood
hope things are going well
mark
great to hear from you
the last few weeks have definitely been a difficult period
i still can't believe it
i'm doing fine and actually think that things are beginning to stabilize
so
how's the baby doing
and how are you doing
john w
called about a week ago and said he thought you were doing well and seemed to be enjoying your new job
i guess it's not so new anymore
you definitely made the right decision to leave stratum
as you've probably heard
they haven't been able to raise any money and now plan to liquidate
i think they're down to four or five people in new york and about the same number in houston
my address is as follows
0 camelot lane
houston
texas 0
again it's really good to hear from you
best wishes
oh yeah
in case you haven't already seen the following movies
i highly recommend them
run lola run
german with english subtitles
and
memento
american
both are available on videotape
also
if i remember correctly
you like classical music
so you might enjoy murray perahia's

recording of bach's goldberg variations
take care
denise
thank you very much
i just got off the phone with someone from technical services and i think
knock on wood
that the problem is solved
thanks again

greg and maria
attached is a first draft of the response to the protest filed by the cpuc
i'm also sending a copy to steve sojic and frank kelly
i thought we would get your feedback
as well as that of steve and/or frank
turn another draft
and then distribute it to the business people on monday
there is absolutely no pride of authorship on my part
so please don't hesitate to comment
also
given the relatively short amount of time that we have to file this
i haven't prepared all of the footnotes and citations yet
steve and frank
attached is an initial draft of a response to the protest filed by the cpuc in rp0-0-0
i would appreciate any input that you have
thanks
attached for your review and comments is a draft of a request to ferc to extend the period allowed under the red rock certificate for the abandonment and replacement of the compressors at station 0
my understanding is that we need to request a one year extension as to station 0
but not as to the other three compressor stations included in the red rock expansion
due to the fact that we haven't fully contracted for all of the capacity authorized by ferc
your comments would be appreciated
thanks
glen i should have included you on the distribution list
sorry
attached is a draft of transwestern's response to the protest filed by the california public utility commission in docket no
rp0-0-0
your comments would be greatly appreciated
i have gotten some additional information from mark on usgt's use of westward capacity
which i haven't had the opportunity to review or incorporate in the attached draft
from what mark has told me
it further supports the statement in our response that usgt has not made significant use of its westward capacity and that the cupc's claim that transwestern is being transformed into a pipeline that is dominated by shippers using negotiated rates is greatly exaggerated
we need to file the response on wednesday
therefore
i would appreciate receiving any comments by noon tomorrow
thanks
at one point
we considered using a bill management agreement for consolidated container
i worked on this with erin stus
we came up with a draft that i was fairly happy with and it should be the latest draft under my consolidated container file on the j drive
if you can't find it there
give erin a call
she should still have a copy
attached for your review and comments is a draft of tw's response to the protest filed by the california public utilities commission of the latest negotiated rate filing
keith
if i understand your change to the second paragraph correctly
the new compressors at stations 0
0 and 0 will be completed and placed into service within the one-year deadline in the ferc order
the removal of the existing units at those stations
however
will not be completed until six months after that
my general feeling is that as long as the old units are taken out of service by the one-year deadline and are no longer operational
we should be ok and don't need to ask ferc for an extension
the ordering paragraph from the ferc order requires that the new facilities be placed in service within one year from the date of the order
it does not impose a similar deadline for the abandonment of the existing facilities
i take it that we would not operate the old and the new facilities at the same time
i.e
continue to operate the existing compressors after we've installed and placed into operation the new compressors
since this would result in tw operating compression in excess of its certificated capacity
as long as we don't do that
i don't think there's any need to ask for a separate extension for the abandonment
attached is a revised
red-lined version of the extension letter
i believe that i addressed keith's question to his satisfaction
so i haven't added the additional language that he suggested regarding the timing of the removal of the existing compressor units at stations 0
0 and 0
please let me know if you have any additional comments
thanks
what's a good time for everyone
i'm open in the morning
thanks
attached is a revised draft of the letter
the only change from the prior draft is to the volumes in the first sentence of the second paragraph
i've changed the contracted capacity figure from 0,0 mcf to 0,0 per feedback from keith
i think this is now ready to file
except that we will need to fill in the blanks
please confirm this and give me a call at your convenience so that we can discuss the logistics of the filing
thanks
attached is a draft of the letter that we propose to send to the cpuc regarding the al0 proceeding in which socal gas is proposing changes to its
windowing
criteria
your comments would be greatly appreciated
we need to file this tomorrow
so please communicate any comments to me by the close of business today
if possible
thanks

also
will we receive any confirmation of receipt of the electronic filing from ferc
thanks
attached is the final version of transwestern's advice comments
which has been submitted to the cpuc
linda
this looks fine
i just want to confirm that we do not countersign this transportation service request when we receive it from the potential shipper
instead
we process the request and generate a transportation agreement that we send to the shipper for execution
when we receive an executed transportation agreement from the shipper
we countersign it and begin service
is this correct
mark
this looks fine
yes
although it's no big deal to leave it in
i haven't received it yet that i can recall

please note that our response to data request no
0
contemplates that we will provide to ferc copies of the other bids that were received on this capacity

but i think the better approach is to just provide copies
a schedule of actual volumes transported and actual rates charged usgt is attached
this is the schedule c that is referenced in our response to data request no
0
this will need to be updated next week prior to filing
i do not have the other attachments to the responses in electronic format
i can of course provide paper copies of these to anyone who would like to see them
i would appreciate receiving any comments by noon on monday

i'm in my office for a little bit longer this evening and will be in all day tomorrow
my number here is 0
thanks
that's fine with me
i hope we are not planning on meeting for several hours
i have another meeting scheduled starting at 0:0
also
where are we meeting
i'm having faxed to each of you a summary that was prepared by michelle lokay of the bids that were received by third parties for the usgt capacity
i understand that the preference is to provide ferc with a summary rather than the actual bids
michelle
here's a draft of the letter
please let me know what you think
thanks
bill
greg
when you have a chance
i think it would be a good idea for me to brief you on the latest developments regarding enron compression services
charlie
i think your summary is very good
i would like to add that although midland cannot discontinue service to ena for failure to pay the $0,0.0 and $0,0.0 invoices
midland can shut off service if ena fails to pay any future invoices
so
it's imperative that someone from northern very closely monitor the situation with ena and midland to ensure that ena makes the necessary payments
in addition
the bankruptcy court may require ena to provide midland with
adequate assurance
of future payments
if required
this will most likely take the form of a cash deposit or a letter of credit
again
if ena fails to provide this adequate assurance
midland may discontinue service
actually
i recommended that we attach the entire bids and not the summaries
i believe it was mary kay and steve kirk who thought the summaries would be better
steve
i understand from maria pavlou that you are reformatting and also perhaps editing the data request responses that i drafted
please forward to me a copy of the proposed revisions as soon as they're available so that i can review them
thanks
ena's bankruptcy lawyers are supposed to be sending out a signed copy of the letter today
when i receive it
i'll fax it to charlie so he can forward it directly to the appropriate person
s
at midland
lorraine
thanks for forwarding the attached message
the way i read this
psnm is effectively withdrawing its demand for the collateral as long as we don't use the contract
we should probably send them a letter confirming that this is the case
i would suggest that you just send an e-mail in response stating that what psnm has proposed is acceptable and that our understanding is that psnm will not require collateral as long as we don't utilize the contract
therefore
psnm's demand for collateral by december 0 is
based on our understanding
withdrawn
please let me know if you have any questions
thanks
greg
i had a dental appointment this morning so i didn't get your message until after 0:0
do you have some time today to talk about the status of tw's contracts with enron compressor services
i think it will take about 0 minutes
i'm here all day
so
just about any time is good for me
thanks
patsy
since i haven't heard back from you re the e-mail i sent earlier this week
i assume that you're going to pass on the nutcracker
although i'm disappointed
i guess it's better to know this now rather than further down the road
anyway
i just wanted to let you know that i really enjoyed meeting you and talking with you
you're a very
very nice person
so
i hope you find the person you're looking for
take care and best wishes for you and your family
happy holidays
bill

privileged and confidential
attoney client work product
attached is a draft letter for your consideration
our outside counsel believes a letter like this would help us in our position that we do not have to continue buying energy when there is no transfer capability at the sdp because we know tva will reject it
sending this letter is not critical to the sucess of our position but would bolster it somewhat
before deceiding to sent or not
i wanted your thoughts on how you think that giving this information to tva would impact us
particularly given tva's actions today
re acces to transmission through third party transactions
lets discuss this afternoon
thanks elizabeth

last week
the wspp drafing group met in sunny california to continue the slow and steady march towards a standardized
national
agreement
schedule c
the service schedule for firm transactions
was the primary topic and the following is a summary of where the group is headed
after much discussion
we proposed that the group consider the definition of firm energy that tim
christian and others have been considering
the following is proposed language
the base was epmi's version
that the wspp group is currently reviewing
firm power is power that is sold and scheduled in accordance with applicable reserve requirements for which the only excuse for the failure to deliver or recieve are those set forth in schedule 0.0 of the wspp agreement
seller shall take steps necessary for the power to be considered firm power under this definition
schedule 0.0 only allows interruption if
i
within agreed recall time
ii
due to an uncontrollable force or
iii
power is need for native load
provided
however it was agreed that a party would neverless be liable for lds if it interrupts due to native load requirements
this last point is a major accomplishment that apppears to have uniform agreement and will be implemented in the next draft
the group claimed that the
optics
are necessary to help traditional utilities
as a further note
the group agreed to do away with all references to c0 and c0 and have just one schedule
changes from epmi's proposed definition where the result of the following discussions
0
generated vs
sold
sold
was elected over
generated
because the group thinks that it is the receiving control area that determines the generator's reserve requirements
0
schedule
was added to bolster the scheduling requirements
0
reserves
instead of
operating reserves
was used because the group thought the word operating may be too restrictive
0
wscc reserve requirements
was replaced with
applicable
reserve requirements because the group thinks that the wspp agreement is national in scope and should not be limited to wspp
0
references to non-firm supply as being excluded from firm power was excluded because the group thought it was redundent
no control area would accept a non-firm supply as being firm
0
power rather than energy is being used only bacause that is the decision that has already been made
this defintion will be further discussed at the next meeting on aug 0th in denver
prior to that time
i would like to get your thoughts on how this is shaping up and what additions/deletions are appropriate
i look forward to hearing your thoughts
thanks

elizabeth
hi christian thanks for the email and voicemail
look forward to seeing you in oct
this eei contract is a still a progress in work
last week's meeting resulted in still more changes
new draft is being prepared and will be distributed later this week
contract
rollout
is in nov
its raining here
first time in over two months
i think i'll leave today in celebration
sager
i have scheduled a meeting for october 0th from 0:0 to 0:0 in room 0 to recommence the project we began in january to review the existing houston-based financial
gas and power trading forms
all of you should have received a black binder labelled
analysis of ect's finacial
power
gas forms
which contains all of the long and short forms used for trading
as such forms existed in january 0
as well as my summary comparison as to how each of the forms handles certain legal issues
eg
termination
cover
assignement
confidentiality
if you did not receive or cannot locate this binder
let me know and i will forward to you another copy
this analysis was done in january
i am aware that some of the forms may have changed since then but have not undertaken to
update
the memo as we will be able to discuss such changes at the meeting
the purpose of the meeting is to review how each of the houston-based trading forms has been structured and to note where there are differences
the ultimate goal is to determine what enron's
model
trading provisions should be and to determine a consistent approach unless there is a justified rational for treating the commodities in a different manner
with this in mind
i would hope to be able to create a
modular type
contract whereby each legal issue would have a recommended approach
evidenced by language that will be approved by the group
by way of example
enron's gas contract prohibits assignement without consent
which consent can be withheld for any reason
the financial form provides that a party can not unreasonably withhold its consent
at this meeting we would discuss what the preferred approach is and then begin the process of drafting appropriate language
which language would be approved at a seperate meeting
this
modular assignment section
could then be dropped into all trading forms unless differences were required due to the commodity/product involved
you will note that the analysis performed to date does not include all areas of a trading contract
similiar steps will still need to be undertaken with other provisions such as credit terms
at the meeting
i hope to further discuss the additional areas everybody believes should be reviewed
aron roffwarg
a lawyer from bracewell
will also be at the meeting to assist us in this effort
thanks

let me know what you think
comes from a guy who is very nice and attentive at citizens but
happy days off
article as per my voice mail
thanks elizabeth
fyi
per my vm es
hi
thank you
christi here is a brief summary of the tva/epmi lawsuit
let me know if you would like more information
note
the mopa has been filed under seal in order to protect confidentiality
the judge was sensitive about this given the potential right of a party to get the mopa from tva under a foia
accordingly
we don't want to encourage further invetigation of the mopa by third parties
*epmi filed a declaratory judgement proceeding on november 0
0 against tva in the district court for the eastern district of tennessee
judge edgar has been assigned the matter
*the lawsuit concerns the interpretation of an option contract epmi and tva entered into on december 0
0
master option purchase agreement
mopa
*the sole issue presented by the declaratory judgement is the obligations of tva and epmi under the mopa in the circumstances where epmi is unable to schedule for delivery
or deliver
energy requested by tva under the mopa at the scheduled delivery point
sdp
if the available transfer capability at the sdp is not sufficient to allow the schedule or delivery
epmi believes that the mopa unambiguously addresses the issue
*a trial date in late june 0 has been set
*epmi filed a motion for summary judgement on november 0
0
as you are aware
the legal group has been considering epmi's options given tva's failure during the summer of 0 to treat enron's control areas in a manner similiar to other control areas
one option we have considered is the possibility of claiming monetary damages against tva for tva's breach of nerc policies
in order to make such a statement
we would
in essence
be required to assert that the nerc policies are a
contract
which all nerc members are obligated to abide by and for which the failure to do so could result in monetary damages
one concern with this strategy is whether epmi and/or its affiliates could possibly be damaged in other
unrelated proceedings if it was determined that nerc policies were indeed
contractual obligations
e.g
a third party claims monetary damages against epmi for an alleged violation of nerc
contractual policies
it would be very helpful if you would consider this issue and get back to me with any thoughts or comments you have
thanks for your help

and the spot
met
at 0:0 am today
jan 0th
we sent a notice to tva advising them that a triggering event under the mopa had occurred
as a result of the triggering event
epmi has the right to suspend deliveries and/or to terminate the mopa
at this point
we have not elected to suspend deliveries or to terminate the mopa
accordingly
our performance under the mopa at this point will not be impacted and we will continue to perform under the terms of the mopa
the letter also sets forth a proposal to tva pursuant to which epmi would be willing to continue performing under the mopa
this proposal is conditioned on tva allowing epmi to seek a judicial determination of its rights and tva paying market-based rates for the energy delivered by epmi to tva under the mopa pending the judicial proceedings
if you have any questions
please call me at 0

cftc concerns
dan
could you please help me fix the definition of
green requirement
fred
i wanted to stick to
would
instead of
will
as the operative verb in order to emphasize the non-binding nature of the proposal
if you have any questions or comments
please call me
i will not be in the office on friday
in my absence
please call leslie hansen at 0
elizabeth
fred i don't think we have to wait

elizabeth
christi could you please email the tva draft letter
thanks if i don't talk to you before you leave
have a great trip
positively
how about early monday
take care elizabeth
at the request of christi
enclosed please find a revised draft of epmi's response to tva's recent letter concerning epmi's transmission requests
this letter has been revised from the earlier draft to reflect comments from kevin and me
i will call bill rust and read the letter to him after all revisions have been made
please let me know if you have any comments
we would like to get the letter out to tva as soon as possible
preferably this afternoon if possible thanks elizabeth
andy as we discussed during the last conference call
attached is a revised article 0
credit provisions
to the eei contract
along with a revised section for the cover page
the changes were made to make article 0 more user friendly and to incorporate the few comments that were agreed to during the conference call
i tried blacklining
but that proved not decipherable due to the extensive formatting changes
maybe you will have better success
i have attempted to mark by hand the changes and will fax that to you in case you want to distribute it to the rest of the group
the only changes that were not discussed on the call
other than those resulting from the global restructuring
that i made are as follows
0
changed the section entitled
performance assurance
to
collateral threshold
use of pa seemed misleading since pa is referenced in other sections dealing with collateral
0
added the words
acceptable to party ___
in new section 0.0
d
and 0.0
d
in order to clarify
as we did in sections 0.0
a
and 0.0
a
that the security must be acceptable to the receiving party
0
added provisions in the cover sheet to provide expressly whether the options are
applicable
or
not applicable
as always thanks for your help
elizabeth
thanks
this would not print for me
would you try
fyi lets discuss later
please call me w any final comments
a huge debate has been ongoing in he battle whether to include language in the eei contract that would provide that a confirmation that contains
substantive
terms not discussed by the traders is subject to the
deemed accepted
language
i have been very vocal against adding this language
the politics as you can tell from this email have been fierce
and as in much of successful politics
dirty
i'm not sure where this will end up
but feel like it is important that we all are aware of the history here as well as enron's position
confirmation needs to be the final
best evidence unless objected to in a timely manner
i will keep everybody posted on the results of the vote
let me know if there is anything else i can do thanks sager
enron votes no
thanks elizabeth sager
in what i'm sure is an oversight
eei forgtot to send me a ballot
after appealing for my right to vote
a ballot was forthcoming
i voted
no
on the proposal
we will see what happens from here

i thought i could do it too
i was playing like a spring chicken until my first big overhead
i set up well
ready to bounce that ball right over grant's head
i thought i was so cool
up i went to find the ball and out came flying my racquet
on the other side of the net
cracked
everybody stood to stare to see if it was anger or incompetence that created such a mess
i think i better work on that shot
tennis on wed

hi brent hope all is well
i received your email
in the us we do physical power puts and calls
usually on a daily
weekly or monthly basis
e.g several month deal that gives party right to receive/sell energy on a daily basis
the confirmation for them is very simple
and generally assumes an underlying master that would govern the physical delivery if the option is exercised as well as all the other general terms and conditions
by copy of this email
i would ask leslie hansen to send you copies of a put and call confirmation which she can get from our documentation group
looking forward to seeing you soon back in houston
thanks leslie

attorney-client privileged communication not discoverable hi tim leslie reeves recently spoke to me about an outstanding receivable we still have relating to pca
pca went into bankruptcy in 0
at the time of pca's bankruptcy
pca owed a $0.0 million receivable to epmi
on epmi's books
this uncollected receivable amount was offset by an out-of-the money forward position epmi had with pca which we were able to take to zero when pca defaulted
contract provided for one way payments upon the occurrence of an event of default
and some funds from credit
after netting all these amounts
there is still a $0,0 receivable showing up as owed from pca to epmi
based on the current bankruptcy proceedings
it is not likely that epmi will receive any additional funds from pca
we have taken a very low key approach in the bankruptcy due to the lack of pca funds
the extensive amounts owed by pca to other creditors
the assertions being made by pca against some of the other creditors
and the legal effect of the one-way payment termination payment that provided us a significant offset to the receivable
accordingly
unless i hear otherwise from you
i will talk to leslie and tell her to go ahead and clean up the $0,0 pca receivable now
and in the unlikely event pca makes payments to any creditors
we would then give such amounts received from pca back to you
call me if you have any questions
thanks elizabeth
this is another tva letter
can you please put in my directory
add our standard addresses and heading and set up for signature for kevin presto vp
i will work on editing letter after you fix format
thanks
hi cregg got your email
i don't know of any openings now but will certainly keep my eyes and ears open
and if i hear of anything i will let you know
good luck to you in your search
with your self realizations in tow
cynicism is always appreciated and confidence is a boon
i'm sure an even better opportunity will present itself
elizabeth
here is a brief memo prepared by dan watkiss relating to the relationship between tva transmission and marketing
n i will call you later to discuss tva letter
kevin does not want to make offer to sell at market based rates
also want to discuss if there is any way we can challenge tva on the hourly tag problems of last week
talk to you soon
thanks
bob here is a revised draft
please review and give me comments
thanks elizabeth

hi smith if a six week delay in responding doesn't merit a big i'm sorry i don't know what does
my sincere apologizes in not responding sooner
we have been looking for a power trading lawyer for about a year
in march mark h
decided that since we couldn't find one outside that he would bring in people internally
accordingly
back in april we had 0 internal lawyers move into the group
as a result of this shift
we are not currently looking for additional lawyers for power trading
but if things change i'll let you know
just fyi
there may be openings in other areas
finance
asset development
if you are interested
let me know and i'll call you back
also
i know that power trading lawyers in general are in hot demand
other organizations may be hiring
i will be up in portland
next week
maybe we can talk then again
my apologizes on the long delay
pretty skimpy but here it is
please reformat

bob here is what we sent tva last year when we were notifying them of the delivery points we would have delivered to
i'm tied up in meetings the rest of the day and we want to start notifying tva of the delivery points we would have used had we had an obligations to continue to schedule and deliver energy under the mopa
could you please revise accordingly and send back to bill rust and me this afternoon
we would like to start sending out tomorrow
as always
thanks for your help

confidential
attorney client work product
not discoverable here is a rough draft
i will also start on tva letter
per my earlier vm
i am struggling with the benefit of a 0 year proposal vs
0
i'm not sure if we get any
cap
benefit from making a seven year deal even if tva doesn't accept our offers
benefit would assume that tva has an obligation to cover entire position which is contrary to what our outside counsel has said in the past
according to bob
since tva is asking for specific performance
it may not be reasonable for tva to cover entire period
i will try to talk to him tonight
if tva accepts one of our proposals and then we lose the termination argument
what do we do
supply
terminate again
in either case our proposal for 0 years will likely not cap our damages
let me know what you think
i'll be in early tomorrow
thanks
per my vm
please review and forward comments to me early thursday morning so we can distribute along with a copy of my explanatory memo
i will forward a redraft of the memo to you for final review prior to distributing to john l and dave d
thanks
confidential attorney work product please review attached memo and provide me comments early thursday morning
kevin and rodgers saw an earlier draft and i do not want to recirculate to them for their final review until we have all legal input
thanks
epmi is entering into more and more transactions that are settled against a floating
published index price
our physical contract does not currently provide for what happens if the published source is not available or is otherwise materially changed
under isda for financial trading
this is addressed as a market disruption event
mde
under ena's standard contract for financial trading
there is included as a mde
the imposition of trading limits on the range within which the price of the commodity may fluctuate
what this may mean is that if a cap is imposed on power prices
then in lieu of using the capped price to determine the floating price
you would be required
under isda
to eventually get brokers to determine what the price would have been without the cap
i want to add language to our physical contracts that addresses material changes/disappearance of the published prices that would mirror the financial trading terms and doubt whether we would want to make the imposition of a cap on power prices a mde
if you treat the imposition of a cap
say in ca of prices to $0 or in nepool to $0,0
as a mde
then we would be required to secure quotes as to what the price would have been without the cap each time that a pricing date trades at the cap level
this only seems fraught with litigation risk to me
alternatively
if caps are not deemed a mde
then you would always settle against the published prices
even if they are
artificially
determined after the trade was entered into
while caps are not appealing
i think it would be better to not have the imposition of caps be considered a mde
i have spoken with the financial trading group and they will follow our lead on this
so
depending upon what you both think
we will make sure that financial and physical power are treated the same on this issue
thanks for your thoughts

confidential attorney/client information not discoverable two years after pca's bankruptcy
we received a demand letter from pca
pca claims that epmi owes pca $0,0,0.0 for damages resulting from epmi's wrongful termination of transactions in june 0
this amount appears to be based on pca's calculation of the forward values of the terminated trades
and certain
preference payments
that pca claims were made to epmi
this claim is in its preliminary stages
i will update you with further information as soon as we get a handle on what the trustee is really seeking
as you will remember
we currently have a proof of claim pending against pca for over $0 million dollars representing our unpaid receivable amount
bill in connection with this matter
it would be very helpful if you could have someone gather the following information
0
date and amount of last payment made by pca
splitting the relative net amounts owed to and from epmi
i would assume that payment for april deliveries was made
accordingly
i would assume that the last payment we received from pca would have been around may 0th
0
total amount of mwh delivered to pca but for which pca never paid for
0
the details of how you calculated the net mtm exposure of the terminated transactions
pursuant to an email to me dated july 0
0 you had calculated the mtm as of july 0
0 at $0,0,0
as always
thanks for your help

thanks elizabeth 0
dynegy has requested a meeting with us to discuss what an
into product
is and how this product works with what is currently going on with transmission and how it may be impacted by future changes in transmission
attendees from dynegy will include griff jones
dynegy's head of trading
matt
whose last name i didn't get
and their lawyer harlan murphy
if you think somebody else should attend or if you want them to come over here
let me know and i can talk to harlan
assuming the meeting stays scheduled
i will schedule an internal meeting to briefly go over the eei into definition before we meet with dynegy
as you are aware
in connection with the eei effort we worked extensively with a large group of industry participants to define what an into product is
dynegy and peco were the two companies that were very outspoken against they way the product ultimately got defined
dynegy put on a big dog and pony show before a large group of industry participants trying to argue that eei's into product was flawed
their position
while not completely expressed
hinges on the concept that if you sell an into product and are making deliveries on firm transmission
then the seller will always be excused from performance if the firm transmission gets cut for any reason
in general
this is contrary to eei which obligates the seller to go to another interface unless the cut was due to buyer's use of non firm transmission when firm was available or due to buyer's attempt to move the energy away from the receiving control area
dynegy's approach was driven by the fact that they have extensive generation and that the vast majority of their deals go physical
at the time
we suggested that if they were worried about cuts in firm transmission
then they needed to sell a transmission contingent product
dynegy's concept was rejected at the eei meetings
i hope that the meeting will accomplish the following goals
0
get dynegy to agree to trade into with us under a common into definition
dynegy will not sign an eei with us because of the into definition
we trade into extensively with them
but clearly do not have a common understanding of what we are trading
critical to clear up this ambiguity
0
secure dynegy as an advocate of eei
because dynegy was so vocal against eei's into definition
if they now started using eei
it would further boost acceptance of the contract and isolate peco as the only other major voice against the into definition
0
reexamine the into product as it is currently drafted and consider what will happen as access to transmission changes
because the into product is such an important part of east trading today
it is critical that internally we all agree how it should operate
additionally
it is critical that we start thinking about how the into product will be affected by changes in transmission
such as the advent of rtos
with long term into deals we may want to consider addressing what happens if the receiving control area goes into an rto
call me with any questions/thoughts
thanks elizabeth
hi carol my home number is 0 0 0
weekends would work fine so give me a call any time
this heat is unbelievable

anytime you want to play
just give me a call

also
to the extent you think we should highlight financial trading policies like i have done
i would like mark to review what is written
he did confirm that this is financial trading's policy
finally
it would be very helpful if i could get your thoughts on to whom we should distribute the memo
thanks elizabeth
you vastly overstate my role but thank you nonetheless

enron would prefer all matters with respect to power go to arbitration for all issues
when we first started trading power we limited arbitration because we were uncertain where/how the market was going
accordingly
we limited arbitration to financial matters only
i only raised the issue last week because the scope of arbitration came up in another case and we were uncertain whether an issue of proper termination would be subject to the arbitration provision or not
in conclusion
based on today's policies
arbitrate everything
i would not think that there would be any reason for us to be concerned with preserving an argument of limited applicability of the arbitration language found in the pca master
i briefly reviewed your draft answer and will fax the comments to you shortly
thanks elizabeth
thanks anything fine but if individual orders are being followed
a large salad with vinaigrette dressing and some maque chou

janette mark had asked me to call williams and invite them to the isda energy meeting in houston last week
tim at williams very much wanted to participate
as you can see from his email
he must not be on the distribution list for isda
can you see if it is ok to add him to the distribution list for future meetings
also
i called dynegy at mark's request and they very much want to participate as well
harlan murphy called me afterwards to ask that he also get notice of the meetings because they fully support the idea of one master for all trades
i will get genia to forward harlan's address info to you
thanks for your help
elizabeth 0 ps mark at the eei meeting last week there was a fair bit of discussion about cross defaulting all commodity lines and using a single master for all trades
it seems that there is alot of interest in this idea
hi tim thanks for your message
we absolutely will forward to isda your message so that you can receive notices of the energy product meetings
i thought you were already getting them
look forward to seeing you again soon
elizabeth
i agree w tracy
the calpine master is legally sufficient for trades and our relationship w calpine is sensitive
we do not need to push the eei master unless they want it in which case we are happy to oblige
just fyi
depending on the trade we would likely like to add product definition
eg west firm
into product since products are not defined in master
john when you are ready with the deal terms
just let me know and we can find the right person to help you document it given the nature of the product involved
hi dede just wondering if you would be able to hit next week

i reviewed the proposed canadian power master and have been speaking to greg johnston about various issues
the canadian master is based upon eei but has been
retyped
making changes based upon variations in the way us power has evolved from that of the canadian master gas contract
the basis for a number of the differences from eei
operational distinctions
differences in product and jurisdictional issues
eei has called me and stated that they want to attend a meeting on november 0th in ontario to advocate the use of the eei form in canada
peter keohane
i know
wants the form he and greg prepared to be the model canadian form for all the reasons he stated in his email to you
do you think i should set up a meeting with you
jeff hodge
peter k
greg j
and myself to discuss
at that time
we could also discuss the significant
policy differences
to make sure that everybody knows what is going on and that there are good reasons for the differences
thanks elizabeth
janette i'm not sure what you are looking for but here is brief description for power trading ena's legal power trading group supports all of enron's u.s.-based
wholesale trading legal requirements
enron is the largest marketer of wholesale power in the u.s
this group currently has 0 lawyers
one located in portland
responsibilities include negotiating master trading agreements and structured power transactions
interfacing with industry trade groups to develop business practices and managing risks associated with the world's most volatile commodity
let me know if this is sufficient
great
the met has 0 hour free parking
use the
yellow entrance
to the allen center
located on the far side of the parking garage
next to all the open air parking lots
and follow the signs for met parking
off to the right
met is on the 0th floor
i can meet anytime around lunch
i'll go ahead and get court for 0:0
but if you want to meet later
that would be fine
just let me know
looking forward to playing
thanks
i also think this is a great idea
there would be a tremendous benefit if the eei contract became the standard for on-line trading platforms
while enron currently uses simplified gtcs for trading online with those counterparties with whom we do not have a master power trading contract
if we do that agreement governs power trades
we have talked about and likely will eventually make the eei contract the
default
contract if there are no other arrangements in place
i would fully support and provide any assistance to pursue this idea with and through eei
0:0 would be fine
i've changed our court time
see you then
please send thanks
i will be there
please print
there are cheap tickets to dc
0
this weekend and i was wondering if i should go
my mom says she is just far too busy for me to come
she is alone and bob is not coming back until next week
what do you think
ugh
jim
sorry for the delay in getting back to you
while i'm still checking
i am not aware that there is a
formal process
for being a board member of a non-corporate entity like spp
we would
however
want to look at the equivalent of spps bylaws to make sure that members are not going to be liable for actions taken and to see if spp has something like d&o insurance
protecting the members
we can talk to spp and see what there is
let me know if you want us to request/review documents
thanks
chris was ontario power generation the canadian company you mentioned this morning that has alot of generation in ontario and would likely be a major factor in determining the contract to be utilized in canada
shari has had numerous conversations with a greg malcolm there and he has said that they are very interested in contracting with epmi using eei
he and shari have a call scheduled for nov 0th
just curious
steve and christian could you please review and let me know what you think of this
there is a call on thurs at 0
central
to discuss
do you want to participate
i'm available on the 0th
tickets were still available so i'm going
commitment
regrettably
enron also can not participate today
monday does not work for me either but in my absence shari stack could participate
let me know and i will coordinate schedules with shari
i'm glad you cancelled
i agree that the changes are much broader than we intended
more importantly
i miss having not played tennis this week
and i'm going to dc this weekend
and likely out next week
a short interlude but that's all
on an eei note
are you/reliant going to the meeting in ontario that is addressing contract issues in ontario
andy is speaking about eei
are you supporting the use of eei in canada
i think i have our canadian office convinced to use it with dealers but they would want to
canadianize
it
thereby creating an eei canadian
any thoughts
ps i am going to wspp meeting just for the day
mike small has mentioned playing tennis on monday morning before the meeting
still not going
hey i just realized i have babysitting on friday
any chance you can play
how about anytime between 0 and 0 houston time
if not
i could also do 0
let me know
0 hours later my crown is on
my teeth are happy but for the #0 upper right molar
which the dentist says
unbeknown to me
is abscessed

that will make 0,0 to 0
happy playing
please sign me up

either at lunch or after work
see you at 0 unless i hear otherwise
thanks for getting it set up
looks great
thanks for your help
is the tournament on sat or sun or both
round robin
thanks looking forward to hitting tomorrow
lets discuss this later thanks
peter
just a follow-up to your email

i would agree that opg is mistaken
after the meeting
chris and i and others started the process of explaining to joel sheinfied
a contract administrator
why deliveries in a pool situation were not just financial settlements but involved a physical commitment to deliver or cause to be delivered power
on this issue i think it would be helpful to present opg w
a product definition that works with the physical master
i know chris is already working on this
from what it sounds like
the ontario pool is not that different from nepool
in ui
chris worked on a product definition that you could incorporate into the physical master
0
i also agree that in pools
a fm will only exist when the pool fails and there are no deliveries capable of being made
not a single mw flowing
this is what we did in ui
this is what we do in the california pool
this is what we attempt to do in nepool
i think the eei fm gets you to the same place
nobody could call fm if the pool were making deliveries
but agree that the language could be more direct
with the california product
caiso energy
we expressly modify the eei fm since there are so many other things we also have to fix
we likely in the future will also modify fm for the nepool product but we are still trying to introduce so many other products in the us that this is a change for the near future
in general
fm is unique to the product and i believe will change with each product
when chris and i were talking to opg we told them that the fm we would be proposing for the ontario product would be just as you stated
fm is only possible if the pool fails
just fyi
the god awful
into
product in the us was created by enron for the very reason you stated
we wanted to eliminate fm risk in a non-pool market
we did this by obligating the seller to continuously be required to change delivery points
and not be allowed to call a fm
within the defined control area if for any reason the prescheduled delivery point was unavailable
harrison called this am at home
he said that you'all had discussed plans for sat
because it's his b-day he wants to go out
he seemed to suggest that you were on board
so i said ok too
hope that's ok
there may be a basketball game and dinner in the offing
talk to you soon
done
i think i could 0:0
deal may be closing
but unlikely
if it did i might have to cancel
i would know by lunch
if you want
we could maybe try hitting at the hcc
the houstonian courts are booked
otherwise we could try there
now that i0 is closed
traffic around the met during rush hour is terrible and i wouldn't want you to get stuck
if this doesn't work
just let me know and we can find another time
see you there at 0:0 unless i call you
yuk
so sorry to have to cancel that deal is making like it wants to close and the traders scheduled a 0 call to wrap it up don't they know we have better things to do here is to getting back on track after thanksgiving sorry again
per my vm
see you there on court 0 ps i may have to come back to work for a 0 call
no problem
hi mike i am definitely coming out for meeting on monday

i will look at during my flight on sunday and will call you on monday am if i have any comments
if this isn't ok
please leave me a voice mail and i will try to review earlier
thanks elizabeth ps
chris
i agree with your comment re the eei copyright and references
i'm not sure what the right answer is
do you want to continue calling it an
eei canada
is that ok with eei
do you think we should rename it in the name of the organization that
approves
it
is that ok w eei
maybe you should discuss at meeting and then we can discuss with andy from eei to
jeff i enjoyed speaking with you on the flight back to houston
as promised
here is the information about the ontario meeting regarding the creation of a physical power master for canada
don't hesitate to call if you have any thoughts or comments
talk to you soon elizabeth sager
attached is draft escrow language for black hills that i made up in an attempt to be sympathetic to black hills's desire for certainty on the release of funds
please review and call shari with comments first thing on wed
i will be travelling wed but will check messages on wed afternoon
good luck
at the last eei meeting there was a strong interest in beefing up the collateral provisions of the eei
what a great idea
bill mccoy at morgan stanley was asked to prepare the first draft
a copy of which i am forwarding to you for your review
please review and let either shari or i know if you have any comments or thoughts
while eei's message does not indicate when comments are due
i have a call into eei but have not yet heard back
i have asked shari to help coordinate all comments so we can get back in touch with eei within the next week or so
thanks for your input

i think attachment is missing since i didn't get confirm
check w genia re paper
i think we have something but is skimpy
you are correct on the facts pget pays a higher price to morgan than ees pays to pget
hence the payment to ees
thanks we will likely need to simple corporate help as well to work on assignments/termination
if possible maybe you could get somebody to assist to also be on call.c
as promised
thanks
per my vm
david could you work with joe wagner on this
thanks
attached are drafts of documents that we prepared and llgm fixed

hi i am here
we are closing tonight

here are the revised documents that we will need eemc to sign

i will be out tomorrow but can be reached at home 0 0 0 or on my cell phone 0 0 0 and will be checking messages
travis and tracy will assist in gathering all the fax signatures and refaxing to all parties
remember
epmi is required to wire the payment to pget
$0,0.0
and we need to get wire information from pget
also pget must release cash collateral to avista
we should follow up to make sure this happens
thanks again
hi angela sorry i did not get back in touch w you earlier
my mom passed away over the holidays and i have been out of the office and don't know exactly when i will be back
definitely out the week of 0th
i look forward to playing and will call you when i get back to play
bill told us last night the true up payments run to pget
documents prepared by shari w llg help
sent to avista
i just found that out
any idea where ees is on this this am
i'm meeting w mark h now to discuss
please print
fyi
we have right to terminate eemc power positions assumed by epmi and have been letting them know that we might exercise this termination right if they don't help us on the collateral issues
confidential
attorney work product/not discoverable a
pge i
termination rights based on the failure to post collateral it is possible that we could terminate the following contracts based on pge's or one of its subsidiaries's failure to post collateral as required by the underlying contracts

enron exposure $0 million 0.pge canada/ena
physical gas
enron exposure $0 million ii
termination rights based on pg&e's failure to pay indebtedness it is possible that we could terminate the following contracts based on pg&e's or one of its subsidiaries's default on indebtedness in excess of a threshold

enron exposure $0 million 0
pge canada/ena
physical gas
enron exposure $0 million most of the above agreements are supported by a guaranty from pg&e's parent
pg&e corporation
in the amount of $0,0,0
we have not yet made demand on the parent but could do so after pge or its other unregulated subsidiaries failed to pay amounts due
exposures are approximate as of 0/0/0
before terminating
we would need to verify actual contract language
b
sce default sce is in default of a contract between sce and epmi relating to a power sales position which is out of the money to epmi approximately
$0 million
based upon sce's failure to make payments on debt in excess of $0 million
under contract we could suspend deliveries
limited period
and then terminate and accelerate amounts due
amounts payable could offset amounts owed by sce to epmi or its affiliates including enron wind or portland general
sounds like a great idea
i'll talk to grant and let you know
meanwhile can you hit this week

please distribute to whoever you think would be interested

hi john thanks for the offer but despite what you say
your legal prowess is still far more important to me
i would likely have ceased working long ago w/out llgm
i rode up on the elevator with jeff skilling and he asked me if i still liked my job
i first asked if i had a choice and then confessed it could be better
i don't think i won many points with him
particularly when i asked him if he liked his job
oh well
any connections there
i'm sending out documents tonight on the utility exposure by confirm to you and jim
i can talk to you and jim about that as well as offset with the commandeered positions anytime on wed morning

hi mike dede and my husband and i are all bringing our racquets hoping to get in some tennis on either or both wed and thurs
can you join us
let me know
great
one hundred and forty two hours ago
i wandered into the houston casino
not really sure why other than a free floating anxiety that could only be appeased by attending to the ministerial tasks in life that so frequently make us forget how good life is
so after a rousing game of tennis on friday morning while my children were frolicking with dede's 0 children at the houston country club
i tackled my desk and made head way to no where
after trashing 0 emails
i opened the the 0th
and then it came to me
an epic
a history
a sense of time
commitment and value
a place where my roots are
as you all know
my mom and dad are buried in a family graveyard 0 feet from the only barn not burned in the shenandoah valley during the civil war and which was used a yankee hospital
and of course there is the hope of sustaining energy to cope with this lackluster
stressful career in the casino
and the gods must have seen this coming too
being meager and always wanting to commit small
i sought only volume 0 of the opus
not to be found
plenty of volume 0s and 0s but not a volume 0 to be found
other than in the sole
0 volume set
neatly packages in the box
high up on a lonely shelf
i knew i was on the right track when the person behind me tried to grab it out of my hands
i fought and won
i'm now on page 0 having met jefferson davis and dear abe
at this rate i'll be finished in about 0 years
a true history of the war
may shelby be with us all providing sustaining
es
can you get eei and cover sheet and riders to carol thanks es
i'm out this week giving a seminar
the head of the rival power form wspp and me miss eei are giving presentations on why our documents are the best
before that though we have tennis scheduled
he'll kill me but i do have the better form
so it looks like we will have to push it till the week of the 0rd any day that week is good
way to go again on your sweet victory this weekend
thanks for yesterday
it's a wonderful tradition that i look forward to every year
also
i spoke w pam and does tues at 0 work for you
thanks again
thanks for the book and bikes
ella is in love with the bike with the basket
how about lunch next week
absolutely
see you at your house as darkness falls
i'm thrilled
see you in newport
when do you get in
how about wed
april 0th
thanks for the explanation
can you also get the actual interest rate used for each group on terminated transactions
eg the financial trades
the power trades
the us gas trades and the canadian gas trades
thanks
bill i spoke with richard and we will have to renew
he is currently trying to get the px bankruptcy court to allow us to take back our security in light of the ferc ruling re chargebacks
but due to uncertainty of the ferc ruling
court has not been willing to allow us to remove
richard continues on the case
in the meanwhile
the px/bankruptcy court will not allow the lc's to expire without drawing down
so we should go ahead and renew
attached is a draft letter setting forth enron's damages in connection with the termination of certain commodity forward and swap positions with pg&e
in lieu of sending out multiple letters and then aggregating the exposures for set off purposes
i thought it would be more understandable if we put all the matters in one letter
for each product line
i thought we could attach all the relevant information
i'm not sure if this is making it too easy for the court but it seems like the right thing to do
each commodity line then would assemble the following and attach as an appendix to the letter
0
copy of master contract or applicable gtc 0
copy of transaction confirmations 0
copy of termination notice sent to pg&e 0
chart summarizing key commercial terms of transaction
s
0
chart summarizing unpaid receivables and invoices for same 0
chart setting forth termination payment calculation for each terminated trade 0
paragraph describing methodology used to determine termination payment valuation
eg
0 quotes secured
threw out high and low and averaged middle
0 list showing quotes secured
entity
person
time and amount
and the extent available
written confirmation of such quote i will be out of the office the rest of this week but will organize a call for early next week in order to finalize the pg&e package
thanks for all your help
elizabeth sager
thanks
go ahead and sign it
i did
the law in va
is that once appointed you can not revoke
i spoke w counsel on this
mom's probate estate is very small
thanks
hi any chance you could hit thursday or friday

talk to you soon

hope so
let me know where you would like to go

see you at redwood grill at 0
i've never been there

if possible
i would like to get this out to larry within the next hour
i promised to send it first thing monday am
thanks for your fast review
larry
in accordance with our conversation late last week
i am enclosing a revised draft of the proposed standstill agreement that was discussed on wednesday
my comments primarily involve the following
0
as you and i discussed last week
i thought it made sense to specify areasonable date by which enron and pg&e shall have reached closure on a settlement agreement on the contract termination and related claims
i proposed a one month period to do that
if the parties can,t come to anagreement in that time period
then the
mechanics0 in the mpa for resolving a dispute dealing with the calculation of the termination payment would be&reactivated.0 obviously
if we are making progress
the parties can always extend the date
i felt it was appropriate to specify the window period tomake sure that everyone is focused on attempting to get a prompt resolutionassuming a final settlement agreement is agreed upon
the conditions of theextension of the
stay0 would be embodied in the settlement agreement itself
as opposed to this letter
0
enron agreed at the meeting that it would keep the lcs in place while the parties were working to see if a settlement agreement could be reached
andthat requirement is reflected in our revisions to the letter
thus
the revised letter provides that enron will do this for the
initial extension period0
i.e
to may 0
0
your draft had provided that enron would be required to keep the lcs in place even if no settlement agreement were to breached
my view is that any requirement to maintain the lcs beyond the initial extension period and any conditions with respect thereto
if agreedto by enron
should be part of the final settlement agreement executed by the parties
rather than as part of this letter
also
we note that
as a contractual matter
the mpa does not require the non-defaulting party to kein place any security in favor of the defaulting party when
as a result of a termination
the non-defaulting party owes a payment to the defaulting part see sec
0.0
0
your draft of the letter provided that enron
agrees0 to enter into new master gas agreements and consummate term transactions on
commerciallyreasonable terms.0 the revised letter specifies that enron agrees to negotiate with pg&e in these respects simultaneously with the negotiationstowards a settlement agreement
but any commitment on enron,s part to efa contract or transaction with pg&e will only arise as a result of the parties
execution of the definitive transaction documents
as opposed tthis letter
the execution of which shall be in the sole discretion of eacof the parties
please call me at your convenience to discuss any questions on the foregoinor on the revised letter
thanks in advance for your help in moving thisforward

maybe justin boyd in london or clement abrams
enron corp attorney who works on guarantees
would be able to help
good luck

elizabeth sager
nothing to date has been communicated to pge re settlement
i'll keep you posted
that's a joke
elizabeth sager
i agree
a fundamental assumption of the mna is that square setoff works and that you can setoff financial and physical commodity contracts
to make it work
all parties must sign the mna
from there you need to believe that square setoff works and that the bankruptcy court will allow the setoff and not make an issue of
the lack of mutuality
taking into consideration that the assets of the bankrupt party may be being used to satisfy liabilities of the non-bankrupt party
elizabeth sager
please process for payment
thanks elizabeth sager
elizabeth sager
hi thanks
i think we should delete highlighted language but lets confirm w cy
also i think we should discuss whether the definition should roll w the wspp
see black highlighted language
we rolled because wspp
we thought
rolled
now we know it doesn't
i don't think our other products roll
how about a brief call w you me and cy
sorry to add layers off confusion
but the wspp rolling has been of gnawing frustration
hence
elizabeth sager
elizabeth sager
sounds great
meet you there elizabeth sager
hi can you get these to ed thanks elizabeth sager
hi travis i already told mark that i wanted you and kay to go and he seemed to think that it was a good idea

elizabeth sager
sat sounds great elizabeth sager
test elizabeth sager
hi how about trying to hit on wed
afternoon
or thurs
lunch
talk to you soon elizabeth sager
hi limor the reason why we have not at this time proposed to include affiliates of the dp in setoff rights
i.e
changing the setoff from a triangular version to square
is due to enforceability concerns absent securing the written agreement of all parties involved
we are
however
on a cp by cp basis
starting to pursue master netting agreements which would tie all masters together and permit setoff on a square basis
this undertaking requires a fairly extensive due diligence review
hope this explanation helps
call if you want to discuss further
elizabeth sager
see you there elizabeth sager
elizabeth sager
my typing is so poor and slow or else a book would surely follow
upon clyde's return we shall revisit the thorny wspp meeting in colorado in the modern way
by phone for lack of my speed and agility
cy
i think we were starting to recap the absurdity when jeff skilling suddenly resigned
but in the meanwhile a preview
the eei creep was evident when mike small after himself
personally
taking credit for drafting enron's market disruption language
he said it was very time consuming to draft
proceeded to be challenged by all the eei members who the day before had sat around the table for 0 productive hours challenging certain concepts that enron originally proposed
as a result we will be modifying our language soon since some good issues were raised
after hearing the new issues mike threw up his arms and asked that we propose new language
afterwards
i spoke with mike
sorry clyde
and proposed to meet with him to discuss the possibility of bringing the groups together
using the absurdity of the market disruption language discussion as good evidence of what we could achieve together
he said theoretically that might be able to happen but he never saw it happening
i asked why
he said too painful
what pain
he said shari stack
i said one bad day in newport
he stopped talking
he did ask if we wouldn't sit down with him and tell him line by line why we don't like the wspp
i think this meager offer is something we can't miss so
maybe
at this meeting
clyde and others can begin the writing of a world of one
a world where clyde can make yet another name for himself
elizabeth sager
elizabeth sager
hi big news
we will make a settlement offer
$0
message to be conveyed today
wed
i'll keep you posted
elizabeth sager
vicki as we discussed

there are 0 financial confirmation letters outstanding with ees
some of these have been outstanding since march 0
the documentation group is under alot of pressure to secure signatures on all written confirms that are set up for signature
accordingly
it would be very helpful if you could help us resolve this situation
please don't hesitate to call if we can be of any help
thanks in advance for your assistance

hi ellen i will have some new expenses ie federal and state income taxes that have not been paid
expenses paid up to june 0th i paid from the estate
depleting cash so i assume we wouldn't list them
right
i will provide you with things i can think of by the 0th
what is happening in the va probate
when will i receive a draft of the return
i assume we can if necessary file an extension so long as we pay the estimated tax

ed as you requested attached is language epmi/ena currently uses for index based power deals at various delivery points
this language forms the basis for what is inserted into physical and financial confirmations for power index-based deals
the underlying confirmations may also contain conforming language depending upon the delivery point and the counterparty
this language is updated/revised periodically as indexes change
new information becomes available and/or to fit the agreed upon transaction
if you have any questions
please call me at 0 0 0

hi scott enron was heavily involved in the eei
anything and everything in the eei can be changed
i attach a sample of some our standard changes for your information
we also add others from time to time
our position on issues depends upon the counterparty involved
feel free to amend choice of law
confirming party
which by the way sometimes epmi also changes
and whatever else you want assuming you think appropriate for your dealings
on typos
we know they exist but question whether there is anything misleading
we were under tremendous pressure to
release
the document
after release we do not want to
re-release
unless something is misleading
if you want to fix
feel free to do so in the cover page
this is a sample of epmi's older cover page amendments elizabeth sager
here are some sample letters
this one is mary's start
she did not go all the way through it
it is based on the pg&e letters

hi so much wasted time and energy and the well is running dry at the same time the animosity towards enron and marketers seems only to be increasing
i like the proposal to merge the discussions but
you will recall at the wspp meeting in colorado i asked mike small if he wouldn't consider merging the discussions
contracting groups
after a long winded story about the personal pain he has and will continue to suffer
shari's name came up a lot
he said he did not think it would ever work
i'm all for trying to forge this single contract approach and i think eei members
drafting committee and all
would relish it as well
what do you think is the next best step
ps
the meeting in san diego on the 0st is still unclear for houston based enron employees
terrorists halloween scares have made everyone unlikely willing to fly
we are trying to get mike to allow a videoconference but so far no commitment that this is ok
lets talk about this also
hoping not to stay the course
again
talk to you soon

hey
just checking to see if you spoke with randy
how was the circus
have you gotten a response
figures
he first detailed allegations that enron abused mark-to-market accounting to hide wholesale trading losses have emerged in congressional testimony pro-vided by a professor and former deriva-tives trader who reviewed the enron case for senate governmental affairs com-mittee
those charges
along with allega-tions that have surfaced that mark-to-market accounting was misused by enron energy services
the company's retail energy and services unit
are expected to support the push by accounting rulemak-ers for much more disclosure on mark-to-market accounting practices and the impact of mark-to-market accounting on earnings trading firms
earnings
in testimony thursday before the senate governmental affairs committee last week
frank partnoy of the universi-ty of san diego law school
said it appears that enron traders mismarked forward curves and manipulated the amount of profits and losses that would be reported in financial statements
in a nutshell
it appears that some enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to cre-ate false profit-and-loss entries for the deriv-atives enron traded
said partnoy
who reviewed the case over several weeks at the committee's request
it appears that enron traders selectively mismarked their forward curves
typically in order to hide losses
traders are compensated based on their profits
he observed
so if a trader can hide losses by mismarking forward curves
he or she is likely to receive a larger bonus
partnoy said mismarking forward curves was not the only problem
for each trade
he testified
a trader would report either a profit or loss
typically in spreadsheet format
these profit-and-loss reports were designed to reflect economic reality
frequently they did not
instead of recording the entire profit for a trade in one column
some traders reportedly split the profit from a trade into two columns
the first column reflected the portion of the actual profits the trader intended to add to enron's cur-rent financial statements
the second col-umn
ironically labeled the
prudency
reserve
included the remainder
partnoy told the committee that in his estimation
enron's
prudency
reserves did not depict economic reality
nor could they have been intended to do so
instead
prudency
was a slush fund that could be used to smooth out profits and losses over time
the portion of prof-its recorded as
prudency
could be used to offset any future losses
he said
he recommended that investigators question enron employees who were involved in these transactions
to get a sense of whether my summaries are complete
alleged enron abuses of mark-to-market accounting emerge
hey fool
you thought columbia was bad
this shit sucks elephant balls
thought you might find this interesting
get your read pin out
you use your tongue prettier than a two dollar whore
dont know who that is
i can find out if you want me too
i know a few people in rac
things arround here still suck
i am doing a little stock trading and trying to find a job
basically doing the bare minimum to keep the paycheck
isnt anderson your auditor
is that a conflict
you should read some of the powers report
unbelieveable
how to grow mollypops
fenner household does a swap with mollypops
an llc for forward products
of course reconize it as income to mollypops
and than the fenners get a small business loan to pay for the swap
use your house as colateral
of course you will have to meet the 0% non consolidation rule to keep your personnel and businees affairs seperate
you could get e to put up 0
and assign him majority of the partnership
and to make him feel better
you could set up a resevre account to protect his investment
oh you might have to garunantee him a 0% return
spoke with centana
he has told me that he is willing to let me sell some of the inventory
he has stated that he will want to keep some of the inventory as collateral for pre and post petition demand fees
margie
that time works with my schedule
let me know when it is finalized
thanks
joe
phil

hey
why get in the middle
its not our responsibility to get aep their money

it might be cleaner to send the money back to el paso
in case you care
i agreed with centana to sell the 0mmbtu tomorrow morning

how are things
this is an interest statement
foreigners want to add to their holdings of us assets when they already hold 0% of the us equity market
0% of corporate bonds and 0% of the treasury market
smells like could be headed for a hire interest rate environment
providing we have any type of economic growth
marked some gaps on the continuations
they are all worth it
every penny

what's the status of the bridgeline transportation and storage

talking today
ena had a term supply contract with energen to purchase roughly 0,0mmbtu a day at 0.0 on mrt
which energen terminated on december the 0th
0
the operator for the supply
duke field services
erroneously allowed supply to continue to flow between dec
0-0
ena also failed to remove its nomination for the supply
allowing it to continue to flow to ena's market
oneok
duke field services would like to get paid for the gas it delivered and has offer to sell ena the gas at a price of 0.0
gas daily average for mrt west leg
i have spoken with david eubanks in gas settlements and he shows ena receiving and delivering the gas to oneok
i would like to try to get the mrt issue settled as soon as possible
for i feel that it would help facilitate the centana storage account
approximately $0,0,0 in positive cash flow
although duke recognizes that it has no offset rights for the two issues
they seem to be taking their time
let me know when you have a minute
hey
got a call from jeff smiron

do you want to call him and give him a fax so he can send it
thanks

ed
who do you think i should have linda roberts send a letter stating glo's position
ponderosa pines energy partners will be taking 0mmbtu per day for the month of april
sent notice to williams
they imediately responded that they had credit issues and were waiting to hear from us about the letter of credit
thought you would want to look at this
thanks
joe
louis
i
for now
have requested wholesale basis positions
price equivalent
be keep out of the price report

i would like to look at basis correlations before including them in fixed price
i have spoken to reliant,txu
aep
coral
el paso
and aquila about buying the supply we have in storage
they have either told me they don't have any interest in buying it or they just don't respond
centana is willing to buy the inventory if we will pay for the gas we received in december off of mrt
i have gotten shemin proctor's opinion on the situation
see attached
i would like to move forward and settle these issues with duke/centana
i have also included estimated cash flows on the transactions
thoughts
joe
well
well
shemin
you still stand by what you said below
heads up
louis has brought up a good point
are we able to see positions non-pv
also can we get a seperate nymex equivalent basis position
i will try to pay duke field services $0
asap
working on it
spoke with chance on friday
he believes that the wholesale data is clean
i also sent an email to chance
pat and scott that raised the issue of pv'ed positions
i am waiting for a response
i have attached a word document that briefly describes what i learned from my meeting with linda roberts
i will also give you a copy of the glo/erac contract and a copy of the dealsheet for the gas
any questions give me a shout
joe

look at it and let me know if you have any questions
thanks joe
ed,wants me to get this deal closed
i spoke with stuart and he would like your opinion on using the proceeds from the sale to cover the expense of the mrt gas
he seems to think it shouldn't be an issue given that ena is counterparty to both
of course we would need to add language that would require centana to show that it has paid duke field
lets discuss
you need to let me know if you want to sell volumes
i have to find a market
nominations are due thursday afternoon
chip
i just want to follow up my voicemail
if you can get with me by the end of the day or first thing tomorrow
