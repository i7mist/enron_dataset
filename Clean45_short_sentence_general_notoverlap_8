oops
i forgot you
all deals have been moved to ena-im west last night
set up your physical post-id's for today and calculate the weapon-x
make sure there are no deals in your books using a forwards detail
if it is blank
you can run your weapon-x and input into your p&l this morning
you will also need to officialize your physical book one last time
financial
you don't need to roll your p&l anymore
except for monte
you will have to due to the transport model
go into the rac website and inactivate all of your books other than the physical
you will do that tomorrow
now that all tagg deals are in one book
we will be splitting up the alphabet among all groups to help monitor that the correct counterparties are being moved to the bankuptcy book
we will get with you all later regarding that
let me know if you have any questions
thanks
i started calculating the bankruptcy book last night for the credit group
this needs to be done nightly
i may be out a few days so if i am can someone else take this over from me please
we can also use these to check daily for counterparties that have been moved incorrectly
the file is in o:\erms\0intra\west\bankruptcy post-ids.xls thanks
yes
send them to john powell and cc debbie brackett
here are today's post-ids
this what she sent
thanks
francis
can you call errol mclaughlin or jeff gossett when you are done
thanks
hector
carole frank has resigned effective today
i will collect her badge and any other equipment
please let me know if there is anything else that we need to do
thanks
please add stephanie mcginnis to the email
it should be john powell debbie brackett stephanie mcginnis
can you take care of this
scott
scott tackett has taken over sean's responsibilities
he can take care of this for you
thanks
done
amanda
can you please look at the last line for management west
those deals are booked to the ft-cand-egsc book in canada
it wasn't reflected in our p&l's
it also didn't liquidate so it shouldn't be a variance
thanks
scott
can you check the contract on #0
the chicago office needed to add a month to this deal and it wouldn't let it due to the contract #
i changed it but probably shouldn't have
it probably needs a new ticket
let me know
kay in chicago needed this at 0-0-0 thanks
jeff
here are the post-id's for you
or whoever
for friday
ignore the can tab
you should have access to these books
if not you can use my computer
kkeiser
tamu0ddd on the right computer
i may come in for the afternoon
let me know if you will need help for anything else
i'll come in
there hasn't been anything going on except running mini-books for russell diamond
see you later
thanks
these are the post-id's for today price 0 basis 0 index 0 gdm-canadian 0 these two books were added to capture the canadian priced deals thanks
fyi
we are not bringing in prompt month value tonight
texas did
about $0,0
the other regions don't have what we need for demand charges
etc
and no one has taken any time to research the values yet
the other groups we need have been gone for hours
we have some large positions which i don't really think are right
i'll look closer in the morning
hope you feel better soon
at least you have all weekend to recover
see you monday
ryan
everyone else is going to be here on monday so please feel to stay a few extra days
we will have the normal closing stuff
liquidations
pma's
etc
i've already checked out our pma's and we don't have anything to liquidate so it should be a piece of cake
things may pick up a little bit on wednesday getting the books closed for the year
see you then have a great weekend
scott
i did the last four pages of this
the pages before that look like they have already been done
i just spot checked most of them but the entire first page was done already
i didn't want to waste time
bridgette is out until next year so i couldn't ask her what the problem is
i'll leave the pages on your desk
i started looking at the prompt month positions yesterday and noticed that many of the deals moved to the bankruptcy book have not been deleted in sitara
i don't think that most people checked the bottom of the sitara deal to see that the volumes were zero for future months
i started comparing the bankruptcy index book to a prompt month calc
and fixed as much as i could for the east and west
i just started on central but we should check this all again on monday
because of this
we have not reported any prompt month physical value
the rates group hasn't been around to get the demand charges either
we should have everything clean to report it on monday
going forward i guess we need to show people how to check it correctly
see you on monday
errol
here are the bankruptcy post-id's that need to be calculated tonight
you probably don't have access to the canadian book so you can get it from jeremy or use my computer
the right one has portcalc up
kkeiser
tamu0ddd
they might need to be on inexact for basis and index
once those are done
can you email the id #'s to john powell
debbie brackett and stephanie mcginnis
thanks call me if you have any problems
john
i was just thinking about the december liquidations
we moved many deals over to a book called bankruptcy for december forward production months
we won't be calculating this book but i'm wondering if the deals will still liquidate for jim's
or whoever
schedule
if they do
we will have huge oa because we killed the swaps on those physical deals
meaning the desk and customer prices will be the same
we'll see those variances
and at the same time financial acct
should see a variance because the deals liquidated but were not
flashed
in our p&l's
how can we tell if that book will liquidate this month or not
greg
have you had a chance to look at the new forwards details we talked about
we need to add the rac website to our list of programs to be moved over with netco
the website is rac.enron.com let me know when you get this if there is anything we need to do to make sure this happens
thanks
thanks
ruth
i don't know if you still need this but here are the deal #'s for the canadian netback deals
that is all i have found so far
here are the post-id's for today price 0 basis 0 index 0 gdi 0
fyi
i changed a deal you booked on friday from im wc cal to im west
that book no longer exists
thanks
has everyone saved all their necessary files to the netco

we need to prepare the morning reports for the last day of the year
biliana isn't here today
could you please take care of that today for her
thanks
do i need to ask him which ones will have physical or did he tell you anything
susan
could i please get a copy of a blank book request from you
thanks
if you don't have these already
monte
i will help you with these
have you started to set up any new books for netco
yet
do you guys think we should all use the same book and portfolio codes this time to make mini-books easier
also
i think we should have some consistency in book names
make them more descriptive
any other suggestions
sure
i spoke with him today about that already
zach
can you get together friday morning to go over the basics of what we do
i will try to find some old class materials for you to review as well
i will let you know when and where tomorrow
thanks
here are the post-id's for today
please take me off your list
i don't wish to receive any more email from you
i brought some of my natural gas and options books from home
please come by my desk if you want to read one during the day or make copies of some chapters to take home with you
we have been making lists of the directories that need to be moved over with netco
will these directories be moved so that the estate can't use them
or will copies be made so both groups could use the files
if not
we will have to make copies and change the list we have put together already
thanks
we are making sure this week that we have all the files we use listed to be moved to netco
can you please make a list of all the paths and files used to prepare the morning reports
including the var access database
i will need this before lunch
thanks
we have decided to name our books fb-west0 thru 0
for each region we will have a matrix saved for everyone to be able to look at with the book names
trader names
sitara books
p&l file name
global id
and everything else that anyone might want to see
i think this will make things more consistent than coming up with new stupid names like before
all books
including the financial books
will have the same portfolio and book codes
physical books will be seperate but will all be the same
i started a spreadsheet for us to keep track of our books
traders
file names
etc
it is saved in o:\erms\erms_adm\netco\controls\trader matrix.xls please add any other fields you think we should have
jeff mentioned he wants to be able to quickly tell what books belong to what traders
o'neil had this idea
is everyone ready to start setting up their books today
has scott neal gotten back to you yet phillip
zach
let's try for tomorrow morning around 0:0
stop by desk and we'll run through the basics
ryan
can you save a copy of all of the files you did for grigsby
price and position reports
to o:\erms\erms_adm\netco\west
we are taking copies of everything we use now
this is the file that will be moved with us
thanks
we are finalizing the list of files to be moved over to netco today
please look in o:\erms\erms_adm\netco\west and if there is a file you used to run
price reports
the wood report
broker
desk to desk
consolidated p&l for the website
etc
that you don't see out there now
please save a copy to this directory this morning
thanks
thank you
mike
we will be setting up both physical and financial books for everyone
i know not everyone will have physical but to keep it consistent everyone will have both just in case
i have the 0 names you sent jeff earlier
please let me know if that changes
do you know what the structure going to look like
ie
will each trader be assigned specific curves/locations
cash vs
term
how many different people will be setting curves
we will be starting over with our curve files also
we want to only start with the true published curves
we have many derived/internal curves that aren't necessary and if we need to create more curves we will look into it later
since the number of curves will be greatly reduced
we will probably start with one file
thanks
will anyone be taking tori's place or are we down to 0 books
darren the counterparty short name you gave me doesn't exist in tagg
is this a new name
yes
the first three legs are the purchase for 0,0/d
leg 0 is the annuity
and leg 0 is the put
i don't think i know what you are asking
there is a book request form in netco\controls\book request form.xls
i put in the west desk books already
susan is checking to see if we can use those portfolio and book codes
if not we'll change them
thanks
chris was able to get me a copy of that yesterday
let me know if there is anything i help you guys with for the controls reports
i would like to be involved in this process to understand it better
do you have a copy of the detailed procedures that chuck prepared for the morning reports
i am looking for a copy in excel if you have them
chuck
i know you made some extremely detailed notes for the morning reports but i can't seem to find anyone down here that has them
do you still have a copy saved you could send me
here is the list you requested
phillip
do you want me to do anything for the new west curve files or are you taking care of it
attached is a file listing the names and nt login id's for our group

i am in the middle of a project
i will call you soon
susan

please let me know if you have any questions
we put in some book and portfolio codes we would like if they are available

all canadian books to be the same and all physical books to have the same codes please
thanks
please use this form instead of the previous west file thanks
the keyspan deals have been corrected
can they be done by tuesday next week
eol needs these to get this information soon in order to start their set up process
russ
can we get a list of the mappings for all sitara locations
we are modifying our curve files by getting rid of all
internal
curves
we need to make sure that we don't have anything mapped to those curves and if so make some changes
we also need to think about how this change will work with the estate as well
will sitara have a separate database for netco and estate like tagg will
i understand we will now the group to set up new books
can we get some instructions from someone in your group
susan i assume
john valdes and myself will be the ones to take this over
please let me know if susan is this person and we'll get with her today
thanks
john
are you ready to learn your first control function
the controls group is going to let us set up the new books we need for netco today
when you are ready let me know and we'll go down there
or they will come up here or whatever
scott
yes
my group will be the ones to book the demand charges in sitara
can you please contact that regional controller for the charges
central-scott palmer east-phillip love thanks
mike
will there be a denver region for netco
i have assumed that everything will be considered west but want to make sure before we set up the books
thanks
the curve lists are saved in o:\erms\erms_adm\netco\central\current central/ontario curves.xls i can help you sort through those if you want help
the sitara mapping table is saved in the netco file named curvemappings.xls check your regions and if you see any locations mapped to curves we won't be setting anymore
make a list of those and what the new mappings should be
once the new database is set up we will get with russ to have those changed over
thanks
torrey
we have taken over the responsibilities for setting up new books so we will be learning that today
these books should be ready by wednesday
i will know more after we speak with them today
once they are ready
we will send you the matrix you forwarded me
i have a question about that
you have a column for tagg financial and physical
what is the difference
thanks
i have done all of these except the pgl&c deals
scott
should these be terminated
mike
let me know when you are free
i would like to bring phillip love up to meet you
please cancel my membership
thanks
ok
just tell me what needs to be done in sitara and we'll take care of it
bryce
these deals have been corrected
the triggers and demand charges have been removed
deal #0 did have gas flow and i believe should still be settled unless someone says otherwise
thanks
phillip
i tried to breakout the curves that keith and frank will be setting in the file you have been working in
we probably should run these past them to make sure
i tried to breakout the curves for keith and frank in the file you are working on but we should run that by them for approval
mike will be setting all gas daily and physical curves
i think we can combine basis
index and gdi curves into one file per trader leaving only three curve files to load
let me know what you think
once we get their ok on the curves
we can set them up and let them add any formulas they need
especially mikes file
andrew
the following are the people that will be setting up new books for netco
the e-requests have been submitted
phillip love scott b
palmer john valdes errol mclaughlin thanks
attached are the files that need to be copied for the netco files
i will get you the list of curves tomorrow and you should talk to louise for a list of the netco traders
thanks
cecilia
we need to get some new books set up in erms this week for netco
we will be taking over this responsibility from the controls group but they are reluctant to grant us access to risktrac now due to security reasons
these books are needed for many downstream groups and therefore must be set up soon
can you set these up before they are in risktrac this time due to these limitations
i can give you the book and portfolio codes and the tagg short names
please let me know today so we can start asap
thanks
thank you
cheryl
the risk management group will be taking over the duties from the controls group as far as setting up new books
i have attached five book requests that need to be set up for netco
once these are set up can you please call me so i can tell cecilia
i will also need the global id # to give to eol for their needs
thanks
tiffany this is the value by risk type as of nov-0th
price $
0,0,0,0
basis $
0,0,0
index $
0,0,0
gas daily $0,0 gas daily index $0,0,0 canadian gas daily $0,0,0 canadian gas daily index $0,0 let me know if this is what you needed
post id's for today
correction please replace 0 with 0 thanks
correction please ignore post-id #0 it should be #0 with a value of $
0,0
thanks
cheryl
thanks for taking care of these so quickly
i have reattached the central book request with some additional books
the blue highlighted
cent
books were on the original request but were labeled as
fb
and should have been pb as the book name
i assume you did nothing with those books because there was no id next to it
is that correct
i corrected them and also added two new books at the bottom
thanks again
john
at some point i would recommend setting up a mailbox for your new controls group
that way we won't have to worry about who is doing what
everyone in the group will get it
the current controls group did that and it was much easier
scott
just so i understand correctly
for the dollars in green
we are to pay coral this amount as demand charges
sorry
i forgot to attach the spreadsheet
attached are the original spreadsheets with additional book requests in yellow
this should be the end
or close to it
for the netco gas book requests
as before
could i get the global id's once you are finished
thanks
zhiyong needs to get a list of all curves we will be loading for netco
by tomorrow
when you all are done identifying those curves could you please get me a list of the curves by risk type
thanks
attached are the book requests for the netco
books
they have already been set-up in global counterparties
thanks
will you still need the gd curves
gd-hpl/shpch and gd-waha
or can the gdp be used instead
question
once the new database for erms is split for netco
we will have to make some changes to the gas daily curve mapping tables
is there another way to create these mappings other than adding them one at a time
we are getting rid of a large percentage of curves and will be making many changes to the current mappings
doing it one by one will be very time consuming and i want to see if you are able to load them another way
susan
can you please set up the attached book for the estate
thanks
there are a few deals that we have agreed to perform on 0% and ed mcmichael needs to be able to value those deals separately
bob hall will have the mid and back office list and ed mcmichael should have the front office
thank you
here are the nt id's
o'neal winfree currently manages the texas risk management group for natural gas and is also responsible for the benchmark reporting group
he works closely with the desk director and other traders to ensure accurate reporting of the positions and p&l's
he has eliminated most oa variances on his desk and has helped the other regions as well
o'neal and his group recently created a new physical p&l reporting tool to assist the risk and trading groups
scott palmer is currently the east desk lead and was the central desk lead prior to that
he set up and managed the wellhead region and created new reporting tools for the traders to manage their supply
he was also responsible for calculating and reporting the virginia natural gas asset management book and worked closely with the structuring group and others at vng and sequent to resolve any issues or questions
james hungerford has been a book administrator on the east region for the past six months
he quickly became an important part of the team by managing up to three traders
p&l's and making numerous improvements to our daily routines such as streamlining the weapon-x database
automating the new deal checkout and implementing a daily var estimate process
prior to risk management
james was the operational analysis coordinator for the east region and worked with risk management and other downstream groups to clean-up all past variances and helped eliminate future problems
thank you
we have a copy of the p&l format we will all be using saved in o:\erms\erms_adm\netco\blank p&l.xls
if you are setting up your formulas you can use this format to create all your links for the new ngp&l and then change them to the individual p&l's later
we will be deciding how to break out the traders sometime this week
attached is a list of the book names and the traders associated with each book
let me know what you guys need to get all of this set up this week
thanks
do you remember at what price do we own microsoft
jan 0th
russell
i believe that francis lim has been trying to help you with the project we have been talking about
the information below should be able to replace what he may have given you
you can copy these post-id's and change the dates to whatever you like
here are all of the post-id's for the pg
g0 and w0 which are the remaining live books
price 0 basis 0 index 0 gas daily 0 gas daily index 0 these are the bankruptcy post-id's

let me know if you have any questions
susan
what time can that estate book be ready to go
do you guys know which books each of your people will be doing
there is a column for that in the trader matrix under the controls folder
ramesh will be loading our information into risktrac for us once we have all of the information
book admin id is one of the fields he needs
when you have decided can you please input that into the trader matrix and i'll then forward everything to ramesh
thanks
andrew
i have one question about this form
does the book id mean the name exactly as it appears in tagg or is it the risktrac name
attaching the risk type to the end
ex
fb-financial-prc thanks
here are the files that use erms that the estate will be using
some of these directories will have files that are saved with a new name daily
you can pick the latest date to change
o:\erms\excel queries
netco will need a copy of these files moved with them
texas gas daily index curves i will send more if i find them
thanks
mike
do you or anyone else in your group get broker quotes on a daily basis to help set the curves
if so
is there a spreadsheet kept with them that i can get
thanks
us enovate should also be added
thanks
bernice
i added the unique 0 digit data codes to column t of the attached spreadsheets
let me know if there is anything else you need from me
susan
can i please get a copy of the physical portfolio request form from you so in the future we get these physical books set up correctly
could you also tell me what needs to be done differently from all other books
we created our own data codes and sent them to global counterparties
is there anything else different
also
can you tell me when the performance book will be ready
ed mcmicheal needs to value those deals today
thanks
thanks
it is the import gas daily file under curve maint in runm
we are working on an excel file with the intra-month and gas daily curves and will send it to you when we are done and we can try to load them once the database is split
thanks
jan 0th
can we also get the books that these used to be mapped to
that will eliminate about 0% of the work
thanks
ed
this book has been set up and should be ready to go
can you let me know what deals you would like moved into that book and we will take care of it
thanks
please take me off your mailing list
debbie
the credit committee needs to get some information from us that i could use your help with
can i get a dump of the non-terminated deals into excel and i will format it from there
the information they need to see are the counterparty name
cash flows
mtm value
and positions
as always
they need it by 0:0 this morning so if you could let me know if this is something your group could provide me with i would appreciate it
thanks
thomas is setting up a new ngp&l file and would like us to save a copy of each p&l to netco\0\0\region#0
once you decide how you are going to break them up
one file for each book or combine them together
can you save them out there so he can start linking them
i think that for the physical regions it may be easier to keep each book separate because people could be moving around a lot
hey
it's vegas time baby
march 0-0th
feel like winning some $$$$
yes
can you please grant access to myself
kkeiser
and stephanie hopkins
shopkin0
to this book
thanks
this is what jeff gave them for the terminated deals
i need the values by month for gas only
they asked for positions but that will be much harder
if you can get anything like that i can use it
thanks see mtm by month
the file is saved in o:\_dropbox\bankruptcy\eyreqeust.xls
can you also add rbhatia and afay to the access list for this book
thanks
this is a list of the curves we will be using in netco
we may have some additional curves to add to this list but i wanted to get you something to start with
thanks
demand charges and triggers are done
casey
could you get me a list of names for those people in netco that should have access to erv and trv
hal mckinney is trying to clean up this file this week
thanks
do you want to keep any of the old trv files for netco for any reason
we can create new ones once it is set up
also
this is a list of current names and files
if for any reason you would like to have any of these files moved with netco instead of creating new ones
let me know which files and hal will move them to the new database
thanks
susan
we are unable to book any sitara deals to this book
it doesn't look like it is set up as a business unit
do you know what we need to do to fix it
the file is saved in my dropbox called erv_stats
see if you can open that
thanks
i have highlighted the files and names that should move over
i had to add some names to the bottom of the erv files
thanks
jan 0th
casey
here is the file we need to fill out for ramesh to download into risktrac
here is the gas file
forward that file to john valdes and ramesh once you are ready
could you please send all counterparty or contract inquiries to deal validation
scott tackett
thanks
i think i fixed the trailblazer path
the curve description on the curves tab didn't match the contract cb tab
the ref# should go away once you roll it for today
try that this morning and let me know if it works
thanks
ok
the fun continues
we need to assign eol products to traders
torrey sent a file
netco\controls\trader-book template
us gas
_eol new books
with all products and the old book assignments
we need to get with the traders today and get these split out
many will stay the same as before
also
when physical deals are done
will all risk types go to the same desk or will one person be managing the index separately
ex
the west desk used to book all index to grigsby's book
i have told dawn that all risk types will go to that trader's book but if index needs to be changed let me know
thanks
errol
torrey sent us a file with all of the eol products and the old book assignments
he need us to tell him the new trader name
book name and global id today
the file is saved in netco\controls\trader-book template
us gas
_eol new books.xls the global id's are saved in your book request also in the controls file
hey
phillip already made reservations and jeff is waiting to make sure he can go
darren and his wife have made their plans
and dawn and gary have also
i think
i will next week
and a couple other girls from risk are going too
we're leaving on the 0th
returning the 0th
staying at the mirage
you could win thousands in vegas to use for your house
what other vacation can do that
well
we think we should hear something today as far as who we work for now
i'm sure it will be next week though
we're assuming it will happen and have been setting up all new files and databases
it should be interesting
how is your job
does kyle lilly work for you now
later
mark
i don't know if your friend is still looking for risk people but here is a resume of someone i would highly recommend
he used to work for me on the east desk
fyi
to keep things consistent all of the traders
except the financial group
will use their physical books to log in for eol
dawn
please leave all risk types to the same books
we won't be splitting the index out this time
thanks
mike
attached are the files required for gas risk management
please call me if you have any questions
thanks
susan
i am still unable to book sitara deals to the performance book
what needs to be done to fix this
we will get you the ft-ontario and intra-ontario
please call brian gillis in canada for the ft-canada book
do you know what the full name for ft-us-can is
that name doesn't exist in tagg
thanks
min
is this change only for those using enpower
my group will no longer be running any power books and won't need enpower any longer
if this affects the gas applications in any way let me know
but i think that this won't be necessary for me
thanks
tiffany
all of the tagg deals identified by structuring have been moved to that book and we have been calculating and reporting it as of last thursday
the sitara book is still being worked on and should be ready to go today
the files for the broker quotes have been moved from the netco file to o:\erms\0intra\broker quotes
those will be used for the estate
please let anyone else who used those files know to start saving them to the new files starting today
thanks
i don't know who has been saving these daily
can you tell whoever on the west desk to use the new file instead
they are for the estate and need to keep them away from the netco files
thanks
i beleive it is keith and frank
torrey
for those traders that also do deals in canadian dollars
we had to create additional books for those deals
these will not have any eol products associated with them
they will be phone trades
thanks
scott
i put some question marks next to brad
john
pete and sandra's products
you have them down as managing some physical products
will they be managing those physical books
if not
they should go to the physical trader managing that location as before
can you take a look at those
#0 is the valid deal
when the second deal was created
the deand charges should have been deleted
it has been fixed
thanks
price post-id
torrey

i can't tell from your post-id sheets if i'm picking the correct ones
thanks
these are the post-id's that we have pulled
showna and debbie brackett are trying to get the official post-id's from the system
once they get that

thanks
those have been corrected
they tagg pieces have been moved but demand charges were not deleted
mark

thanks
kevin
we have over 0 books that were getting officialized at that time
i tried to get from everyone which post-id's they used that day from houston
chicago and calgary but with that many books we are bound to get a wrong post-id or miss one
i need to get the list from credit or rac to be sure we have the right information
i have yet to hear from them today
i also told z to run with what he had and i'll get with him asap if i find it was wrong
thanks
thank you
oh yeah
he's the one
debbie
have you had any luck getting the nov
0th post id's
i did my best job trying to get them for houston

let me know if you still think it's possible
i would like to get back to zhiyong today
thanks again for your help
this is an updated sheet of post-id's
we added many and deleted some also
hope this works

thanks
ok
thanks for the update
kristen
once zhiyong gets me the information
how would you like this handled
do you want me to fill out the schedule a

do we have to do anything for this
fyi
i changed the west and performance books to your name on the rac website
the attached file summarizes all mtm value by counterparty
in and out-of-the-money trades
physical and financial
you can filter column a for p or f and or column iv for positive or negative values
please call me if you have any questions
thanks
this should help you
yes
i didn't realize it mattered
all caps

fyi
all org region codes will be in all caps if that makes a difference to you
robin
darren corrected these
if you have any questions
please call him
he is the master
thanks
i sent this to john valdes
he will check the book codes and get back with cecilia to have her set them up today
i put in a book request for the canada books two days ago
i will check with john valdes to see what the hold up is
as far as the futures and options books
there should be one book for both
if you have questions about that can you please call errol mclaughlin directly
those are his books and i don't know how they need to be set up
thanks
yu could make some money selling your enron stuff on ebay
the keychain i bought for $0 is now selling for over $0
it's crazy
we were able to get close to the dpr values reported with the info you previously sent me
i won't need anything from you tonight but thanks a lot for being available
i may need to get with you in the morning to get something else together
thanks
please call if you have questions
i forwarded form a to raj

carl

kristin
here is some information requested from e&y for gas

thanks
yes
unless they find something on my background check
cross my fingers
how about you
kristen correction on the # of people
it should have been 0
sorry
carl

arnold
kevin ruscitti

how is your group looking
who's left

jeff
there is a meeting at the houstonian tomorrow morning
is this one for us or did they split the group into seperate meetings
kathy
vladi asked me to give you a call
i will be out of the office until about 0:0 today so i wanted to let you know what we did to populate form a
we gave all post-id's that were calculated on nov-0th to zhiyong wei
from there
he dumped all of that information into excel and we formatted it from there into the required buckets
it will take a few hours for it to get the file ready to use so i recommend getting that together asap
let me know what i can do to help
thanks
there will be some changes to be made to this list
we should know more later this week
thanks
are darren and phillip doing this
could you please re-run the data dump you did for me last week with the attached post-id's
if you could let me know how long it takes i would appreciate it
if possible
could it be ready after lunch tomorrow
thanks
how do we get into test to view these trades
carl
here are the values you requested
i have the detail if you need it
physical $0,0 financial $0,0,0 total $0,0,0 physical $0,0 financial $0,0,0 total $0,0,0 thanks
john
there is another report that needs to be added to our daily duties
it is currently only being done once a month by accounting
i'll show it to you in the morning
could you run the detail for these post-id's in grey
these are the physical post-id's that were excluded from the original request
you don't need to run the other post-id's
just the new column i
thanks again
we are working on this now
we have a book with all physical active trades we will be performing on
we are now working on getting the in-the-money financial trades separated into a new book
once that book is ready and deals are moved
we will be able to report it to you
thanks
you should try looking at duke
they seem to be doing some mass hiring of enron people and giving them big pay raises
i don't have any contacts at duke
kelly little will be working there
but other than that i don't know anyone
have you called scott neal back yet
we were just talking about that exact thing
we knew all the weather guys left and were wondering what they would do
that would be a great opportunity for you
congratulations
kelly will be a power trader
i don't know if she has any experience doing that
i haven't heard exactly why the weather group left
but many of the traders weren't happy that the move was a lateral one and didn't accept their offers
i think that's what happened with them
good luck with everything
it would be great to work with you again
in the bedroom looks better
done
i will also be leaving for vacation tomorrow and returning whenever the hell i feel like it
brian
in an effort to keep things consistent at ubs we have tried to perfect a roll spreadsheet that all regions should use
we added extra rolls so we should never have to add rolls
we have saved copies for our new p&l's in o:erms\erms_adm\netco\0\0\regions0
this will be out new regions file until further notice
can you copy one of those files and use that as your new p&l's
let me know if you see a problem in doing that
we are trying to start linking up all new p&l's to the dpr
can you save yours out to that file when you are ready
thanks
scott
i really think that melissa would be able to handle storey better than kristen
i think we should keep her on central and let you take kristen on the east
are you ok with that
thank you
do you know if all of our books are set up and ready to go in risktrac
ready to report var
ok
once that is done
we need to set up the rms access query to extract the new var and dump it in the positions by trader spreadsheet
ashely
i noticed that there isn't a wacog being used in your p&l
currently it is taking the ua0 volume and multiplying it by $0
it needs to have a dollar value in cell m0 on the physical tab
thanks
we all need to sit down again
could we change the gas daily intra-month and index to gdm and gdy
rather than gdl and gdx
tell me how much trouble that is to change
it also made some changes to the physical org region names
i will have to get you those changes
thanks
now that we know which traders will be moving over
or we should
we need to make a second pass at the eol product list
can you confirm with your desk heads that the list of names we have is correct
and then update the product mappings by tomorrow afternoon
o:\erms\erms_adm\netco\controls\trader-book template
us gas
_eol new books.xls thanks
outstanding
that's the best news i've heard all day
let russ know also so he can break this up for tds
have him create a roll up for south and northwest and a total west that sums up both
i created an inactive books folder in the netco file for all currently unused books
o:\erms\erms_adm\netco\inactive books thanks
there is a file under netco for all currently unused books
rolls and hedge strips
o:\erms\erms_adm\netco\unused books
rather than deleting these
they will remain here until they are needed
the ngp&l will link to these
once they are needed we will start saving it to the regions file and the links will be updated
there is also a hedgestrip saved for each book to the live and unused books files
we should also start creating a common file for each region to post the p&l to the website
let's try to keep these the same format
east has a good file that shows new deals and curveshift
west used a macro to pull in finished p&l's instead of updating links which eliminated some problems
randy could help with this
figure out what format you want and use that for all regions
i think everyone agrees that we don't want to give them a positions file like in the past
they should use tds for that
i believe the trv website should be ready to go tomorrow so we can set up the users and report #'s then
yes ma'am
same as before
thanks
i left a message with confirms
they should answer this for us
that sounds good
how about tomorrow morning at 0:0
i have a meeting at 0:0 and i'm clear around that
only inactivate those books that don't have a trader name next to it on the book request
there are only a about 0 that should be inactivated
good question
i think we should have an excel template set up with all imaginable necessary info that all traders should use
one line per trade rather than one sheet per trade
what do you think
dawn
please see the attached trader matrix template
there were some changes made on the physical global id's
steve south was also added on the west desk
thanks
i am on the 0th floor
0
see you then
after speaking with kim theriot in confirmations
we will not be using the riskmantra entity
per the legal department
all canada to us deals should be booked ena to ecc
using the new legal entities of course
rather than riskmantra
she is waiting on the final word about our new legal entity names
i will let you know what i hear
thanks
no problem
could you please add derek baily
dbailey
to the tds and sitara access list
thanks
here is our final list of eol products
thanks
here is the gas dpr for last night
you will start getting this on wednesdays and mondays
please tell me if this is what you need
thanks
the 0 are all in-the-money financial counterparties and all physical deals we are performing on
we have gotten shorter because that is not all positions we are reporting
to the true dpr we are reporting additional books but we were told for this purpose you only wanted the deals we plan to perform on
we don't need the east/west for gas
i will fill in those additional columns for tomorrows report
will you be sending out a new form or shall i make the changes
do you want an email daily or have you set up a file for these to be saved into
is canada doing their part
sheet 0 has been updated
highlighted
for all trv users
i added the admin names in column h
thanks
we have decided to take the curve history with us to ubs for the attached curves
we have changed the names for some of the curves so column j has additional curves that we would like to bring history
we will not continue publishing those in the future however
thanks

bob

we need to get all post-id's

thanks
thank you

james
could you go back to the detail we used to do the form a

just to check over the names once again
thanks
i got the goldman counterparty names from bill hare and i have found 0 deals with them

greg couch will be taking over the responsibility for the estate risk group and will be able to assist you with your requests going forward
thanks
as seen below
please start using the ena dpr 0 file rather than the ews dpr 0 file to send to chris

there are still about 0,0 deals between ecc and riskmantra that need to be moved to the bankruptcy books
it did all ecc to ena deals
they need to change the script to ecc and riskmantra
we started to move some of the deals manually but there are too many to do
sanjeev gupta has been doing this for us in the past
i left a message with him but you might want someone to follow up with him to make sure it happens before calcing time today
here is a list of the deals if you guys are looking for work to do
thanks
here is a list by risk type that we plan on loading with ubs
there were some name changes to a few of the west desk curves
lt me know if you have any questions
we have created six new curve files for ubs
could you please look at them and let me know if there is something in your files that you are not responsible for and we will move them
also
you can use these files to change or update your links
o:\_dropbox\west curves we will probably be loading these on wednesday for the first time to do our final testing so let me know if you have any questions or need our help with this
can you let me know when you have finished with yours so we can convert them to the new database
thanks if you have already done this let me know
phillip is out all week and i don't know where he left off
dawn has given us until noon wednesday to get them the final list of eol products and book mappings
i know with the trader changes last friday these will change again
the traders had a meeting this morning going over their curves
and it sounds like they are moving some curves between regions and might possibly be losing some locations
since we will be testing everything on thursday
we need to have our curve files ready to load on wednesday to give a prior day curve for portcalc
the west traders are looking at theirs now
can you guys check with your traders and see if they need any changes made to the files
and let them change any links
we also need to create a curve file that the traders can get to
but doesn't give them access to any of our other files
so the current location will not be the final
we can create this tomorrow once we have converted over to ubs
thanks
tom
everyone in risk management needs to get access to eol bridge monitor and reports

i made a copy of your benchbytrader and cleaned it up a little by taking out all the hidden rows and old traders
it is saved to the same directory as ubs benchbytrader.xls can you look at this and check the macros to make sure it all still works

regarding bc utility
i have discussed a gisb with mr
wong and we have been unable to come to agreement due to their choice of law restriction
because they are a utility they are by statute required to bind agreements subject to british columbia

it will not work to agree to british columbia as jurisdiction for this contract
please let me know if you have any questions
or i can be of further assistance
with regards to our discussion on priority of contracts for 0 day firm transactions
the system gives priority to master agreements over gisbs
all things equal
a 0 day firm transaction will attach to the master before the gisb
hope this helps

lunch today
my phone number is 0-0
sounds good to me
is 0 ok
i am so sorry
a lesson on communication
i called and left a message and waited by the elevators
lets try for thurs or fri
thursday is good
no problem
jim
bob
before we do anything on this issue
i would suggest that we need to have developed a strategy on a number of issues
primarily the proper reformation of the px credit calculation after jan 0 and the application of the 0c/kwh surcharge
on this issue
assuming that we haven't discuss the failure of sce to apply our account's past credit with the cpuc
given that the bills were just received
i can't imagine that a federal court would look to favorably upon a legal action
in addition
we have not identified where the
credits
are if they are not on the customer's accounts
my recommendation is to first
a
work with sce
have jeff dasovich run the traps and
b
discuss the issue with cpuc division of energy and see if there is a solution without complaint
if this doesn't get us anywhere before august 0
then it seems that to protect our interest we would need to file a complaint with the cpuc
i am not opposed to lebouef looking into federal action
but that seems a bit dramatic without first trying to exhaust our adminstrative remedies
please call me
jim p.s
there is a meeting on the 0c/kwh surcharge with janet dietrich today at 0:0 in her office
i think you should attend
i think the best person to provide the affidavits for the px credit receivable is wanda curry
if we want to make this claim inside of the ferc proceeding
still an open question

best to come from you
jim
sarah
we have the last draft
i was talking with rick yesterday and i don't think that we want to publish it or use it publicly
it did it's primary job of validating that a non-gas model structure would not be harmful to enron's interests
give me a call
jim
yes
if by aug 0 we don't have the strategy
we should file
but we need a comprehensive strategy before the end of the week
i hope to drive that to conclusion
jim
as some of you may be aware
dick's consulting arrangement with enron ends later this fall
in an effort to make the transition as easy as possible
i would recommend that the following people work with dick to transition on critical committees and tasks
nothing is hardwired
so if we need to change people
let me know
dick will attend the upcoming wscc epitf meeting
not sure of date
but think in the next two weeks
my recommendation is that steve walton attend with dick and become the lead
we may not get a voting seat after dick leaves
but we should try and cover
ray alvarez should attend the wscc board meeting on aug 0 with dick to pick up these responsibilities
charles yeung should pick up coverage for the flowbased discussions
dick will not attend the next meeting in chicago that takes place on aug 0
andy rodriguez should pick up the security coordinator subcommitte discussions that take place sept 0
0
dick will not attend
i think that charles
ray
dick and i should attend the nerc stakeholders mtg on oct 0
0
finally
dave perrino should go with dick to the next wscc octpg meeting
let me know if this transition plan works
jim
not sure if we can do anything
it's paul's call
jim
don't we want the iso to provide to whom the refunds are entitled
jim
sue
we should probably file something on this cpuc docket just ensuring that if these meters are put in place
esps have access on a timely basis to the data if they serve the customer da
what do you think
maybe the vinio could help
jim
can we have a meeting on friday at 0am this morning as an update
jim
yes
shapiro will also attend as i may need to be in houston
jim
jeff
are you going
the list looks pretty good
if not
we may need to have someone there
jim
can we talk at 0am your time
lots going on
jim
jeff
sue
we need to discuss at 0am your time
as well as other things
jim
thanks
maybe we should have nancy hetrick simply put in a place holder
jim
call greg sharp
janel
no one on my team is really qualified
jim
received
nothing
i'll give him a call
jim
makes sense to me
good luck
let me know if you need anything
jim
fyi
cheers
guillermo

thanks
jim
i approve
jim steffes
aleck

sending to others on to list
maybe ursula brenner can help you pull a response together
jim
thanks for update
pls keep sending info
fyi
some info on the ca experience
jim
probably have to work through kaufman for seminar
education cost
jim
agreed
ray alvarez is working with fergus and watkiss
etal to get this taken care of
jim
steve
alan is on vacation next week
jeff is tied up
bryan gottfredson will be compiling this information
by the way
there may not be a listing of who
meaning generators
is owed how much
wasn't disclosed in the ferc settlement
jim
with alan comnes on vacation starting this week
the primary point person from enron govt affairs will be ray alvarez in our dc office
ray will be following up on this and other filings
etc
on this case
jim steffes
lisa
please let me know what else i need to do
jim
steve
fyi on the information your requested
bryan is working to pull this together asap
what exactly is the deadline
jim
bryan
fyi
not sure if you are going
jim
if you want to talk about the ky issues
probably best to get with janine migden
jim
yes
i can't
in a united way event
jim
fyi
the ees usa organization has been reorganized to centralize all sales teams under jeremy blachman
scott gahn's group stays unchanged
harry
you and i may want to let people in the field know these changes
jim
charles + steve + ray + dave + andy
there have been a number of e-mails related to my initial request for a transition plan for dick ingersoll
by this e-mail
i am asking that charles yeung take the lead on ensuring a smooth transition and that all meetings are appropriately covered
please coordinate as a team to work out the details
charles please also consider that jose bestard will be returning at some point in the near future
thanks
jim
howard
i received a call from jeff brown who said that he had visited the nypsc and nyiso to discuss load curtailment
he had placed a few calls into you and hadn't heard back
when you get back
please let me know where this stands
no big deal
but i want to understand what is going on with the load curtailment efforts
jim
a few thoughts before the ng meeting
0
maybe we should
as a team
call transelect
paul buckman
before our ng meeting
you may remember that transelect sent an initial letter into skilling to try and solicit our support for stopping the ng application to be managing member of the arto
i think that it would be good to call buckman and ask if he has a better idea than ng
we are right now stuck between two very bad answers
let aep and fe construct a managing member or have ng
maybe transelect has a better solution
0
chief issues with ng
a
are they
really
independent
having a short position in ny and owning generation in ne effectively makes ng into a
market participant
i think that enron should make as a hold firm position that to operate an rto there can be no agreement with anything less than almost perfect independence
b
who do they feel the customer is
maybe we want to get paul dawson's take on their business model from the uk
it is critical that the new rto operators across the country view traders/marketers and generators as their key customers
what form of regulation for cost recovery of their operating expenses do they want
pass thru
pbr
etc
c
who writes the tariff
i would make a strong argument that the problem with most of the rto work to date has been that ferc has allowed the current incumbents to first write a bad tariff and then assign the provision of service under that tariff to someone who has very little
if any
control over future changes
the rto operator must be free to make changes to the tariff with only two constraints
0
must not restrict the ability to pay facility revenue reqts and
0
must not damage the assets
d
do they intend to build/own transmission and how does this impact the energy markets
will their planning and construction processes impact any long term positions that epmi may take in the energy market
how do they manage to allow other merchant transmission into the business
e
how do they intend to provide balancing energy
the flip side of our fight on congestion management involves the pricing of energy imbalances
what is ng intending to do on this issue
does ng believe that multiple control areas makes sense for a single rto
does ng support unbalanced/uncovered schedules day-ahead
also
just to let people know
kerry stroup will also be working on the midwest rto efforts going forward
please keep him included on the e-mails
jim
leslie
can you coordinate with jay dudley at 0-0-0 on how to change the filing
if at all
on pge's pipeline issue
pge is willing to modify the filing to try and take out the language on native load
they are suggesting that maybe they should sign a contract for the full amount of the capacity
about 0,0 mmcf/d
rather than assume its right
the goal should be to have a final decision on next steps before next friday
aug 0
please call me with any questions
thanks
jim
jeanne
not quite sure that i am getting the picture
let me lay it out more directly
the px credit for october 0 was $0 based on the actual market rates
now ferc is saying that october 0 hourly prices for calpx da and calpx ha markets were
too high
in june 0
can the cpuc change the px credit for october 0 and make the utilities recalculate our negative ctc
what is prospective
have they ever done this before
jim
your buddy
rick
fyi
becky heard michelle foss talk the other day
was very aligned with our perspective
maybe someone for ferc
jim
susan
i put together a short write-up and would like to submit to hr for your mid-year
because you've only been here a short time
most of the responses are to be determined
if you don't have any problems
please come by and sign
thanks
jim
looks good
please make sure that you submitted an rcr
if ed wants more info of this type for other states
i'd like to make sure that we organize our efforts so we don't duplicate too much and deploy the proper resources
thanks
jim
i agree with christi's point
the problem is that those arguments
effectively that real competition will take away market power
are no longer effective at ferc
i think that massey and wood are ready to do something more potent
my primary question is how do we think that appendix a would apply to enron
do we want hirenymous
sp
to undertake a proxy exam to see the real impact
i am going to try and schedule a phone call for next friday to outline our next steps
should anyone else be in on the call
who else could lead this analysis for us
given that we are all so busy
jim
linda
please arrange a phone call with christi
sarah novosel to discuss market power for this upcoming friday
jim
i assume that we will discuss the entire process on the next nerc call
jim
susan
please discuss with ben
you may want to call barbara
christi to see if anyone else has discussed already
and relay importance of this to his future plans to me
key question is whether or not we need to be engaging directly with local governments
jim
nancy
please keep john
charles in the loop on this question
they are both working on next steps for nerc and while not directly related to the rsb
there is potential for overlap down the road
also
where does enron publicly stand on the incorporation of this into an eisb
i thought we were ready to go
finally
are you giving the presentation
jim
linda
let's talk about all expense report matters tomorrow
also
please send out reminders to everyone that i want to deal with this only on friday and not to go too long without a report
thanks
jim
please enter into my calendar
jim
ginger
i am taking that entire week off
jim
tom
can put some analysis into this market opportunity and relay the results to the enron direct team
current shopping credit versus 0 shopping credit versus market
maybe we should be highlighting the opportunity to pick up some quick market share where the saving opporunities are relatively large and have enron direct enter now to lock in the deals
jennifer thome may be able to help you with this project
although she may have some other projects
jim
christi
did this come from ferc
jim
as you can see from the comments below
staff at the texas puc is considering whether or not certain areas of texas are ready for competition
the non-ercot region
who on your teams do we need to talk to understand the implications of this action
jim
charles
nancy
please make sure that we are on the same page
publicly
jim
jeanne
i guess the other big question is this
what is the best argument one could make that any retroactive calculation
and application in a forward-going manner
is illegal
we need to develop this argument asap
jim
rick
how about sitting down on wednesday am
say 0 am
to do this
jim
not sure how this got through the
process
please feel free to call on me if this isn't getting fixed right
also
should we just have pge pull the application and re-file with different terms
also
becky you should let amr know and keep track
he can try and quantify
jim
great
i'll be there
jim linda
please put on my calendar
i'll attend if you think it's important
otherwise
i'm assuming that ya'll are covering the meeting
jim
dung
best to start with jean ryall
in austin
different utilities in different places of restructuring
by the way
aren't you in ebs
jim
please put on my calendar if possible
probably can only go for 0.0 hours
jim
howard
kathleen
steve
can we sit down and discuss our strategies going forward in light of this rd
i'd like to understand where there are opportunities
both for polr outsourcing and standard market entry
i don't think that there will ever be a huge surplus in generation
and there shouldn't be in a competitive market
instead of focusing on something the nypsc can't control
why not work on demand responsiveness
better metering technology would certainly help
let me know when a good time would be
jim
please put on my calendar if possible and rsvp if necessary
jim
looks good
are these
incremental
to the total
may be important to highlight the % growth as well
jim
bryan
thanks for the update
on the first issue
there was a letter sent from the caiso to some congressmen
please find this
also
keep trying to locate the creditors list
we want people that bought and sold electricity
jim
has your initial question been answered
jim
here is a list of point people for issues in the west
jim
did we get the right people to sign-up to speak
let me know
jim
not sure if you knew this
jim
sue
is the issue for the governor's eminent domain or native load exception
very important distinction maybe lost on these guys
jim
charles
very well put
this is another example why it is so important for you and andy r
to be out with the rto teams helping us to be more precise
we need to blend our nerc and ferc advocacy
of course
you realize that elcon will never support a pjm model central marketplace for balancing energy
at the last epsa meeting
elcon really blasted centralized pools
jim
erin
enron is working right now to try and develop its policy on this issue
clearly
our primary goal is to ensure that market makers such as enron are treated fairly by the ferc rules vis-a-vis other market participants
while we are not yet enamored with any policy option
we are committed to helping ferc do whatever is necessary to create a strong and well functioning marketplace
as soon as i have any more
i'll let you know
sarah novosel and i are intending to come to the meeting
jim
janine
where does this stand
i just read the text and agree with harry
most importantly
the hhi may not be suitable given the high degree of regulation of comed service
as important
i don't think the icc cares too much about enron losing market share
not the best lead argument
let's talk
jim
not until all of the key electricity fixes are included in the package
remember rtos are still voluntary
the courts have yet to require ferc to do away with the native load exception
and nerc is in charge of reliability
this is clearly the biggest issue for the publics
jim
talk with rick
but i think this project is complete
fyi
lynne
i am very sorry that i have not yet responded to your e-mail
i am trying to firm up my calendar
not sure that excelon and enron will differ greatly on the key lessons learned
i should know by mid-week
if you haven't already filled the slot
jim steffes
dad
thought you may be interested
jim
bob
sorry this is just getting to you
pls work with fergus to come up with an answer
jim
this is one of those to show to amr to quantify
jim
wanted you to see that doug regarded you highly
my highlights below
also
sorry i wasn't very nice on friday
another very bad day
i'm sorry
jim
evan
who is responsible for completing all paperwork for entering a new market
is it someone on your team or someone from cec
there have been some issues with getting everything coordinated lately and i wanted to make sure that we knew who was on point
jim
sorry that i am just getting back to this
i think that one of the key roles for reg risk analytics is to
validate
the appropriateness of regulatory assumptions in ews retail tariff curves as well as help govt affairs build risk management plans
let's talk soon
jim
who at ews is the head
jim
am i scheduled to attend
jim
correct
i'm in all week
jim
jean
thane
can we have a meeting this week
maybe thursday at 0:0
to discuss this
jim
fyi
you may want to discuss with becky
jim
what do i need to do
jim
hope he is ok
jim
janine
who is imserve
i'm guessing they are a vendor that does billing
etc
you should e-mail evan hughes to determine the nature of the csc arrangement
but i don't think that we want to give our business to a company because they help in one case
jim
linda
can you please pull a copy of the comed oatt that would include the calculation of
opc
mentioned below
janine
doesn't it make sense that we are disadvantaged vis-a-vis their own transmission service and should talk to donna fulton about a complaint at ferc
jim
but where in statue does the icc have that as one of their issues
jim
charles
in planning the transition
please include this issue
jim
cheers
susan
can you please work with ena accounting and others to determine the following to provide to epsa so they can calculate our dues
0
total megawatts of your company's equity ownership as of june 0
0 in competitive generation assets operating and under construction in the united states
including purpa plants
probably good to start with wes coldwell
0
total megawatthours of market-priced wholesale and retail sales for the 0 months ending march 0
0
probably just get linda lawrence to sum up our monthly sales
i would have a separate total for wholesale financials
and use someone from evan hughes shop for physical retail sales
call me to discuss
we need to get this in by august 0
jim
steve
has pr given the go ahead
anything else from me needed
jim
yes
i'll get us a conference room on 0
jim
linda
please schedule a conference room to hold this
jim
sue
do you have a list of the commissions
officials that you have discussed these issues with either formally or informally
it would be good to make sure that we have a running tally
jim
sue
what is our current involvement in the urg case
do we have a range of potential outcomes for each udc
jim
jean
please call eric to understand the implications of filing or not filing on this issue
jim
good idea
harry is the best to start with
jim
i would like to have a meeting today at 0pm to review the work that west power urm has been working on to compare the economic impact of the 0 alternatives
it would also be good to get any other feedback from the meetings with sce and other relevant activities
i will ask my assistant linda noske to get a call in number and a room on 0
please let linda noske know if you will attend
jim
please cover this
jim
to make sure that everyone is on the same page
my understanding is that thane
owns
this issue from top to bottom
thane needs to make the recommendation about moving forward or not
please keep me in the loop
jim
i can't make it
but sue mara will cover
jim
don't worry about the call
thanks barbara
if we need to do anything
please let me knwo
please coordinate a meeting with chad for later this week between chad and myself
jim
0:0 works for me on thursday
jim
works for me
jim
i can make it
now on my calendar
jim
sue
my take on this letter is that it is a little too
jumpy
any way to help make it a bit more to help lynch do something different
maybe work from the arem filing
jim
thanks for the accounting treatment
probably better to have one payment this year and one payment on jan0
charged back to 0
thanks
jim
thanks for the feedback
your model now assumes a modification to the distribution tariff to include a new rate element
that may get around the settlement
although oca in pa will think that now d is going up and there is no offset in the g rate so consumers are getting screwed because they won't switch
also
can the papuc implement this charge and direct the edcs to transfer the funds to third-party generators
seems like that would require legislative changes
i like the idea that there should be fixed charge for icap
one way to get that number would be to go back to the edc stranded cost cases and look at their filed testimony
remember if they are earning more from the market than that $ amount
they are overearning on their stranded costs
jim
send me your phone number
jim
i thought we were responding through some other group
jim
thanks
appreciate the concern
hopefully most of this will be legal time
$ but one never knows
jim
no problem
have a good vacation
jim
thanks
the key
of course
is to create a filing that could not be used against us at ferc on these issues
i guess that amending the filing is better than withdrawing the filing and re-submitting
my only thought would be that by withdrawing
pge provides no trail
jim
steve
as sue highlights below
when people talk about stranded costs ending no later than 0/0/0
they are only speaking about generation-related stranded costs
above market costs for qfs will be
collected
from da customers for some time into the future
wanted to make sure that this was clear
jim
thanks
linda
please work up some letters from me to the people in the file ecar
main
mapp for my review
thanks
jim
the offsite is more imporant
please call lysa akin to confirm the date
jim
you on this call
jim
becky
what's the upside and downside from the settlement
my only concern is that ferc is so swamped with issues may be overwhelming
where is our business going
jim
linda
please reschedule until wednesday
i have a meeting all afternoon on california
tell mike i apologize greatly
jim

wes
wade
you've probably seen this
but ferc issued this notice for jurisdictional public utilities related to a fasb decision
richard
we need to make some decisions very soon
this morning
about enron's submission of data into the pacific northwest
pnw
refund case
the data is due at ferc no later than thursday august 0
the key strategic issues in submitting the data to the alj include the following
0
do we exclude bookouts
ie
only physical transactions
it appears that other market participants intend to exclude bookouts
epmi should also exclude bookouts given that these transactions never went physical and hence are not appropriate to consider in this case
0
do we provide only sales transactions or do we include our purchases
the alj's order allows parties to include purchases only if the selling party is not an intervenor in this case and hence
our purchase would not be included in the data
the alj wants to limit the amount of data to be provided to ease the workload
our initial analysis of some data from other parties is that there will be transaction data irregularities and hence
we should provide all of our relevant sales and purchases
by having the data in the case
we can dispute any inappropriate transaction and ensure that all of our purchases are included in the calculation of refunds
this is key for enron in that our primary defense is that enron deserves refunds as a purchaser to offset any sales refund amount
0
do we provide data for all 0 time blocks
through 0 hours
through 0 days
through one month
through 0 year
the alj's order indicates that parties are to provide data for transactions that are not consistent with the initial definition of
spot
deals less than 0 hours done day ahead or day of
our initial recommendation is to provide the data but to retain our arguments that this is not consistent with ferc's order
the primary downside of not complying with this element of the data submission request is that we anger the alj and end up providing the data anyway after being told directly to comply
in addition
it is possible that by providing all of the data we could be creating the problem that some economist or competitor could get their hands on the data at a later date and
determine
our trading strategies
weighing these risks
i would still recommend to include this data but argue before the alj and the ferc the ultimate relevance
0
do we provide data based on contract date
the alj has requested data for contracts that were valid on december 0
0 that had physical energy flowing after december 0
0 through june 0
0
this would explicitly include balance of the month transactions for december 0 and the associated physical flows
to minimize the hours on these transactions
we intend to enter the transaction date in the data submission to allow for ferc staff to delete inappropriate transactions
i will call you this morning
thanks
jim
left you off
sorry
ginger
please send to rick's team
jim
steve
i've stopped trying to understand the utilities in california and what they want
it hurts too much
but yes
the law allows the utilities to continue to collect
something
from customers
including da customers
for qf cojim
ok
if the ferc team in dc
donna and sarah
are ok
let's support this but let's make sure that we have outlined our
needs
and
wants
and
no ways
before going in
also
who would cover and can we do this in houston
guessing most of the parties in town
jim
jeff
any communications with electricities on virtual direct access
maybe another good avenue for electricities to help its members
now that direct access is dead in nc
electricities could agree to move new products through their stable channel
jim
why is buxton upset
this is good for consumers
what does he want to change his mind and push this forward
wouldn't this just lower the prices to his customers
also
this is why we need to be constantly pushing the political message in the states
jim
buxton is not a true consumer advocate
i thought that he was the guy who put mecc's together
we have a relationship with him
why not work our magic
jim
i'm taking sept 0 off
i think it's labor day
please also note that i am taking off late in september
choose the best date to work through for this
jim
pls update my calendar
pls put on my calendar
john
can you please get with sue
ask linda noske to schedule some time for us to go over
i think it's great
jim
bob
let's discuss today
jim
on what case
jim
linda
pls work with brian redmond's asst to have a meeting with me
him
jean ryall
and becky cantrell
maybe someone from the risk mgmt working group would also go
jim
jeff
please send the invoice to my assistant
linda noske
to have her take it through the system
her phone number is 0-0-0
thanks
jim
linda
i thought that ray set up a daily call regarding the ca and pacific northwest refund litigation at ferc
it's not on my calendar
can you please call bernadette hawkins to verify and put on my calendar
jim
linda
please find out if gordon
mary lynne
and steve can meet at 0pm to follow-on to our px credit discussions
if it does
please find a room on 0
thanks
jim
pls keep sending these
i just didn
t know the case
jim
here are my comments given my very short review of the nga statement
0.0.0 demand response good 0.0 improving energy transmission ok talks about
equal access for all suppliers
even though says
oppose preemption
indicate a willingness to better coordinate 0.0 regulatory hard to read if the section on
no preemption of state regulatory authority
is good or bad
we don't argue that our model preempts any authority
only that transmission service is best defined by ferc
jim
thane
you are probably already aware but if not
enron holds an interest in project cornhusker
a qf in cleburne
there are some issues that may develop with the plant related to its ability or inability to meet specific ercot guidelines
generation investments is managing this asset and relations with brazos co-op
their primary concern is that mirant is brazos co-op's qse and may be interested in playing games with the plant through modification of ercot rules
please coordinate with jean and decide who will call either rick hill or chuck ward
thanks
jim
nothing really
he both had the $ to retire and wanted to spend more time with his family
no
forcing
out
jim
jennifer
i like your #0 and #0 issues for highlighting
on the issue of fuel diversity
enron has been somewhat agnostic
please draft some comments and share with tom hoatson to submit
thank you
jim
what was the explicity capacity
$/kw-mo
component by year for peco in their stranded cost case
feel free to call jr
jim
bryan
thanks for the info
i think that a section 0 would be good to add
who is on each list in a
major
way
sort of your analysis of who is the best company to leverage if we are to work a deal
jim
i have a call into jean ryall to discuss
agreed that we need to keep our ferc team in the loop
jim
when
friday
august 0
0 0:0 pm-0:0 pm
gmt-0:0
central time
us
canada
yes
also
best to coordinate with jeff and sue
jim
is it possible for everyone to stay on rick's staff meeting
0:0 cst
today to discuss our next steps
i think that may allow us an opportuntity to set up next steps
jim
do you want to go to las vegas for this trip
i love you
jim
can we talk about this protest at 0pm
using the last 0 minutes of our call on market-power analysis
also
we need to coordinate this activity with some protests that janine filed in the ohio puc about a failure of implementing a fix for the
native load
exception
jim
can you get a call in number for 0pm
i want to give to kerry stroup and donna fulton to discuss aep next steps
also in the meeting should be sarah novosel
christi nicolay
mike roan
jim
bob
ray
can each of you please put together a short outline of the
a
timeline
b
key decision points
and
c
potential outcomes of the decision points for the different refund cases
if possible
having this before today's call would be helpful
but i realize that this may be difficult
jim
linda
please work with jan
jim
jeff
federico is coming to the states to understand how our policymakers deal with the issue of default service
he is the manager of the italian default service provider
can you please make a presentation next thursday or friday about the ui deal
thanks
jim
a couple questions
0.could the company include distribution wires as well
instead of being just a transmission only wires
0.how many shares would a divesting company get
could this be more that 0%
if so
wouldn't this be over the
control
threshold
in general
i fully support this type of action
agree
jim
sarah
i can't open this
jim
jeff
sue called on friday late and had some issue with the research report that was to go out
she didn't give me any details
how do we get to her to discuss
jim
what do you guys think
my idea is to have a short
0 page
presentation that gives a brief update and then make sure that we understand current positions and current projects
0 hour max
the four of us would deliver
jim
should you be on this service list
jim
becky
thanks for getting this info
jim
good info
linda
i'd rather not use the first week in october
i may move my vacation to that week
jim
susan
can you confirm with the desk
my recollection is that the combination would make sense
also
not sure how this
works
with the testimony we've filed to support natural markets
maybe christi can piece that all together or call tca and get their read
jim
diann
what's the next step
jim
thanks
thanks
jim
thanks
christi
please ask each regional rto heads
all that are being discussed + mediation
to develop one page memo
may want a map with current config and a map with ferc model
let's plan on doing for september 0 or september 0
i'll ask linda noske to work with duran's assistant to coordinate
also
let's give info on current interconnection issues
finally
christi
maybe you could develop 0 key regulatory issues
jim
janine
the other thing that i am thinking is that we don't want to file anything at the ferc without a broad coalition
at the right time
after we understand the facts and our desired outcomes
let's sit down and discuss how to approach ferc
i think the timing is right to make a cogent
well-defined argument before ferc but we need to sell this to the ferc before the filing and we need to have enron as a minor player in the fight
the ferc is looking to help retail markets
jim
thanks
any thoughts on the nerc budget
jim
janine
what's the gas delivery tariff on cge for generation services
do they have a standard service
do they have a good generator interconnect agreement on the power side
jim
sorry
pls let me know the outcome
jim
dave
i'll look at today
is there an rcr
jim
i am not attending
jim
christi
can you please send any and all summaries of the rto orders mandating mediation for ne and se to vicki sharp
also
please include any other information that is helpful to understanding these issues
thanks
jim
fyi
i wanted to make sure that everyone is on the same page related to utility costs in california
these costs may be
will be
collected from some utility customer
potentially including direct access customers
about $0.0 billion
this money includes our negative ctc amounts
should be financed through corporate debt
no securitization
enron's position
bundled service on jan 0
0 pays fixed c/kwh bucket #0 cdwr cost from jan 0
0 through bond issuance or march 0
0 about $0.0 billion
about $0 billion for spot purchases and $0.0 billion for long-term buys
enron's position
dedicated rate component
drc
for all residential and small customers
larger customers are assigned direct responsibility for the undercollection on c/kwh
balancing account for holding utility even
bucket #0 prospective generation costs for bundled service post march 0
0 urg = $0/mwh
retained generation and bilateral contracts
bucket #0 ab0 non-generation stranded costs bucket #0 ab0 generation stranded costs
let me know how this turns out
if you need a contact
let me know
also
everyone should be aware about an aggregation project under phyllis anzalone
ees legal has found a loophole to the time restrictions on electricity contracts and the appropriations risk that we need to check out
jim
ray
let's discuss on today's refund call
jim
sounds good
guys
i agree that we need to file at ferc
but we need to also get in the field with a strong message supporting ferc asap in the southeast
i'd rather go down swinging
maybe a least find out the objections of the parties across the region
including pucs
stakeholders
etc
what about building a short schedule
maybe coordinate with dc office on key members
jim
good job
i think this makes alot of sense
who would cover pa and nj at retail
you
jim
linda
please arrange a good time tomorrow or thursday to talk with aleck
jim
thanks for doing this
jim
probably not
thanks
jim

eb0 please attend if possible
latest information on cpuc decision
commissioner bilas filed an alternative draft for the cpuc that would
* hold da suspension and have the cpuc conduct hearings that would work out details including impact on bonds and phasing ending of da
* resolved issues related to credits and payments of negative ctc
and * hold hearings dealing with bottoms-up ratemaking for da
this is effectively an updated version of the alternate that bilas put out last time the cpuc considered this issue
it is a long-shot that this alternative would be approved
our current information is still that the cpuc will vote to suspend da as of sept 0
jim
john
how about i take the
delay
side for $0
jim
i think that we should support the effort
i would not get into the specifics in any region or the specifics of the proceedings
this should be an opportunity for enron to
spin
its message
rtos help us help our customers
jim
sounds good
why have exit fees and limit to open enrollment
jim
right now i'd let the ferc make that call
if asked
enron believes that incorporating fla into the southeast makes great sense for florida consumers
more access to low cost markets
etc
why is the fight ours
let's keep it alive before ferc but not make it a big push for enron
jim
what happened
jim
john
louise
i wanted to make sure that you were aware that ferc has ordered natural gas sellers to provide monthly reporting for transactions relating to california
we are
of course
seeking for ferc to modify its decision
given the politics surrounding california energy markets
it is unlikely that ferc remove in whole the reporting obligation
govt affairs has talked with the west gas team about this new obligation and how we respond
if you have any questions
please call
jim
makes sense
jim
please see pg&e response
jim
thanks for the info
will be in touch
jim
jennifer
please review and discuss with me if you think there could be
financial
products placed on top of this utility service
ie
could we get a customer to agree to this and then offer a swap to fix their rate
jim
fine with me
i finish up with an ees op comm meeting at about 0am
jim
amr
you may want this
jim
is this our responsive testimony
jim
becky
thanks for the update
i think that maybe you should take 0 hour to walk through the deregulation history of pipelines
maybe ingaa has some nice history
jim
amr
please take the first stab at two presentations
for each business unit
that would lay out what our key issues and decisionmaking process for these issues
jim
what do i do
jim
i am worried if we give the mm
penalty
ability
especially before the fact
this feels alot like the nyiso implementing some market remedies
ferc can act quickly to abuse if it is found
jim
this gets at some of the buckets of $$ that may or may not be charged to da
we continue to try and pull together the facts surrounding the potential surcharges to ensure that the book is properly marked
jim
any way to work on
0
moving to 0/0/0
jim
steve
thanks
looks good
some thoughts for you to consider
0
not sure that impact #0 makes sense to present
no real reason to set ctc = 0 c/kwh on jan 0
calpx was still in operation
i think that impact #0 better captures the idea
also
probably not good to use the term
ctc eliminated
maybe should say
ctc = 0 c/kwh
given the cpuc's march 0 order
the utilities have a claim for additional generation related stranded costs until march 0
0
0
in calculating impact #0
what did you use as the jan 0
aug baseline
did you calculate the hit of
$0.0
from actual bills or based on our dj index model
there is a fundamental difference in likelihood based on the baseline
also
i assume that the feb
aug timeframe was relatively low because ees and eemc had most of their load on bundled service
0
probably should discuss in a footnote the different models for px credit calculation and most specifically the pg&e adjustment
also
may be interesting to have the $ impact of the pg&e adjustment
the rate adjustment to re-capture their previous mistake
i think that this is something we need to go into the cpuc to fight pretty quickly
0
should impact #0 and impact #0 apply to sce's loads
in column 0 it looks like it does
sce is not currently hitting our bills with this surcharge
0
probably better to model impact #0 as of oct 0 not sept 0
0
can you break out the volumes for
vintage
contracts versus
retail gen with passthru
contracts
you haven't shown anything for
a
utility undercollection costs or
b
cdwr bond fees
these costs may hit our vintage contracts
jim
pls work into my calendar
jim
i'd be happy to come to the meeting on sept 0
i'd rather stay close to the bldg for the reception
jim
john
look at the letter from caem below
they want us to sign on
not sure that enron adding its name is the best idea
also
are the sections listed the right ones
maybe we can change this without our name
jim
please process this request
jim
susan
please take the lead on coordinating our response
thanks
paul
how is everything going
wanted to make sure that i hadn't been unresponsive to the project
anything critical that you need from me
please let me know
jim
agree
would be good to have the utilities
answer in graphic form
0+ rtos
versus ferc's model on a side-by-side
discussion of the tca work on natural markets to support ferc
jim
please give me your comments before the meeting
jim
fyi
hey
maybe here for our anniversary
jim
thanks
thanks
by the way
it is only a
suggestion
i know that i can push pretty hard at times but it's only because i believe that both of you can handle it
you're both doing fabulous jobs
of everything going on
i never worry about the ne and se rto mediations because i know that you guys are going to get everything possible for enron
keep up the great job
thanks for everything
jim
cool
sending messages in real-time
jim
linda
pls print out for me
thx
fyi
california is playing games with the market again
jim
sweetie
here is the address
scott karro 0 west 0th street apt
phj new york
ny 0 i love you
jim
info on the sce response
jim
i wanted to make sure that you had seen the language jeff references that 0
explicitly recognize the px credit as part of edison's undercollection
and 0
permit edison to pay debts associated with the negative px credit in the earlier e-mail
call me with any questions
jim
eric
please give me a call
i would probably recommend that you sign a new contract with dick given that we did not intend to renew his option year
jim
i'll discuss tomorrow with bob
jim
david
i will cover for meeting and let you know if anything happens
jim
i plan on attending
jim steffes
sarah
two issues that we should work on
first energy discusses cbm
not sure of their position
and mapsa deals with icap
my recollection is that icap will not be addressed at this time
seems to me that we should try and propose some resolution or at a minimum a separate proceeding to mediate this issue before 0/0/0
what do you think
on cbm
now is the time for ferc to get rid of this discriminatory practice
jim
this is the list of the parties opposing the nerto and their arguments
jim
my only addition would be to strengthen the answer to #0
rtos
even if formed
do not explicity resolve the question of the native load exception
i think that this is critical to highlight if this issued is raised
jim
sounds good
please arrange on my schedule
jim
john
i think that sue is still on vacation
jeff may be able to help
jim
bob
when should we file our complaint at the cpuc
jim
i wanted ir and pr to be aware that within the next few days the pg&e bankruptcy team will file with the judge enron's current claim
we intend to ask the judge to lift the stay so that we can file at the cpuc a complaint to recoup our current receivable
i'm not sure what our public statements have been and as soon as we prepare the filing
i'll let you know
if anyone has any questions
please give me a call
thanks
jim
jamie
thank you for keeping me in the loop on your activities
while i am always supportive of more public statements pushing competition
neither i nor enron can sign on to the letter
first
i am concerned that having enron sign on will distract from your messages
enron is a
hot button
in dc and will change the proper focus
in addition
i would argue that the recommendation for a national commission is out of place with the current timing of ferc and congressional action
which is imminent
while a commission would delay action on the hill and at ferc
thus supporting the forces against competition
let's not study this too much
we know what to do
move away from the commission
also
i'm not sure how providing federal grant money only to states that promote competition supports our efforts
making ga pay for pa is a distraction from the main fights at ferc and on the hill
finally
i would guess that more funds to ferc and other agencies will only be used to increase enforcement against those in the industry
while enron wants markets that work well
the core problem is that we haven't deregulated enough
not that markets aren't working
also
i don't know where the recommendation numbers from the bush/cheney plan came from
i think it was an earlier document
there are no such numbers in the final printed version of the report that i have
if you want to talk
please let me know
thanks
jim
are we sending anyone
jim
amr
i'd like this as well
jim
fyi
i agree with bob that the reporting issues are important
i also think that focusing on the
lessons learned
from the ne rto and se rto mediation would be interesting
have people from different industry groups discussing their views of where the mediations concluded
assuming we are finished by october
any outstanding issues between epsa members and between epsa and other parts of the industry could be discussed
thanks
jim
no truth from what i know
a couple of points
0
the language in the relief indicates that we are trying to
determine the validity and amount of px credits owed to ees and eemc
is this correct
isn't our primary goal in this complaint to
a
have the utility return the net credit to our bills and
b
to allow for recoupment againts all non-generation related charges
0
throughout the document the idea of
t&d charges
is used
i assume that this is shorthand for all non-generation related charges
we pay ctc and public purpose costs as well as t&d
0
not sure if cpuc regulates the esps
the filing makes this case in the first paragraph
thanks
jim
fine
dick and i have worked out exactly the hours for my group that he will work through mid-oct
why not have dick submit his charges for your group directly to your assistant
bernadette is in dc and having these charges running around the country may cause great confusion
finally
since i have not looked at his contract lately
i assume that in using this contract to move forward immediately we are not creating any other obligations with dick
thanks
jim
pat
please keep jean ryall and thane twiggs in the loop on these activities
specifically
they need to let the desk know before we take any formal actions
thanks
jim
i was wondering if someone from our trading desk would take the lead
not necessarily someone from govt affairs
jim
way to go
jim
lisa
i would recommend that you send mike day the language to clarify #0
jim
are we ready
i thought that we were still moving through the process
jim
harry
can you please review and provide input on comments
especially as it relates to keeping open the san diego market
jim
see last bill
jim
jennifer
can you get a copy of the sbx0 0 and provide short synopsis
thanks
jim
janel got something on this from pri
not sure about how much media it got
jim
a short analysis that indicates who would face the brunt of this bill
enron
and the mechanism
$/mwh or % of income
jim
donna
becky
do you have any good points of reference on the history of natural gas restructuring
jim
i've sent out some feelers on a good book
i'll look around my desk etc
jim
i didn't calendar
or at least i don't remeber
when will this happen
jim
call ozzie pagan
jim
dave
with ees
push into serving smaller customers
the issues in this situation
potential affiliate abuse and unfair sharing of information
will become more important
when ees focused on national outsourcing
this was less an issue because our products crossed many jurisdictions
this issue
of course
is especially important in recently opened or opening markets as the affiliates try and secure large market share
we are also watching for these activities in places like mi
va
and oh
jim
we need to let jeff richter and tim belden understand the implications of this for current book of business
jim
vicki
along with everything else
this bill continues to be discussed
we don't think this is a high probability
but wanted you to be aware
and more importantly
this is california
i'll keep you up to date
jim
jason
dinner is at 0pm at the house
we are catering from eatzi's
casual dress is preferred
see you then
jim
janine
if we have draft tariff language
i'd push pretty hard
jim
i will be setting up a conference call for later today to discuss our latest view on developments in the california market
if anyone has any specific questions before then
please call me at 0-0-0
jim
we need a model for the entire midwest independent of the ability to changejim
0pm works for me
jim
fyi
it would be helpful for you to be on this call
jim
the meeting to discuss california issues today has been set at
eb 0c0
fyi
fyi
fyi
please coordinate going forward with epsa
jim
here is the proposed decision
appreciate any thoughts you have on how to fight or when
jim
bob
pls send alan the overviews you and ray put together earlier
thanks
jim
bob
pls update me with all parties ripple claims on this afternoon's call
alan you should get on
0:0 houston time
jim
i want to do this today
jim
angie
i will be traveling and unable to attend
hope everyone has a great time
jim
scary
sue
what were the figures for the two months prior
jim
i don't understand why you were denied access
did we improperly file
call me
amr
janel
please add these people to your lists
jim
attached is the complaint that ees intends to file tomorrow against sce related to the recoupment of our negative ctc
as you aware
after returning our customers to da recently
our billing department was expecting that the past negative ctcs would be returned to our customer's accounts
this has not happened nor after conversations with sce will it occur
this complaint is the next step in the process of attempting to recoup these funds
primarily ees does not want to pay for utility charges for our customers while an outstanding negative ctc balance is due
one key risk with filing this complaint is that sce may consolidate this case with the earlier complaint that is currently on hold
probably not too big of a downside
we will be paying the bills into the cpuc for holding until the resolution of the complaint
any questions or issues please let me know
jim
with everything else going on
it has been hard to develop the monthly report for ena management
i'd like to re-start this report and provide an update at the beginning of september
while i am aware of some efforts
i am sure that i don't know about everything that is critical and on-going
i need get a list of projects that your teams are working on for deal support
regulatory risk
and advocacy
i am truly at a loss for current deals that government affairs is supporting and our expectation of closing dates
for each project
i need lead government affairs person
financial impact
our your best guess
background and key issues
and strategies and next steps
this list does not need to be exhaustive
but simply the major activities currently underway
thanks
i appreciate your help
jim
alan
appreciate your thoughts
jim
thanks for the info
while there may be some differences in presentation
there don't appear to be any basic differences in the analysis
all of the discussions of the legislation need to be aware that the passage is highly uncertain
i agree with the analysis that if you have never been da and sign up today there is a very large possibility that you will pay a surcharge
assuming the legislation passes
let me know if there is anything else
jim
cheers
hope you and gracie are having a good day
i miss you guys
california is a difficult state to understand
things are crazy
jim
good news or bad news
my quick read is that ferc looks like it is trying to end the obligation but is waiting for an industry solution
what is new power saying
jim
bob
please be on the next rcr call to update
see ginger for time
jim
alan
here is the original note for your update
jim
rick
i see that amr has taken over the fundamentals group
the fiefdom grows
jim
angela
the value proposition for a customer is related to which buckets of cost would be bypassed by switching to da
if a customer goes da after august 0
0
based on the discussion about surcharges in the legislation that has only passed the assembly energy committee last night
with still a very low probability of success of being signed by the governor
the customer would pay for sce undercollection
pg&e isn't being discussed on this piece
dwr bond costs
and dwr net unavoidable
the hardest piece to calculate
which belden said on the last call he simply couldn't given the tremendous uncertainty
is the dwr net unavoidable
if the customer has been da since july 0
the customer could avoid the dwr net unavoidable
but the legislation could change or not pass and the cpuc could do something else
each customer needs to appreciate this latest information and make a determination about what these amounts will be
the key question i'd ask a customer is that they need to try and keep their options open
of course
all of this assumes that the cpuc doesn't go back and suspend da even earlier than july 0 or something else crazy happens
remember this is california
jim
rick
any insight into this statement about whalley and frevert
i'm guessing that this is just lay's vision of what is now impacting our company
appreciate your thoughts
jim lay wasn't more specific about the two men's assignments
``they'll be looking at all of the businesses
the wholesale unit
government affairs
anything that affects enron
lay said
leslie
did any of the gas commercial people respond
also
any communications from ena and barry t
on this
jim
thanks
we need to be very cautious about signing on to documents that seek to delay the start date of any rto
unless and until i hear something different from ferc
my going in assumption is that enron will be one of the only voices on this issue
we should only give on this issue when real value is being created
why not file a
me too
on the issue of seating of the board w/o agreeing to everything else
jim
agreed
talk w
joe h to confirm that we are consistent with preferred p/l policies
jim
pls fax to sf office today
thanks
jim
leslie
what would it cost for outside counsel to do the hearing
maybe running an rcr through with the biggest $$ allows shapiro
etal to discuss next tuesday
jim
jennifer
sbx0 0 and sbx0 0 are important to follow
jim
i'll be going
you should go if you want to go
it's a good opportunity to network
jim
yes
i think one thing that is good is for every california call you make us go through the key bills in some organized outline
thanks
jim
lamar
there is alot of noise in the media to find some customers who will state for the public record that they will be harmed by the retroactive suspension of da
at one point
you were going to get some customers
names
contact info to pass along to the media
any luck
karen denne with pr is getting quite a few phone calls from california media sources
the strategy has to be to downplay enron and have the customer pitch
their pain
by this action of the cpuc
give me or karen a call
jim
nancy
0
are we able to vote
0
if yes to #0
what is your recommendation for our vote
thanks
jim
alan
paul
see john shelk's e-mail below
alan
you may want to coordinate
jim
steve
i will be traveling back from ca tomorrow so i can't make the call
some things to be aware of
we filed aug 0 before the cpuc asking the cpuc to re-instate our customer net bill amounts
jeff dasovich will call john fielder to try and see if there is anything that we can do without litigating the case
or at least delay until after legislative session
if complaint moves forward
sce will probably consolidate the complaint with earlier disputes
enron is preparing similar filing for pg&e
although we need to seek relief from the stay
0
california legislation sce mou bill
that includes da issues
moved aug 0 through assembly energy committee
needs to go to assembly appropriation and full assembly
hertzberg is trying to get out by weekend or early next week
by removing the conservation easements
the bill has lost some liberal democrats
governor davis is asking business to find 0+ republicans to move the bill
trying to modify
0
surcharge effective date to sept 0+ and
0
get more comfort that sce will pay our negative ctc if $$ exists
also
the windfall profits bill has moved through assembly committee
it has to go through assembly appropriation and full assembly
jennifer thome has prepared a synopsis that is attached
litigation about both subpeonas was heard this week in sf and sacramento
mike kirby believes that he may have swayed the court in the sen dunn to provide a protective order
a final decision may be issued next week
0
ferc refund case enron presented its
ripple
claim earlier this week
range of refunds
non-netted
is very large
please see bob frank for exact $$
i have also attached a calendar of both cases prepared by alan comnes
oral testimony is being prepared in pnw case for next week
both proceedings come to a close this week with an expectation that the alj issues a recommendation next week
or soon thereafter
looks like the best date that a large number of parties can agree to for a single ne rto energy market is nov 0
pjm thinks it can happen by may 0 but wants some cushion
sarah novosel is trying to best position us vis-a-vis the other stakeholders to drive it earlier
also
icap and control area consolidation is not considered at this time
christi nicolay believes that the alj will recommend moving toward a pjm model
0
cpuc decision to suspend da retroactive sue mara continues to push the cpuc to remove the retroactive date in the current proposed decision
some rumors that the cpuc will again delay a decision until sept 0
confirming so please keep close
vicki
fyi
this bill continues to move
jennifer thome prepared this synopsis
please let me know if you need anything else
i'll ask jennifer to keep you updated on any changes and status
jim
sounds like flying sunday night
jim
charles
if the rto has the interchange function
what else is needed for
virtual
consolidation
jim
not too sure how important
but wanted everyone to see the discussion from jamie wimberley at caem
jim
jamie
thanks for the external view on legislation
i agree that most of the bills don't
get it right
the hope is that the ferc can do that without too much legislative guidance
which of course would be wrong
not sure that setting up a new federalism on this will ever work
not enough $$ to states to get them to overcome the political power of the utilities
jim
thanks
susan
when we get to a point to make comments
please let me know
jim
no
just wanted your thoughts
thanks
i'd say we want tariff language before any investigation
i don't typically like investigations
i like complaints
my thought is to pre-sell tariff changes to ferc with a broad coalition and then get the ohio puc to ask ferc the question
jim
jean
you may want to call jeff and find out where he is going with this talk
we still need to meet with a detailed plan on texas
maybe next week or soon thereafter
jim
john
to your point #0burr
probably want to bring in steve montovano on the nc puc question
we have worked with a local lawyer in the past
i think her name is allison duncan
that could help with this question and demonstrate that having an rto does not make a state deal with retail competition any sooner than it wants to deal with the question
steve montovano could probably be of assistance here
maybe bring in allison to dc to deal directly with the staff
jim
i am not sure if we have a claim to
px credits
our claim is to the negative residual of bundled less the px credit = negative ctc
jim
ray
fyi
some information on how we are talking about the claims in the bankrupcty case
jim
it's on my calendar
unless i need to be in california
i'll go to dc
jim
janel
this paper has two great maps that highlight the utilities
model for rtos and the ferc's current proposal
would be great to build this into some dc and other political coverage
jim
did our $mm supreme court attorneys have any heartburn
jim
here is the file
while there are some quotes
remember that the analytics were never taken to the final decimal
we were mainly trying to make a political point
jim
jean
what is doug going to say
do we have the right messages
what about the retail issues in texas
have we considered these
jim
vicki
evan
please see the e-mail trail below
the papuc has assessed ees $0,0 for its costs
we intend to protest
do you have any idea of who this bill would go to
jim
tom
there does appear to be some intelligence gathering going on at the cpuc
you should speak with legal about the inquiry
clearly the cpuc has a right to ask anything they want
it is my understanding is that our customers have a confidentiality clause in their contract that prohibits them from responding
jim
thanks
while i appreciate the concerns about the diffferences in east and west
we've waited too long for utilities to agree to make rtos happen
we can finesse this forever
but we need to give ferc some tools to force the process
jim
yes
sue
mike
jeanne
attached is the letter from pg&e regarding our payment
issues
discussions this morning have this gameplan
0
file at cpuc and bankruptcy the appropriate paper
$ to hold our issues
we need to have a call at 0 houston time to discuss and ensure that the filings are consistent
if anyone has any problems
please let me know
jim
ray
these are being finalized today for filing tomorrow
i'll send you final
jim
is there a room inside enron
jim
christi's call
lamar
it is critical that every customer in california that switched
signed new or renewal customer
during this year
we need a contact person for each account
the key to securing a better date is to have the customers push the governor and the legislature and the cpuc
we are able to provide phone numbers and contacts through our trade groups
jim
looks like we need to make sure that this nerc
rto policy dispute gets identified and recognized as what it is
discrimination
jim
great plan
are we discussing today at 0 dc time
jim
linda
pls print attachment
jim
please feel free to attend
jim
yes there has been a shift in the thinking
away from the
natural gas
model and toward the financial structure
some of this is related to the political realities of the us market and ferc
some is that our traders in the east are comfortable with pjm and have been making term markets at pjm west hub
all of this assumes that we should be able to migrate to a more physical model if the industry needs to later
i do think that it would be helpful for you to get together and work up a discussion for all government affairs to explain the key differences and what policy discussions we need to focus upon
i.e
setting up good
hubs
and auctioning transmission rights
also
i think that any thoughts you have on the implications for ees are important
not sure that either model is really
great
for competitive retailers
the difficulty is that our predictions of load and the actual usage will always be different
as long as
0
our analytics have the data to
price
basis between hubs and from a hub to a customer and
0
there is no discrimination in allocation of transmission rights then our ability to sell at retail will be competitive
jim
please put on my calendar
also
how do i find out how much vacation i have
jim
i heard today that brad nebergald will take over the ill market under greg adams
i'll try and track down all the facts
jim
don
can you please add becky cantrell
melinda pharms
and guillermo canovas to your nat gas weekly discussions
not sure if they will all come
but i'd like someone from government affairs at the meeting to try and keep us up-to-date on the issues
jim
please put on my calendar
jim
fine
same here
jim
steve
rick
fyi
pg&e bankruptcy counsel has provided the below stipulation that holds any further action on this issue for 0 hours
it appears that pg&e doesn't want to be anywhere near the cpuc
provide more details as they go through
jim
please do not contact these customers
fyi
enron signed the following customers after july 0
we are checking on wal-mart
i would like bev and hedy to rank these parties with their ability to help in sacramento with our messaging
once you have this
let's talk this afternoon to plan going forward
as you can see from the e-mail
we are going to have to work through our business people
jim
sent the wrong address first time
jim
not sure
it was stated rather quickly in passing
fyi
same holds
let's not talk to wal-mart until we work through our business folks
jim
thanks
jim
linda
please arrange a call-in number for 0:0 am houston time for everyone above for tomorrow
purpose
legislative strategy
thanks
jim
becky
please keep guillermo and melinda in the loop
jim
next steps
0
leverage ees customers signing post august 0 contracts the language in sb0 continues to hold the date for suspending da as august 0
ees signed a number of very large contracts that benefit important in-state businesses
we are trying to establish a strategy around the following segments
a
california restaurant association b
cmta via the aerospace industry we need all of our customers to call
a
the governor
b
the key legislative members
and
c
their trade associations
leveraging the trade associations is critical given cmta's support for the bill
we can release
very quietly
to influential persons wal-mart
raytheon
and northrop
it is also critical that we try and contact someone from boeing to get their read of the bill and its impact
our understanding is that they have recently signed a deal with another marketer and will be cut out by this bill
any help in communicating with boeing is critical
please let me know how best to approach the calif rest association
what should we do
is it better to have our customers call
i will work up some talking points and phone numbers with sue mara to use in these discussions
0
fight the cpuc on retroactive order sue mara is working through arem to convince the cpuc that their proposed decision would be illegal
continue to push on this front
thanks
jim

jim
before we invite ferc staff to the trading floor
let's set up a gameplan and run by the trading floor
i don't want a dispute with trading after inviting staff down here
jim
sarah
alan

guiding principles
i.e
prospective market rules
etc
jim
fyi

jim

b
trade associations
key messages
0
don't have the cpuc make wrong decision tomorrow 0
sb0 can work if da suspension date = sept 0.0 or later 0
setting this da suspension date does not mean that customers will escape fair surcharges i am putting together a gameplan right now for who to call and the messages
0
i called sandra yamane
at marathon communications
re
ceo contacts
once i receive the list
we'll make a decision on how to proceed with that group

mike day
can you please draft language to use on the assembly floor to
fix
sb0 per our interests
hedy
bev
who should support the amendment
don't we need a member to carry the provision
wouldn't it be better if we had cmta or the ca restaurant association
is this possible
0
scott govenar is calling boeing's lobbyist to get them
interested
thanks everybody
keep up the great work
jim
for the monthly update
on coalitions
i was thinking about other market participants
agreed that cinergy could be the vehicle
also
maybe make an informal presentation to ferc before any filing
etc
jim
fyi
these bills are currently moving through the california legislature
not sure if the bills will be signed into law
please call with any questions
from my quick glance
only good news is that it appears that the windfall profits tax would not apply to retail contracts in effect on date of enactment
jim
bryan
pls include on the monthly update
jim
lisa
rick shapiro has offered to present
i think that we can work up some presentation for 0 minutes
let's discuss soon the details
it is on his calendar
jim
the latest information we have
president lynch of the cpuc said today that the vote on suspending da would be taken tomorrow
proposed decision remains at suspending as of july 0
there is still a possibility that the cpuc will hold this vote
in addition
there continues to be a legislative fix that could override this decision
please call with any questions
jim
fine
jim
michele
rick
please see the note below
it is critical for you to call your clients
jack in the box/burger king and wendy's
to try and convince them to push their industry lobbyist to ask for a change in the date
call me at 0-0-0 or 0-0-0
cell
to discuss
thanks
jim
i've asked sue mara to try and develop through arem some form of legal action that the industry could file if the cpuc goes through with its current plans to retroactively suspend da as of july 0
our goal should be to file tomorrow evening
assuming cpuc action
to make sure that we are on board
it probably makes sense to have a phone call to discuss the draft sometime tomorrow early afternoon
0pm pst
i will leave it to sue mara to arrange with the people on this e-mail a conference call to discuss the draft
my choice would be to not have enron file the paper
but rather work through arem
thanks
jim
linda
can you please get a copy of the report below
spending wisely on private hubs
for me
if it costs $$
i don't want it
thanks
jim
jennifer
please make sure that vicki gets regular updates of both bills
thanks
jim
christi
fine work
looks like we are moving forward in the se
a couple of discussion points
i am still not so much in love the lmp as this paper makes it seem you are
i don't believe there is a perfect solution
also
the document is not consistent relating to control area consolidation
for instance
the issue around ca or rto with tagging makes no sense if there is only one ca
the rto
this is important to highlight to the alj
the easiest way to solve the problem is to do away with the archaic systems of the old world
also
i still don't fully understand why we are happy that the sac gets to pick the ima
i personally despise the concept of a sac
never has worked when times get tough
also
no real discussion
or maybe i missed
of timing to implement
next phase
anyway
great work in the mediation
keep pushing these guys from the south
thanks
jim
thought you should see this
jim
should we talk about the implications for the px credit given this pd
i am guessing that this would significantly alter the calculation for pg&e
moving dwr from $0 to $0
do we want to file comments on how this should than resolve the px credit process
jim
i wanted to re-confirm that you are covering
thanks
jim
please set up a meeting on monday with becky
thanks
this guy runs a small think tank
tv and radio program that tries to push competitive ideas
he is very pro telecom and energy dereg
not sure if this is something that makes alot of sense for enron
but thought i'd get your spin
i'll follow up with you
jim
thanks for the material
i am discussing internally
will keep confidential
jim
good info
i like the reg orig plays
amr should track our success
jim
jim
i'll be staying downtown
once i finalize my plans
i'll get in touch to finalize our meeting
you're right about our thinking
probably just to get a feel for some ideas
nothing formal
thanks
jim
lisa
i don't have any funds for this
sorry
jim
christi
i am comfortable with trying to settle
i hate that this new commission has to litigate this case
it is important
however
that we focus ferc staff on the broader policy changes necessary throughout the industry and not just on entergy's tariff
jim
hi sweetie
out here in california
trying to rally support for competition
hope you and grace are having a good day
i love you
jim
thanks
jim
david
here is some info the windfall profits
jennifer can keep you updated
jim
please review first section
jim
jose
thanks
also
feel free to send to joann hill in houston
jim
susan
please put in an rcr to discuss asap
probably next week
i think that the key issue involves the inclusion of financial transactions
need a solid message from industry that this is inappropriate
which epsa members are filing this info
jim
some thoughts from bob williams
jim
please let the right person know that i will be on vacation
jim
thanks
fully agree
i figure sarah's already committed to #0
jim
thanks
please include becky cantrell in this meeting
jim
your call
let's set up the meetings
don't you think
jim
scott
good to hear you were ok
let us know if you need anything
i'm stuck in dc right now and trying to get home
jim
great
i agree that we are losing money
that's not the reason for getting out of this case
what is the upside
even if we win
we are only forcing ferc to reconsider at some later time
is this really the best strategy
jim
yes
i had called him to set up a meeting
we talked recently in pa when he told me he was taking the job
i'll arrange lunch
if everyone wants to
soon
but don't delay talking with him
he wants as much help from enron as possible
jim
good to hear from you
i hope all of your family is well
i was in dc on tuesday am and drove in last night
jim
no known timeline yet
i'm still discussing internally
jim
ok
but let's keep the time and $ minimal
jim
john
thanks for the update
as long as the ferc is fully in control and the ero is not a
self-regulating
organization
i assume we'd be ok
the ero must be fully under the control of ferc
jim
sue
please work with diann to determine if their calculations are tariff driven or simply an internal process of sce
thanks
jim
fyi
rogers
ferc has already filed a policy statement providing for cost recovery of
security
upgrades assuming they are reasonable
i know that the bush admin will now have the response as its top priority
i think that it will take a couple of weeks before we really understand the implications for further energy reform
ferc postponed announcing its work plan this week but my guess is that chairman wood will continue down his course
retail competition in different states was already under fire from the california situation
not sure if this week's events will have any major changes
thanks
christi
let's talk
we are arguing against nerc
but kevin needs to understand that something must be in its place
we have a policy that we are supporting
giving reliability to ferc
and that is enron's approach
have you communicated that to kevin
also
on rps and energy source reporting
i agree but this may be a part of the final package
also
the language i read allows the ftc to construct a process that makes it possible to not use day ahead markets
jim
attached please find sept's government affairs report
if you would like to discuss
please let me know
thanks
jim
sue
here is the list of key customers in ca that may support our efforts
please work with tom riley to coordinate
jim
steve
if you have not called sce yet
now may be a good time to do so
given the failure of the legislature to resolve their problems
jim
yes
i intend to produce this monthly
we had been doing it before
if you have any questions about the matters included
please call
jim
elizabeth
i'd like to let bryan take over this project
jim
ray
i assume this makes sense and you are incorporating into the case
jim
diann
i was under the impression that we had taken all necessary steps to protect our customers
is this problem just related to residential customers
jim
not sure if there is much to do
i was just sending this e-mail because i saw alan working to find a copy as well as john shelk's team
wanted to make sure we weren't duplicating efforts
jim
it sounds better on fm
you can pick up the wonderful vocals
didn't hear too much from rush on the drive
he was probably in a bunker worried that the taliban was after him
jim
more info
christi
when is this meeting
also
dave forester is looking for someone to present
through rick shapiro call
is this the same meeting
call me
jim
he is at the state dept
glad to hear things are well
jim
thanks for the info
jim
thanks
pls send out
jim
diann
so it is correct to say that ees is responsible for the final bills
if yes
how much $$ is this
jim
anthony
evan
who should process this
jim
i'm ok with this
jennifer will be good for rto campaign

is sue mara going with you
who else is going
anyone from commercial or scheduling
my understanding is that ray alvarez is attending
0
do we have a list of issues that we want to go through with the caiso
maybe outlining our top ten before the meeting and getting internal agreement
maybe even with the other participants
makes sense
thanks
guys
don't know if we need to do our own study
probably want to get with this prof to discuss
i agree with his analysis that the electricity markets needs a bunch of sellers
means we should push for distributed generation
thanks
linda
yesterday you mentioned i had a small work assignment during the meeting
didn't get the exact details
any info is appreciated
jim
charles
please work with susan lindberg on this as well
jim
i only have one question
the nyiso may be replaced by a nerto as soon as this year in december
what is the timeframe of the contract
also
the nyiso rules may change
what happens to our deal
do we have rights to restructure
what happens if icap or ucap goes away as an obligation
jim
i'll be on holiday during this time frame
don't wait for me
jim
not sure if there is any real
issue
we can push
maybe something on the p/l side
see joe hartsoe
clearly this idea that rtos will be anti-security is mistaken
it just implies that there should be redundancy of systems
jim
bryan
add this to the report database
thanks
jim
susan
jim
does change in law mean the implementation of the ne rto
that process is underway and whatever happens with its implementation we should already have a knowledge of
jim
call thane twiggs
i'd also be interested in seeing this through
there was a little confusion about enron's position earlier but we are now ok
jim
tammy
i sent this report to john and louise last week
intend to make it monthly
similar to earlier
i will include you on it going forward
sent to john's asst
call with any questions
jim
is this good or bad for enron
my take is that this doesn't help us push for one rto
jim
please add to reg orig section
jim
don't know where you guys are with the negotiations
but here is another small issue with pg&e that would be nice to work through with them
jim
michael
i've asked the outside consultants to give us a % change for the impact of the refund case
try to give these to you asap
ray alvarez will you please follow up with cra and jan acton
thanks
jim
thanks
i think that this list is fine
any thoughts to including the key industrial customer and legal rep for the munis
coops while in this area
jim
sounds good to me
any thoughts to have milnthorp support the conservatives and devries
or someone else
do the liberals
jim
should we try and agree with the other market participants on a list of issue prior to the meeting
maybe coordination also with ferc staff prior to the meeting
don't want to appear that this is
ganging up
but we do need to be prepared to go in with a clear idea of what is a
good
meeting
jim
too late
i will be attending
jim
christi
like we spoke about yesterday
the key play here will be to understand the retail opportunities
let me know how your efforts to get a good synopsis goes
don't forget to use jennifer thome to help in this effort
jim
thanks for the reply
we will be reviewing the applications in due course
probably best to work through the standard process
becky
fyi
does egm have any past advocacy on nurf
jim
i'd let alan make the call
as long as we understand the issues well
maybe no reason to take commercial to the mtg
jim
a couple of thoughts
0
ashley brown and rick have a great relationship
don't hesitate to use rick to find out some details if you need him
0
are we supporting this
i don't understand why we would agree to make ng the mm with this process
paper
thanks
howard
have you and jeff brown talked about the mg deal
i want to make sure that you understand fully and appreciate any issues
concerns
thanks
do we need to have a phone call with you
harry k
charles y
sarah n
christi n
john shelk
gloria o
vinio flores to make sure that enron is on the same page
i don't think that we will see much support from the business people
although maybe you and i can sit down with evan hughes to get his buy-in
let me know
jim
do we need to have a meeting to work through this
what outside counsel is supporting the sale right now
jim
dan
spoke with janet dietrich yesterday
slight change to our advocacy versus our monday discussions
after meeting with sean holmes
it was agreed that our policy work would say
0
no retroactive da suspension
at least not earlier than sept 0
0
don't end da but study how to allow it to continue
if the cpuc does suspend without retroactive
the fear is that re-starting the ca market will be very difficult
please call me when you get some time
jim
thanks
as long as the business guys
and king
spalding
aren't preventing the appropriate filings
i'll assume this deal is done
jim
thanks
does howard understand your deal and the going-forward issues
if any
that he needs to be aware of
i want to make sure that he knows what is important and unimportant to this
and other load curtailment
jim
paul
please give me a call
if possible today
i am taking vacation from tomorrow through next week friday
jim
linda
pls put on my calendar
thanks
jim
bob
did we send this
jim
eei's work is nothing more than the nerc language
but shorter
still the key difference
self-regulating versus standard setting
given that eei seems to believe that the canadian issues are minor
why get rid of the self-regulating nature
jim
becky
thanks for the updated list
i will include it in our database
please continue to coordinate with roy boston on the
info
reporting
jim
linda
please set up some time
about 0 hour
after i return from my vacation with dave duran and rick shapiro and myself to discuss enron's wholesale
retail advocacy positions
thanks
jim
fyi
please try and attend
bob
it would be good to have your issue list on the tfg brief and next steps before the meeting to this group
jim
bob
any concerns with this language
not sure if we are even going to file
but want to be ready
sue
while this draft talks about july 0 retroactive date
i'd guess this would be filed if the cpuc does anything before the ordering date
jim
bob
jeff talked with fielder
your thoughts on next steps
jim
fyi
janine
i would have epmi be the party of record
also
please make sure that susan lindberg gets a copy of all filings to pass along to the midwest desk
thanks
jim
on holiday
i am trying to find out if anything went out and if so
will be in touch with the document
jim
fyi
richard
fyi
please add to the database
jim
thanks for the informative phone call this morning
having the key issues presented in one place was very helpful
to follow up on the meeting
the following are action items for the group
0
december 0 market readiness update meeting thane twiggs
wholesale
and nancy hetrick
retail
will have at this time an understanding of the billing and settlement issues
or not
with their respective areas
we need to ensure that ees and epmi are able to get the necessary information to make sure that their bills and settlements are working and that we can bill our retail customers
i will ask linda noske to set up this meeting
if anyone hears anything else about the market delay
please let jean ryall know immediately
as of right now
it is my impression that we all agree there is no delay scheduled
0
congestion pass thru to ees
retail customers thane twiggs
nancy hetrick and jim steffes will get with ews and ees counter parties to try and work through the ability of ees passing thru congestion to its customers per the contract language

information flow all policy statements from anyone within government affairs should be first vetted with jean ryall to ensure consistency and conformity
also
all people on the to
list above should be included on all e-mail traffic
i know this may sometimes slow down response to business people
but i think that we can all agree that no one has all the information in this very fast moving environment and unless we have a central clearinghouse we may send the wrong messages
it is also critical that all commercial people interested in texas need to hear about the latest
by having jean ryall in the center
she will be able to ensure that no one feels
cut out
the bi-weekly meeting should be held with jean ryall as host to follow these issues in a timely manner
0
wholesale products thane twiggs was going to keep the team apprised of our products and pricing info on a regular basis so we are informed about the market
finally
it is critical that everyone work together to get the best results possible for enron in the texas market
this is our
home
base
we need to make sure that our business efforts win big
thanks for everything ya'll have been doing to achieve this result
jim
beth
who on your team can i get to move forward with this report
jim
please include this information
jim
vicki
i have heard recently that ees is signing up customers in texas that
passes thru
congestion
there may be some billing and settlement issues given ercot's systems
basically
we will not know based on our bill from ercot what each customer's congestion was
i want to make sure that ees billing can determine how to charge this
who should i talk with
jim
leslie
please let me know what you need to get this issue properly defined by ees
one option
maybe
would be to take the customers back to sales service
would there be any problems with this
please let me know
jim
bryan
please include the first 0 on the regulatory ventures section for next month
jim
sarah
please pound epsa into submission on the ne rto
jim
becky
i spoke with don black
please work with donna greif to get this done
she is responsible according to don
also
if possible so we don't have to rush our it and pay extra money
what about asking ferc to give us a 0 day delay for filing
probably just file to do it and ask for forgiveness
thanks
jim
fyi
use as necessary
linda
sarah
please get with jean to discuss
i don't think that enron needs to send this right now with everything else
jim
confidential
do not distribute outside the company
attached is a spreadsheet of how prices may change with the ferc refund case
this is still subject to change
hope this helps with the negative ctc calculation and negotiations
jim
good memo
thanks
keep up the good work
jim
becky
i hope that i didn't come across too strongly just now
our budget is again under fire by the business groups and i want to try and do everything we can to create value for the businesses
i appreciate what you are doing on this
thanks for everything
i understand the bind we are in with timing and the importance of getting this report in to ferc
jim
jean
please take the lead working with mike d smith to clarify that we don't have any issues
thanks
jim
here is the new file
what do you think that about having kerry take the lead on all mapp area rtos while also supporting roan in miso/arto
not top priority but i think this could be a good opportunity
jim
your call
i'll support you on whatever you decide
jim
can we talk about this and a number of other issues tomorrow
i'll try and get linda noske to arrange a time
jim
please get this to fundamentals
thanks
jim
lisa
you should also attend
jim
glenn thomas was the chief guy in the gov office during peco but was relatively quiet
he is now the chair of the papuc
he will probably just discuss how wonderful a job pa is doing
i don't think that he'll want to pick on calif
if you want to talk with him prior to the meeting
i can give him a call or steve montovano can arrange something
jim
that's good
jim
here is the note
fyi
jim
mike
epmi is the qse
as long as our customers don't mind that we are deciding their congestion charges internally
then this should work
my concern was that our customers would balk at enron deciding how much of our costs they should pay
jim
donna
i'd say that it is a commercial matter
try and push the bill back
i know that paul says his rc is closed but someone above him has to have some $$
jim
we need to discuss the economics of this on our book
assuming that these costs hit our pocket and not our customers
jim
why does edison care about dwr stranded costs
are these the costs of the bonds or the above market long-term contracts
jim
linda
sarah
i intend to come to dc tomorrow night and attend the epmi v
ferc hearing
if i still have a seat
i'm planning on attending the geni meeting wed pm and thurs
thanks
jim
thanks for the invite but i'll think the dc team should brief greg on the beltway politics and energy policy
i'll join you guys at the supreme court invitation window
jim
jim
how about breakfast on wednesday this week
i'm coming in tomorrow night and could do breakfast on wed
jim
jean
is the puc going to agree on aep's motion
please see below
what are we doing to stop this movement
aep is ready to go in ohio with the same notice but just haven't done anything in tx
jim
thanks for keeping wes and mary lynne informed
i give this chance a very low probability right now
but we'll see
jim
can we change the project lead on the rto nopr on standards of conduct to be both lisa yoho and leslie lawner
also
can you call the project leads before the memo goes out to make sure that they are aware of their responsibilities
just a heads up
in paragraph 0
your language is that this is addressed only to the people on the chart
i think that rick intends to send out to everyone in ga
maybe we want to change to indicate that people are welcome to be included in teams if they were not mentioned
thanks
jim
jim
just trying to follow-up on the next meeting
any news
harry
nancy
i am somewhat concerned that the implications of having to act as tax collector is creating a push to change the way reps work with the t&d company
in enron's advocacy throughout my years
we have always asked the pucs to make the marketer the
customer of record
better limits the utility control over the market
now it appears that this good decision of the puct has tax implications and means that we have to process the taxes
i don't see that trying to support a change is a good thing from our long-run business
moreover
if we are paying gross receipts taxes and didn't include them into our customer costs than we made a mistake
this is a cost of our business
let's talk
jim
jo ann
do you know if dan staines has an active employment contract
charles
after our conversation today
i thought that i'd outline some q&a topics for you to consider
0
how does nerc define
security
important to differentiate between national security and system security
0
what is nerc's role in national security
0
will rtos degrade national security
system security
0
what does enron think about calls to restrict access to network information such as transmission maps
0
does enron oppose additional emphasis on securing electricity infrastructure
this q&a should not be released to the public
i think this is just to make sure that all of govt affairs is on the same page and our dc team has good answers to hard questions
thanks
i'm on my way to dc
please ask my asst to set a good time to call with you on wed
thanks
unless jean hears otherwise
i don't think that enron needs to be doing anything that conflicts with the key policy arrangement on the marketer being the customer of record for the t&d services
jim
what does mike roan think
also
will they help pay for our
natural market study
in the se
jim
lisa
give me a call about this and item #0 below
jim
please print and ensure that jose bestard has this info
jim
have we done my travel for nerc meeting in vancouver
jim
looks good
why doesn't epsa propose a timeline for the ferc to order
this could be a signal that we only want one
rule change
date
also
maybe we can build in kevin's argument about uncertainty hurting liquidity and market dynamics right now
jim
the statements
jim
rick
you indicated that nerc disavowed their discussions with the press about national security and rtos to nb
i may have misheard you
i think these attachments would prove otherwise
finally
i'm sure that rj rudden is just fronting for southern
jim
paul
can we have a phone call with our reg team on friday to make sure that everything is a-ok
i want one final run through
if yes
please let me know by phone and i'll ask linda noske to set up the call
also
i owe you a call on sue
jeff
are you in thurs
jim
haven't checked voice mail at home
in dc
have time to talk right now on phone
jim
jeff
how about a call tomorrow to discuss
jim
fyi
the first memo
here is my proposed budget
jim
mike roan and tom hoatson would be the best
jim
lynnette
please talk with pat keene about nevada
some customers will have access
jim
this is a non-ercot texas utility
jim
rick
belden is in houston next wednesday and a number of the western team is going to visit with him about current status and issues
also
he wants to get more info on the pjm model
congress has re-scheduled the hearing on reliability for the same time
can you attend the belden meeting in houston
presto is coming for the pjm model discussion
jim
dave
do we have a strong preference for what dstar utilities should do
i think that we want to communicate with omtr and others at ferc to push a single rto in the west
leaving ca
outside
also
having the transco originally within the rto west makes alot of operational sense and should not limit the economics of the transco
jim
rick
please see attached
lot's of $$ from ca
jim
thanks dave
the critical things for us to take-away are the key priorities for the desk moving forward
on this
i want to make sure that kevin and tim are comfortable with the evolving process of implementing rtos
option 0
wait till completely ready or option 0
start with basic and
improve
thanks
jim
becky
my only question is one of emphasis
are points 0&0 the key for barry t
if so
should we move them up higher
also
why the very lenghthy discussion of pooling points
the length makes the points after that discussion hard to appreciate
maybe a list of bullet points up front
jim
should we add a project titled
interconnection nopr
for susan lindberg
jim
susan
can we sit down tomorrow or monday for 0 minutes to discuss
maybe at 0am friday
want to get an idea of the timing and our position
thanks
jim
please put on my calendar and arrange travel/hotel
thanks
mary
as we discussed
please find a list of our project team leads on on-going wholesale matters
thanks
jim
could you please find out what group carlos works with and pass him some information
thanks
jim
info you wanted
jim
thanks for the info
not sure what we're doing
i'll pass this along
jim
please consider this candidate for the position
jim
probably want to talk with jay lewis and other product leads
i'll get some names
jim
did you attend
did we file comments
jim
thanks for the info
we need to push for other good load programs in pjm and new england
jim
guys
we need to quickly put together some talking points on how to respond to aep's request for delay until 0
my understanding is that aep in texas is wholly outside of ercot
if wrong
please inform
aep needs only to file a good amendment to the ferc oatt
or spp needs to do it for them
asap
my basic model for provisioning of energy for retail competition in non-ercot texas is that delivery to the border of the oatt provider
for instance delivering a into-entergy product into arkansas and paying for losses would be sufficient for delivery into the woodlands
jean was going to call luiz to get this issue on the burner
thanks
paul
what happens if bpa doesn't join
jim
pls come by at 0am
agreed
in fact
my understanding is that the ercot protocols state that if congestion is greater than $0 mm
year the model would change
the market has reached $0 mm
jim
dave
can you please send to rick shapiro the agenda for next wednesday's meeting
thanks
jim
here are the final slides
wade
home 0-0-0 cell 0-0-0
we should also make sure that paul kaufman and pat keene attend
thanks
thanks for the info
i'll leave in your and leslie's capable hands
jim
sarah
should we try and lobby any of these witnesses prior to next week
i was thinking about john meyer and peter cramton specifically
jim
i'd have susan lindberg and charles take on this
jim
john
on this bill
i would think that as far as our competitive businesses go
we should work through epsa
better to have the industry speaking with one voice
to that end
do we know where epsa is on this
reliant and mirant will have a much larger impact
finally
we probably will need this ability for our control area operators
jim
i think that kerry stroup is handling non-miso/arto midwest matters
john
i'm heading up tomorrow
do we need a call today to make sure that my ducks are still in a row
i don't have the barton draft handy
jim
shirleen
can you please send me the most recent version
thanks
pls get with susan to make sure coverage is appropriate
jim
sounds good to me
i'm out on wednesday but in the rest of the week
jim
my comments
i assume that in the enron filing we will make a stronger argument for sticking with the 0-0-0 date
also
critical to highlight that the ferc should have one
major
change date
not multiple given the liquidity problems with significant regulatory change
finally
break out competitive retailers in the list of the one rto coalition
every state inside this region
except vt
has competitive retail access
furthering this effort with further the policy directions of the states by lowering wholesale prices and making business
easier
for companies like ees
we should play this up
we are really pushing hard on the physical retail gen side in nyc and boston and taking another look at pa and md
this is the real benefit
that consumers
bills go down
i didn't see that language on consumer benefits
jim
thanks for the info
please stay closely linked with the rto week activities to try and read wood's questions
also
john meyer from reliant is testifying
what will be his position
should we talk with him this week to coordinate and try and move him the right way
wasn't he the head of congestion management in ercot originally
i think this is wood trying to ask him how ercot works
what will he say
thanks
jim
sarah
pls coordinate with kerry stroup
he is the mike roan of the upper midwest
jim
fyi
is this moving forward
jim
sue and jeff
i am having a meeting with vicki and janet dietrich on thursday to discuss our view on the ability to extend our current contracts in ca
for customers already on da
can we discuss this today or soon thereafter
my take is that the udcs will be indifferent to this
maybe
and our #0 priority is to work to get the pg&e model adopted across the state
any news on how sce and sdg&e will move forward
thanks
janine
i have not yet talked to kerry about this but the translink is moving forward
will you do it today
jim
fyi
please do
jim
howard
if the one rto doesn't have a day-ahead market
what happens
jim
thanks
if you need anything else
please let me know
jim
talk with john shelk in our dc office
jim
ban
sorry to take so long to reply
family is fine post nyc attacks
not sure if we have any needs right now
i'll keep you in mind as the budget
staffing moves forward
take care
jim
looks fine
thanks for everything
jim
thane
pls work with christi and sarah to find a time to call john
jim
before i send this louise
i'd like your thoughts
the element that drives the ea # higher than i would have thought is the large number of people who are working on rto and nerc only matters
i've made a decision to assign these people to ea rather than spread to ees
i could change if you think appropriate
thanks
jim
lisa
please include g
canovas in these discussions going forward
thanks
sure
jim
dasovich this is in your court
jim
i looked at it today on the plane
i don't see any issues although we are in the middle of budget process and will see if this impacts this request
jim
need to also include the moneys owed to enron and its affiliates related to the wholesale power transactions
we should also seek to clarify the language about us supporting the pe advice letter proposal on going-forward
jim
the ews west power urm desk will need to determine the $$ at stake and help us manage our financial exposure and the appropriate policy response
it's their $$
so far
my understanding from the desk is that our current policy recommendations
as outlined in the mike smith memo
are the
preferred
outcome
i'll reconfirm
jim
rick
this is the spreadsheet
jim
louise
here is the analysis on how many govt affairs
ftes work on enron americas matters
the bottom line = 0 professionals in group
0 ftes on enron americas
call if you want additional information
also
i am trying to arrange a meeting for this friday to discuss our next monthly update
which i am finishing hopefully tomorrow
thanks
jim
perfect
pat
i received your voice mail
will be testifying this morning
i will try and call later today
thanks
jim
fine
i still think that any obligation is a mistake
just improving a bad market is not going to help
make sure that dan allegretti is in the loop
nepool is putting something like this together
jim
on point #0
i think that at the end of the day
ferc will not deal with the negative ctc directly
all they will do is reset prices
the utilities and the cpuc will then have to decide the legality and the equity of modifying the px credit and hence the negative ctc
we have tried in the ca refund process to highlight the fact that much of the
high
prices were due to inappropriate policy and actions of the cpuc
governor
and utilities
the core problem with this line of argument is that the refund process didn't ask the first question
what or who is to blame
it simply took dysfunction and ran
we are trying in the context of the rehearing case to ask ferc to restart with the right question
also
remember that we aren't going to have a solution in the ferc case until sometime next year
probably after sce gets its money
finally
i think that the right policy decision is not to
re-bill
negative ctc but rather to prospectively recover the costs
on point #0
see point above
i doubt
however
that all
high
prices can be seen as just a result of underscheduling
jim
fyi
fair points
my dogma machine is running at high today
don't disagree with your thoughts
let's get the answer that works for the business for the long-term
jim
diann
i agree with bob
please let us know as soon as possible if sce is willing to discuss this fairly
jeanne
i guess that we would update our complaint if need be
thanks
jim
i think it's a fair statement that enron doesn't currently support the barton language
on this issue
i would argue that any penalty imposed should remain the purview of ferc and its procedures
jim
mike
let's discuss
i don't want to overextend our involvement to all regional reliability councils and all working groups
if the mapp rtc is critical
let's understand why and staff as best we can
jim
jim
do have a final copy for my files
i assume that we submitted
jim
i agree with john shelk to not attack the cbo report
while the cbo again and again relies upon academic studies to state that generators
may
have withheld power
the basic argument is that
deregulation itself not fail
rather
it was never acheived
in addition
the paper states that
much of the blame for california's electricity crisis attaches to the state's restructuring plan
but not to its objective
electricity deregulation
in addition
california's response of
directly intervening in the market
a response that could prove costly to electricity consumers and taxpayersi hope that we can use this to persuade ferc that they are missing the boat on the refund case
the cbo has now stated publicly that the fundamental market conditions and the state's poor plan and actions created the financial and political crisis
the cbo finds that
wholesale electricity prices were higher than they probably would have been in a traditionally regulated market or a more fully deregulated market
because
features of the restructuring plan limited the responsiveness of the supply and demand sides of the electricity market
seems to me that we need to devise a strategy to get this message out
together with our details of the policy failures
this cbo report clearly undercuts the
political
arguments of the davis administration who had every opportunity to fix the plan and who has now not only bought into horrible long-term contracts but has passed through 0% of the high costs to consumers
jim
today after the hearing i attended lunch with john anderson and phil harris
one of the primary points of discussion involved what to do to respond to the nerc legislative efforts
basically we agreed that a straightforward delegation of authority over reliability to ferc made sense for all of the groups
agreeing to that
the idea is to review the bingaman language and see if our groups could agree to that language
i think that internally enron is already there
john shelk
if you could pls send out the language to everyone on this e-mail to get agreement that would be very helpful
i'll let you know how we next proceed
if anyone has any problems
please let me know
thanks
lisa
who should i send this guy to
tim battaglia
thanks
lisa
i haven't forgotten about trying to find a name
was on vacation in early october
i will ask around for the right name
hope roger and you are doing well
grace is keeping marianna and me very busy
she's now 0 months and pretty much runs the whole house
talk with you soon
jim
sarah
christi
let's make sure that we get our comments together prior to the phone call
how about a phone call at 0:0 am cdt on friday
also
probably don't need everyone on the epsa call so maybe we should organize our participation
pls let me know
jim
steve
we did originally file that the replacement for the px credit should be the dj index
my recollection is that we did withdraw this argument
however i've include sue mara on this to double check
if we haven't
i'd guess that is no longer urm's position
jim
fyi
probably too early for you guys
jim
not that i know
jim
david
my thoughts
i would change the section
reliability
to
operations
the current framework is non-standardized
poor seams interface under access to transmission i would change it to say that
not all users on the system take service in a non-discriminatory manner
utilities can't discriminate versus like users
under generation
i would change
optional
to optimal
i don't also understand the 0%
easier to say 0%* *
public power recipricoity issues
thanks
jim
thanks
ok
thanks
i hope that lora can send a copy
jim
yes
peter is the one who i spoke with
my testimony went fine
me too
jim
steve
got a note from ees that there was a energy summit in ma to discuss next steps of restructuring today
the meeting is today
are you going
did anyone go
thanks
thanks
thanks janine
also
please keep paul kaufman and jean ryall in the loop
we need to make sure that we do this nationally
thanks
jim
fyi
this is especially problematic given that ees and ena can not comply with the reqts as defined
jim
agree
in fact this was john anderson's only problem
my position would be to simplify bingaman's language to not define any organization
jim
thanks
janine
i want to make sure that our comments allow both a retail option and a wholesale option
let's also focus the puco on the fact that bidding leading to negotiations is the best solution
allows for creativity
jim
please coordinate on this
jim
here is my testimony
i have one attachment that is being sent via fax
thanks
jim
attached is the testimony that i filed today asking thh puc of texas to open the retail markets in the spp territory
thanks
jim
the best outcome is that there is an obligation to dispose of load through this but the mechanism is negotiated
jim
i read the same
it was crazy
their solution is to tell us to do what we said didn't make sense
we won't give the ferc made up information
jim
thanks for the draft
will circulate internally and respond
jim
here is pjm's attempt at nerc language
i think it makes sense for us to support this
jim
my understanding is that we are going to work ark
jim
mary lynne
do you need anything on this
jim
how about wednesday oct 0 next week at 0am
jim
thanks
no major issues
jim
thanks but my group has an all day budget meeting
maybe some other time
jim
yes
her name is linda noske
what does this mean
jim
harry
christi
we need to be coordinating on this
you both met with these people at different times
i don't want to be creating work or stepping on each other
i don't think there is any problem
but let's sit down and coordinate
thanks
jim
please let me know what we're doing on this
you are the project lead
go get
em
jim
sarah
you're call on working with epsa
get everything you can
i don't understand how
new services
is moving fast enough
jim
sorry
i'll be in austin testifying
jim
good luck
guillermo
before you send any letters
please make sure that steve montovano is the in loop
he manages that region
jim
change the language on operations to include
coordination of service and planning for transmission
thanks
jim
no
although the lack of a concrete decision is a
decision
just not one we like
our goal is to get this dealt with by end of november
jim
christi
some interesting language for the icap team
please forward along
jim
jeff
in a budget meeting
will call this afternoon unless something critical
thanks
jim
sorry that i didn't get to you sooner
the head of the group is tim battaglia who is the best person to work with
jim
not really
i tried to get to talk to her but never could get an opportunity
jim
didn't get invited
are you going
i don't plan on sending anything
do you think we should even though we didn't get any invitations
jim
i'll play the cheap course
jim
ray
looks very good
we need to stress the points on what we need ferc to do
fix their mistakes in the rehearing
one other point
maybe we should stress that ferc could open these proceedings and not delay the decision because the cal iso is taking so long
also
don't be shy about describing how the process is going so slowly and the
abuses
of the cal iso and its lack of independence
jim
jose
charles
thanks for the update
i am concerned that
customers
are talking about having nerc deal with commercial matters without first agreeing to ferc's control over everything
we should discuss the goulding report when you return
jim
let me know about how you intend to move forward
probably the same team as the ca reporting
also
what did aga do with its storage figure report
i heard that they cancelled the publication
jim
sure
thanks
we will discuss in context of state review
jim
fyi
call jeff if you have more questions
jim
does this make sense
jim
i'll go to the houston meeting
jim
should this go into janine's efforts on markets
jim
thanks
i want to talk about this on the
consultants
call with linda robertson
should we push this argument or leave the ferc with its infirmities
i believe that we can work away at many of our concerns in the
should refunds be reqd
phase
jim
jeff
look at the letter
i see no issues
call me with your thoughts
jim
thanks for the information
at this time
i don't think that i am interested in any reports
jim
please put in swepco file for thurs
pls put in swepco file
jim
linda
pls include in the file
jim
pls put in my swepco folder
fyi
i think that this is a good step but we need to remember that nerc in the commercial sector may not prove to be the end all
also
while rtos may enforce the standards or set the standards
not sure if we want one organization doing both
jim
any time you want to you should feel free
jim
did we decide not to join with anyone else
jim
here is the report
jim
great idea
my key points would be that
a
ferc needs to push ahead with its
right sized
rtos and
b
focus on standardizing the tariff and market design
no more collaborative efforts
two simple
easy to understand thoughts
also
i think that it's a mistake to use the term
large rtos
we don't want large rtos
we want rtos that cover natural markets and benefit consumers
jim
looks good
is there a timeline on when ferc may act
or at least when the audit
will be final
is this information confidential
should we be working the trade press
thanks
jim
if ferc agrees
does this hurt our retail business and the implementation of our retail gen product next year
jim
steve
what's up with ga psa wise wanting to open marketers books
saw this in gas daily today
any info is helpful
jim
there are some commodity meetings
one with jim wood and one with greg sharp
harry
can you please call and get on these meeting schedules
also
guillermo canovas and melinda pharms are going to the ees gas meeting weekly
jim
damon
good idea
i'm out early next week
how about next thursday
jim
seems reasonable to me that we tell nerc they can't
make a land grab
how about epsa and elcon signing a letter together to the chairman of nerc board
jim
christi
dqe provides some level of audit capability to ensure that the costs are fair and apppropriate
pge may not have a resource specific system lambda but aw may be able to explain how they would implement something like this
i know aw from some other issues so if things don't go well let me know
also
please keep alan comnes in the loop
thanks
jim
thanks
with the discussions at nerc recently to broaden their role
i think that we need to be very coordinated on our eisb message and begin to figure out how we get aga to work with the retail gas and eei/ubr to work with the retail power quadrants
let's think about a naruc message to drive this very quickly
maybe at the next meeting
having one body begin to coordinate all of these matters will greatly expand our policy reach
thanks
jim
are these papers consistent with enron's positions
jim
no
jim steffes
what do you think
jim
jean
the puct voted to delay for spp markets
not sure about entergy
any news
can you send out something to the business people
jim
your thoughts
jim
it is critical to win this case
sounds to me that dynegy wants icap in the midwest
jim
sounds reasonable
would the same be true about the dst case
if we lose
without the ppo what do we have
jim
pls call steve
jim
alan
what about a simple price cap
ala pjm
of $0/mwh rather than a gas-index deriviative
just a thought
do whatever the desk thinks is right
jim
sounds good
pls talk with bob frank about his involvement in this group
jim
the first order of business is getting the cost/benefit analysis done
once we have that study
let's go to press
jim
thanks
can we have breakfast wednesday morning at the park hyatt to discuss where we are and necessary next steps
given southern's statements
as well as others
this is the key analysis that would hold up this from moving forward
jim
pat

agree with you that we don't want utility in merchant role

why don't you put together a note to the caem that we can send as our thoughts
just the top 0 issues
jim
try to respond end of the week
i'd like to see your drafts
jim
this evening and stay until wed pm
jim
i didn't get the attachment
if you want my thoughts
please let me know
jim
thanks for the update
it is disappointing that aga is not opening the process
although the final eisb retail gas standards will need to be vetted by an ansi group so we'll get our comments in one way or the other
also
what are we doing to get the different states to adopt these protocols across the board
seems like pushing naruc to agree that this is the right vehicle makes sense
thanks
jim
thanks luiz
as a follow-up
i'd like to be on record as saying that the puct wasted my time in flying to austin
when plane travel is not secure
i'd add
and not even listening to my statements
why bring us if they had already made the decision
also
i don't know who is going to pay for more market readiness work in spp unless aep agrees to pay our costs
the customers pay for their activities
jim
sounds good
please make sure that jeff brown in ees is kept in the loop if this gets close to goal line
jim
no
but i'm happy to ride with almost anyone
jim
wanda
who do i need to call at epmi west power to discuss the following
we are considering proposing a settlement for sce
the language we are considering on the negative ctc is as follows
does this help or hurt
do we have
final iso invoices
please call me
jim
lisa
let me know what you decide
jim
barbara
what's up with tn
did we ever solve the issue with stokes bartholomew funding with the commercial team
jim
thanks
jim
mike
i'd shorten the letter to one page by simply referencing the state commission's letter and issues
don't we want to also work on pushing a mediation
or some other solution
right now
donna
pls check with linda r
about filing
it's important but let's make sure our overall ferc strategy is consistent
jim
ok
i may call keith anyway
jim
randy
last minute
i'm coming to dc today through wednesday afternoon
any chance to grab dinner or a beer
you're probably swamped
but thought i'd check
i'm staying at park hyatt
0 and m
leave a number if it works 0-0-0
thanks
jim
leaving for airport
can we talk in am
jim
thanks
if you need any additional support pls let me know
also
pls send my best to thane and his family
jim
vicki
i will be in town on thursday and available to meet
assuming that the meeting won't go for more than 0
0.0 hours
i'd be happy to attend
thanks
jim
yes
i've called keith and he says he can also go
please call lora sullivan 0-0-0 to arrange a time
i'm good whenever
jim
i think that ees would like to send out some regulatory information on a regular basis
maybe qty instead of monthly
nothing formal right now
jim
randy
dinner is at 0:0 pm at cashion's eat place
0 columbia
keith is coming
call me on my cell phone at 0-0-0 with any problems
hope to see you there
jim
fyi
charles
jose
the spinmisters are already at work
people at ferc thought we had bought into the
new nerc
enron does not support nerc in working through commercial issues
we need to develop our opinions of where to go next
but right now you can respond to dave nevius that we still don't believe that nerc and its process/organziation is the right vehicle
we are willing to find a way to do this
but we can't have the same sro bullshit that they have been saying for 0 years
sorry i missed the call
i'll talk with you guys friday
jim
no
talk with pat keene and/or leslie lawner
we haven't done much on arizona lately
jim
jeff
i'd leave the number blank for all parties to be discussed between the different parties
best way would be to have some attachments for the amount that the companies can sign after everything else
don't want dan douglas to know the $$$ before richard sanders oks
jim
roy
do we need to run a more thorough legal analysis to check
i trust your thoughts
i just don't want to be left hanging
i'd rather spend $0 now than have this come back and bite us in the $%*@
jim
i think when you add the publics into southern they'll hit 0k
it may make sense to send this question to intellibridge
we have their resource
call margaret allen in houston she'll have their number
jim
thanks
fyi
jim
pat
if you're in on friday
let's sit down for 0
thanks
jim
fine by me
not sure if i'd make so much of the recent ferc statements
may come true if we don't keep a straightforward message
agree
jeff
how would we calculate ees
contribution
to sce undercollection
jim
how about 0pm friday afternoon
you on a plane
jim
we
marianna and i
decided that with the new baby on the way
not sure if you knew this
that now wasn't the time to head to dc
although with the stock price and company in shambles
maybe it would be a more
conservative
bet
hope you're doing well
jim
no big deal
next time i'm in town i'll give you a little more notice
hope things are going well at state
for what it's worth
i think it would be a total mistake for america to stop our hunt for osama during the muslim religious month
i don't think the grieving families in nyc and around the pentagon are going to stop their mourning for their loved ones during that timeframe
just one opinion out of millions
take care
jim
i would like to schedule a phone call with nick and the puct staff to understand the implication of this
maybe he isn't asking for too much
but let's get some clarity before we say anything at ferc
can you please set something up with you
christi
jean and me for friday pm and then we'll go outside next week
jim
linda
pls set up a 0 minute meeting with melinda tomorrow
thanks
i know that sce is taking this position
they are simple wrong
unless and until we get all of our
positive
ctc back from the utility
why should i even begin to consider their
goofy
arguments
in addition
sce is receiving $0.0 b which is a full payment of all negative ctc
if their issue is to have a undercollection charge against all customers
that's a different policy matter
the cpuc agreed to the idea of negative ctc and sce needs to pay
also
if we are 0% of load and the undercollection is $0.0 b
i think that sce would be looking for $0 mm
our entire claim
they aren't talking about 0% from our view $0 mm claim
jim
thanks
we're happy but marianna is extremely sick
all day
enron could see $0 easily
it's very bad
jim
good work
fyi
great job
what are the back out rates for ch going forward
any improvement in the market
jim
i'm back in thursday am
let's beat the heck out of dynegy on this case
jim
we have not made public the sce amount
as far as i'm aware
we need to make sure that ir is in the loop
i think that mark koenig is following this issue
jim
great job leslie
let's keep up the pressure
jim
may be some value here when all over
we should the testimony at ferc in the arto docket
by pushing ferc to get with the program and by pushing arto to use a better cm model
we'll get leverage
taking it to the puco is a nice step
but i don't think that they are going to change the current arto program
by the way
where is the puco on arto
miso issues
thanks
jim
isn't there a better option for all of the comed issues
open the legislation
why not talk with comed about this
jim
are we winning
any movement on our issues
jim
i would think that we should take the time to talk with local counsel or other
allies
to get a feel for the chances in az
i also think that the difficulty in az will be a physical problem with getting transmission service
no rto
it would be great to have a thorough analysis of problems in every open market just to know what the issues are
jim
i'll be at my desk
yes
although probably more useful
if we have a smoking gun
in the legislative arena
doe has no authority over tva
jim
joe
let us know
jim
david
you should contact mike smith in ees legal
he is the one to respond to this allegation
my fax is 0-0-0
jim
agreed
need to talk this morning about our exposures
jim
bill
steve kean needs to talk with some analysts today about our ca exposures
can you send me your most recent information on our wholesale and negative ctc exposures as soon as possible
call me with questions
jim
wade
attached are some additions
looks fine
mary lynne ruffer has the most recent negative ctc numbers
my understanding is $0mm for pg&e and $0mm for sce as of today
jim
linda
please put on my calendar that i will not travel or go out of town for all of may 0
i will be in houston during this period
thanks
craig
as we discussed yesterday
we would be very interested in a memo outlining a work product that would document the cost/benefit of rtos
if you have any questions
please don't hesitate to call me at 0-0-0
thanks
jim
sue
received your voice mail
having arem only file is ok with me
spoke with lamar frazier
jeremy sounds worried
let's make sure that the contract question is vetted with internal and external lawyers
agree not to give cpuc any info
thanks
jim
fyi
you may want to send out to rto team
jim
thanks
jeremy
to let you know where we stand on the cpuc's investigation on da suspension
0
sue mara is leading the effort to respond to the cpuc for enron
0
we knew that the cpuc was at a minimum going to investigate how and/or whether to allow extensions of contracts and the application of other surcharge $$ to da load given their earlier statements
the issue on retroactivity is open primarily because they can ask these questions and
i believe
as leverage for other issues
0
we are coordinating with the big customers who recently left
they are marshalling forces to oppose any retroactivity
this is as much their fight as it is ours
0
at this time
enron will file as a member of arem
we intend to oppose the cpuc's request for our contracts and transaction information
if you want any other info or want to discuss further
let me know
jim
vince
i see that you are on the panel on market monitoring
dave perrino and alan comnes are following the issue for enron in the western power markets as rtos are formed
it may make sense for some people from govt affairs to talk with you to discuss current issues and focus of ferc and others
if we can get together
please let me know a good time
also
the attached paper from epsa on market monitoring is something we support through our trade association
thanks
jim
steve
what's up
jim
here are my thoughts
use as you see fit
jim
let me know
i'd talk with aps just to find out more details
if we do
let's take dave perrino our wholesale guy to also talk about rtos
jim
some more information would be nice
these seem low
jim
agreed
jim
i think that california needs to make a final decision on whether it wants competitive markets or not
i wonder if purpa has anything to say about meeting incremental utility needs and what that does to the cdwr contracts
i don't see enron getting engaged in this quagmire unless there is a clear business reason
jim
if made to choose
i'm for option a
below
jim
thanks
thanks for moving ahead
jim
agreed
pls make sure the puct understands this
jim
will do
what record will ferc file today
this is crazy
ray please call me when you get in
jim
who at reliant said this
i'd let them go forward and we'll do our own
jim
guillermo
i should sign the letter
also
we should be consistent on affiliates given epmi and enron gas mktg
we are affiliates of a pipeline
we offer competitive services on the affiliated pipelines
let's be consistent with our own business
when are you going to send the letter
jim
sarah
do we need to replace tom on the reg project list
jim
what did we do on this
jim
rogers
harry kingerski informed me that you and some team members were going to visit coned to discuss the benchmark rate swap
i think it's a great idea
scott gahn and i had discussed something similar a few years ago when he ran urm
my only thoughts for you would be
0
maybe difficult to do the swap with the utility
given puc oversight
but the holding company should be in the same place financially and should be protected from puc scrutiny and 0
being long t&d
assuming that you don't sell 0% of the position to customers
creates interesting regulatory questions
i'd love to sit down with you to discuss this product
jim
any luck on my password
jim
mike
when you have the list of customers we should contact
please let me know
i should try and get back with ashley today
jim
chip
did you get the chance to look at the combined company
just interested
thanks
dale
right now i'm in all of next week
although may have to travel on thursday
jim
linda
pls arrange a room for a visit from ken malloy on nov 0 at 0:0 am
thanks
jim
bob
where do we stand on the sce stipulation
i want to make sure that our push in sce doesn't conflict or contradict something we are doing in the pg&e discussions
can we meet today
jim
susan
please talk with jeff golden and the ees dist generation group to get their take as well
thanks
jim
scott
any thoughts on this merger
i would love to know how the financials would look post merger
charles
my final edits
let's talk
also
please let john shelk and sarah look at before sending to epsa
jim
i will let ashley brown know
do you have phone numbers for these guys
also
ng is willing to do a conference call late wednesday or meeting on thursday
what do you think
jim
how about 0:0 cst
jim
sounds good
should we put out a note through ginger that indicates the changes
jim
how about 0pm est
0pm cst
jim
fyi
epsa looks interested in undertaking a cost-benefit analysis
as soon as i hear more
i'll give everyone the info
jim
thanks
i want you on the call
try to do wednesday pm conference call
jim
thanks
we have some relationship with trans-elect
supported trans-elect on the ng question of managing member of arto
if you want to sit down with them
let me know
jim
0 is better
jim
ashley
we would prefer
given the schedules
to hold a conference call on wednesday pm with a group of marketers/generators
seems like the easiest way to discuss with everyone
it would be great to have a paper from ng earlier in the week
here is our list of recommended people
probably best to have ng or you call to invite
rather than enron
to highlight your interest in brokering a deal in the midwest
constellation
harvey reed
0 0 0 edison mission energy
reem fahey
0 0 0 thanks
jim
tom
you may at some time want to cross train on nyiso rules
especially as the region integrates
thanks
jim
dave
pat keene is working on a number of issues before the nv commission on retail access and unbundling
one thing being the implementation of da for c&i
can you please reach out to him to help on some transmission issues involved in retail competition
thanks
jim
what lobbying did enron do last year with regard to enrononline and the commodity futures modernization act
thanks
fyi
steve you may want to be on this call
jim
seems to me that we need to engage in az
along with nv and or
in the western states to try and push competition forward
why don't we first assemble a
0
what we know
what we don't know memo and then
0
look at oppotunities to push our agenda
leslie
everyone is looking to you to lead us to the promised land in az
go get
em
jim
mike
how about lunch at 0:0
meet in the lobby
jim
ricardo
i tried to call this morning
no answer
pls give me a call today
jim
sorry
i need to be in houston both days
jim
fyi
fine
everything's crazy at enron
just trying to keep my head down
thanks
jim
do all reps have to report this information
including our customer complaints
even if we only serve non-ptb customers
who is tracking this internally assuming we have to file it
do the business people understand this obligation
jim
ok
it seems that
0
we should try and get a handle on az
leslie lawner please put something together and
0
need a market plan on nv
pat keene put together
paul
i appreciate the issue with or but i'd like to know what is the opportunity and make sure that pge is not destroying our chances
christi got wind of a imbalance pgm that was punative to marketers
who can we meet with to discuss
jim
following last week's meeting
here is my recommendation on how to proceed with sce
0
form enron negotiation team my recommendation is to use the same team we used with pg&e + jeff dasovich
my understanding was that lisa m
was the lead negotiator
i would not change this
jeff should only be there to make introductions
sue mara and jeff dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens
0
reformed stipulation i would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document
based on dasovich's idea to get together with sce on thursday
maybe let this ride
0
meeting my understanding is that
jeff d
please correct
sce can meet with us this thursday
can everyone make it that needs to be there
probably meet in california
we should put the laundry list on the table
please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees
thanks
jim
to discuss this outline and our issues list
can people attend a 0pm houston time call
the meet and confer may be on-going
but maybe either jeff or sue can jump off
linda noske will be sending out a call-in number
thanks
jim
fyi
nancy
i don't understand
will this delay the opening of the ercot tx market
we must do everything possible to open the market on time
jan 0 0
jim
we also need to check reporting for post jan 0
gloria can you make sure that rebecca fite knows this
jim
i was hoping to meet with pge
but will hold off it is imprudent
christi has reviewed something
i'll loop her in to find out all the details
jim
christi
what's the latest on the pge imbalance method
jim
my fault for not making it clear that you should have been in the loop
we will send out a message across the board to help with this
jim
this is critical that we are all pushing this
please let me know if any obstacles develop
jim
are we still friends
nancy
go get
em
you'll do great
just be factual and explain how you've worked on these issues in multiple states
jim
good job
jim
my thoughts
0
focus more on tariff standardization
i think that this is the key issue for enron because lmp based bid balancing market is almost a done deal
and the texas market seems to be fine for liquidity
build around a new proforma with a network plus model
0
i would highlight that size matters
re-double our arguments and documents on natural markets in this filing as attachments
0
i would highlight the importance of ending the control area benefits and also strengthen the arguments for no source/sink requirement
0
the gas
power industries are different not because the amount of vertical integration
ie
cng
but because of the geographic reach
many ldcs used columbia p/l
but only one ldc uses aeps
the electric market needs transmission to be
rationalized
across the marketplace so moving power to where it's needed from where it's at
0
should we attack the 0 boards
agree that they are unnecessary
but pls be careful
thanks
jim
janine
good job
on the hourly market price index
until we have lmp dispatch
the best we can do is a public index
let's not ask for too much
just something we can hedge against
can you talk with the ews folks for the best index option
also
if the default is a monthly public index
why do the customer's need any
parking
they can move directly to the new option
what is your definition of
functioning wholesale market
are we stating that unless an rto is running
we can't get rid of the ppo
maybe just resolve the imbalance issue
more specifics would be helpful
thanks
jim
no
trying to put something together
jim
think the best thing is to let it ride
no sense in discussing because we don't have a solution for them
see if any intelligence on how hard they are going to push npco to fight us
jim
yes
thanks
ok
also
don't forget about the dynegy v
comed dispute at ferc
important for us in our physical business
probably want the letter to be a little more specific on a monthly index v
an hourly
also
what about the 0 kw size distinction
is this the right #
may want to talk with jim wood
isn't the dst question also important
the icc's decision will impact the need for a ppo
jim
charles
the rto week stuff is different from sso stuff
right
jim
gloria
vicki sharp was interested in trying to update our licenses throughout the country
i will arrange a meeting for us to follow-up
thanks
jim
agree
lisa
i'll leave it to you to decide if mike day needs or should be at the sce initial meeting
i received a message that he can
but haven't told him either way
pls advise
jim
fyi
linda
pls put on my calendar
pls arrange a room and have mike roan and luiz maurer attend
also invite kerry stroup
thanks
jim
sarah
christi
can you ask the project leaders on the key projects for a timeline
comments due date
etc
of their activities
i would love to have a crib sheet to know when to expect comments
i saw the nopr commetns on code of conduct was moved to dec 0
thanks
jim
harry
do want to shepherd the development of our comments
team would be you
lead
charles
nancy hetrick
andy rodriquez
christi nicolay
what do you think
jim
can someone please cover this meeting
jim
pls put on my calendar
jim
cheers
friday breakfast works for me
0:0 am at 0 diner
jim
no
i'll let her know if she asks
thanks
fyi
i would probably utilize either epsa or wptf to make the filing
this is an attack on the competitive generation industry and better to not have enron point any fingers at a key
potential
customer
jim
fyi
when
tuesday
october 0
0 0:0 pm-0:0 pm
gmt-0:0
central time
us
canada
can you make this phone call
susan is on vacation
when
tuesday
october 0
0 0:0 pm-0:0 pm
gmt-0:0
central time
us
canada
i'll be on the call
you guys are of course welcome
my thought is that we need to push epsa to do something on this
jim
i will be attending
i'll cover
jim
jim
they are active throughout the west
mainly california
we can use them
both are good
jim
kevin
last update that i know about for cdwr costs
if sue or jeff know of later $ figures
please advise kevin
also
my understanding was that the cpuc simply disallowed the cdwr from having straight passthru without review
they may get to charge 0% of these dollars
but needs cpuc approval
jim
if reliant is interested in filing
we should seriously consider using epsa
reliant is a member of epsa
we could get epsa to work through larry robertson maybe
let's discuss next week in houston
jim
thanks for sending this out
jim
i haven't processed a bill
fyi
thanks for getting the info to keeney
jim
i don't know if we need to do anything
seems like they are just acquiring the main facilities
not market design material
have you spoken to anyone at arto to inquire
jim
mike
you should contact lisa m
about the sce meeting arrangements
i will be there in spirit only
jim
fyi
linda
have you heard anything from doe on this
jim
it will be difficult to understand the impact of our credit decline on a per transaction basis
it is probably sufficient to communicate with the credit department
under bill bradford
for wholesale and the ews services group
under evan hughes
for retail
i spoke with evan hughes and he is going to have csc run a report of the tariff obligations
he will send the info to me and i'll forward to amr ibrahim
thanks
thanks
marcus n
says that everything is done on our emergency project this morning
sam behrens will write an opinion letter to allow the move without the need for a 0 filing and everything else is in place
steve montovano has/is confirming that in pa
oh
and nj there are no outstanding tax or regulatory matters
we probably want to put in place an update to clinton's mbr that would allow for a/s trading
should we just have sam do that work
jim
tom
i received a call today from the cpuc
came through the main enron number
a cpuc staffer named joyce at 0-0-0
no one was interested in giving the last names
someone named dan at the quail ridge research station
0 hwy 0 napa
ca 0
called the cpuc to complain that he was inappropriately switched from pg&e to enron
it's a strange situation
the universities own the bldg and land but a trust pays the bills
he says that
the facility isn't anywhere near the campus
the pg&e account number is znl0
his phone number is 0-0-0
i told him that we would look into this and get back by end of business thursday
the cpuc staffer is joyce at 0-0-0
no one was interested in giving the last names
my guess is that uc/csu listed this account on a switch request but didn't ask dan
what should we do
jim
fine
people are shocked
jim
linda
can you also please process jose's documents
jim
fyi
do we need to communicate this to the trading
logistics groups
jim
i would probably not sign on directly
but would support the document with the additional thoughts
0
i don't understand a 0 month collaborative to work through smd
this only extends the implementation
0
need to push harder on doing away with the reserve obligation
0
i would argue that the rto need not run a day ahead market
also
why does a day ahead market provide
sufficient capacity committed in the right places for the next day in order to supply load reliably
california has a da market and people simply did not participate
the argument that a da market replaces a unit committment process doesn't seem complete
0
the position and implications on cm and rt market going in at the same time needs to be made more clear
does this mean that enron supports delaying all rto
activity
e.g
oasis
single tariff
rates
until cm is complete
0
what is a
point-to-point
financial hedge
does this imply node-to-node
can we include some discussion of market
hubs
how could i obtain a hub-to-node hedge
also
what about the allocation or auction process for ftrs
how should existing transmission arrangements be managed
0
do we agree to incremental pricing vs
rolled-in
will this cause any heartburn for ets
what about the cost of expansion to meet the needs of incremental generation
should this be borne by the system or the generator
my thought is that this is a big piece and enron should probably file its own comments rather than sign on
sarah novosel is working on enron comments
jim
gloria
i wanted to make sure that our license in tx allows us to use e-signatures
ees is opening a pilot
jim
alan
i assume that you will lead enron's response to epsa's comments
should we have a discussion of this filing before the epsa meeting on friday
pls give me a call
jim
interesting
seems to me that epsa needs to help az do better by its citizens
it's not just aps that's a
bunch of neanderthals
to use a rick shapiro phrase
i don't understand something else
is mumaw aps
and ees
counsel in az
how is this possible
jim
marcus
i would recommend that enron not do anything to modify the clinton mbr tariff at ferc right now
it may make sense for sam behrens to work up a
clean up
filing to be ready to go upon any action
pls give me a call if you want to discuss or would like us to take a different approach
jim
here are some thoughts from me
jim
lara
i would think that alan comnes would be good
if he can make it
to go
jim
understand
when you speak of the gas desk
are you talking to scott neal and frank vickers or don black
we should make sure that both groups recognize our message
jim
sue
i agree with your arguments
the other problem with sce's analysis is that they had a defined stranded cost amount and they deserve that money
what california did
my explaination
is that sce was offered frozen rates for 0 years
all of the margin they
earned
was shareholder's compensation for moving to direct access
if the total $$ of margin was $0 or less
this implies simply that sce had no generation stranded costs
the entire argument that sce is making forgets the $billion that they have kept from consumers through the fixed rate
fyi
who are they hiring as lobbyists
jim
thanks
leslie
it's my understanding that janine is just reviewing the eastern us
if i'm wrong
janine please correct me
thanks
let's sit down at 0pm to discuss
jim
can you please resend the fax to barbara hueter about the tn legal bill
thanks
maggie
you may want to attend
global markets
jim
amr
not for us to contact the isos about our material change
jim
great job
fyi
thanks
appreciate the quick response
jim
how about 0am tuesday
fyi
let's discuss at 0pm
i don't think that govt affairs should do anything on this
and not sure if there is anything to do
i'd say 0 pm at daily review or marks
what does everyone think
jim
thanks
guillermo
looks good to me
i'll discuss with amr to ensure his agreement
jim
thanks
having this e-mail on the agenda for the upcoming meeting is very helpful
jim
sue
my thoughts on the filing
0
pretty hard line with comm wood
i don't have any problems with it as written
but comments like
cya not calif youth admin
is not appropriate
0
we don't deal with the requirement to submit contracts
should arem address this
my understanding is that for contracts with customers below 0kw we need to submit something
maybe with the price and term blacked-out
is this correct
0
in the conclusion
don't we want to ask the puc to take some affirmative action
tell the industry that they will never implement retroactive suspension
that their is no cost shifting
and that da customers can extend without penalty
the filing simply asks for no harm
thanks
jim
the ppo
power purchase option
is a unique program based on the il restructuring law
texas has no analogous service
i agree with your statement that we don't need an rto
we need to fix the physical retail transmission rules
it's important to keep consistent messages
jim
thanks for our new model
pls let me know how it is going
jim
lisa
i appreciate your note greatly
while we didn't always win
we did always give the other side the fight of their lives
electricity markets in the mid-atlantic
and throughout the country
are better for the work you did over the last few years
best of luck in your future plans
i'm sure that we will talk again
and often
take care
jim
ca supreme court filing
thanks
jim
here are my thoughts
i have to be honest
i'm struggling with the transco
rto split
jim
i don't think that i'll send this given the current direction of the puc to move forward with tx
i do think that these points are important and maybe jean r
can get them in verbally as appropriate
thanks
jim
yes
but i think we may lose that rating
what is the impact if that were to occur
seems like we should
a
identify our situation given today's environment and
b
identify the impact of one further downgrade
jim
thanks
thanks
probably also want to talk with brad nebergald
jim
janine
ok for you to cover the whole country
i had forgotten our discussions
please discuss nm and az with leslie lawner
jim
here are my thoughts
issues with the epsa paper
0
the epsa paper indicates the preferred option of the 0 models that ferc staff proposed
should epsa at least indicate that it stands ready to analyze other solutions that may be proposed
gives epsa an
out
of this recommendation if it proves later that ferc's application of the delivered price test is unworkable
0
i don't understand when epsa says
our recommendation
therefore entails a more stringent method of assessing market power
on page 0 of the draft
why should epsa indicate that it is comfortable with a 0% economic capacity test to ferc
i would argue that 0% is the minimum we should entertain as an opening position
also
is there a fear that a power marketer would have to meet this test in
real-time
having a once and done for three year application is ok
but if we are conditioned that we can't get beyond 0% in any market
what does this do to trading and how would this be reported
0
the discussion on available economic capacity and its implication for having a
bias against new entry
is confusing
maybe we should clairfy our concerns
0
the argument that all new generation is by definition pro-competitive needs to be strengthened
it should be explained in the context of the delivered price test
also
it that still true if a party which holds 0 mw in a 0 mw market builds a 0 mw power plant
now 0 mw in a 0 mw market
maybe i am missing something
0
epsa needs to make the argument that conditioning mbr on vague rules is wrong and anti-competitive earlier in the paper
this is my biggest concern
that we are perpetually subject to some refund risk when the market
breaks
even though our fundamental presence has not changed
0
i don't understand the epsa paper on rto versus non-rto markets
epsa endorses something but i'm not sure what
what does this mean if i sell on tva's network
i appreciate blanket authority
but i wonder about exactly how this would be constructed
would this be similar to the natural gas marketer blanket authority
also
doesn't this play into the hands of the transmission monopolists who don't want competition
if they never set up an rto they never face competition
jim
i spoke with ashley yesterday
awaiting ng's filing
no plans right now
will keep you in the loop
jim
fyi
i probably shouldn't be so serious
but i think the current situation at enron has made me less fun
jim
dynegy filed a complaint at ferc that tries to disallow firm ld from being used by marketers under the comed network service
ip claims that is losing $ mm because customers are not paying for capacity
this will impact our ability to
go physical
starting next year
0
miso vs
arto ip is a member of the arto
epmi continues to try and establish only one rto in the region
i think this is why dynegy won't state very clearly that 0 rtos makes sense
no $ impact
although this decision may impact our ability to
go physical
starting next year in illinois
0
ctc bet in comed my recollection
talking with harry k
is that we pre-sold a ctc roll-off in comed that could cost our business around $0 mm if it doesn't happen
most talk in illinois is that ctc should end early for big customers
so not sure if this is an issue
0
delivery service tariff litigation comed and ip have filed to increase their rates on delivery service tariffs
but not on bundled customers because there is a statutory rate cap
ees told us originally that this could cost as much as $0mm
but current estimates are closer to $0mm for comed and $0mm for ip
0
ppo
power purchase option
termination comed is pushing to end the ppo service
ppo provides a re-sell service to marketers while sharing the mitigation factor with customers
it is the service we use to
deliver
today in comed
ip will probably terminate this service because their stranded costs are expected to end sooner
hence
not a major issue for ip
0
relative size of current ees book hope this helps
data will improve with more time
jim
the $$# is 0mm
sounds like the right approach to me
lower rates first
they still don't get it
does this process conform w
regulatory reqts
yes
just info
may help to have sue landwehr on call to hear your thoughts
rick
we do have an on-going dispute with the papuc about our assessment for gas sales
the charge is $0k
we are suing with others the papuc to argue that we are not a utility and therefore can't get assessed
jim
trying to run down the information
jim
howard
did we deal with the ees letter from nyiso mmu
pls let me know
jim
fyi
not sure if we can afford this
but if you think it's helpful let's talk
jim
thanks for the info guys
jim
resend
do we need to file on the nopr on partial day recalls
will epsa file
what position will they take
should we talk with joe hartsoe about his position
jim
sue
please follow up with roskow at the cpuc
i hope that he can get an answer before eob monday next week
please keep me in the loop on this
jim
got it
thanks
jim
was the amendment approved by ferc
jim
fyi
will you attend the meeting at ferc
jim
fine
why not have this as the first element of eisb wholesale quadrant
jim
ray
have you looked at the testimony
it appears to be hitting the key points
is there anything else that we need to be doing to make sure that our case is as strong as possible
give me a call
jim
please include as appropriate
jim
not sure
probably won't be ready until end of year
jim
looks good
i agree that making arguments about merchant generation
stranded costs
is questionable
better to couch this as
structural impact on market participants
more importantly
if i bought 0% of generation in one market
and ferc changes their rules
seems like i either
a
sell generation and take the loss or
b
get regulatory risk insurance
ferc has the right to make markets work
finally
on the issue of blanket authority
i think that the caiso model is a good example of why this may not work for enron
in the long-run
as a market-maker
enron needs workable markets
a good test case would have been this
under ferc's proposed rules
would ferc have granted market-wide waiver in california
if ferc is comfortable with the result
than move ahead
thanks
jim
attached is a summary of the sce meeting to discuss our negative ctc claim
call if you would like any additional information
jim
pls provide john with any further information
jim
if we do take over this type of role
what issues and information would the nyiso be entitled to
we are pushing dg and load curtailment very actively
jim
melinda
let's talk soon
i want to make sure that you understand all of the implications of this decision
jim
alberto
pls ask sue mara where these stand
i thought that the ferc didn't approve
jim
pls send asap the information to have me submit to rick
jim
rick
andy is looking for about $0 for tuition reimbursement
i would
if we can afford it
pay this
i indicated that going forward we could not make any committments but finishing his college would be helpful
thoughts
jim
sounds good
maybe we can employ the gov one last time before the end of the year to try and message a
workable
solution
let's just decide what that is
maybe some bare minimums on rtos
jim
look at this web site www.southerncompany.com go to the section
news
issues
section of the web site
they compute the cost of moving an electron from new orleans to nyc
jim
rick
are you going to put out the new org chart by this friday
jim
howard
how did this mistake happen
does their tariff allow for restatement of prices
does this cost the desk $$
maybe the nyiso shouldn't be doing this
jim
harry
this is the meeting
jim
this story appears to be about residential
do we know if c&i has feared so poorly
what are the problems with entering the market for those customers
have these customers been angry or pleased
jim
the tx monthly story
jim
we should inform ferc enforcement
no formal filings
jim
bill
joe hartsoe
fed reg affairs
got cc
on the demand letter from pjm
i assume you have the letter
if not
please let me know
joe sent me a copy
jim
i'd say $0 is fair
jim
i would recommend that either steve or myself call bittenbender to recommend kirk house
we met with him on the rto discussions
jim
thanks
thanks
jim
we are pulling this together and will talk with marcus nettleson as appropriate
jim
i still think that enron should be advocating some form of negawatt program for non-retail access states
using an rtp tariff that more closely tracks the wholesale prices from an rto balancing energy market with locational signals can be used without any retail access and can have the load response needed to keep prices from skyrocketing
of course this would require a da market because the signals need to come in ahead of the usage
by the way
i disagree that we need a wholesale rate for capacity
we should make sure that we put this in our comments on rto week
jim
great news
are there any other md commissioners that ms
mcdonald thinks we should visit with
on the idea of nyiso vs
pjm
i was reading in restructuring today yesterday about some elements that ny thought was better than pjm
i think that we need to
find
three things to give to the nyiso in the development of a single market
allocation of ftrs comes to mind
i agree that pjm and its staff are the key elements
but maybe getting over this rhetoric will be made easier if we concede that nyiso does something well
should we do another round of new england meetings to push our support
with mcgreevey winning in nj
will the njbpu change its focus
jim
sue
kerry
do you know if anyone is going to this
should we work with epsa to publish an epsa piece that corresponds to this
jim
i am beginning to agree with dave on governance
that a for-profit transco may not be in our best interest
let's talk about how to change the wording
jim
wanda
can you break out for me the iso and px money due
i need to make sure that our settlement is consistent with our ferc refund issues
jim
i can attend
jim
fyi
ferc will be the ultimate decider on admin cost adder
not the iurc
not sure why this is even in the settlement except to ensure that iurc won't intwe should not sign based on this information
jim
yes
we need to ensure that the edi rules are final and allow enron to switch billing options early next year
see #0 below
let me know if there are any issues
jim
are they going to send a new invoice with changed amounts
do they know not to do anything going forward
jim
also
we should have a talking point response to the naruc points
would be good to come from epsa
jim
after the phc today
we should have a better feel where the parties are and what the discussions will provide for
sue
can you make sure that jeremy and team have a synopsis and outline of next steps
thanks
fyi
thanks
if the may 0 date starts to slip
pls let me know
jim
let's discuss this afternoon
jim
rick called lynne church to discuss maybe having epsa put out daily
papers
on market issues
epsa did this at the ferc rto week and it worked very well
jim
i didn't say that was ok
she was to move on nov 0
jim
help as much as you need to
jim
harry
janine
bob
joe short works on project phoenix
rebooking of old ees deals
he is interested in any analysis that we may have provided related to the simon properties deal with the master meter issue
if anyone has any old files on this
please send his way
also
any updates on where we stand
e.g
ohio court cases
would be good
we probably need to have a review of our rights and obligations so that we can properly book the deal
after we get joe our info
we can regroup to determine next steps
thanks
if anyone has any questions
please call
jim
joe
i forwarded the call from phil to bill bradford and let kevin presto know
if you hear anything else
pls let me know
jim
thanks
i don't think that i want to travel to europe right now
market opportunities are slowing down
i think that we'll go to mom's for some time
you can always come over through the weekend to see gracie
jim
thanks
i saw this recently
it's true and funny
this place is amazing
jim
thanks for the update
i'll keep my fingers crossed
jim
thanks
it was a nice dinner
jim
i think that christi's write up is great
i've only changed two things
if anyone has any more changes
please get to janel asap
jim
pls let me know
jim
thanks for asking
this is a very strange place
our core trading is doing very well
it appears that management decided to put some huge bets at the corporate level without any risk management
i'm doing very well
marianna is expecting our 0nd child next may
grace continues to grow and become a little person
hope you and your family is doing well
jim
i don't think that it is one of our top issues
i'd recommend that we stay out
jim
janet
going forward govt affairs will coordinate with services and product development
and other ews and ees groups as appropriate
e.g
credit
to ensure compliance with
0
licensing/registration
0
bonding/security
0
regulatory reporting
and
0
other
i have asked gloria ogenyi to lead this effort for us
we will need other groups to appoint a lead for their teams as soon as possible
i will work with evan
legal
and product development to find out the appropriate people
i fully concur with rogers that within all new product development activities there must be a clear analysis of our obligations and appropriate resource allocation to continue supporting the market activity
as important
just because we don't want to attract new business in a given market doesn't mean that our responsibilities have ended
we need to ensure that our product development activities are accounting for the costs of these obligations over the long-term
to ensure that we are selling in accordance with applicable regulations
i would recommend that gloria be on the product development sign-off sheet
in addition
we have already begun reviewing obligations
etc
for our current market activity
both wholesale and retail
i will talk with gloria to build the matrix of issues you referenced
our goal is to make current all of our market obligations
i will call you to provide an update on the market review when i have more information
if you want to talk about this
please call
thanks
jim ps
i'll ask gloria to give you an update on the il bonding status
i didn't know that i was all powerful
barbara
any decision on the payment
jim
thanks
it makes sense for gloria and rebecca to get together
i am available to talk tomorrow and have asked gloria to set something up
also
we need to work together to make sure that ees
reports
taxes
and other requirements are filed in a timely fashion
with the right internal groups
on the il bond issue
there must be a disconnect between us and the icc
the icc believes that our bond isn't current
maybe we can figure this out together tomorrow
call if anyone has any questions
jim
just to keep you in the loop on sce negotiations
jim
agreed
fyi
who will attend and present
jim
should we work through arem
jim
amr
can we use cash as collateral for pjm
jim
can you please add this to the general write-up for each iso
thanks
pls print and have for my naruc phone call
jim
can we move it to 0pm
thanks
mike
ashley brown called to discuss a meeting with the stakeholders in columbus
oh on either dec 0 or dec 0
he would like our participation
also
he would like us to let our friends in the industry know about this upcoming meeting
thanks
jim
i think that enron is interested supporting your idea
let's weigh in with appropriate language that counters the below language
i think that the state-level parties
and the iurc
have an interest in the miso acknowledging that it is an indiana utility with some degree of accountability re
at least
bundled retail load to the indiana commission and the indiana parties
please work with sarah n
to create a reasonable response and our key arguments
jim
interesting ideas on reliant and orion asset transfer
jim
in our discussion of the duke model
we don't outline when the cap would be set
would the duke model give our traders certainty before the fact and certainty that no refund is due if we don't exceed
maybe make this point stronger
jim
janine
what does this do to our current book of customers on msg
will our $$ margin evaporate
is there some other
solution
on how to restructure the fe retail market
what wholesale issues does fe need to change to help the ews desk
jim
pls print for my naruc call
jim
no need to prepare anything
they'll do most of the talking
jim
ok
but if this case ends up in settlement
we should have our priorities outlined before the case
jim
attached please find the nov ga report
please call with any questions
jim
please get internal comments from thane twiggs
sue mara
steve walton
dan staines
and dave perrino before letting doug go public with this document
i want to make sure that we are correct in some of our analysis
for example
i think that you may have misinterpreted the ferc in the california discussion
jim
mike
i'm guessing that sue and/or jeff have responded
the short answer is that there are going to be a number of legal tests before we are
completely
in the clear
jim
thanks
let's get together
just you and i
and figure out how we can make sure our teams are working together
i am sure that you don't want to worry about this stuff any more than i do
how about for 0 minutes after the ees op comm on monday
jim
so the short answer is that ees needs to change its procedures
also
is the 0kw right for all markets
jim
had a call from tribolet
he agrees
as does lisa m
that we need to rationalize our california legal support
can we outline our key cases
also
my opinion is to continue to use mike day but have you as the only
point of contact
for approval of work
let's talk today
we will need to talk with vicki
jim
documents developed for naruc by janel
etal
jim
i hope you are having fun at the nutcracker market
tell christi and susan hello
fyi
i like it
our argument should be that the miso is not an indiana public utility
i'd put it in the dialogue just to keep from having the process work out poorly
jim
tom
you may want to go to this event and report back to susan lindberg
it could provide a nice overview of the status
jim
sue
did you ever reach terrie wheeler
jim
we already knew it
more importantly
i'd extend his thought to every competitive retail market in the us
jim
the tough question may be taking a long-term cash committment and transforming it into a single npv payment
discount rate issues
assuming that is part of the options
jim
pls submit an rcr for me to discuss at today's meeting
rcr
epsa se rto study
$0k
jim
texas gas plan
agreed
did we want to get off the creditors comm
thanks
then let's proceed with that model
someone needs to tell jean b
not to get involved
jim
your thoughts
jim
in what forum will this be discussed
jim
how about 0am tomorrow
jim
dave
i assume you are following this
jim
thanks
let me know how the desk sees it
also
please make sure that we talk with ees gas
don black
jim
thanks
i want to go down with you
thx
jim
lisa
while wanda and i with the ferc team agreed on a process of moving forward
i want to make sure that the documents properly deal with how the ferc haircut will be handled
when will you have a new version to read
jim
thanks
thanks
is everything ok
haven't got anything today
if i get some
i'll send to epsa
thanks
any issues for the p/ls or for tim belden in the west
jim
thanks
fyi
also
does the same obligation present itself in illinois
are there any restricitions or obligations on ees as a marketer in ip territory
jim
how about tuesday the 0th

jim
elizabeth
let's please meet this week to update this web site
jim
a good summary of current rto activities
jim
a couple of thoughts
0.ng is trying to schedule a meeting in columbus either dec 0 or dec 0
0.i did speak with ashley
he indicated that ng has no specific inclination to avoid lmp in the real-time
he did not
however
confirm that ng was indifferent
0.i am very concerned with the implication that mike highlights in his point #0
ng may simply have misstated its intentions
but clearly this position makes it difficult for ng to join miso under appendix i
they would be giving up too much
0.i agree that what ng is really saying is a for-profit rto with ownership of some
but not necessarily all
transmission plant in its footprint
0.let's try and coordinate our discussions with paul dawson in the london office to gather his thoughts on ng in the uk market
luiz
can you please develop some questions
talking points based on the attached comments that we can transmit to ashley brown prior to the meetinthanks
gary
do you still have a contact at waste management
i hear their financial troubles seem to be under control
just wanted to start some inquiries
jim
jackie
pls send me a copy of the report
i am trying to identify generation assets owned and/or controlled in ercot by enron and its affiliates
the information i have been provided is that enron only has ponderosa pine energy partners ltd
0 mw
is this correct
do we have any long-term capacity over the dc tie
do we have any construction in progress
any other positions
e.g
capacity auction
that may be considered by the puct in the merger
is there anyone else i should talk with about this information
thanks
jim
houston time
we spoke with roger yang
they don't have anything on the shelf
i started to look at the pg&e web site and figured out that you'd have to have a phd in oper research to re-compute the px credit on an hourly basis
jim
harry
fyi
ok to travel
jim
yes
have fun
jim
guys
i understand the differences
becky is going to get on the epsa call tomorrow and tell them that we are ok with the nopr
and will file as such
and that epsa should make sure to not blow up the nopr
or try
becky if epsa wants complete agreement
then they shouldn't file
grab me if you want to talk
jim
chip
the e-mail i referenced in my voice mail
please call if you have any information
jim
also
please look at this file
thanks chip
if you hear anything else
please let me know
jim
isn't friday the potluck
if not
yes
otherwise
how about thursday
can i get a copy daily
thanks
rick
let's discuss bad messaging at naruc meeting at our thursday meeting
jim
my initial take is to keep engaged through perrino
i'll try and make the call this thursday
jim
please arrange a call in # for 0pm thursday
we are trying to identify assets and contracted positions that enron will either own or control in ercot to process the puct merger analysis
if you have any information on existing or planned assets or positions please let me know
if you want to discuss
please feel free to call me at 0x0
thanks
jim
thanks
attached is a summary of pg&e's notes on how they calculate the px credit
until january 0
0 when they hardwired $0/mwh
we continue to try and get a handle on how the ferc refund case will impact the px credit and negative ctc
if anyone has any issues or comments
please let me know
thanks
jim
i put it together from notes on the pg&e web site
i may ask roger to review
jim
jean
why not ask marianne carroll to draft a short note on the current status of the docket and likely outcomes/timing
thanks
gloria
before we move forward
please talk with steve montovano
thanks
greek
here is our current list
thanks
jim
the $$ should come from the business people
jim
great
i briefly looked at your papers
the idea is very promising if you can find the agency/government
jim
my number is 0-0-0
see you tuesday
denise
do you have a listing of all bonds that ees
and its affiliates
has in place for retail marketing
including wholesale isos
speaking with gloria
we don't keep this information in govt affairs
rebecca fite keeps bond information required in the state licensing processing
the place that i think that is missing is wholesale service providers
e.g
isos
i think that we need to expand this idea of bonding to
financial guarantees
including with utilities
states
and wholesale service providers
maybe the best way to start is to work backwards from ees active markets and determine what is needed in each locale
thanks
jim
thanks for the thoughts
i fully agree on bf costs and dwr costs
i believe that you are right on est rt$ = caisom imbalance
but i need to check
on the question of retroactive ratemaking
it is my understanding that you are correct
pg&e probably won't rebill
but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward px credit to
collect
the overpayment of negative ctc
all of this means that the impact of the ferc refund is less than 0c on the $ for the negative ctc
jim
alan
the only way to collect the
overpayment
is to artificially reduce the px credit going forward to thereby allow for more ctc
jim
andy
i was speaking yesterday with chuck ward
he indicated that we continue to have
or may have soon
litigation surrounding our ownership interest in cornhusker
this is important primarily because the texas public utility code requires that the puc approve any merger of generators that will have a combined ownership of over 0%
which dynegy and enron will have
i want to make sure that we represent our ownership interest to the puc appropriately given the current dispute
if you have any specifics
please let me know or give me a call
thanks
jim
thanks
once done
let's have a phone call with the wholesale electricity team to discuss before sending to ashley
jim
except that my understanding of the sce model is that the ctc structure will continue beyond 0/0/0
and may then apply for pg&e
i agree that if you were to go to a bottom's up
it would require the cpuc to put in place a surcharge for remaining stranded costs
non-generation
for example qfs
and a second surcharge for negative ctc
overpayment
key question is who will pay the negative ctc
overpayment
on trying to understand the px credit algorithim
my concern is that to understand how much the
overpayment
was during oct
feb
we need to understand how costs hit the structure during that time period
otherwise we don't know what form or amount of discount is required in the settlement talks
jim
lisa
something to think about
do we want to try and expand the issues to resolve the settlement
jim
rebecca
pls work through gloria and bevin hunter
in austin
my understanding is that puct filing deadlines are always 0pm
but bevin can take it over to the puct this evening
i assume that you will create the report and gloria will draft a simple cover sheet filing
gloria
we may need marianne carroll to sign
jim
bob frank will be coordinating with services from govt affairs
thanks
fully agree
i assume we are happier with this message
thanks for the tip
why don't we try to have lunch in early december
i'm going to try and take off the week after thanksgiving
jim
rick
please find attached the asset report in texas
enron's ownership depends on what day the filing is made
for instance
indian mesa won't be active until dec and may be sold immediately
also
there is an on-going arbitration with cornhusker about our ownership right
andy edison has the lead from ews legal
jim
ray
let
s hold a call in early dec
i don't need to be on the call
where we go through the ferc case for belden
give me a call to discuss
jim
thanks
julie
enron would be willing to move forward with the boston pacific study
at the $0k
level
thanks
jim
well
haven't they got themselves in a pickle
jim
rick
here is the information on staffing and outside services
call if you need anything else
jim
thanks
before we take this on
let's talk about how it fits into our priorities
what will be happening that we must cover
jim
i am planning on calling in from home
do we have a list of issues/states that we want epsa to focus on
if you send me your thoughts
i think that we can send to epsa before the phone call
my list
0
az opposition to the aps
pinnacle west generation
sale
0
continue pushing at state level for nox fairness in allocation to ipps 0
re-instate direct access in california
many epsa members
led by williams
will fight against direct access
i won't push hard here
jim
ok
i agree
jim
this means that the dst proceeding moves forward
right
how about a phone call at 0pm houston time to catch up on all matters
jim
lunch works
i thin 0:0 is best
jim
attached is the most recent statement from the california utilities that implements the da suspension
filed friday
comments are due nov 0
wed
from parties
the utilities continue push for a
hard
deadline of da
they also offer an option where suppliers would be required to submit a affidavit for incremental dasrs and potentially have the cpuc review the specific contract language
of course
in no event do they believe that any customer should be allowed to have da service if the customer's name was not on our oct 0 customer list
jeff and i will be talking with mike smith
and anyone else who wants to participate
to work through our response to these comments
jim
don't worry
appreciate the thought
jim
not sure yet
we will be talking with arem and will want your input
we may have to file but not sure
jim
here are my thoughts
0
agree that offering transmission provider waiver given rto status is premature
0
maybe strengthen argument that both unbundled provider of last resort type service and bundled utility sales service should be included in the affiliate definition
at a minimum
in places like pa
where the utility sales service is a direct competitor
there should be no difference with any competitive player
in a state like ga
where the utility sales service is a
monopoly
by statue
i.e
bundled retail
i still think given the ability to cogenerate
it makes sense to have these providers take transmission service similar to our service at wholesale
maybe make this argument earlier and as the core focus
i fully agree to include these providers in the definition
0
leslie
call christi n
to discuss examples of how native load exemption has caused problems
we've put in earlier filings
0
the question of
holding company
etc
we should argue for an exemption
0
i am also troubled by the
administer
term
ferc should prohibit any
helping
by the transmission provider of anyone in the marketplace
maybe focus ferc on clarifying its positions
0
emergency sections
keep the language you have that never applied to natural gas industry
and could be a real problem given a caiso type situation
ask alan comnes for thoughts
probably don't object but want to make sure that if emergency develops there must a pre-set timeframe for going back to normal business
0
everything filed at the ferc related to standards of conduct should be posted on the oasis
i didn't understand the final bullet point comments
is this policy or a statement of something to come
jim
can we talk this week on our response
jim
does epsa agree that ferc should require all transmission providers should agree to an rto of the ferc's choosing or lose mbr for all affiliates
that's the other message lynne should put out
jim
i know that was the plan and we do intend to work with arem
but we may have to file if our needs aren't met
jim
eemc has filed in md for a gas license
it is on the calendar for this wednesday
there have been a number of letters sent dealing with
questions
on our license
govt affairs is concerned that this will be voted down by the puc given everything that is going on with the company and our incomplete record
we would recommend that the agenda item be removed this week and we deal with the outstanding issues
if anyone has a significant reason not to pull the item
please let me or harry kingerski know as soon as possible
thanks
jim
harry
i think that we need to talk with ews tariff risk to make sure that we are on the same page
i am concerned that some of gloria's statements may not end up happening with the final tariffs
please advise
jim
i'll call ashley and relay the message
jim
fyi
any thoughts
janet
here is the org chart that captures our discussions
i think that this org and the # of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ena and ees
total headcount = 0
the personnel cost = $0.0 mm
total for ena and ees
please let me know if you have any questions
jim
harry
rebecca is ok with pulling the md license until the issues are corrected
also
who is following up on the va license
thanks
jim
dan
i will get with evan and his team and pull this together
of course
much of the activity with utilities is driven by their requirements and judgements
which change over time
jim
gloria
where are we on a matrix of utility agreements
jim
thanks
i'll ask around floor
given my background
this position does not sound like the best fit
i'd rather be more on the long-term contracting
origination
side or business development
thanks for the inquiry
as you know
things are pretty crazy right now here at enron
i intend to take the week off after thanksgiving and intend to give you a call during that period
have a great thanksgiving
jim
thanks
how about heading off campus
less likely to run into enron people
let's meet in the parking lot entrance
right where the little store is on the way to the met
at 0:0
if anything comes up
call me on my cell at 0-0-0
jim
i would like to take something to dan leff by end of business tomorrow
whatever we have
thanks
jim
let's do it at 0pm tonight at teala's
jim
janet
0
the best split is probably just 0/0 on personnel
while everyone is in a specific box on the org chart
many if not all of the people are flexible enough that they can cover different roles
the $ on outside services may be able to be split differently going forward
for example
if ees wants something specific on a state puc matter
0
in terms of approving outside service expenditures
i would like to sit down with you
louise
and rick to work out what the best method of working through the approvals
i will try and set up some time the first week of december
0
i have put steve montovano in the ne gas box
this will increase the budget by $0k
based on historical figures
i have attached a new org chart to represent this change
also
dan staines
who is not on the org chart
has an employment contract that ends 0/0/0
dan has been working on florida and northeast rto matters and continues to help east power with the nyiso tcc auction
we can sever him
but his contract will need to be paid off
$0k
govt affairs also has a contract for support with joe connor
ex-southern exec
to support our se activities
i am trying to get a copy of the contract
but i think that it is in place until 0/0
my recommendation is to use these guys through their contracts instead of a large payment today
thanks
jim
draft
i would recommend that if we keep roy boston we not keep pat keene and move bob frank to texas with roy boston in the mid-c
jim
as with everything else right now
i take no offense
it was a pleasure meeting with you
i wish you all of the best
jim
gloria
we need to keep this type of information in our matrix on recent contact
jim
something to think about
topics to be covered in the texas intrastate white paper
0
current state of the texas intrastate market 0
areas for improvement 0
proposed future state of the texas intrastate market 0
strategy for implementation 0
actions for implementation a
form of transport contract b
gas flows in texas c
basis price history
after talking with dan
i intend to set up a meeting to provide complete matrices on licensing and utility contracts sometime early during the week beginning dec 0
also
just to make sure everyone is clear
harry
gloria
and rebecca are on point during the next few weeks to ensure that that ees and/or epmi responds timely to any request for info
additional security
or other utility matters
this
of course
will continue to require help from legal
credit
and operations
if anyone has any other questions
please give me a call
thanks
ees does not sell power except potential if it overschedules to their retail load and
sells
balancing energy to ip
i'm not even sure if we are delivering any energy to any customers in the market
i'll send to rogers herndon
jim
thanks
please do
we could discuss on the regular nerc call at 0:0 tuesdays
jim
during the merger
transactions between a regulated company of one of the partners
ip
pge
should not do business with the other
if ees or epmi is buying or selling from ip
please let me know
also
if we are delivering to retail load behind the ip market
we may need to make sure that our actions are with the code of conduct
i don't think that we have to worry much with pge side because epmi and ees are already acting within the code of conduct
jim
fyi
check this out
jim
ashley
first
hope you have great thanksgiving holiday
luiz maurer and others put together the following set of questions for ng to potentially discuss at the upcoming meeting or earlier
if you have any questions
please call me
also
enron will sign on to a petition to for extension of time in the ng/arto case
not sure when this is due out
some other people were pushing it and with everything going on here at enron we needed more time to respond
please don't take this as a signal that we can't continue to discuss and maybe help find a solution
thanks
jim 0
profit-rto
where does your proposed organization fit in the attached graph in terms of end state
stage iii
stage iv
0
regarding document
response of national grid usa to questions posed by the commission
does it imply that core
for profit functions should not be subject to a stakeholder process
wasn't the neta design subject to an extensive consultation
even for profit
ng core functions
0
if each transco manages it own oasis
how can we avoid fragmentation
balkanization
pancaking and many other negative aspects and seams that the rto process is trying to eliminate
how can you achieve one-stop shopping
by outsourcing those functions to one single third party
0
as a follow up question
what are the mechanisms to assure that this
potential
fragmentation may lead to underinvestments in t
particularly in important inter-tie investments
0
what kind of pbr mechanism are you envisioning for the transco-rto
are you thinking about including
external
measures such as cost to provide ancillary services
congestion costs or costs incurred in energy balancing
0
are you envisioning an rto-transco model which will assume that all transmission assets in the region will be divested
or can the model live with a
light
rto where part of the assets are divested but others are not
and sign an operating agreement with the rto
would your proposed matrix of rto functions
page 0
still be robust under this scenario
0
can your proposed rto model dovetail with an lmp/congestion management system based on financial rights
our understanding is that neta completely reorganized the uk pool
the uk system now looks like a
self-dispatch
physical rights model
0
as a follow up of the previous question
assuming alliance adopts a self-dispatch
physical rights approach similar to the one ng operates in the uk today
don't you think that this will create significant barriers/seams with other neighboring rtos
considering that there seems to be a general trend towards security constrained dispatch
lmp and financial rights for most rtos in the us
0
if your proposed system can be dovetailed to a central dispatch
lmp/financial rights
shouldn't some functions in your
martix of rto functions
be collapsed
for example
management of congestion prices
calculation of congestion
operations of energy markets and generation redispatch
0
procurement and deployment of ancillary services is listed as non-core
however
in the uk system
this represents a significant role of the transco
with incentives and penalties attached to its achievement
is there a different vision or do you assume that those functions will end up being developed by the rto and consequently will be part of the pbr formula
0
generation interconnection
obviously
your proposal did not go that far
conceptually
do you favor a system whereby t fixed costs are recovered via a postage stamp rate across an entire region or do you favor the uk model whereby fixed costs
use of the system
are calculated based on incremental cost and have a strong locational component
and connection costs are treates separately
according to a shallow method
0
establishment of transmission rates
how to reconcile the fact that those should be regulated and you propose that the transco itself will establish its t rates
are you thinking about some possible non-regulated activities
0
you stated that separation and control of t assets persists
to a large extent
in the collaborative model proposed as part of the southeast mediation
do you think that the independent system administration model is superior in this regard
what are the key important differences in your view in the conceptual design of those models
molly
please let either gloria or harry know if you need our assistance
jim
nice to meet your brother
do you have a map of the 0th
jim
thanks
yes this gets at my issues
i want to build your matrix and rebecca's together
no where do we deal with reporting yet
also
we need to have some systematic approach to updates and naming
point people
jim
i received a call late today from the cpuc
joyce @ 0-0-0
someone from pac tel called and said that his service was switched without authorization
mike benson with payphone group @0-0-0 or 0-0-0
lamar
who is the client rep for pac tel
can they get into pac tel and try and find out if we have done something inappropriate
we need to call this guy back by monday eob
please let jeff dasovich know so he can call joyce back
i'll be out on vacation next week
jim
christi
i'm out next week
this is a bit touchy with the changes coming
why not have jose agree to go
no one else
and if necessary we'll backfill
jim
my thoughts
0
great job
0
i would change the message in the conclusion
and elsewhere
that the work should be done at the same time
the commission should act quickly to establish the scope and configurations of rtos
while also working and then begin the process of creating a standardized pro forma transmission tariff and market design to be implemented by these rtos
0
thanks for getting in
network plus
it's the little things that matter
0
maybe strengthen that just standardizing is not enough
real integration across seams is imperative
ny and pjm have same tariff same model but haven't worked well for a long time
thanks
luiz
attached is a version that i changed
mainly formattting the intro
i think that our current draft is too long without a short synopsis up front
we want a white paper that reads like an advocacy piece
please add to whatever you are doing
also
move forward with contacting larry ruff for
0
his analysis of your and my combined draft and
0
a simple affadavit on this
govt affairs will pay up to $0k for this work out of our current budget
we need to have this finished by tuesday eob
charles
we need to make sure that monday and tuesday someone calls everyone on the committee considering changing these rules on thursday
let's get the list and start lobbying actively
call me if you have any questions
please talk with doug gilbert-smith about who and where

working on msg jim steffes enron
wade
anywhere that we have supplier consolidated billing enron put up some form of credit to cover 0+ days of utility charges
so while i am unsure of the form of collateral
if evan provides a list of where we are doing supplier consolidated billing
we should be able to construct a collateral obligation worksheet
we also have collateral in each iso
ne-iso
nyiso
pjm
caiso
it will take some time to de-dasr to dual billing and until our accounts switch
the utilities will hold the collateral
jim
jim
christi
sarah
do we have to do something related to this
thanks
jim note also that in a separate development ferc simultaneously opened a broad investigation under section 0 of the federal power act to apply the new market-based-sales policy to all u.s
sellers nationwide
what this means is that
although only three utilities are mentioned in this initial order
it is expected that ferc will continue to take steps to constrain what it believes to be erratic wholesale markets
reportedly
some 0 companies are awaiting similar reviews by ferc to determine if the commission believes they exert market power
the 0 investigation reportedly also requires power providers with market-based sales authority to amend their tariffs within 0 days to provide ferc with open-ended authority to order refunds if the commission determines that market manipulation has occurred
did you hear anything on wm
jim
julie
given our current situation at enron

jim
thanks jim steffes enron
there was a discussion today involving home depot and our inaction regarding not having sent out a dasr
to make sure that we are all on the same page
please let me know if anyone disagrees with the following
0
we
meaning ees broadly
do have customers with metered demand greater than 0 mw
otherwise known as non-price to beat
0
for non-price to beat customers that have not been dasrd or have no contract
the affiliated rep will provide service to the customer beginning on their first meter reading after jan 0
0 under a blanket term of service agreement
let me know if you want copies
under the following price terms txu energy services cost = $0 per kw for demand
based on highest demand in last 0 months
+ $0/mwh + $0/month + delivery costs + taxes
reliant energy services cost =
0.0 * daily gas index * kwh
+
0.0 * capacity price
* kw
billing demand
+ $0/month + delivery costs + taxes
0
if the customer does not pay their bill
they will then be placed on polr service
0
the arep offers month-to-month service with a 0 calendar day notice provision for cancellation
0
next opportunity to dasr these customers will be dec 0
0
0
when we find a buyer for the texas book or all of the company
ees intends to obtain permission from the customer to assign the non-price to beat customers
this implies that we will not be sending out the opt-out provision to non-price to beat customers
jim
thanks marianne
we've been in contact with the puc but we will need some help next week

christi pls send spreadshet jim steffes enron
call jeff brown
he use to work there jim steffes enron
to follow-up on nepool matters
last week
the nepool members comm did not take any action against enron
i received a call today
that i intend to return tomorrow
from dave doot
nepool secretary
he would like to have a phone call with enron's attorneys and credit people to figure out how to manage our credit issues going forward
the reason there was no action last week was because nepool hoped that they could work something out
i do not know what the bills are for ees/eemc/epmi
i will call dave doot and find a good time for later this week when i can arranage a call with the appropriate people
call with any other questions
jim
harry
let me write-up some things on this and will send to you
hope everyone is well
jim
maureen
thanks for the information on the switching of the
held
customers
we will process through a standard edi transaction
i am trying to find out who would work up the credit amount
when i find out
i'll e-mail you
thanks
jim
marcus and ed can we talk today about this
is there a good time
i need to get back with nepool today
also
while our business dropped off
i am guessing that ne-iso has been arranging energy for our ui load and our payable is growing pretty quickly
jim
didn't know about this
have we compared this list to our gas market termination list
jane
can you please send me the list
jim
customers we will start to de-dasr probably next week
very confidential
i see that uc/csu is on this list
have any buyers been interested in their load
jim
someone from csc was on the call
allison hafner
txu said the meters were to be read by dec 0 with final edi files sent to ercot by dec 0
ercot would process a rep of record change on dec 0
looks like everything is ok
jim
i will review the list
but i need someone from gas team and someone from power team to help
let's talk at 0am meeting tomorrow
jim
can we get together this afternoon to discuss calling nepool
how about 0pm
jim
let's meet at christi's desk on ebs0 and find a conference room
jim
suzanne
becky cantrell had entered enron into a number of dockets before ferc related to pipeline rate and other matters
not sure if there were protests
i would greatly appreciate you coming over to 0 and going through a number of filings so we can either
a
stay in the case or
b
remove our name as an active party
elizabeth linnell has the papers on 0
my initial thought is that enron does not need to continue in these cases
but the newco will want to understand what to join after formation
we may want to talk with commercial types to gauge their thoughts
please let me know if you can take care of this
thanks
jim
paul
i have no information as discussed below
jim
mary lynne
is this for both ees and eemc
is epmi in this bill
can we pay separately by company
jim
doug
the puct called out of the blue and indicate that they would like to talk with you about this information
have they communicated with you about this
jim
they would like to talk to you
jim
fyi
please add so we can get to fallon on monday
jim
doug
it seems to me that keeping the puc somewhat appeased makes sense
i'll try and get some formal questions
but sooner or later they will want to talk directly
i appreciate that this is a pain
but maybe it's a good opportunity to push to get rid of balanced schedules
let's sit down on thursday am and talk
jim
please comment asap
want to get to fallon
jim
pjm sent a bill for the 0 annual fee
for $0
upon paying the fee
epmi will be able to access e-schedules
pjm is looking for payment on december 0
0 along with our november grid payment
i assume that no enron company will need the e-schedule system after january 0 and therefore we will not be making this payment
please advise
jim
also have we returned our physical pjm customers yet
jim
with the cancellation of a number of surety bonds by our providers
we are faced with a potential credit crunch in nepool
also
it is my understanding
although i haven't seen anything
that our nov 0 bills are due in all of the markets on dec 0
0
christi and i are trying to work out our payment plans
if any
and other requirements to keep our books afloat
we need to have support on understanding any payment obligations
and bills if we have them
and issues
e.g
annual fees
who can we talk with for each market
thanks
jim
fyi
call if you need anything
jim
jim
here is a quick and dirty overview
please let me know if you need anything else
jim
lisa and dave
are you the right people to discuss payment or modified credit terms for epmi
the issue with nepool is that our ui/cmp/nstar wholesale reqts deals would be harmed if we don't pay these guys
i don't know if we should pay
but i need to figure out who is on point for paying if that decision is reached
i know that john llodra is trying to sell these positions
jim
bob
please follow up with juan so we can ensure coverage
jim
mary
i need to know the other bonds that aren't cancelled
are there more
jim
come to 0am mtg jim steffes enron
fyi
thought you'd be interested
jim
i am trying to pull together a list of the pre-petition and post-petition claims against ees and eemc
and epmi where collateral may exist as one entity
as well as any other obligation in the key power and gas markets
i hope to have this tomorrow
jim
let's talk tomorrow
jim
wade
there may also need to be another $0k for eesi
jeff is checking
jim
chris
i did discuss enron's payment issues with pjm with our team
to make sure that we are on the same page
0
no additional collateral is required at this time
0
the annual fee is also due on 0/0/0 = $0,0
one fee for all affiliated companies
i will call you tomorrow
jim
iso-ne is seeking the following by december 0
0 to continue enron's presence in the market
amount due $0.0 mm amount due $0.0 mm 0
we are verifying these figures
iso-ne may have ees and epmi amount due reversed
0
the process post 0/0/0 is unclear
not sure if enron companies can schedule without posting security 0
surety bonds have been revoked and safeco/fireman's sent notices that bonds can not be used for post-petition claims i can't imagine that enron will post collateral in these amounts
in the caiso market
enron has 0 days of projected expenses as security coupled with a going-forward power supply
may be an alternative worth considering
any other questions
please call me at 0x0
how do i take care of this
jim
ed
can you please draft a letter
similar to what paul darmitzel sent to gas ldcs
to send to peco thursday to indicate that placing our physical load customers on bundled polr service is not objectionable to ees
we have a bill due in pjm this thursday that may not get paid
if we don't pay pjm on thursday
our brief analysis of the pa supplier tariff is that peco can pull these customers back
the customers in peco are gno
e.g
suiza
so not sure what the contract issues would be
maybe michelle can help here
my understanding is that the contracts should allow ees to serve using utility power
so we should still have the right to determine to reject or not
please let me know if you can do this and if there are any issues
thanks
jim
troy
a few questions
0
the counterparty
pge
is that pacific gas
electric or portland general electric
0
when do you think that you would have the
unknown
researched
0
i assume that the costs associated with ercot or caiso are captured in the epmi and ena payables
thanks
ed is drafting the letter and coordinating with michelle
jim
my understanding is that jim wood is making the recommendation on etown
correct
jim
dave
i wish you and your family all of the best
may you have a happy and prosperous new year
please keep in touch
jim
diann

jim
susie and i talked
she and i agreed that she would work 0-0 m-th
and 0-0 on fridays
we had agreed to that before she left
i also filled her in on our situation as a company
she had no idea
i didn't want her to get blindsided by any kind of decision
i am sorry you have been so sick
that sounds just awful
are you all better now
i can think of nothing worse than not being able to talk well
my head would explode
love
good morning
diane is out today and all next week
so just call me thanks
cara semperger
we did 0 hlh parking with pge
please see diana or me for details
thanks for that laugh
i needed it
here's the deal
a call swaption was sold to me by pollard for the intrinsic and extrinsic value of the desks on the floor times 0.0 per month
i sold this put to myself and pocketed a next fixed premium of one million dollars
i took that six million dollars and used it to finance the new snickers plant that is going to be built in 0 years
i divided the reesee's plant and the snickers plant
sold put-call parodies on the reesee's and put the snickers plant up for collateral on a 0 million dollar loan to finance potato chip options
my net was 0.0 billion dollars
so i am the one buying enron
my new company is called
cara-land
i am working on the national anthem now
the real cara comes out at last
you will notice schedulers working feverishly behind me
thanks
thanks vish
i will let you know if any more bugz show up
just checking in to say hi
wanted to know what slc is like
good evening i ran a master download for december 0 so that over the next few days i can test the overwriting fix
and found two deals that are 0 hour deals
show scheduled hours of 0-0
but are segregated with the
off peak
deals
the deal numbers are
can you look and see if they are booked in a strange way that makes them fall into the wrong segregation category
here is my psw sheet
diane is out all week
just call ol cara to tell her all about it
no
i will just make a note of these two strange deals
tom and i confirmed this change via phone earlier
just let me know when the update has been done
and i will pop in and do a few more tags
thanks
good afternoon
the last of our kinks has been worked out and we are going to go ahead with all schedules in the new system as of 0/0
we will then have a good couple of weeks under our belt before the start of a new month
the last date you will see any preschedules in lotus is 0/0/0 please see me if you have any questions
cara
build route is a very vital part of what we use every day
any change to it must go thru me
the change in the build route for dart deals is a minor one
a check box on the user interface
real time can run the report to show only dart deals
and they would be captured that way
please see me before any changes to the build route are discussed
cara
please copy me on anything that you need to speak to the developers on
dart changes to the build route need to be done in the preschedule workspace version of build route
as that is what we are using now
we have been phasing out the old build route
cara
things are coming back a bit
here is your sheet
for your eyes only
i dont wanna piss off the new massa
thank you dave for the horribly long hours you put in on this
i was able to access the record in path confrimation
and it has the correct info in it now
i recognize those sunglasses
ha ha ha
any ideas
the time difference is from nearly instantaneous before to 0-0 seconds now
have a good day cara semperger
hi mom
i am so glad that nathan seems to be responding
his well being and future are what is most important
i don't know what to say to the behavior of beth not taking responsibility for the financial end
and kind of holding you both hostage with this unspoken threat to withold your grandchildren
i have so little respect for her for treating people this way
if i didn't think she would punish you somehow
i would tell her so
i am looking forward to seeing you next week
woohoo
cara
much interest from me
please have the default set to
starting on
not
active on
we use starting on every day
and active on much more rarely
thanks
cara
the old build route remembered what the user chose last for delivery points
and had it in the defaults each time build route was opened
can this be duplicated in the psw version of build route
his attempts to get path confirmation he gets this error access violation at address 0e0 in module
path confirm.exe
read of address 0
he needs access asap
thanks
cara
hi donald is having an access violation when he tries to run the path confirmation report
vish is aware of this
and wants to do some investigating tomorrow
but i don't know if donald will have time
maybe you can do this with vish and donald's passwords
stacy still has performance issues running the report launcher locally
i am just ducky
i am suprised at how little the bare bones employee and the full package employee trips differ in price
i wanna do the 0 grand package
employees and spouses
do for us but do the works
i think it would be a welcome perk in a weary office right now
i turned my computer completely off and back on to see if my connection would improve
it didn't
my plain old data only no macro excel sheet still takes 0 seconds to save
outlook also seems slow
but i never liked it anyway
mike tully is going to work on this with you today
it is slower today than it was last night
i assume from traffic
y'all have a good weekend
cara semperger

i had populated the market path first
dynegy's presentation outlining what is important to them

pardner
things are much better now
we only have minor issues with control areas
and none so specific as to be addressed in a formal way
thanks
other deals is fine
build route has been selecting the hourly deals just fine
and including them in the off peak sections
we must be able to see these deals
as we have a great many deals with odd hours and shaped schedules
thanks
cara
i propose we just keep aol
i got your res and will keep it in case i hear of anything
take mine
and put it in your just in case folder
love
none of us can get on the main site
and we are using their alternate site
i had some difficulty making tags
but have finished
the problem i was having today is identical to my problem a few weeks ago where i could make the tag
but then everything would hang when i hit the
confirm
button
cara semperger
why is this coming from you
good morning
diane is off today and tomorrow
just call ol
cara with questions
i will be there with husband
i need a reccomendation
please let me know when you have a few minutes of spare time
stacy just ran her build route for december and got data with no counterparty names
i just ran my build route for december and got new data blended with old data
we need help immediately stacy's number is 0/0-0
we need to be able to rely on the repeated running of the build route
running a month long sheet from scratch is a huge problem for us
it forces us to do massive amounts of work over and over again
i need you to find out why this is happening
and let me know when it is fixed
cara
nice
have a good time
good afternoon kathy
please get susie a december parking pass
we also need a box that says
include only dart deals
please also make absolutely sure that this is included in the psw build route
as we use it nearly exclusively now.vish knows about our problems with that

dave said he called you
i feel awful
i called 0-0-0-0 and navigated thru the automated menu
someone came on line and helped me
the confirmed my point balance and and asked me what i wanted to get
i told them and they did it on the spot
they also referred me to this website i am not suggesting a course of action
but rather relaying my experience cara
her mailbox must be full or something
we are getting her mail kicked back can we tidy up her mail a bit
she returns on tuesday
thank you for your kind words
this is the hardest decision and the most painful one i have ever had to make
dave needs his family so much right now
as he has very few friends
please call him often and if you can invite him down for a visit please do that
i am confident that if we are calm and peaceful through this process we can emerge on the other side as friends
i promise to do everything in my power to be kind generous and calm
love
no changes to any existing data
just adding real power losses
kitten
thanks
cara
put vending machines in where it says cows
and you have the filed business plan for my new company
hi sweetie
i still can't believe all of this
we are laying off people here left and right
our traders are trying to call in favors to find jobs for as many people as possible
we are still trying to deliver on contracts
and not all of our counterparties have cut us off
i can't imagine for the life of me why anyone would continue to do business with us
i love you
and pat and riley cara
hi mom
i am still here
there is so little work that pretty much all i do is talk to people
play computer games and read e-mail
i still can't believe that this has all happened
dave is doing better
he is calmer now and less upset
i am glad to see that
i felt really bad for how upset he was
he is going to go stay with his folks for a few days
they had their insurance company call and tell them that if they didn't clean up the outside of the house that they would drop them from insurance
they had a gardener come out
but dave is going to take the pressure washer down and wash the house
i personally think they need to move to a retirement apartment with some living assistance
they do not seem to have the ability to take care of anything anymore
work is winding down
folks are bored and working on resumes and stuff
i love you
cara
i can pop up today if you would like
just give me a call and i can dash over
thanks
thanks tara
i propose that while work is so slow we have some informal tutorials from the folks who know stuff
sql access excel stuff
susie is a bona-fide expert teacher
html xml whatever folks might want to teach
there are bpa real power losses for the 0th only and some transmission only paths
i will be surrendering my cell phone when enron no longer wishes to pay for it
i am still having lots of problems with oati
hi mom
things are a little better here for me
friday was a horrible day
we had layoffs of about 0% of our office
lots of crying and sadness on the floor
the weekend was strange
dave came back from eugene un announced which was not what we agreed to
and i got the feeling that he was thinking he was going to
catch
me doing something or having someone over
he is still really struggling with the idea that i just can't love him like a wife anymore
and that is not enough to keep two people together
i wish that i could make this easier on him
and i almost think that if i had been unfaithful it would be easier for him to accept
i am just trying to hold on until he gets some kind of income so that we can sell the house and pay our debt
i do not have any desire for him to be forced to live with his parents
i wouldn't wish that on anyone
just pray for him and for me
school sounds wonderful
i am so glad you are happy dealing with your little ones
how fun
i love you
cara
hi frank
thanks for taking care of the password changes for our real time group
things are still very up in the air here
we hear new developments nearly on a daily basis
and so much remains unknown
i am in kind of a wait and see mode
thank you for asking
cara
i am interested in being part of this effort if there is still room
hi
yesterday richter asked me to get with john oh and bring him up to speed on everything that we use
although i think this is a good idea
i think that this direction should more appropriately come from you
please let me know what you would like me to do
if it would be beneficial to have me explain our stuff to both john and victor
i will be happy to do so
thanks
good morning
due to our current situation
i have 0 full time very talented schedulers with very little to do
they have a wide range of experience and abilities
and would be available to assist you in whatever tasks may need handling
please let me know if you have temporary room for any one or all 0 of these folks
i would like them to have something to do while we are waiting for trading to resume
thanks
cara
let's meet tomorrow morning about 0 am to let me show you all of the tools that scheduling uses
i expect it will take about 0 minutes
thanks
cara

dear little sister
thank you so much for you love and support during this difficult time
i wish that i could make this easier on everyone
but this is what has to be done
i have no intention of separating from you or the rich/mcphersons
you all are more than family to me
you will always be my little sister
i am going to work very hard to come through this with dave and me as much friends as possible
so that the stress to us all will be minimized
i see no reason to hurt people over what amounts to belongings
i am glad you liked your gifts
you did save at least one to open on christmas day
right
i hope so
i have the house to myself this weekend
dave is at your folks to give us a little space
he is still very upset
and i feel bad that i have made him so sad
i really didn't think he would be this upset
i am glad that the family is rallying support for him
and i have been kind of laying low with the family so that he can have that support
he has no real friends here
and that is a big problem
i love you
cara
pizza pie
i haven't heard any firm plans
but i am game for nearly anywhere maybe perry can scare some folks up
hi sweeties
you are in my heart today
how goes the fight
dave has gone to his parents for the weekend to give me some space
and i am really liking being alone
i love you and hope you all are well
cara
hi mom
i am amazed at those bear photos
the entire office
what's left anyway
was around my desk looking at that
that guy must have filled his drawers
how is natalie doing
what shot do they think she reacted to
i can't imagine how frightening that must have been for monty and jackie and the whole family
dave is staying at bob and sandi's for the weekend
i asked him to go or let me know if he wanted to stay and i would go somewhere
i need some space and he is still so upset that my presence is not helping
it would be easier on him if i just moved out now
i can't because he can't afford to live in the house without me
and he can't leave because you can't get an apartment in this town without a job
we will be putting the house on the market no later than the first week of january
i love you
thank you for your love and support for both of us during this very difficult time
cara
please see the attached spreadsheet
i have added leg 0 to both annuities in red
i looked at the spreadsheet that diana forwarded me
and probably need for you and i to sit down and just walk me thru it
cara
i threw the tree tag away
but i gave lynn a bunch of bath goodies in the handle bag
i am so glad you got internet service at home
earthlink is good
have a wonderful time in florida
i liked it bunches when i went
things are strange here
dave is still very upset but is starting to trend toward anger now
he wants me to take the truck because he sees it as a betrayal that i got it for him a couple of months ago
ok
i have a truck now and he has the car
wanna buy a truck
he is also not wanting to be at home
which is fine with me
it is so tense and weird right now that i am glad to have the house to myself
i don't really want to be there either
i have been keeping busy with friends
they have been so good to me during this
i went to a seattle seahawks game yesterday at the university stadium
and thought about those trips up there to sit with you all during scotty's surgeries
seattle was nice
but it was a long day and horrbile horrible rain
our seats were in the upper stadium away from the wind so we were dry
i have a movie tomorrow and a party wednesday
tonight is just being home catching up on my laundry and my sleep
i love you very much
thanks for keeping me in your heart
cara
hey
is there any way on the face of the earth that i can get ahold of one of the remaining drexler basketballs
my boss just said
it's all good
i laughed my ass off
dear mom
i just want you to know that i love you very much
you still mean as much to me now as ever
i am your family whether i am married to dave or not
you are an example of kindness and giving
and one of the most special women on the planet as far as i am concerned
i have been kind of keeping quiet because i know how much dave needs you right now
and i don't want to say anything that would diminish him in your eyes
part of the reason that i waited as long as i did to do this is that i desperately wanted one last family thanksgiving where nobody has to choose who can come or feel strange or anything
dave has decided to stay with bob and sandi
and just come up to deal with the vending machines
i am glad
things are very tense and weird
i just want to get everything settled
he seems like he is getting angry
and i don't like that
he told me he wants me to keep the truck instead of the car because everytime he looks at the truck he feels like it is a betrayal
i got him this truck to help him with his business
wanna buy a brand new truck
anyway
it will all work out and we will all get thru this
i have a new cell phone number
please feel free to call me
and i will probably call you tonight just to touch base and let you know i love you
love
it's all good
everyone keeps asking my why i am grinning today
i thought i was playing it pretty straight
should we go ahead and separate our names on the credit cards
i think it would be wise
also
if you want to transfer pahio to our joint account that is fine
i would like to have pahio
when you come up
if you want to come to work here and get the car and give me the truck keys
we can do that
just let me know
thanks
y'all have a good day
have a good day cara
cara's new number is
about another hour or so and i am outta here
i am tired
ti
yerd
i ran up and bought the charlotte church cd
listening to it now
it is very nice
i will bring it home with me
i would like to come over and finish that movie tonight for a bit
but i am going home to sleep
that ok
everything is wonderful
just wonderful
there is a suprise on the way for you today from me
craig is so nice
we had a really good weekend
thanks for inviting me to your drunken bash
hi there
what a great e-mail
i got a warm glow and a great laugh all rolled into one
i am keeping that one in my palm pilot so i can read it anywhere i want
i woke up thinking about you
took my bubble bath and looked at my pink toenails thinking about you
put on my lotion thinking about you
drove to work singing along with the radio to steely dan thinking about you
and am just about useless at my desk thinking about you
i really enjoyed just vegging last night
you have a good day too cutie pie
thanks frank

my roses are starting to really open up now
they are so beautiful
i had fun at the party last night
danced my fool head off
good natured fun dancing with the buds from work
one guy tried to dip me and failed miserably
i fell on my right hip
but not before i nearly knocked myself unconcious on part of the wall
i ended up sitting there for a minute with a packet of frozen soybeans on my noggin
i told him no more of that stuff
on the way home from the party i almost just showed up at your house
but figured you needed a break from me for some rest
you have a good day

i have decided to postpone the catchup christmas party and instead have a housewarming party when i move into my new beautiful condo that is right on a wetland/woods
i go to sign papers today
thanks again
good morning
here is the spreadsheet that you sent out with the access for the west power scheduling group
the users are now only me

i have been hearing your name more lately
and just wanted to touch base and tell you how much i miss you
i have been buying that good prosperity wine at trader joe's and always remember the party at your house
do you think that you will be ever coming here to visit
how is your husband
how is your dog-bite scar
do you have any new jewelry
i am trying to sell my wedding ring
and am thinking instead that i will just get another stone to match the center stone and make earrings
if you do come to stay
please stay with me
i am signing papers on my new condo this afteroon it is wonderful
0 bedrooms
backs right up to a greenbelt with a wetland
i miss you
cara poo
good morning honey
i wish that i could have pulled it together enough to get up with you and take care of you this morning
i really missed that
thank you for waking me up and giving me kisses and love
it was a sweet way to start the day
today there is a meeting from ubs
in about 0 minutes
i wonder what will be said
i will let you know everything
on the way to work i was thinking about us planning for our home
i love the sound of our home
i hated seeing all of your stuff packed away today
i like snuggling with your pillows when you have gone to work
soon we will both just be home
hopefully i will be all done with my bullshit in time to meet you at the grotto before going to stanfords
but if not i will meet you there at 0
if i make it to the grotto by 0
will that be enough time for you to pick them up as well
i am calling the doctor when his office opens to complain about the medication
i hope he gives me some more meds
but he might tell me just to hang in there until the new lower level is stabilized
last night was wonderful
each time we are together i find something new to enjoy
i love being with you
holding you and feeling all of your touches and caresses
you make me so happy
and i want to make you happy
i love that little grin on your face and the tenderness in your eyes
you are a wonderful man and i am the luckiest woman in the world to have you in my life
i love you
cara
someone sent this to me
it seemed appropriate
subject
pfthhhhhhhh football an old man and his wife have gone to bed
after laying there a few minutes the old man farts and says
seven points
his wife rolls over and says
what in the world was that
the old man replied
it's fart football
a few minutes later the wife lets one go and says
touchdown
tie score
after about five minutes the old man farts again and says
touchdown
i'm ahead 0 to 0
not to be out done the wife rips another one and says
touchdown
tie score
five seconds go by and she lets out a squeaker and says
field goal
i lead now the pressure's on and the old man refuses to get beat by his wife so he strains real hard but to no avail
realizing a defeat is totally unacceptable
he gives it everything he has
but instead of farting
he poops the bed
the wife looks at him and says
what the hell was that
and the old man replied
half-time
switch sides
uh
not when i came back to bed
the score is now craig 0
cara 0
when you get a moment
k thanks
when you get the chance thanks

hope you get it all built today
love
cf
please drop by when you can
i get into regular enpower but when i try to get into preschedule workspace i get an errr

i am taking off for home now
looking at a little nap action and then if i feel good start packing
i love you and will see you this after noon
don't work my man too hard
but i will rub your feet when you get home if you do
love
cf
good morning honey
i didn't really sleep well last night
so i am tired and cranky today

the feeling of rfp is something to grin about
today i am tying out our february positions with the traders so that they can pre-pay their trades for scheduling feb 0
just spreadsheet and number crunching stuff
you are so important to me
i can't hardly articulate how much you mean to me
i love you and am so proud and happy to be yours
i can't wait till we share a home and i am
out
to my family
i want to tell them
this is done
not
this is what i am going to do
i love waking up in your arms and feeling your kisses first thing in the morning
the sleep thing will work itself out
i am not worried about it
i am looking forward to forever with you
love
cf
i tried to login with the est_csemper id in estate enpower

thanks
hi sweetie
hopefully the visit to the dr won't be that bad
do you want me to come hold your hand
that would be pushing the envelope on intimacy
eh
i saw a wrapper in the trash this morning and was sad to see it there
you need to fix that
or those as it were
please let me know what the dr
says
the movie sounds good
but we will see how tired you are when you get home
i wouldn't mind laying around like a turd this evening either
i need to vacuum but that is all
i love you
and am so glad that i make you happy
i want us to be happy together for many years to come
i still feel like the luckiest woman in the world
to have such a caring and loving man in my life so suddenly
see you tonight
bill and i are considering having real time do the epe preschedules since they are the ones that live and die by them anyway
that way you would be released from that burden and any errors would be all on the ownership of rt
donald will be helping you with that
he has taken over the nw now for feb
thanks
thanks for your addy
it was so good to hear your little voice yesterday
things are sure different here
mark and tom are not staying

i am very sore today
good afternoon
lots of difficulty getting good information today
please call asap if there is a problem cara
we are all relieved to hear that alan
i am glad you have come to the good side of the force
i agree with that when i look at the sheets
um
nobody is trained here
we have had exactly one day's notice to pull this together
we are going to plan on being there for the enron schedulers
until they are ready to fly solo
i have been told today that these folks will have to do all of our scheduling as of monday
they are being trained today but will have to have working logins patterned after donald robinson by the end of business today
serena bishop
i do not know what she has access to
she was the california scheduler
mike purcell
already has access to some things
but please check his access
if this cannot be done
please call murray o'neil asap
his cell is 0-0-0
stuff you may need to know
any oati stuff you can e-mail support@oatiinc.com
good morning
i need new logins created for the following people pw
welcome i need the following logins deleted
lisa gang susie wilson stacy runswick within a couple of weeks

mike purcell will be handling the account and can be reached at mike.purcell@enron.com please call me at 0/0-0 within the hour if there is additional information that you need to set up serena and mike's logins by the end of today
thanks
everything that we use is located in p:/scheduling
you will find old sheets with tags and paths
documents outlining how the system works
how daylight savings time needs to be represented
there is also the intranet site on this there is the oati links
and also the test site for oati 0.0
this will go live in april
and will be totally different than any tagging done before
you will need time to get familiar with the new format and practice
and i will be happy to help guide you when you are ready
all 0 of us are here to help
and will be available to you until you are comfortable
good luck
cara

shelley
my colleague
clayton vernon
who has a background in economics
wrote a short summary of arguments against the rofr
we are working on the second approach to the problem
we try to come up with a numerical estimate of the value of this option
the fact that an incumbent shipper has this option has distributional consequences
he has something of value he never paid for
having a numerical estimate of the value of this option could help to argue against it
the value of such an option is case specific
so we shall rather produce a template you can use for valuation case by case

i was under the impression i sent you a message regarding brad romine but i cannot find a copy in my msg folder
there might have been a glitch in the and the message did not go through and wasn't stored
i wanted to make the following points
0
brad will not show up on march 0
he is still working on his dot-com business and wants to pursue this opportunity
0
my recommendation is that we should draw a line in the sand
either brad or a stipend refund check should show up on march 0
0
i told brad that a failure to show up on march 0 will not imperil his future employment opportunities with enron
we just need clarity and ability to plan our human resource needs
if he decides to re-apply at some point in the future
we shall not hold his decision to pursue him entrepreneurial plans against him

i can pick up the cost of your trip from the research group budget

vince

i am ready to cover the cost of steve's trip to houston
one month in the summer
i think very highly of steve and think about coaching him a bit to expand his horizons
i see him as a very valuable asset of enron and a great leader in not too distant future
he needs exposure to more diverse business problems and areas of research
i think it will be in the best interest of the company to devote some resources to foster his development

this is the update on what i have done for the lng transactions
0
i was not involved in the lng ship project
i shall read the dash and give you my comments
without looking at the details
i think that the decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the elba island project
please
see point 0
0
elba island
i am working with doug rotenberbg
brad hitch
scott earnest
sally beck's organization
and rac to set up the book for the elba island transaction
the next step will be to expand the book to capture all the enron's lng-related positions in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges
a working group is meeting to close a few remaining gaps tomorrow
tuesday
at 0:0
a few comments on the book design and my view of the project
a
the current thinking is that lng will be sourced for the elba island facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis
marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions
the fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the long-term contract prices
the economics of the deal
as represented by the book we are setting up
will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis
arranging shipping and coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the us
in other words
we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction
b
the transaction will cover the period of 0 years
with an extension option of 0 years
even if we can lock-in the lng volumes over this time period
we have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread
us gas prices
for such a long tenor
this is essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the lng
nat gas spread and i would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread
one solution would be to cover
let's say
0% of he lng volumes for the first 0 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the us market side
c
the book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of lng
shipping rates
schedules
etc
i would set up a big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market
d
my group will work on valuation of some options we have in the elba island deal
that are good for enron
and on the hedging strategy for the lng positions
long-term lng contracts are typically based on the japanese crude cocktail that correlates very well with brent
vince

reviewed by mark williams
svp risk management
citizens power the long awaited second edition of managing energy price risk has finally arrived
it has been four years since the first edition was published
during this hiatus
a lot has happened as risk management within the rapidly expanding energy industry has come of age as a respected discipline
the second edition is a rich compilation of papers by a surprisingly representative group of industry leaders
practitioners and academics
the books strength is that it reinforces the fact that risk management principles initially applied to a narrow band of energy commodities can and should be applied across a wide array of energy commodities including electricity
as expected the book does a solid job in capturing an international perspective on the various challenges
which are not isolated to any one continent but are global in scope
it includes a lengthy introduction that effectively frames risk management progress
advancements and innovations that started in the oil markets in the 0's and migrated to the natural gas and most recently expanding to the electricity industry
managing energy price risk is comprised of 0 chapters
all of which include an introduction
which minimises the disjointedness that you may expect from a book written by a large number of authors
other improvements in this second edition include expanded graphics
highlighted panels
detailed appendices and a separate glossary
which provides the reader with additional reference material
in particular the chapter on energy options written by michael hampton is a useful primer and provides the reader with a concise explanation of option theory
pricing
basis risk
delta hedging as well as practical guidelines for distinguishing between hedging and pure speculation
for the more advanced reader
the chapter on energy exotic options
written by vince particularly strong as it outlines the challenges associated with the exotics and effectively documents the latest methods used by leading practitioners in pricing such instruments
additionally
the chapter on accounting for derivative contracts in the energy environment by three consultants from arthur anderson
is a well written summary which addresses the numerous tax related issues including a timely discussion on the us financial accounting standards board's statement 0
see eprm october 0
page 0
having this tax information housed in one concise chapter is of great value
the second edition however is not without flaws
in particular
it would have been useful to have more information on the current challenges risk managers are confronted with in the power industry including latest advancements in volatility and correlation estimation techniques
additional attention could have also been placed on the shortcomings of the current market structure and methods in finding and applying appropriate hedging strategies and instruments
in the fledgling power market
this continues to be one of the primary challenges
in summary
this second edition of managing energy price risk builds upon the sentinel work laid out in the prior edition and is a valuable reference book for the new recruit or seasoned veteran
it is a welcome edition to any risk management library

the journal of risk is a more technical and serious publication than risk magazine
if the article is published it will give you more exposure in the academic circles
i think it will be a significant accomplishment
on the downside
it does not receive the same wide circulation as risk among the practitioners
i can also see the reason behind the recommendation given by navroz
the article is fairly long for risk

jeff
i would like to get on your calendar
together with jeff shankman
for 0
0 minutes to discuss the results of my visit at the wharton school with tom piazze
a separate message about this visit will follow
i would like also to talk to you about the way we manage our relationships with different universities
historically
we were rather passive customers of the academic institutions
trying to hire the best students and limiting our presence on the campuses mostly to the recruiting trips and campus receptions
we should rethink the way we work with universities
the efforts to get the best students look more and more like a hand-to-hand combat and often we are not very successful
it is critical that we increase our presence on the campuses and this can be accomplished in a number of different ways
0
involvement in research projects
for example
we are currently underwriting two research projects at stanford university
involving ph.d
students of professor nicholas bambos
a top expert on communications networks
we shall participate in formulation of the projects
objectives and will be given access to the results
involvement in research projects allows us to obtain access to current scientific developments in the leading universities and also to lock-up some very promising students
most companies in the high tech industries have such programs
0
lectures and presentations by enron employees
practically every presentation i have made so far at different universities resulted in a number of resumes and hiring decisions
it is important that students get exposed to enron early in their academic program
in many cases
the best students have already made up their mind by the time we approach them during their senior years
0
visits by faculty members in enron
closer cooperation with the universities has many advantages in addition to getting the best students and obtaining access to current research
the universities are very important in shaping public opinion on the issues critical to enron's future
especially in the area of deregulation and design of new markets
currently
the relationships with many leading academic centers depend on personal commitment of a number of overworked enron employees
in many cases
there is no continuity and focus
i want to recommend a creation of a special function
vp or md level
responsible for coordinating our relationships with the universities
this function would be separate from our analyst/associate program
i have many ideas how this function could be structured

an interesting piece of information from the oil markets
iraq is trying to extract concessions from the us and threatens to shut down production as of oct 0
just in time for the us elections
the source of this info is phil verlaeger
an oil analyst
he is very good but excessively concerned with iraqi machinations
he is the source of news
reported by friedman of the new york times in his op-ed columns
about massive iraqi trading in the oil futures markets
i personally discount this info
the volume and transparency of the oil markets would not support this type of huge scale operations by saddam's government
there may be some trading by iraqi officials on the side

i think the crucial distinction is between recognition of risks and elimination of risks through hedges
as correctly pointed out in other messages
being aware of risk does not mean that one does not want to be compensated for it
now a few more detailed comments
0
i think that illiquidity discount represents double counting when combined with a project finance discount rate
illiquidity discount
in my view
should be applied to financial options that trade in a market without sufficient depth
one should apply a haircut if liquidating a position takes a long time
the approach used in valuation of the turkish transaction is the same as approach used in valuation of investments in physical assets
which are by definition illiquid
this illiquidity is recognized through other aspects of valuation technology used in raroc
if we apply an illiquidity correction in this case
we should be consistent and use this approach across the board for all project finance type cases
not that i recommend this course of action
0
valuation of an unheadgable options
let's look at it from the position of a seller of the option
he cannot hedge a short call or put and black-scholes valuation becomes the floor for the valuation
the seller has to be compensated for taking a price risk
as opposed to taking a vol risk when he hedges
the issue of the compensation he will require becomes fuzzy
the option really becomes an insurance type product and pricing depends on two factors
0
risk preference 0
existing portfolio positions risk preference
insurance companies typically require a payment that consists of two parts
expected loss + unexpected loss
the latter is typically defined as 0 to 0 standard deviations
the number of standard deviations depends on risk appetite and the ability to absorb the loss
i admit that it is a bit fuzzy
but this is the way the world works
we looked into insurance pricing at the request of jere overdyke
you can talk to vasant shanbhogue to find out more about it
existing portfolio positions
an additional contract may increase or decrease the risk of the overall portfolio
i would expect the deal to provide some risk diversification
but it does not look to me as a deal that reduces risk
given all our positions in this region
what are the practical implications
pricing depends on risk appetite
the utility function of a decision maker in technical jargon
and becomes to some degree arbitrary
if we are short an option embedded in a deal and the option cannot be hedged
we should subtract from the value of the contract the value of the option
that is greater than the black
scholes value
if we don't price this option explicitly
the valuation of a contract will be based on a discount rate with a risk premium
in the case of an option buyer
the situation is reversed
if he cannot hedge
he should recognize the risk of losing the value of his investment and apply a discount to the value of the option
how big is the discount
see the comments above
in the special case
where hedging is possible and the black-scholes-merton paradigm applies
both values will become equal
ignoring transaction costs
the values of an option form the point of view of a seller and a buyer will converge
0
what happens in case we use simulation technology
we can discount at the risk free rate along each scenario
each scenario will recognize the downside and/or upside at different points in time in different states of the world
if we run a sufficient number of scenarios
we shall get a distribution of npv as of today
knowing this distribution means that we can estimate risk
but in most cases we are still holding it
the expected value should be
therefore
adjusted for risk
this is equivalent to using a discount rate with a risk premium
i hope this helps
please
call me with additional questions
sorry for a delay in responding to this question
i ran my response by stinson and vasant
to make sure we all agree
it's a very complicated technical problem and the financial theory does not have good answers

sap
as i have pointed out
short-selling the stock may be a bad decision because of tax implications
ignoring the legal aspects
suppose the strike is $0 and you were granted an atm option
you sell short at $0 ten lots
one lot = 0 shares
the price goes to you lose $0 x 0 = $0,0 on your short position
option exercise gives you $0,0
this is before taxes
you pay taxes on your option income
it's treated as ordinary income
the tax is 0% x $0,0 = $0,0
you can use only $0,0 of your loss against ordinary income
this saves you only $0 in taxes
of course
if you have capital gains
you can use losses on your option position as an offset
the remaining part of your capital loss is carried forward and you get the tax benefits over time
less the time value of money
assuming you have income in the future
or capital gains
not so good
by the way
valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options is a very interesting and difficult problem

my recommendation is to make steve the head of the research unit in london
we were talking originally about september but i think we should accelerate this process
of course
anjam will be very unhappy about it
but we cannot manage around him any longer
i think that the promotion should be combined with a salary increase
i would like to offer him a significant increase that goes with expanded responsibilities and much higher visibility
a salary increase will also bring him closer to the market
we see the market for technical people going through the roof in practically every location where we operate
a contract is not a good solution in my view
it creates a sense of false security for both an employee and the company
i shall send a message to john sherriff with my recommendation
i shall cc you

a book by martha amram and nalin kulatilaka is an excellent non-technical introduction to real options and it contains all the most important references to more advanced books and papers
the book has an endorsement by jeff skilling on the cover page
the research group offered several one-day seminars on real options and applications to the energy industry
we still have a few binders with the presentation materials available if you are interested
we plan to repeat the seminar sometimes in the fall
the first part of the seminar
about 0 hours in the morning
covers general concept of real options and their applicability to the energy business
the second
more technical afternoon session
covers stochastic processes used to model price uncertainty in the energy markets and specific case studies
valuation of natural gas storage facilities and of peaking gas-fired power plants
the real options approach has been developed specifically to address the problem of making investment decisions under uncertainty
nobody in this field claims that this is a perfect tool
but it represents a significant progress compared to other techniques developed earlier
discounted cash flow analysis that tries to incorporate uncertainty through analysis of several
in most cases
arbitrary scenarios
most likely
optimistic
pessimistic
these scenarios don't identify explicitly the risk drivers and don't specify the future proactive management decisions
the real
option approach is very powerful because it allows to
0
capture uncertainty in an explicit way and
0
to design investment projects that allow to exploit future positive developments and reduce future exposures to downside risk
this approach allows also create a link between investment decisions and future operational decisions
forward-looking investment decisions create options that are exercised in the future through active management of a project
the real options technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tools to come up with the representation of future possible states of the world
the real challenge is to use these tools in a sensible way
i have seen in my career
almost 0 years of applying mathematical tools to business and economic problems
many quants armed with powerful computers who reminded me of monkeys armed with hammers
the challenge is not to run mechanically thousands of simulations based on arbitrary assumptions but to translate in a creative way the insights of people who understand specific businesses into parsimonious quantitative models
it is especially critical to stress-test the assumptions of any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends critically on any set of assumptions
if this is the case one should use common sense to examine the underlying assumptions
i remember that in the early eighties quite a few models simulated the dynamics of oil prices
but all the stochastic scenarios represented fluctuations around a very optimistic upward trend
one would have been better off stepping back and asking a simple question what economics 0 teaches about cartels and the dynamics of supply and demand

we have the first running version of var model for the mg positions
many thanks to tanya and anjam for taking lead in this effort
we had also great help from cantekin and kirstee
we want to validate some inputs before releasing the number
specifically
i want to make sure that both london and houston work with the same position numbers every day to avoid confusion
a few comments
0
we plan to set up the models to run var concurrently in houston
cantekin
and london
kirstee
with the same inputs
the reason to do it this way is that we may have to respond quickly to multiple inquiries in both locations
cantekin and kirstee
please stay in touch and synchronize the inputs
0
it is critical that we run the model daily and receive the updated positions and prices on a regular basis
0
we shall continue work in houston to improve the model
two critical areas
a
var model
by its nature
does not capture one big risk mg has in its portfolios
this is the liquidity risk resulting from different cash consequences of the hedges and the underlying positions
b
we should go through due diligence to validate the process generating the position numbers
i.e
look into the details of specific transactions
from what i know
mg has a fairly rudimentary risk management system and i am not quite sure how they generate option prices
and deltas
they get some option prices by calling brokers
0
i think the current var is within 0-0% of the true number
assuming the inputs are right
but
as i have said
var does not capture all the risks that we have to worry about
vince
osman
yes
but a visa may be a problem
vince
can you figure out the reason for cocoa beans var fluctuations
the same is true of aluminum
i assume this is the position change

i am writing to you regarding the management of the london research group
as you know
dale surbey
who was managing the london unit of the research group
is moving to ebs
dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of talent we have currently in london
given that dale is likely to be transfered to houston
it's time to nominate one member of the research group for a management position
my recommendation is steve leppard
steve emerged not only as the most technically qualified member of the group but also as a natural leader
highly respected by his peers and internal customers
steve has a very high energy level and is very efficient as a manager and as coach of new talent
his promotion is likely to cause anjam's departure form enron
i value technical skills of anjam
but in spite of my loyalty to him
don't think he is the same caliber as steve
however
i would not like to lose him and think about moving him to houston for 0 years
i think that the opportunity to work in houston
would be a sufficient incentive to keep him in enron
by the way
his performance feedback has greatly improved
please
let me know what you think
vince
we can offer him a job
the problem is
he has about 0 more years to go
vince

vince
mark
steve's comment has many merits
i think stinson gibner and grant masson
physics ph.d.'s
can help to identify academic and industry sources to validate some of the claims
on the other hand
even if our guests were wrong by a factor of 0 or 0 in their time estimates
the technology they develop will bring about a technological revolution with enormous potential payoffs
it make sense to stay close to them and to explore potential investment opportunities
vince
we would like you to meet tomorrow morning
starting at 0:0
with a few members of the group
around 0:0 we shall go to lunch
myself
stinson gibner and zimin at 0:0 we would like you to make a presentation to the research group on the topic of your choice
after 0:0 we shall continue with individual meetings

vasant and i talked to clayton about his request for transfer
clayton received a conditional approval contingent upon completion of the current project he works on
vasant will formulate exact definition of the deliverables and we will hold clayton to it
if he fails to deliver the request for transfer will be rejected
anything else would be highly demoralizing to everybody
clayton has so far produced exactly zero
no single output was delivered
though he was advertising the projects inside and outside the group as completed
i want you to be aware of it
because i have serious doubts regarding clayton's integrity

the partnership functions through involvement in different research projects
i have identified a few projects that will maximize the benefit to enron

research and corporate engagement related to e-commerce
main benefits
access to e-commerce research and enhanced recruitment opportunities

i shall call you tomorrow about it
my preference is to move anjam to houston for some time

i have discussed this issue with dale and richard and they concurred
i don't expect anjam to act irrationally but it's better to be safe than sorry

i don't know the labor market in london that well but here the market for quants is very hot
steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person and i would go an extra mile to retain him long-term for the company
i would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit
o0,0 basic is what anjam is receiving currently
if i remember correctly
steve has a much higher value to enron than anjam
vince
ashley
i agree with you
two trips are the best solution
unless of course shmuel rearranges the speaker list and the 0th will work for the presentation as well
coordinating so many different events is never easy

this is very well written and will serve the reader well
a few comments
0
when i think about the taxonomy of the var models
i typically use the classification based on 0 categories
a
variance/covariance method b
historical simulation c
monte carlo simulation
delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear instrument
0
i would define monte carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation of behavior of all the market prices/rates
etc
and revaluation of the entire portfolio
the revaluation may be based on an approximation
using taylor's expansion
that may involve delta
delta/gamma
delta/gamma/omega or may be exact
based on the same model that produces the mark-to-market portfolio valuations
the main benefit of using the mc simulation in the energy markets is the ability to capture the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way
i would emphasize that there are attempts to incorporate jumps in the v/c model
i shall send you the references from home
0
i would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets that are evolving quickly
new instruments for which we have no comparable prices
behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de-mature
0
for bigger portfolios
virtually all methods require some level of aggregation into atomic
elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem
this process may be a source of a big error
0
the computational burden of mc can be reduced through clever preprocessing of a portfolio that introduces no error
many swaps with the same underlying can be aggregated into one positions
they are portfolios of forwards and they are linear instruments

feel free to use any comment

abstract
the power market developments in the us have created several unique challenges for energy industry economists

i was approached by john martin
a professor of finance at baylor
to write jointly an academic paper on enron for a financial journal
he wanted to work on an article on ebs
i have suggested a different topic
enron
case study of a company reinventing itself
i made a few points to john
a
enron's evolution did not just happen by accident
it was a result of implementation of a far-reaching strategy developed by the management
b
in the process of its evolution enron changed its environment
i came up with a term
proactive evolution
as opposed to
reactive evolution
c
the strategy included many elements
including emphasis on the quality of human resources
changing corporate attitudes to risk taking and employee empowerment
d
there are very few companies that match enron's experience and the paper could become a standard reading at the mba courses on corporate strategy and would help greatly our recruiting efforts
writing the paper would require interviews with ken
jeff and a few other key players
let me know what you thing about it
john is really excited about this paper
vince
yes
we are ready
i shall be accompanied by one person from our analyst/associate program and i would like to ask you if she can be invited to dinner as well
we plan to come thursday night and leave on sat morning to avoid potential flight delay risk

a clarification
we had an agreement with chris and les to contribute aus as a part of the cost
vince
who coukd help with curve extraction
vince
john
i talked to dale nesbitt
he suggested that the best way to evaluate his model is to go through a one week intensive project with assistance of somebody from his company
our cost is a flat fee of $0,0 that would be deducted from the purchase price of $0,0
in case we buy the software package
the price of 0k is indicative and will be adjusted based on the required level of support
dale will be in houston next week
i have tentatively invited him to visit with us on tuesday

poetry analysis
discussion tulips the tulips are too excitable
it is winter here
look how white everything is
how quiet
how snowed-in
i am learning peacefulness
lying by myself quietly as the light lies on these white walls
this bed
these hands
i am nobody
i have nothing to do with explosions
i have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses and my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons
they have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff like an eye between two white lids that will not shut
stupid pupil
it has to take everything in
the nurses pass and pass
they are no trouble
they pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps
doing things with their hands
one just the same as another
so it is impossible to tell how many there are
my body is a pebble to them
they tend it as water tends to the pebbles it must run over
smoothing them gently
they bring me numbness in their bright needles
they bring me sleep now i have lost myself i am sick of baggage my patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox
my husband and child smiling out of the family photo
their smiles catch onto my skin
little smiling hooks
i have let things slip
a thirty-year~old cargo boat stubbornly hanging on to my name and address
they have swabbed me clear of my loving associations
scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley i watched my teaset
my bureaus of linen
my books sink out of sight
and the water went over my head
i am a nun now
i have never been so pure
i didn't want any flowers
i only wanted to lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty
how free it is
you have no idea how free
the peacefulness is so big it dazes you
and it asks nothing
a name tag
a few trinkets
it is what the dead close on
finally
i imagine them shutting their mouths on it
like a communion tablet
the tulips are too red in the first place
they hurt me
even through the gift paper i could hear them breathe lightly
through their white swaddlings
like an awful baby
their redness talks to my wound
it corresponds
they are subtle
they seem to float
though they weigh me down upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color
a dozen red lead sinkers round my neck
nobody watched me before
now i am watched
the tulips turn to me
and the window behind me where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins
and i see myself
flat
ridiculous
a cut-paper shadow between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips
and i have no face
i have wanted to efface myself the vivid tulips eat my oxygen
before they came the air was calm enough
coming and going
breath by breath
without any fuss
then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise
now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine
they concentrate my attention
that was happy playing and resting without committing itself
the walls
also
seem to be warming themselves
the tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals
they are opening like the mouth of some great african cat
and i am aware of my heart
it opens and closes its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me
the water i taste is warm and salt
like the sea
and comes from a country far away as health
look forward to meeting you in houston
what about wednesday

i have a number of case studies on enron but not the one on sutton bridge
i know that peter tufano was working on it but when i checked the hbs site and tried to purchase it
i could not locate it
when i talked to peter a few months ago
he told me that the case study was ready and he was going through enron's internal approvals
i cc mark palmer on it
maybe he knows about this specific case study
i wander if it was completed
given sutton bridge developments
vince
mark
it was done in collaboration with john sherriff
vince
rick and ted
it looks more like foxes building chicken houses as opposed to foxes guarding chicken houses
i shall send a message to bryan saying that the research has to look under the hood and examine the mechanics of the model in order to sign off on it
a dog and pony show is not sufficient
in any case
the decision to approve the model should not be left to ben and kirstee
please
let me know what your thinking is
vince
location 0-0 pin 0
bryan
we shall be glad to take a look at the system
to sign
off on the vendor provided system we have to look under the hood and review the algorithms
i hope the vendor will have no objections to it
another critical issue we have to solve on a short notice is to integrate the system you want to buy with the rest of var/credit systems
we shall stand by to help in this endeavor
an alternative approach is to evaluate to what extent your positions can be rolled into the existing risk systems

naveen
just a thought
changes in the portfolio values may combine both the changes of prices and positions
this happens if one tracks changes in the value of our historical gas portfolio
a big jump in the volumetric position from day to day
combined with a moderate price movement may produce an observation that looks artificially big
if the volumetric position was frozen
it's just a scaling factor and there should be no discrepancy between your numbers
of course
the correct approach is to separate the price process from the position changes
vince

he wants to come back after 0 months
my recommendation is to take him back
he left on good terms and is quite competent
i would also like to send a message to the group that the grass on the other side of the fence may look greener
but in reality it may be painted hay
the return of grant masson
would demonstrate that enron offers best long-term growth opportunities
and that i am good manager
grant would come back to his original vp position
can we short-circuit the hiring procedures for a vp
grant's body is still warm and we can just him in the original position instead of going through all the loops required to hire a vp

i am forwarding you a message i received a few days ago
i want to ask you for advice how to handle this case
my first reaction was to ignore it
the longer i think about it
the more convinced i become that some action is required
let's try to reverse the situation and assume for the sake of argument that a female employee was harassed by a male colleague
an employee informs her boss a few months later about the alleged incident and the boss chooses to ignore it
in many similar cases
courts subsequently found against the companies that decided to turn a blind eye to such complaints
the fact that we are dealing with the case of reverse harassment is immaterial
if i ignore this complaint i may expose the company to charges of double standard in handling sexual harassment cases
my recommendation would be to ask maureen to attend sensitivity training and sexual harassment prevention class
please
let me know what you think
sorry to burden you with this case

i don't think that the additional seminars will crowd out the brown bag lunches
the seminars are really targeted to people who recently joined the group and have very limited

brown bag lunches are not that time intensive

this was perfectly all right
as a matter of fact i expect and encourage the members of the group to disagree with me
or anybody else
on any subject
i am never offended by it and take it as a manifestation of ability to think independently and having the courage of one
s convictions
nobody has the monopoly on truth and nobody knows everything
the only way we can learn and avoid costly errors
to ourselves and the company
is by having open communication
in enron
facts are friendly

we have a few reservations about some features of the model but would like to discuss it internally and make the improvements without giving the benefit of our insights to the consultant

thanks a lot
i think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no bugs in translation of a business problem
for example
complicated credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality
into the code
regarding tanya's attitude
just a few points
0
i don't think she has the skills to do the system administrator's work and she does not have the necessary privileges
this explains why she keeps asking winston for help
it's not that the work is beneath her
0
some members of tanya's team came to me complaining about winston
he effectively told them to go away and work on the
research projects
and that he would take care of the it issues
i don't think that it's just tanya's issue
though i agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful
0
the reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat on tanya and me whenever there is any performance problems and/or they intuitively disagree with the results of a run
they could not care less about the demarcation line between it and research
they also want tanya to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code
the bottom line is that we are in full agreement
tanya and winston have to work as a team and i shall work on my end to make sure that it happens
credit is emerging as a critical issue for enron for the next few weeks and the system cannot fail
vince
pavel
we shall talk to him
he looks like a very qualified candidate
vince
shirley
please
set up a phone interview with him
i think both zimin and stinson should talk to him

it seems that his transfer is not an issue for the time being
we can put it on a back-burner till he gets here
vince p.s
the relevant section
i also spoke about anshuman
and there was resistance to his leaing for such a long time
however
i have agreement from folks here to send him to houston for a shorter stint on dpc budget
i will try to finalize that before i leave
i will call you in the evening to just chat
molly
let's get l0 for anshuman
just in case
i am sure he will stay here for a while once he comes
it is quite obvious jeff shankman will have to keep him longer
given the priority of the project
i assume there are no problems with sandeep
thanks
vince enron north america corp
molly
i shall ask sandeep to do it when he comes back from india next week
i have just learned that anshuman has b0 visa and he can start on a project as a person delegated by dhabol power company to houston

it seems that there is a bug in the system
i made an error mixing equity and merit raises in one column
the system does not allow me to correct the mistake by moving the entries from one column to another
i can enter the changes
but after i save them the system reverts to original designations
as a result
the columns contain mixed entries related to merit and equity raises
the column totals are misleading
i am taking a csv version home to continue making adjustments

steve
please
let me know when you come back
i have detected a tendency to implement different approaches to valuation in the past
to some extent
it reflects the absence of formal rules for sign-off on the valuation techniques which
in turn
reflects
the turf wars and the desire by the originators to control the outcomes

this is an update on the continuing winston saga
tanya identified the sections of the code that produce inefficiencies but the rest is in the winston's hands
steve stock is very cooperative and takes a very rational
enron-first approach to the problem
privately
my concern is that the code
based on tanya's report to me
leaves a lot to be desired
the code tends to be a very mechanical implementation of the algorithm
developed without a series attempt to optimize it
let's keep paddling along
vince
steve
i was delayed on my wait out
i probably hit the stop at let me buy you a coffee this afternoon
what about 0:0
vince
steve
sign-off from the research group is something that requires defining formal rules going forward
my concern over the last few years was that we were asked on many occasions to sign
off on partial results of valuation
without the benefits of a full picture
sometimes
we were asked to sign-off on trade ideas
over which we have no control long-term
i shall talk to rick buy and david port about setting up more formal rules for the research sign-off

i would like to apologize for the confusion regarding anshuman
we have floated a number of possible scenarios regarding his trip to houston and there was a lot of confusion regarding the terms
given that i was talking to sandeep every few days
currently
we expect anshuman to come to houston for one month to work on the dpc project
at jeff shankman's request
the lawyers advised me that we need an l0 visa for him
irrespective of the duration of his stay

i called vlady gorny and explained that the presentation by jorion is not offered under the umbrella of the seminar sponsored by enron and that it is a closed meeting for the school faculty
i don't think that enron would open its job interviews to rice observers who expressed interest and i made this comment to vlady
he is ok with this
you can let his program director know that i have explained to vlady that it is a meeting for limited audience and that he does not expect to be invited

some minor differences between the draft and the final executed version
i have forgotten to bring the draft today
i shall send a copy to you tomorrow
there were some hand-written changes made by greg ijn the draft that were not transferred to the final version
vince
i have looked at the outline of the proposed course and find that practically all the topics of the program are the staple of what we do every day
i don't think research should spend money for this class
if we want to establish a relationship
we can easily do it by asking him to work on a research project
vince
should we make arrangements for lunch
what about inviting brad romine
he was instrumental in forming this relationship
vince shirley
please include on my calendar

i share some of your concerns regarding mr
sud
he is retired and he chose to contact us rather indirectly
or on the spur of the moment
i understand that things are done differently in different cultures but i did not meet him and could not form my judgment based on personal observations
however
the information he gave us seems to be too important not to convey to you and not to act upon
vince kaminski

i fully support sandeep's request to move anshuman srivastav to houston
i anticipate that we shall be working on dhabol related issues for the next two years until all the business problems are successfully resolved
anshuman is a very capable employee
with the right combination of skills to attack the dhabol modeling challenge
he understands the indian markets as well as international fuel markets
he has also a very good grasp of power industry fundamentals and of the technology used at the dhabol power plant
vince
norma
i would like to proceed on two fronts with sevile
both h0 visa and the green card
i shall rather work hard to keep my employees happy here than try to attach them to the job through immigration arrangements
they can see through such arrangements and it de-motivates them

two things i did not manage to mention to you at the meeting on monday
0
joe carson
i was very positively impressed by joe carson
enron badly needs a senior economist of his stature and experience
he has many contacts in the industry and can represent enron well
he is very pragmatic and
also
i expect a cool head on old shoulders
one negative is that he wants to work out of new york
the tradeoff is between maintaining his contacts and working closer with the desks
0
tony mends
i think you
or louise
should explore the possibility of using the skills of tony mends
tony and i are good friends so i may be biased
i think that he is a very smart and efficient person and can contribute a lot to the organization that relies on processing huge volumes of information

e hired tony to support global markets but jeff shankman decided that
given highly specialized nature of his work it makes sense to put him in the research group
with a dotted line to mike roberts who is running our weather group
given that his work will directly and exclusively benefit gm
it makes sense for research to charge his expenses to global markets
we can adjust allocations to reflect his contributions to different sub-units of gm
tony spent the last few weeks in houston training for his position in london with mike roberts
we are very excited about the prospect of working with him
vince

during today's var coordination meeting we had a discussion of issues related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations
mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system
we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds of available cpu memory
also
in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor and it's difficult to model the price curves independently
we solve the problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves
we have agreed on the following
0
winston will investigate the it side and determine to what extent we can increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic
core
curves
he will investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the var run
0
the curves associated with the biggest 0-0 positions in each commodity should be modeled as core curves
i.e
no mapping into other locations
it makes sense to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less transparent aggregates
0
the results of an automated clustering
mapping
procedures should be systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions
this responsibility should be vested with one person
right now the responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody is responsible
research can allocate one person to this task
cooperation of trading and rac will be critical

charm looks more like a prototype that requires a lot of work to make it more a production tool
we have developed a similar model
without some nice functionalities charm has
in about two weeks
at request of rick jones who joined ees from hsb
rick worked on a similar model at his old company and wanted to have a similar tool for his projects with enron
i can tell you more about it when we meet
hopefully
later this week
i would tell willis that the model requires more work before enron can consider it as commercial product

vasant is swamped with work coordinating several high profile projects
bob is very productive and thorough and will get a lot of support internally from other members of the group
this contribution may not be directly visible but it will be still very important

vince
let's chat about it
vince
fyi vince
anita ok vince
molly fyi vince
shirley
did we renew it
vince
steve
i submitted my evaluation
general impression was rather negative
he seems to be a consultant type person who speaks about everything with confidence but is short on depth and technical details
he is personable
outspoken
organized
on the positive side
also
the red flag is that he jumps from job to job
typical after 0-0 months when any organization can ascertain his usefulness
vince
fyi vince
let's chat about it

please send my bio to layla
anne
thanks for contacting me about this
as a matter of fact
i wanted to talk to you about it today as this matter was outstanding for a long time
i think we should go ahead and adjust gwen to manager
effective march 0
the compensation would be her current base plus 0k
this is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a manager
such promotions take place in march and i think gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management
i.e
my and maureen's procrastination
on unrelated and more serious matter
gary hickerson is the primary client for maureen's services
he communicated to me a few weeks ago that he is unwilling to underwrite maureen's position
he is in general unhappy with her contribution
this means that maureen will have to find another sponsor or leave enron
given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal customer will be quite a challenge
gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to maureen from his budget
i would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes

the info is attached below
shirley will call you in the morning
vince s&p credit indices s&p credit indices reflect daily movements in credit spread levels within two sectors of the u.s
bond market
s&p credit indices are quoted in basis points over the u.s
treasury yield curve once daily
credit spread movements within the investment grade spectrum are represented in the s&p u.s
industrial investment grade credit index while movements within the speculative grade rating spectrum are captured in the s&p u.s
industrial speculative grade credit index
each credit index represents the distribution of u.s
corporate issues across different rating categories and subsectors
re-balancing occurs regularly to ensure that the indices are composed of relevant issues with sufficient liquidity
pricing information for the s&p credit indices
underlying securities is derived from a number of sources
option adjusted spreads
oas
are used as a proxy for nominal credit spreads in order to adjust for the presence of embedded options
standard
poor's utilizes the proprietary option adjusted spread model developed by andrew kalotay associates

i am writing to ask you to help my associate
krishnarao pinnamaneni
who faces a very difficult personal situation
you probably remember krishna from his visits to our bombay office when he was helping you on a few projects
a brief outline of the facts
0
his wife is pregnant
she gave birth to their daughter
pallavi
a few years ago after a very complicated pregnancy
pallavi was a premature child and her survival was a miracle
we all thank the almighty for this wonderful child
current pregnancy is also very complicated
0
krishna invited his in-laws to visit and stay with them to care for his wife
the application for a tourist visa was denied and the reason given for the denial was that they had overstayed the term of the visa during the previous visit
the irony is that they complied with the us laws
they had asked for an extension of the visa and the extension was granted
the company can
of course
intervene on krishna's behalf
krishna made an outstanding contribution to enron
he is currently a vp
and to the american society
i am sure that ken lay would have no objections to write a letter on his behalf to the state department
i would prefer
however
to try informal channels first to avoid confrontational approach
it may be better for all the involved in the long-run
i hope you can use your personal contacts to intervene on krishna's behalf and ask for a reversal of the decision on humanitarian grounds
i shall fax to you a copy of the decision
thanks

we called tom limpers and talked about the services his company can offer to enron
it seems that they don't have any great product sitting on the shelf
it's rather a group of university professors who are ready to offer their brain power to solve different problems of interest to potential customers
we talked about different potential projects and suggested in what ways they could demonstrate their problem solving skills before we go into more detailed discussions
they promised to get back to us in a few days

another indication of tensions in ec
vince
a few comments on the state of our var models
the issues always become more controversial during the periods when vols and positions increase and i would like to share with you a few observations
0
critical importance of a good risk management system to enron
and the p/e ratio
a number of recent analysts
reports characterized enron as a hedge fund engaged in massive directional trading and representing huge risks to investors
one way to counter this crirticism is to emphasize the quality of enron's risk amnageemnt system and our strong risk amangeemnt culture
our claims regarding the strong risk management technology and culture should be
however
supported by reality
it is critical that we continue to improve our risk management systems and also can convince the external parties
stock analysts
creditors
credit rating agencies
about the quality of our financial technology
this can be done through targeted disclosure of the elements of our technology
as we have done frequently in the past
by reality
0
inputs from the trading desks vs
historical calibration
the var system used in enron is based on the assumption that as much input information as possible should come from the market
i.e
trading desks
or should be calibrated to the market observations
as opposed to historical data
one immediate improvement
we should review inputs that are not based on the trading desks information and move
if possible
to replace them with market based
forward looking data
one should not assume
of course
that the information coming from the trading desks is perfect
one problem that is persistent in some portfolios is the disconnect between the posted forward vols curves and subsequent fluctuations in the forward prices curves
the forward vols curves should be relatively unbiased expectations of future realized forward price volati
oty
if this is not the case
back testing for some portfolios will systematically fail
one way to address the problem is to implement a module that compares systematically fwd vols posted by the trading desks with subsequent price movements
it will allow us to identify the source of problems we see in some books
0
var process management
given the size of our trading operation
we are running a var factory
a system designed to produce timely risk assessment for all the portfolios
what is missing is the industrial type process that guarantees the quality of the results
specifically
i am concerned about absence of one person vested with the responsibility for the model calibration
right now this responsibility is dispersed in the organization and resides somewhere between the it
rac and research
as a result we have inputs updated inconsistently and without proper quality controls
some inputs used currently in the system are 0 years old
another aspect of this problem is prioritization of different projects
in my view some recent modification to the system tied up it resources and were of marginal usefulness
and in some case on questionable understanding of mathematics
of course
i can be wrong but there is was no systematic process to bring these issues to the table
in a meeting involving all the concerned parties and

data from larry thorne
vince
ron
rakesh mentioned that there is an additional conditionality that will result in an adjustment of our valuation of the restrictions imposed on the forwards going into the raptor vehicles
we were not aware of this conditionality at the time the project
we can
however
easily
incorporate it in our valuation model
this omission makes our valuation more conservative form the enron's point of view
please
let us know if this is required
vince
shirley
please
ask her to e-mail this to both you and me
vince
mark
thanks
i can always depend on a prompt response from you
vince
mike
please
take a look vince
gary
he looks like a well qualified candidate but we receive hundreds of such resumes
the way to distinguish between different candidates is to ask the question
did an individual make an effort and invested his time to learn things directly useful to enron
given our work load
i would not accept a person who has general quantitative skills but expects that enron will train him from ground zero in all other disciplines
we had recently a candidate who wrote a letter and complained about being asked questions about energy economics
finance
etc
during an interview
we can interview the candidate over the phone and see if he knows anything beyond math
vince
can you interview him over the phone
vince
bob
please
give me an advice
the students from rice wrote a report about eol from which we extracted this article
we can publish it in out internal research weekly newsletter but i would like to make sure that we don't cross the line
the newsletter is internal but somebody can always capture the screen and distribute it electronically outside enron
or get a hard copy
who else could help to review it
vince
bjorn
i don't think the scope of the project is really that big
when we looked into it
it seemed like a relatively minor issue
to me
it's really a matter of routine maintenance that should not be an equivalent of a desert storm operation
zimin and i will call slava on tuesday and determine what has to be done
vince
we can sponsor one table
what do you think is the appropriate level of sponsorship
vince
nelson
we can go to memphis on friday
i would discuss first with gary and elsa the scope of what we shall reveal
we can shoot ourselves in the foot if we reveal our pricing technology to consultants
vince
this is the first draft based on what students from rice working on a project produced
of course
they were free to say what they thought
our objective is to modify the article to such an extent that it can be a useful source of information about alternative electronic trading platforms in the energy industry
it would be only for internal consumption and it should be a useful source of information for enron employees
ken parkhill from my group will work with you on editing this paper
vince
we can sponsor a table at the friend level
vince
we can move the trip by one week

who would be the right person on the trading desk to take a look at it
vince
kevin
please
take a look at the link to the website describing the neptune project
a merchant transmission dc line from canada and maine to ne
the link is embedded in one of the messages below
the neptune regional electrical transmission system will connect rapidly growing
electric-load centers in new york city
downtown boston
and the connecticut and new jersey shores with clean and efficient electric generating facilities in eastern canada and maine
employing state of the art
environmentally proven sub-sea cable technology
the neptune system will overcome constraints to the existing land-based electric transmission grid which hinder the efficient use of energy resources along the mid and north atlantic seaboard

i want to discuss this with him
vince
billy
we had an interview with bobby and we were not impressed at all
he started with a statement about his option pricing experience and when we asked a question about a basic concept in this area
the definition of volatility
he could not define it
an answer to any question was that he did work in a different area
when we followed up with a question from this area
like quantum physics
he would complain that the question is too detailed
he comes across like a classical consultant
many buzzwords
little substance

received vince
i shall be available next week
except for friday
vince
mark
thanks a lot
looks really interesting
vince
paul
i am glad you sent me this message
it will help to clarify a few issues
0
i was contacted by christian
this means i did not start this phase of the process
last friday
as far as i can remember
christian expressed interest in joining the research group
i told him two things
a
we would be delighted to have him here
b
our mutual relationship and good practices require that he receives your blessing before we can move ahead
we agreed to have a conference call wed morning
your time
with you
christian and mike roberts
0
wednesday call was subsequently cancelled by christian
mike and i decided to call you anyway thu morning your time
directly
to discuss the matter
i was in a prc all afternoon and asked mike to call you in case i could not sneak out to join him
mike called and was told you were out sick
0
i am leaving in a few hours for california
i shall be driving back to houston for the next 0 days
please
feel free to call mike an discuss this matter with him in my absence
0
i think christian has a strong preference to be in the research group
assuming he moves to houston
i think he came to this conclusion after visiting houston in early july
i did not bring up the issue of transfer with him at all when he was here
i can understand his motivation and think we should take his preferences into account
but the first issue is if he can leave sydney at all
i hope it helps
cheers
vince
mark
the members of my group attend informs conferences and i shall check today if we are covering this specific meeting
we shall be glad to speak with dr

look fwd to meeting you
vince
gina
i was thinking about calling you and suggesting an
italian only
lunch
i can also introduce you to my associate
rakesh bharati
who studies italian on his own
what about tuesday next week
vince
paul
i hope you feel better
i have seen the message from christian in which he confirmed that he approached the research in houston on his own
he did not receive any encouragement from me and from mike
i hope this closes this issue
i can understand christian's motivation but don't endorse the way he takes to reach his goals
he hopes to accomplish more in a larger group where he can have more interaction with his peers who have similar backgrounds
i think also that he developed an appreciation for good interpersonal relations in my group he could observe during his stay in houston
my advice is to try to figure out how to use his skills for enron and how to develop his social intelligence
vince
laura
we can definitely help jose
we are producing the demand projections for natural gas by state
by customer class every day
the projections are used to forecast aga storage numbers and have a very good history of hitting the right number
this validate svery well the demand model
getting the supply curve at a specific location is more difficult because other regions are competing for the same finite quantity of gas available in the short run
we have some good insights into this problem as well
my concern is that summer associates are not fully committed to enron
i have about 0-0 summer associates every year and we always take measures to keep them away from critical information
please
let me know how far we can go with jose
i am ready to help you with baseball
i went to a game last week and astros won
i guess i brought some good karma

i would like to thank once more you and your colleagues for visiting enron and for your most interesting presentation
we all look forward to working with you in the future
vince kaminski
thanks here is the message for jeff
jeff
i am asking you on my behalf and on behalf of rick causey to make a keynote presentation at the annual energy finance conference at the university of texas at austin
the conference is tentatively scheduled to take place on february 0
0
0
depending on your calendar
the conference organizers can reserve a time slot for your presentation at the conference dinner
february 0
0
thursday
or lunch
february 0
0
friday
this annual conference is devoted to financial engineering in the energy business
the topics covered in the past meetings included applications of real options technology to the energy business
risk management and the future of deregulation
the agenda of the last conference is attached for your review
the agenda for the 0 event is under development
given enron's relationship with ut and our interest in the energy finance program
a great source of highly skilled talent for our analyst
associate program
we think that your participation will benefit the company
the conference is widely attended by senior executives of other energy companies and is an excellent forum to present enron's accomplishments and the agenda for the future
vince kaminski
kim
thanks
i shall ask shirley to schedule a lunch in 0-0 weeks for me and krishna with you
krishna is about to become a daddy again in a few days
the end of august should work for him

i think dinner is a better forum for jeff

jeff agreed to participate
i suggested dinner as a better forum to jeff's secretary
the decision regarding lunch/dinner issue is still to be made
vince
steve
praveen is coming in tomorrow
we shall figure out a way to give you a great recommendation
i always appreciate your trading suggestions

assuming we go ahead and forge a formal relationship
how would you like to be involved
out of london or
possibly
houston
please
let me know
vince
mike
this is what some people in the industry see
vince
sheridan
i am aware of the duplicate check problem and i owe you phone call about this
i am still trying to mobilize internal support for the valuation study we discussed at san antonio
mark ruane whom you met
moved on to a new job and his successor is a bit skeptical about the need for a study
internal enron perception is that we understand the process of decision making inside big financial institutions
or lack of it
especially in the energy area
regarding valuation of investment projects
any study would just reveal what we already understand about quite simplistic tools they use
dcf with a discount rate being subject to negotiations within a very broad band of potential values
it will help if i get the agenda of the conference soon to pass it on to jeff skilling
it would also help if you could write a formal letter to him
vince
norman
thanks
talk to you soon
vince
thanks vince
steve
prediction company was confused
no problem

do you have a list of the members of the research group who have/have not contributed so far
i am afraid that you may have an outdated list and a list including some temporary summer employees
interns who cannot contribute even if they want
they are not in the system
i think our participation may a bit higher
vince
fyi
we need to get to at least 0%
i am also talking to erik thode
i am afraid he has a list of the group distorted by the summer employees who cannot contribute even if they want to
they are not in the system
vince

our internal rac models assign roughly bb credit rating to enron
vince
hello
thanks for your message
i think that we can resume our discussions in a few months
we have currently a large group of highly skilled enron employees who
given that we have effectively an internal labor market
are looking for alternative positions
we are giving them a priority in the hiring decisions
vince
thanks

i fully agree
they are free to donate as much as they want to charity as they wish
but it does not have to be through enron

a spark spread model has two primary uses
it can be used for pricing stand alone options traded in the otc markets and also can be used as foundation stone for a real options valuation model of a generation plant

we could include the lawyer
mark taylor

vince
anne
shalesh told me that his visited his hr screen some time ago and it showed a promotion to an associate
this entry was reversed later
any reason for that
it may be related to his transfer from ebs
we can check with his previous business unit whether they gave
promised him a promotion
vince
liz
we can schedule the trip sometimes between september the 0rd and september the 0th
i was shooting for friday only because it worked better for greg
vince
brian
it sounds great
i know from personal experience that it's much better to da new technology quietly and test it before everybody develops high expectaif you don't manage the management
they will give you zero credit for the idea
and a lot of grief for slow deployment
i see the usefulness of this technology in many places where we trade poweris it ok to consult one my associates
martin lin
and ask him for his opinion
he knows infinitely more about transmission than i do

another interesting problem that may lead to a trip to an exotic place
as you know
brazil is in the midst of a very severe power shortage
about 0% of installed capacity in brazil is hydro
out of about 0 gw
and the level of water in the reservoirs is about 0% of the normal
we have a huge exposure in brazil given our ldc investments and merchant power plants
measuring water level in the reservoirs is a critical project and boys from brazil are asking for help
we have looked into a similar problem in norway and came up with interesting technical solutions but had to drop it because of lawyers
objections
these objections may not apply to brazil
can we arrange for a conference call between you and me and remy collonge from sao paulo to discuss the problem
he will be back in his office on tuesday
i shall call you tomorrow about it
what is your phone number
vince
marshall

my assistant will call him to confirm

they may be able to give you some leads
vince
molly
jill is a daughter of my friend
she contacted our analyst/associate program but her background makes her a better candidate for an hr position
do you know if we are looking for somebody with her skills
vince
let's send flowers
i don't think a transfer is an issue that should be brought up during a hospital visit
zhiyong does not need any more stress
i speak from experience
i had a car accident
vince
anne

vince
frank

evp chief of staff
0
0-0 i shall leave a phone message for steve about the invitation from you

or would you like to leave it to him to decide
vince
richard
it's nice to hear for you
i know many people at rice
including the dean of the business school
and i can make discreet inquiries on your behalf
please
let me know if i can approach the dean or one of the finance faculty members on your behalf
vince
joe
we are working on the jcc project with the crude desk
vasant shanbhogue and nelson neal are involved in the project
we are meeting with marc de la roche tomorrow to present our findings about pricing and hedging
we shall be glad to send you the presentation and walk your through the slides over the phone
vince p.s
you are right
the margins are fat
it looks like a great opportunity
joe
i sent you another msg about our work on jcc
we are meeting marc de la roche tomorrow to discuss the jcc projects
who is the person in tokyo we should work with on this project
vince
steve
i have received an inquiry from a professor at the wharton school who would like to invite a senior executive from enron to speak at their energy club
i gave him your name
so you can expect a call from him or one of his associates
sorry if i put another burden on your shoulders
vince
joe
we shall work with marc and kinoshita to get it done
also
we talked to kiyoshi today and were very impressed
we shall show his resume to whalley
vince
john
a quick comment about seating arrangements for the weather group
i understand the new plan is to put both the gas and power weather guys at one location
my recommendation is against it
if the objective of having two separate weather groups is to put in place a system of checks and balances and encourage independent views
the new seating arrangements will nullify it
the power weather guys will defer to mike who has unquestionable authority and experience
if we go ahead with the new seating arrangements it makes sense to combine the two groups under mike's leadership
please
let me know what you think
vince
tsp
tanya
it was 0
vince
joe
thanks
vince
gayle
thanks for the invitation
let's connect in the beginning of november to discuss the details
vince
martin
looks great
i have forwarded it to sam
vince
paul
i have left a message for steve about your call
vince
i hope you will feel better soon
vince
anita
should we advise everybody to wait for the results of martin's evaluation
vince
laura
thanks for confirming the meeting on september the 0th
we shall be coming on a company plane from san jose and this gives us a lot of flexibility in planning of the agenda
please
let me know when would you like to start the meeting and we shall be glad to adjust
i assume you are on mountain time and this means we shall lose one hour flying east from california
vince
mike
i think it makes sense to send somebody from enron to make a presentation
given our relationship with the wharton school
i think it can be somebody below steve's level
the occasion does not justify allocating time of a senior executive
vince
thanks for your message
i shall ask my assistant
shirley crenshaw
0 0 0
to set up the call with you
vince kaminski
tricia
thanks a lot for your message
i am glad things are going well for you
it's quite hectic here as you know
i shall try to call you later this week to chat about the markets
vince
thanks for your message
i have talked briefly to rick about it and we came to the conclusion that we could substitute greg whalley for jeff
i assume that your interest is more in having a speaker from enron than a specific person
of course
we have to get on greg's calendar but i can make these arrangements as soon as i hear from you
vince
shirley please
inform the group
vince
albert
thanks
what is the time of the presentation
vince kaminski
dear dr
whitaker
i was contacted a few days ago by my friend
richard mcminn
who is currently holding the swiss re chair in the management of risk
centre for risk and insurance studies
nottingham university business school
before moving to england
he was for many years with the university of texas at austin
he is also an editor of the journal of risk and insurance
richard expressed interest in coming back to the states
and specifically to texas
i remember from a number of conversations with you and other rmembers of your staff
that you are thinking about making several additions to the faculty of jones school
especially in the area of risk management
richard is a well qualified candidate that you may consider in your search
i am attaching the address of richard's cv
please
feel free to contact me if you need more information about his academic credentials

thanks for sriram
i shall call you later this week with an update on our needs
vince
mike
thanks
vince
richard
i have made discreet inquiries at rice and it seems they are looking for somebody with a different profile than the one you represent
i think that the interest is more in a person with more financial institution risk management experience
with special applications to trading and energy trading in particular
vince

many changes in enron kept me busy during the last few days
rabi and tanya are working on a new version of the documentation and we hope to send it to you in a few days

i agree with you regarding point # 0 and so does tanya

as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality
they are not certain
and as far as they are certain
they do not refer to reality
only two things are infinite
the universe and human stupidity
and i'm not sure about the former
before god we are all equally wise
and equally foolish
common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen
i know not with what weapons world war iii will be fought
but world war iv will be fought with sticks and stones
i never think of the future
it comes soon enough
if i had only known
i would have been a locksmith
the hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax
the most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is at all comprehensible
the release of atomic energy has not created a new problem
it has merely made more urgent the necessity of solving an existing one
the secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources
you cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare for war
if the facts don't fit the theory
change the facts
imagination is more important than knowledge
the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious
it is the source of all true art and science
the important thing is not to stop questioning
paul
thanks for your message

vince
i have informed ryan siurek
cc rick buy
on oct 0 that i cannot sign off on any analysis done by our group without looking at full set of legal documents related to the ljm transactions
those documents were not provided and therefore we cannot sign off on any analysis done in the past
i have come to a conclusion that we cannot support the valuations based on verbal and often conflicting information
without doing full due diligence
feel free to provide the information to kimberly but
please
inform her i cannot support the quantitative analysis we have done in the past
i am especially concerned about the conflict between the existence of the restriction and the existence of a put that are
in my view
mutually exclusive

the answer about environmentalist making it hard to build power plants in california is yes
even with load growth and
asset divestiture they wouldn't face the facts that the supply/demand picture was messed up
they wanted all of the plants to be built in other states such as arizona and nevada
environmentalists
fish people
were trying to get rid of the hydro dams in the pac nw
it is definitely an issue they
as well as california will experience this year as the dams are only filled to 0% of normal
this equates to approximately 0-0 mwh short
typically in the summer
the pac nw exports about 0 mwh to california
guess what
there will be no exports this summer
the light will go out in cali
when is the meeting and where
thanks

i have attached an indicative terms sheet for full-requirements gas supply
it is similar to the initial proposal that i have made to other municipalities in northern california

many changes were made and negotiated based on several factors
some of those factors include the types of customers behind your city gate
residential
power generation
what your load profile is correlated to
weather
transport owned
and other services requested
also
the type of pricing you are looking for can affect the structure
call me on tuesday and we can talk about the city of roseville more specifically
i will be out monday
have a great weekend
i hope this is helpful

hey lyndon
very glad to finally hear from you
sounds like you are happy back in austrailia
i would love to see it sometime
unless things change between now and january
some of us are suppose to be on the poly on january 0th
we have booked our trip and the pictures of the beaches on st
martin look fabulous
we are going in on the 0rd to stay a few days before we get on the boat
i hope you are there
although i would understand if you stayed where you are
keep me posted on your plans
whether you stay in austrailia or go back to work on the poly
as for the recent tragedies here
i am so very lucky that no one really close to me was killed
i actually flew in from denver on monday night
just in time not to get stuck there
one of my very good friends was suppose to be in the wtc
worked on the 0th floor of tower one on monday and was called back to houston for a meeting tuesday
flew out of laguardia at 0:0 am tuesday morning
that meeting saved his life
i am so glad that he had that meeting
i would have been devasted if something had happened to him
however
all of the people in their offices there are missing
he is very sad but greatful to be alive
it does make you think about what you are doing with your life and what is important but i don't think it will make me stop traveling or doing the things that i love to do
it is sad that this thing has already affected our freedom
some more so than others
most things won't be as easy as they once were
but i guess that ease and freedom were taken for granted
i also can't believe that someone could come in and do so much harm to innocent people
and i don't know what should be done to stop such things from happening in the future
can i just run away to the beach and ignore it
it's a good thing that not everyone has that aanyway
i am glad to hear that you are well and having fun
i am doing the same
just here in ugly houston for now
i think that my trip to aruba for october has changed so i better get something planned before the end of the year
please let me know if you are back in the states and if you go back to the poly
oh
and thanks for the picture
take care
love
k0 ps
i have another email address at home
it is kward0@houston.rr.com

attached are the financial statement for the parent who is willing to guarantee the project

i got the rfp late and therefore
i am running behind
i am attaching my proposal in case you need it
it will basically be a full requirements transaction out of our socal pool for up to 0 years
can we make this our number 0 priority and get contracts to them today
please
i will supply beverages later in the week or perhaps a ticket to astros tonight
if i can find them
please call and let me know if we can make this hurdle
thanks
kim

i am showing some physical and financial transactions to the city of santa clara
also known as silicon valley power
we have done a lot of business with them on the power side and i want to sell them some gas

let me know if you have any quesitons
thanks

jay

thanks
kim
0
hesco additional collateral 0
noresco
they want to focus on 0 or 0 years
can we get there
i don't have their financials but lets get started on what we can get started with
i am not expecting to do financial swaps in the immediate term but i would like to be preparted when we are ready
thanks
kim
steve
attached is a term sheet showing price indications for the products that we talked about
the market it down today so they may appear to be a little high
i am still working on a structure term sheet for the pipeline capacity that we breifly discussed
please give me a call and we can update these prices for you or we can adjust the structures if these are not the products that fit your needs
i would like to be prepared in the case that we are able to put physical or financial transactions together
in order to do so
we would like to put both a physical purchase/sale agreement and perhaps an isda master swap agreement in place
one thing we would need is someone to contact for financial or credit information so that we can insert the appropriate credit language in the contract drafts that we send to you
please let me know if you have any questions and i will be in touch with the transport structure
thanks
kim ward manager
west gas origination
just talked to noresco again and they are trying to get a handle on the credit requirements that we have so that they can be prepared
they want to do a 0 year
fixed price transaction with 0 % swing at that price
all other gas outside the 0% swing will be priced at gas daily +
$.0
we are adding a $.0 premium on the 0% swing and the baseload is approximately 0/day
if the credit requirements are different for a 0year deal
they would like to see what those are
that might sway them
jay
i know i have been bugging you about this but i do need it in order to go forward with trying to get this deal
and they have asked me for this credit information twice today
it's all about you
thanks a million for your help
kim
lose this email address
your site has been blocked by my company and i can not remove as described below
no
i will try to investigate today
they are forwarding the name and number of a financial/credit guy from noresco as soon as they can
they asked for a ball park and i could not help them
would it make a difference if we did 0 year index
for baseload
with gs daily for the swing
due to credit requirements from others we are competeing with on this
they are considering an index with the supplier with noresco doing an internal financial swap with a sister company
perhaps equitable
what do you think
i will keep you posted on discussions
thanks
kim
antoher thing they brought up was locking in physical basis only
how does this affect credit
thanks again
kim
very cool
i will keep you posted on the structure that we are focusing on
right now it is nymex + physcial basis
they will lock in basis but not nymex
we can talk about the potential risks there if you want
kim
thanks mike
we have left a message for dave and are waiting to hear back from him
also
we are definitely willing to fix the physical basis for you and float on the nymex
and this will help your credit cause
so now i am assuming that you guys are focusing on fixed basis for 0/day with gd on the swing
would you guys be interested in looking at a transport structure for the first 0 months of the transaction
i am looking at the economics of this to see if it will help you
call me if you need anything
thanks
kim
hey amy
could you add art avalos
aavalos@pnm.com

thanks
kim
steve
attached are form certificates that you can use for the first two documents required to be included with your executed isda

thanks
kim
mike
we still haven't heard from dave
he may be wondering who jason williams from enron is
if you guys could work him from you end
it could speed things up
thanks for your help
kim
you're welcome
it should be fun
kim
we are very close
when were you here
and why are you slummin on the gas floor so much
you goin
ok
i was wondering if you came to work today
i certainly didn't want to
still sorry to hear about your deal
i hope things get better
here are our curves for san juan for the last couple of months
you make the chart
i was not successful
also
i have attached a storage chart
let me know what else you need
my friend shannon is coming over at about 0:0 and we are going out
somewhere
what are you doing
do you think it would be beneficial for me to go to wspp
oops
it's ksward0
chris
attached is my new and
in my opionion
improved spreadsheet for the citizens deal
as you can see
there are slight differences between my calculations and john cogans
the main issue is as follows
0
calculation of the spread
he is taking the greater of pg&e topock minus $.0 minus pipeline demand charges or sj + fuel
this can create a negative spread value equal to pipeline commodity charges
which we are reimbursed for
the results of all of this is mulitplied by $.0
i am assuming that the floor for the spread is sj
therefore
the spread = zero if it does turn out to be less than zero
i hope you have time to review
once this is fixed you are done
just collecting money
i am working with darla and ann to get the orig granted
thanks
kim
went this morning
did you go
any word on noresco
just got a call
darla
attached is a spreadsheet we prepared that details august business with citizens regarding the griffith deal
please use this to prepare your invoice
also
please inform me if they do not pay us by the due date
john cogan should not be paid until we get paid by citizens
please call me and we can discuss the spreadsheet as there are cells that must be verified against the tw invoice as well as sitara
in addition to billing citizens
the following entries need to be made each month
0
payment to john cogan 0
origination to kim ward and chris foster
0/0
0
payment to earms for the $.0 insurance chris negotiated these amounts are dealed in the last three columns of the spreadsheet
there may be some updates to the spreadsheet that will create some prior adjustments but these should be ironed out soon
call me when you get a chance
thanks
kim

believe it or not
we are very close getting our signed isda from the city of glendale
steve lins
the city attorney had a couple of questions which i will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents
0
i am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort
this document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references
typically
it references a transaction
which in this case
there are no transactions yet
he feels this reference should be deleted
what is your opinion regarding this
0
we sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the isda
one form ws a form resolution
they have already received city council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an isda with us
steve is going to get a certified copy of this resolution
will this suffice
when you return
i may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions
i think we will have an executed isda with the city of glendale by the end of next week
i am going to be out there meeting with them on wednesday
thanks for your help

at least that's where i think we are
any news on srp or ncpa
thanks
kim
j
sorry
i sent the other email before i got this one
the contact that i would recommend at ncpa is dean park
0-0-0
he will either help you or can direct you to someone else
you can reference the rfp if you would like
you are right
ncpa is a consorsium of munis
the ones that would be involved in this particular transaction would be the cities of roseville
lodi
lompoc
and alameda
the transaction would be a physical basis transaction for 0/day at city gate for 0-0
we would be buying back $0.0 physical basis for 0
this would be a sort of blend and extend
our deal would be physical basis
let me know if you have any more questions
thanks
kim
thanks
beth
credit will review and i will let you know if he has any questions
i think the next thing we were waiting on were your new contracts
if you guys need anything while we are waiting on those

once we get things rolling
we are available to come to dallas
thanks

funny you should ask about my life right now
now you are sure to get an earful
beware
my country is at war and going into a major recession
my company is falling down around my feet
my grandmother is sick
i am broke
and my boyfriend broke up with me last week
further confirming my ability to fail when it comes to relationships
i know i act tought when it comes to this stuff but i am really sad about this one
i guess that i am not sick and i do have lots of friends
but i am tired and need someone to take over at this point
i can't believe that you didn't get my email about gas being a buy a couple of weeks ago
i guess if i had seen you when i was there
i could have told you in person
as for business over here
gas and power trading is still going strong
however
all of the events have affected us in a huge way financially
down to whether we get bonuses or not
it is not going to be a good year just trying to stay strong but i think that we will survive
and mostly thanks to enrononline
curious about what's going on there since you mentioned it
anyway
sorry to burden you with my personal problems
i do hope things are going ok for you
too bad you're not going to make it here
as we are in a cash crunch
i think i am probobly grounded for the remainder of the year
who knows
keep in touch
sorry i didn't forwarn you so you could choose to re-schedule
funny how things can change in just one week
suzanne is awesome
don't know what i would do without her
we just went to berryhill and had a taco and margarita
not a late night
you didn't have to leave
i am glad you came though
hope we can do it again sometime
once i get over this hump
see
i am still insecure and a disaster when it comes to relationships
and i hadn't even gone there in 0 years
take care and keep in touch
he is canadian
did you meet him

kim
attached is a summary of the conference call held between enron
citizens
and pp&l on october 0th
proposed procedures on how we will handle cuts from now on are also included
enron is making every effort available to ensure that pp&l receives 0% of the gas that they call on
i feel that we need to formally agree to these procedures
either in the form of an amendment to the agreement or a formal letter signed by all parties
please let me know if you have any comments regarding these procedures and how you would like to proceed
thanks
kim ward manager
west gas origination
please change your address book to include kim ward in houston and not kim e

thanks
thank you

call me
0-0-0
i don't know what to do
boss says i don't need to look for a job and they will have to find some $$ to keep people
don't know that i want to be among the 0 enron employees beating the streets
any suggestions
there have been no formal announcements of layoffs but logically
i feel like about 0% of my friends here will loose their jobs
especially the ones not associated with gas or power
the world is in turmoil
wish i had my sailboat and 0 mos
$$ to live on
i would go to the caribbean and stay for a while
hi joan
yes it is me
your long lost cousin
you probobly got my address off of something that my mom sent around
how are things with you
as you probobly knew
i am back in houston
which is very good as my company just announced a merger on friday
worried about many of my friends but i am not so worried about loosing my job
the world is certainly in turmoil
hope all is well with you and your family
keep in touch
kim
hey
the leg is healing nicely

kim
hey lyndon
it was nice to hear from you
we are in dired need of the upcoming vacation
things here have been changing by the day
to make a long story short
my country is at war and going into a recession
the company that kim 0
stacy and i work for was purchased on friday by another company after finding out that our chief financial officer was involved on some questionable activities
to the tune of about $0.0 billion
practically taking our company down single handedly
loosing about 0% of the value of our stock
therefore
we are broke
and my boyfriend and i broke up
things just aren't right
but hopefully
things will start to get better
i'm very glad i have a trip
that is paid for
to look forward to
how was your gay cruise
i think i would have a hard time with that one myself
i do hope all is well with you
we will all be ready to play and relax in january
take care
kim
gerald
thanks for looking at this for us
when do you think you will have a chance to review it
i talked to the customer today
they are looking at doing some 0 and 0 transactions
also
do we need to have credit re-review
let me know what you need from me
us
and if i can help in any way
thanks
kim
how are you doing
things here are definitely roller coaster status but stablizing a bit
how was your wine tour
i thought about you guys
it looked like so much fun
elliot is thinking about having people come to stinson dec
0 and 0 and i was thinking about coming a day early or leaving a day later
or maybe both
i am thinking that you might be out of town around there but if you are around
i would like to get together with you if it all works out
let me know what you think
and i hope all is going well for you
kim
el
i am in for sure
just gotta look into possibly using miles
i think suz might be in as well
what about rosie

i certainly understand your concerns and believe that they should be voiced
i will also babysit the situation and try to make sure she abides by the rules
gerald
stacy
i didn't which of you would have the most time to deal with this
but
i am responding to an rfp for provide gas to several frito lay plants in california for the term dec
0 through october
0
it will be a full-requirments transaction whereby we manage the imbalance and transportation
based on the request
they would like to execute a gisb with special provisions that i have attached
i have also included a confirmation form they would like to use to confirm the transaction for each of their facilities
all requested modifications to this contract form must be submitted with the rfp response which will be emailed to them by noon central time on thursday
nov
0
sorry for the rush
i just received the rfp yesterday and didn't realize this was a stipulation until just now
no modifications indicates that the proposed language is acceptable
i am also attaching the rfp itself
please let me know if you have any questions
this will be a pretty standard full-requirements offer
please let me know if you have any questions or what i can do to help
thanks
kim
el
i think you sent this to the wrong place
just talked to suzanne and she is in
as long as we can get there cheap
as for sunday
when do you think people will leave
being 0 hours later here in houston
we might have to leave pretty early
what are your thoughts
kim
we can come in on thursday evening
so we can spend friday in the wine country
and leave sunday afternoon at 0:0 for 0 miles
so we are definitely in
what do you think
finally
i think this one is for you
have a good day
kim
quite commendable
i have to say

i will talk to her on monday and see what the plan is
phillips
i will check on this
also
keep me posted on conexant and let me know how you want to set it up
we are busy getting moved onto the new floor
kim
also
who use to do the smurfit invoice and who is their boss
do you know
wow
i think the world is coming to an end
all these huge changes
not much going on over here
doing busines as usual
don't htink i will see a change for a few months
if at all
maybe just some new faces
i think that there will be some hostility and not really looking forward to that part
moved onto the new trading floor this morning
chaos
but very nice
unfortuneately
you know who is on my floor
bummer
anyway
as for suzanne
she was with ees on a product development project
she worked with corporate development on the dynegy transaction and has been asked to stay on with corp dev to sell more asset through march or april
at least this way
she knows she is employed until then
she wasn't so sure about the ees gig and i think she is right
my parents were going to come here for thanksgiving but my mother has this
feeling
that they shouldn't make the trip
so they aren't coming
don't know for sure what i will do but i refuse to sit at home entertaining myself for 0 days
i am sick of hanging out with myself
you are probobly going somewhere warmer and perhaps tropical
i hope you have a great thanksgiving
lets get a beer after
its the holiday season and time for
good
cheer
kim
are you talking about js
thought she was going to kentucky
i was going with my friend elizabeth but she is probobly going to have to work on friday
so i may just ride back with her
trying to figure it all out
as i am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal
i will need your input in order to respond to this request
as i have indicated
the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and citizens is considering walking away from this deal
they need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue
do we need to have a meeting
and when can i expect a response from the desk
thanks
kim
let's meet today at 0:0 in conference room 0 to discuss the griffth deal and our reply to citizens
if you are unable to make it
please let me know
thanks
kim
$0.0 plus origination
jim
just wondering if you had that list of counselors or if you were interested in setting something up
kim
sean

i am here
i'm off my call
terri
what's going on and how was your weekend
we are still working on the tn/fla party

don't know for sure what i am doing yet
thinking about going to dallas
gotta work out the logistics though
let's get together for a beer soon
kim

keep me posted on how your day is going
i kind of hope you get to go today to see your fam
thanks so much for your help
kim
when can we meet today to discuss our written response to citizens
fyi
we are addressing this today
grigsby knows they are pissed and he knows that i am pissed
if they expect me to continue to sell products involving service from their desk
and they get paid for that service
they are going to have to do a better job
citizens isn't the only one that i feel has service issues from the desk
dan

did you put that on my desk
cliff
for gas day december 0
0
enron did not schedule gas to the city of mesa
i was unaware of this until late in the day dec
0
therefore
it is my interpretation
under section 0 of the contract
enron is not providing sufficient gas supply to the city on this day
the city of mesa should determine its best course of action based on the terms of the contract given the fact that enron did not schedule gas for december 0th
please notify me of any new supply or other course of action
as soon as possible
please let me know if you have any questions
thanks
kim
some of you may have gotten a similar email before but it seems as though it is appropriate once again

check out the following websites for airfare
www.orbitz.com
the best so far
www.hotwire.com
with this one
you see the offer but won't know the airline or flight times until you lift the offer register for sidestep and it will show you what priceline offers anytime you look for airfare under any other platform then of course
there is expedia and travelocity
but they tend to be more expensive
also
sometimes when you check the same website again 0 minutes later
it will show a better price
don't forget
tomarrow is 0 days in advance
that might matter
p.s
if you want to see how un attractive my friends are
we are going to be a the wine bucket

a new associate and analyst prc is being set up

mike
who is working on the duke restructuring now
regards delainey
how do we immunize ourselves from the workouts being shed into raptor
regards delainey
gere
just following up on the offsite
have you all agreed on the target producer list for the insurance product
how is the peaker product developing
regards delainey
that may work
i don't want to end up with an equity position i just worked hard to eliminate
further
raptor may be a good accounting hedge but if we took back jedi's share at existing marks we would be destroying significant real value
will the buy back price of the equity/debt we get back from jedi incorporate the write downs we think should occur
regards delainey
david
once you get the demand lets discuss before deployment
regards delainey
mike
i will want to see those economics
thanks delainey
sounds good
lets see if we can start marketing the product and the capability
regards delainey
sounds good
i think you have a great opportunity in this market
i would suggest staffing aggressively in order to take the first mover advantage
i note the associate needs
regards delainey
maybe that commercial is closer than to the truth than i thought
regards delainey
both
scott
what is our emissions strategy for these counterparties
regards delainey
chris
when did bp amoco get involved
i thought we were dealing with avista
regards delainey
scott
you need to make your own call on that one
i think you could add value in either
regards delainey
mike moulton has been pursuing an idea in the technology area for a while
the sponsorship of this idea clearly fits in net works
could one of youfine gentlemen give his idea a test drive
i would much appreciate if youcould give him a call
regards delainey

i understand that none of the facilities were available today
i thought we were targeting 0 mw

please advise
regards delainey
lew
it looks like i have some appointments i can't get out of on the 0th
however
we could be out there by noon on the 0th
how does that fit
i did get a call from mike letting me know that he would be sending over the ca
regards delainey
joe
i would appreciate a quick call by you to larry to ensure that his organization is focused to get these plants over the goal line asap
we still have technical issues with the vendor that need to be addressed
i believe ee&cc is working the issues
however
a phone call from you to emphasize the importance to enron will add extra encouragement
thanks
regards delainey
guys
have we started the mobilization on the tear-down of the two 0fd's at gleason
will they be machining the equipment on site
it appears to me that we should not let that equipment leave the site if possible
do we have a credible site rep from westinghouse for both wheatland and gleason
please advise
thanks delainey
guys
i appreciate the updates
please ensure 0
that you
as ena
are integrated 0
deliver a very clear expectation with ee&cc with a credible plan and 0
that you scream bloody murder if a deliverable is missed
you will need to bird-dog this to closure on an hourly basis to ensure that we get over the goal line
keep me in the loop daily so that i can keep the pressure on at a senior level
regards delainey
rob
does the new contract have the same price or is it an increase
if it is at the same price
i would agree with barry that this is a very visable display of enron canada's participation in the business and social community and it should continue to sponsor the flame
on the accounting front
expense it in canada
it will be an explainable variance for this year and budgeted next
let discuss regards delainey
thxs joe
much appreciated
dave
jere
please forward the list of targets
let me speak initially with john
lets try and get this done today
i appreciate the effort on the peakers
as well
i would suggest we start discussions with reeding
bates which according to both redmond and thompson is a live deal
thanks delainey
looks rather impressive
good job
regards delainey
this looks good mike
i appreciate the efforts
regard delainey
mike
i forwarded your interest to whalley
mcconnel and mcmahon
any technology effort really should be lead by networks
this is consistent wiskillings strategy and what has been communicated to the analysts
you should receive a call from one of these gentlemen
regards delainey
chris
i can assure you that i was not part of the
organization
got the books
going throough now and i will get back to you
keep avista's feet to the fire
speak with you soon
regards delainey
jere
i spoke with scott on these targets and his belief is that both himself
allen and john have significant relationships with these folks which should help leverage your product into this sector
scott and john have agreed to set up these meetings with the decision makers in these targets with no delay
from there
you
john and scott can determine what deal team will go speak to them about the opportunities
i would expect that we will be in front of these folks asap
lets see how the product is embraced by these customers before we extend the target list and create a more formal alignment of the groups
as per your earlier e-mail
i assume you are working on the reeding
bates opportunity
regards delainey
fyi
tammy
please ensure that budgets and cost tracking similar to the peakers/doyle are set up asap for austin and vitro
these should be updated and circulated weely
regards delainey

regards delainey
i am in florida
i think i am available the night of the 0th for the baseball game

i would like to make the game
regards delainey
larry and joe
is there any additional moral pressure that we can put on westinghouse to get the resources needed to expedite the resolution of the gleason 0fd issues and the vibration issues at wheatland
the phone call by larry to ge has made a world of difference
regards delainey
fyi
kay
try and schedule me in
bill
can you set up a meeting to discuss credit issues
just you and i is fine
regards delainey
guys
swank has confirmed with me that he is committed to join the mid-market group in east power and make a difference
i would strongly support his movement into either serc or ecar as per our earlier discussion
i hope to be moving several experienced dealmakers into the gas and power mid-market groups to increase our deal-making skills and relationships in those markets
i would also hope to move a reasonable number of new associates
that only rotate within trading and mid-market
to the various desks
the goal is to increase the bench strength of the trading and mid-market groups plus support john's iniatives on the fundamental groups
regards delainey
tom
you are making the right call
give me a day or two to manage the positions
regards delainey
jere
i understand your frustruation and i am very motived to prove out the insurance product
however
i do think john has a legitimate concern
especially given the fact that this group blew up very publically internally and externally and we need to repair the image internally and market perception externally in order to be successful in the future
surrounding multiple groups covering the same customers with different stories
you guys could not work this out
so i offered a compromise position which involved a well coordinated test marketing iniative
this was agreed to by you and john at the offsite
a
the insurance group was to identify the initial 0 to 0 target customer list that ena would pitch the product to which should give us a determination if this is a commercially viable product
b
john and scott would facilitate the contact with the customers to ensure a consistent face and story with the customers
if you guys can sit down and come up with an alternative that works for you
great
regardless
john had promised me that he would do everything necessary to facilitate and promote this capability to these customers asap
c
both groups would put a deal team together and get out there asap
d
if the test marketing of the product is successful
i agree that we need to sit down and discuss how we formally allign the interests of these groups
this appears to be a reasonable and logical approach on an interim basis
regards delainey
any ideas
these guys
john
jere
just can't get it together
regards delainey
kevin
i would like more detail on these issues of which i was not aware
lets discuss next week
regards delainey
i think it would be great if dan and kevin could participate
regards delainey
janet
i though we signed a turnkey with nepco
there should not be any overruns to your p&l if that is the case
regards delainey
rob
i think we should renew the flame for the three year period
my understanding is that it is $0 k cdn per year roughly
not paid up-front and cancellable if flames leave calgary or disappear
expense in canada
it is your call ultimately
regards delainey
celeste
try and get him scheduled into the super saturday if possible so that the risk guys can take a look at him
if that can't be done then give me a call
regards delainey
ben
why are we distributing this
it is inaccurate and i'm not sure i want it floating around the place
regards delainey
guys
i will set up a monthly meeting between myself and you guys to discuss deal flow
priorities and strategy
i think you will find that more effective and i can keep the other meeting small
kay
please set up
regards delainey
john
great job
please
work with jeff to move the longer term deal along
regards delainey
dick
i appreciate the effort on the moore project
i would hope that there is more than a $0m saving in the scope
this plant is still showing $0 to $0/kw given current economics
i am still puzzled by this
regards delainey
eric
we need more than $0m saving to get this deal to clear the hurdle
i think we need to get to $0 to $0/kw firm including idc to make this viable
please ensure that nepco is working to figure out the disconnect
regards delainey
rodney
please give cliff a call
i spoke with him today
he will handle
please fill him in on your discussions to date
thanks delainey
this is great rob
regards delainey
good job
randy
live to fight another day
i don't know if you know but i settled with fort james
we ripped up all three contracts for no money that netted us approximately $0m in value through the elimination of the two power contracts in the nw
wertz was on the other side
thought you might want to know
thanks delainey
eric
i am on the road
i really don't have much to say
we have had very little interaction
regards delainey
this is great
please update and forward weekly
regards delainey
rob,this deal is not dead
i am primarly waiting on nepco numbers
you should be moving down the road on the deconstruction
refurbishment and movement of the nb machines
you should also be doing any development work
permits
interconnection agreements et al
you need to do to maintain the optionality of this project
let me know if the expenses get above $0mm
randy
please facilitate
mike
can we put the screws to abb given the significant transformer business we forwarded their way
laura
we probably need to make a call on the peoples turbine pretty soon
eric/rob
i think we need to see the project with idc come in between 0 to 0/kw to be viable or i need a very detailed analysis of why it costs significantly more than a frame 0 machine in the us markets
i would like see us make this work
regards delainey
mike
why would it cost $0 to $0/kw for the moore project
it is a 0 unit abb configuration and the turbine costs appear to be in line with wilton 0ea's on a kw basis
kay,please approve in the pep system
thanks dave
don
lets hang tough for a day or two
nothing needed for cinergy
regards delainey
mark
you have this one
regards delainey
guys
we are working to put together the final team to manage this issue
however
it isjeff skilling's call to keep delainey
milnthorp and keohane out of the day to day fray on this issue
i believe this is the right call
commercial and legal resources from houston will manage this issue on a go forward basis and may call on you as a resource if needed from time to time
you have done a very great job managing this issue to date and your efforts on that front are much appreciated
our focus should return to growing the business and meeting our financial targets
peter
i believe that mark h
would like you to stay involved through the friday conference call that is scheduled

don't do anything at this point
it is not needed
regards delainey
please approve in system
don
with regard to your previous message please contact michael
regards delainey
what about barry and eric
this looks good
regards delainey
ed
this looks great
please ensure that the focus is on coverage
deal flow and building markets
i want to avoid two groups hunting strategic elephants
ie
east origination and development so ensure the scope is consistent with mid-market coverage and feeding the desk deals and info
in the case of building or purchasing assets please let jacoby's group handle
any deal or lead that significantly disrupts coverage or takes you or your people out of the market please pass or coordinate with origination or development there is bound to be some conflict between the strategic origination groups and you
please keep to a minimum and resolve in a manner consistent with one team and doing the right thing
please provide john and i a monthly report of customer transactions completed
coverage plans and
market building iniatives
let me know how i can assist in any way in recruiting or transactions
regards delainey
tim
in the east power group and the gas groups
we are trying to build a mid-market capability
deal flow
information and coverage
consistent with the largest energy merchant in n.a
please see tha attached
i would be curious to talk to you about your structure
coverage functions and market building iniatives
i recognize that you and your group have been the most effective and proactive group in these areas for some time
is there areas where we could be more aggressive or proactive
can i get you more resources to cover the market more aggresively
lets discuss
regards delainey
jeff
i would like to discuss this with you and your plans in gas
regards delainey
please follow up with this person if interested
regards delainey
i think jean is gong to be there
thats ok
regards delainey
guys
the project should be charged market based rates and ena is not in the business of subsidizing international projects
this is particularily the case if we are not going to hold a continued interest in the project
however
if we can not reach a term o&m agreement please maintain the optionality in the project by managing the facility on a direct bill basis to apachi until they find an alternative provider
do not in any event abandon any assets at any time
regards delainey
where did he rank against other folks at the super saturday
i would argue that if he was in the top 0%
we should accomodate his need
regards
gary
i have not heard much more on this issue
are you ok with this
regards delainey
guys
i am getting the impression that we are having quality control issues
it just sounds sloppy
am i wrong
do we need more focused resources
regards delainey
jeff
what is your current thought process on txu
regards delainey
ray
i am ok with nick and his group managing if redmond/mrha are ok

in this capacity
i would like that engineer to report to you or wayne mays

i believe this has been handled appropriately
however
fyi
regards delainey
rodney
are you managing and coordinating these reference requests for ena to ees
i think that these requests need to be highly controlled into the ees organization at a high level and screened by you as being necessary or not
regards delainey
tim
my understanding is that partnership fee
the $0.0m
has been amortized for the last several years and expensed to the industrial groups
mcconville and ondarza
as you are aware
i sued them for breach
the settlement involved the elimination of all existing transactions between ft
james and enron including the wauna and halsey power contracts
it is my understanding that the benefit of the elimination of those shorts resides in the portland shop
the elimination of the shorts would not have occurred without the lawsuit on the alliance and the settlement i originated
it seemed logical to charge the portland office with the remaining un-amortized fee of $0.0m as a cost of eliminating the shorts for no cost and no future contingent liability
lets discuss
regards delainey
guys
i will forward the info as it becomes available
there appears to be one project in texas and one in california which are well down the development road
if interested in these projects
which have to meet a december 0 cod in order to get the tax credit
i would suggest that we purchase the development sites and turbines from enron wind and keep the asset
commodity position
tax credit and possible green credits in ena
they are ok with that strategy
this is an opportuntity that needs to fleshed out fairly quickly
ben and dave can you lead this analysis with close contact with doug and tim on the desk
we can get together to discuss if you like
regards delainey
joe
thanks for the assistance
we have a few items still outstanding on the doyle
georgia ppa with ogelthorpe

the 0 program is much smaller
i will follow up shortly

that is correct
you know what
i agree
don't let it go to your head

best of luck in all your future endeavours

good job with the california issues
we didn't get everything but we managed the position in a very effective manner
jim
given our view to support the growth of the iso structures as a necessary evil and given the socio-political leaning of these entities
should we be more actively or aggressively supporting or nominating directors on these boards
jim/rick
we need a full court press on this nepool icap issue
allegretti is putting plan in place
regards delainey
guys
your teams did a great job managing a very difficult situation with very few material effects to the organization
it is noticed and appreciated please pass on to your organization if you feel appropriate

regards delainey
ed

you may want to think about eol as well
ie
how many companies have you brought on-line
etc
summary
coverage metrics
completed deals
hot list
delainey
jim
i agree
lets put a plan in place to ensure appropriate representation at these iso's
not unlike pac

the three of us probably need to get together and discuss tactics around a number of issues
jim
i am also curious where you are in your thoughts and plans given your new role

i think the project team managed the #0 turbine problem heroically
talk to you soon
regards delainey
jeff
have you finalized how jenn and craig will split out the industrial segments
they should also come up with their business plans and a reporting matrix similar to what you are doing with the desks
how are you making out at the desk level in implementing our previous discussions with scott and the remainder of the desks
regards delainey
kay
why are we waiting to the end of august
regards delainey
i would like to thank all of you for putting quality time and effort into this important process
there is nothing more important to ena than attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people
effectively immediately
written and oral feedback for commercial managers and directors can be delivered
as per our discussion
the prc process is primarily a feedback
performance management and staff planning tool
it provides a data point for bonus purposes
however
it is not the only determinant
in the interest of ensuring the most effective performance management tool
i would suggest that we implement the following
a
for employees ranked in the strong and above categories
the ultimate ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities
written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately
b
for employees ranked in the satisfactory
needs improvement and issues category
the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure performance issues
for the satisfactory category
the message should focus on increasing deal-flow
financial performance and productivity
the bar is always being raised
for the needs improvement category
the message should focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months
for the issues category
the business unit manager should determine
in conjunction with your hr rep
the appropriate plan to find a better
fit
in the organization or counsel out
regardless
the ena office of the chairman will require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of action to rectify performance
vice president ranking can not be communicated until after the enron vp prc currently scheduled for july 0st
i anticipate a similar process as above with our officer feedback process
associate and analyst rankings can not be communicated until after the enron a&a prc currently scheduled for july 0th
other identified action items from the meetings include
a
the hr group will put together a
profile and performance book
for ena's a&a's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at the july 0th meeting
b
ena will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing a&a's to continue rotating within ena
c
ena will be holding an additional
off-cycle
a&a super-saturday for houston and portland in august to augment our capabilities in this area
and d
your hr representative is building a pipeline of outside employment candidates for your review each week
please review these resumes in a timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof
please communicate to your organization as appropriate

this looks great
looking forward to seeing your final thoughts
regards delainey
ray
couple of comments
a
donahue is responsible for the portfolio management function but also incorporate the idea of jeff being responsible for ena's
capital book
ie
managing existing deals and intimately involved in conjunction with treasury and the various origination groups of which finance transactions get or don't get on our books
b
has fastow clearly put defner in the ena treasurer role
if so we should also mention this in the note
c
chuck ward
generation investments
don miller
merchant generation
and d
with regard to commodity structuring ensure it is clear that they will facilitate and structure the highest priority/value transactions across the organization even though they report to janet
ie
they don't just work on east origination deals
let me see the final before release
make sure mark is on side
regards delainey
on the fee
let mike manage he knows my thoughts
regards delainey
guys
any interest
regards delainey
guys
we need to figure this out in the next couple weeks
john do you want to take a stab based on manager
director and vp rankings
regards delainey
ray
if mark does not have any other comments
lets go ahead and send the memo out asap
regards delainey
rick
looks like a good start
as per our discussion
this is a very important issue
janet
please assist on the ui front if necessary
regards delainey
jeff
i don't believe the offer i showed you of $0 m is unreasonable
in fact the team had recommended $0 m based on a number of measures
i see the 0x multiple of annualized q0 earnings as one of the best measures of the potential value of this company
i don't see it in the best interests of enron to be transferring assets below a reasonable market value between business units
you can trust that i will be keeping the energy capital resources team's feet to the fire on the realization of this value if you do not purchase the company
if you and steve can come up with a better indication of value
i will support that transaction
regards delainey
steve
please call jeff and go through in detail how we got to our valuation of approximately $0 m
please ensure that this is a reasonable facsimile of value that ena would accreate over the short to medium term assuming your continued management
let me know where you end up
regards delainey
george
it is probably worth speaking to them about the us assets
probably the smaller virginia sites which are probably less core and may be great brownfield sites
i'm not sure we would have an interest in uk coal fired assets
i would speak to sherriff on that one
however
i would caution that real value is created through rapid brownfield development leveraging on enron's development
electricity
coal and emissions talents
for comed and homer city
mission has already paid up for these assets based on gas being on the margin
now that was before a lot of the run up so it may be worthwhile
however
i think it may be difficult to arb these guys
as well
i think it may be difficult to get the asset out of them
i'm not sure that they can turn their strategy or show a loss this quickly from a wall street point of view
we should probably take a shot at the smaller probably less core virginia assets
are they in qf
if so there may be upside in the deal from duran's point of view
dave
given the rise in gas prices and gas being on the margin for a larger part of the load curve
coal assets or coal qf's may be great assets for us from a restructuring and power asset
expansion/brownfield
point of view
have we looked at this
are there many in the market
regards delainey
how could coal fired qf's play into your and george's strategy
regards delainey
janet
we have been down the road with these guys before and it was not very pleasant
i think it is hightly unlikely that larry will be coming up with an additional 0fa turbine
but you can call him
i'm also starting to think as the lm position starts to get better managed that maybe you and chris should take the d0's and 0ea's onto your book
something to think about
i am just concerned about your ability to manage more complex deals without some resource availability
i think you have to feel pretty good about the lm position first
something to think about
regards delainey
fyi
richard
i think i am starting to obsess and i really don't want you guys working on this
however
it think that it is very odd that this griffin guy over an eight week process
two registered letters and a phone conversation does not send a letter or bring up this
chrome dreams
issue from 0 with us until this lawsuit is filed without our knowledge
this guys sounds a little off
regards delainey
guys
where is rebox
it seems to have disappeared
i assume you guys are working on the accounting issues necessary to book the swaps on the garden state deal
regards delainey
chris
did we get the dash completed and approved on pasotria and lv cogen
rob
i have not heard what the plan of action is with moore
rob
what would be the necessary steps needed to book all or some of the bruce deal in q0
regards delainey
david
i wouldn't do the brown bag
too often
too hard to keep doing
i wouldn't do the social gathering
too country clubish
i like the monthly dinner/cocktail hour/ballgame
etc with the otc and parts of the management team as a forum to identify talent
give a&a's exposure to the management team and to
sell
ena
i would suggest that we make it every two months rather than monthly
however
i would have the first one very quickly for the top rated a&a in ena that are due to rotate soon in order to try and pitch them on staying in ena
maybe dinner and ballgame
for the resource management and coaching part of the program
lets wait until we see where we end up on any possible changes to the program first
i assume that you are working on a couple strawmen on possible alternatives
once we have a few ideas
i would like to pitch whalley
sherriff and mark when i get back
lets go ahead and implement above asap
regards delainey
wes
we have the following dates set up
a
east midstream and qf restructuring

regards delainey
don
couple of points
a
would take a page to describe the bridgeline structure
ie
we have done this before
b
haven't we done more that 0,0 transactions
c
we are getting paid a fee for providing the back-office services
let me see what you come up with after discussing with presto et al
regards delainey
good job rodney
keep me up to speed and let me know where i can help
regards delainey
janet
its your book
if you feel we have the lm's licked and we need the resources/the value at risk is minimal
i would go ahead
i would get calger on side as well
regards delainey
looks fine to me regards
don
go ahead and set it up
what have been discussing with them on the gas side
did csfb tell them about the $0 kw capital cost plus the three year tell beverly or kay to make time for next week if mr forster can make it
regards delainey
i'm already perfect
unless asked just bring your smile
regards delainey
jeff
my team believes that there should be a premium to book in the range we quoted to you
however
i appreciate your interest
i would agree that we have spent enough time on this and it is time to move on
regards delainey
wes
please have the detailed hpl numbers available to discuss on monday
regards delainey
guys
lets set up a meeting between the three of us on monday asap to discuss
i have a few ideas and i probably need to go have dinner with lew to get him comfortable
this may be setting up to be a larger asset management transaction
don can you try and find a time next week with lew for me to have dinner
get beverly to schedule the plane to get me in and out that day
if not next week then early the following
i think it will take a one on one with lew to get this one centered
at our meeting
i would also like a status update on the other iniatives eg
the accounting issues on the generation projects need to be addressed as well
regards delainey
jordan
i assume the memo i asked for is in hard copy on my desk
thanks delainey
i think we have the wrong date and time on this one
the upstream qbr is august 0th for an afternoon
regards delainey
fyi
please follow up if appropriate
regards delainey
eric
jim ajello in the industrial group is the best person
regards delainey
laura
i spoke to tom about his retail proposals
i told him that you would coordinate a meeting between mark muller/lou pai and himself
i only want lou going up if tom is involved
however
mark muller is up to go and i have spoken to him with regard to the opportunity today
he is expecting your call
on a related note
i volunteered wes colwell
our controller and former anderson person
to speak to peoples accounting
risk people and anderson auditors on how to manage the issues surrounding marking the hub values inside peoples
i would appreciate you coordinating that meeting
if wes goes to chicago
we want to ensure leubbers
the anderson folks and the appropriate peoples accounting folks are available so wes can spend the least amount of time on this issue
jeff
where are we on the peco/pseg retail play that you spoke to mark muller about a couple weeks back
mark
i forgot to mention that fpl is interested in potentially investing in the new power company
tony altman
president of fpl wholesale
would like to discuss
if interested please call him at 0-0-0
if you don't think you will have any interest let me know and i will call him to let him know
i probably need to get back to him either way shortly
thanks
regards delainey
jim
i would forward to chris calger
janet dietrich and jean mrha
thanks delainey
mike
if you janet or dave can cut the deal with izzo go ahead and speak to him
i don't think there is any practical way to enforce any percieved call we have on izzo so you will have to determine how much larry really wants the trubine or how he could benefit from striking a different deal
regards delainey
rick
i hope you take the time to speak to rodney malcolm or ray bowen on how your technical and commercial exprience could help move the outsourcing product
in all its forms
forward in the industrial market
otherwise
your welcome
regards delainey
kay
make sure mark knows when you are scheduling these qbr's so that he can ensure the package is ready
some of these are coming up next week
regards delainey
mark
note the feedback from the aa's
it is imperative that we get a handle on this
let me know when i can spring our plan on jeff

right now i am scheduled to be up in calgary on the 0th of august
lets shoot for that date

brian
great job
i would really like to get this done for third quarter please let me know how i can help
i have heard that you can request a expedited hsr for fairly straight forward deals like this
wes
i believe that we don't have any issues recognizing the value from this transaction
please confirm
regards delainey
rick

looks pretty general
only comment is what is the product purchase agreement entail
do we want to go into more detail on the nature of the alliance
the target market and the nature of the excusivity
ie
wholesale renewables applications
ena
major state programs
all of it based upon the conneticut job working
regards delainey
shocker
edward
you are very welcome and i appreciate all the efforts to ensure the transition works and we get the accounting treatment we want on garden state
regards delainey
david
i want to enforce this to nth degree given his understanding of our industrial offering and that fact he mis-represented his reasons for leaving
regards delainey
please put on schedule
charlie
your call
just a question
kay
please have jordan forward this in hard copy to your attention
in don't need to be in the e-mail loop
thanks delainey
jeff
we are thinking about how to finish the mid-market iniative and i need to know if you want breslau
i would like him in a singular role and accountability so i need to plan to incorporate him or not depending on if you want him
regards delainey
guys
to end all arguments
i would suggest the following protocol which is similar to what was discussed at columbia lakes
a
p&p swaps and anything to do with the network strategy/assets in the paper sector in canada and mexico
industrial origination
b
pure energy commodity positions and stand-alone energy assets
no outsourcing
for all industrial segments in canada and mexico
ecc or enron mexico
c
energy outsourcing for all industrial segments in canada and mexico
i would like enron canada and enron mexico to develop a written target list in which ecc
enron mexico and the industrial origination groups would work together to develop
sell and execute on the most profitable and value adding outsourcing product for the industrial customer in canada and mexico
ecc and enron mexico's understanding of the energy markets in canada and mexico coupled with the customer facing
product development and execution skills in houston should provide a winning team
i am asking for the three teams to clearly identify the outsourcing targets
lead sales and structuring people and the timing as far as starting discussion with each target customer
asap
i would hope that the mexican and canadian teams would lead the sales process and the houston team lead the structuring
customer facing and execution but i will let you decide the optimum mix
either way
i am expecting this target list completed and agreed to in the next two weeks for canada and mexico
and d
for tembec i don't think it makes sense to change the deal team at this point
however
the us team will keep the canadian team in the loop and if the products become non-outsourcing related the deal should be passed to regards delainey
fred
i will research our potential needs otherwise i agree with your approach to keep the option open for as long as possible
regards delainey
let me know your thoughts after you speak with him
regards delainey
how do like that
i like this guy
larry
my understanding is that esa has taken four units and that janet dietrich in conversations with esa has made four more available to esa subject to them getting their deal approved by the board
so i do not believe enron needs to committ to additional lm units at this time
regards delainey
i agree 0%
i look forward to your plan
rob
we may be saying the same thing here
for the ees outsourcing proposition
which is more than just asset management
as being defined by rodney et al should be managed together by industrial origination and ecc
although
i would agree that ecc should lead the sale process
my view is that we should not and will not recreate the structuring
customer facing and execution requirements in canada and mexico required to do these deals
it is an important strategic iniative for ena to complete a number of these deals
the problem is that a clear target list
joint accountabilities and schedule between the groups has not been rolled out which was discussed at columbia lakes
all other industrial business other than p&p commodity/asset business is the perview of ecc
ultimately
i have not seen any outsourcing transactions from canada in the deal structuring/due diligence queue
the us group can help get these done and can help in the pitch
regards delainey
thanks ben
makes sense
joe
thanks for the message
it has been my experience that people who have had experience in our trading
mid market and structuring groups have a better overall understanding of how enron
ect or ena
looks at value and manages risk
personally
this is the track i took which included a very solid foundation in accounting
operations
trading
structuring and then ultimately in origination
i hope this helps
regards delainey
guys
i would like to schedule a quarterly meeting to review our technical risk as a part of this reporting procedure
wayne can you set up a meeting for the four of us over the next few weeks
regards delainey
janet
get rid of these lm's
too many cooks

margaret
what is involved with this permanent residency application
how does it change my status as a non-immigrant resident
regards delainey
larry
go get
em
whatever you can get you can keep and reduce the fee
you could make this easy for both of us
regards delainey
rob
i spoke with paul
eric didn't rank high enough
regards delainey
jeff
you are killing me
we targeted that group specifically to build the risk business in gas and east power in the short run
this was well planned effort
regards delainey
janet
any thoughts
do we have excess development staff
this would be a good opportunity for the brave at heart
regards delainey
dave
i still believe that the most flexible model that provides high roce and has growth not constrained by capital is the one being employed by enron
i think the cash on cash returns on these genco's in the short run will be good
however
i think it will be difficult for these companies to move quickly to react to market opportunities given their need to protect their long position
not unlike our friends in the oil
gas producing sector
the returns and value provided by these companies will be primarily be based on the timing of new production and their asset base and they will realize
on a relative basis
very little from the trading
it is not a bad model just a different one
either way
they will be a strong bid for assets given their story to wall street
regards delainey
guys
this is my first cut on who i would want to be in this group
i think this is an important exercise on a couple different fronts
we need to bring more people
in
which should increase their accountability for ena results overall
improve communication and teamwork and provide a platform to evaluate future leaders
trading origination country managers support executive presto calger yzaguirre beck delainey arnold duran oxley lavorato neal bowen haedicke shively donahue murray allen mrha martin redmond i would like to send out a note this week to communicate whatever we come up with in order to have the right folks available on friday
look forward to your comments
regards delainey
wayne
that would be fine
regards delainey
mark
i am in favour
regards delainey
as part of the restructuring between ena and global markets and consistent with the view to increase our focus on building our core gas and power business
we have decided to re-formulate the ena management committee
as part of this change
each of you are invited to participate in dialogue and decisions which will impact the overall course of our business
ultimately
this group is responsible for the overall financial performance and strategic direction of ena
the only structural committment to your time will be a pre-scheduled management committee meeting every second friday afternoon starting at 0:0 pm until 0:0pm in 0 c0
video conference room
the portland
canadian and mexican offices can connect via video conference
the meetings wil focus on financial targets
deal flow
market opportunities
staffing and strategic direction
the first meeting will be scheduled on this friday
everybody should make a serious committment to attend
to stay for the entire meeting and to be on time
regards delainey
mark
this is great
giving the increased exposure/politics in some of these markets it makes a lot of sense
regards delainey
kay
can you make sure i am available
john
if we invite scott then i think we have to add eric thode
pr/ir
however
everyone would be in
what do you think
regards delainey
guys
my suggestion would be that rac should manage the overall monitoring responsibility for ena
however
i assume that janet and chris will continue to be responsible for the ena turbine book
they should be actively managing and monitoring ena's piece
regards delainey
ben
can you spend a little time and give me some feedback on this item
regards delainey
janet
it may be in your personal interest to ensure that a number of witnesses are available to ensure the message is delivered and there is not confusion in the future
regards delainey
chris
where are we on gas interconnect
i am hearing rumblings of 0 year kern exposure
don't know if i like that
regards delainey
mike
lets discuss just after wayne and i get together to discuss the technical book or in conjunction
regards delainey
david
i would change john thompson and ed baughman to strong
delainey
tim
i thought i would send you a copy of the east mid-market qbr to give you a view on what presto/baughman are doing
the west historically has been far better than the east in covering the market and generating mid market deals/services
i look forward to our discussion in portland next week
i would like to get a perspective on organization
market approach
deal flow
resources
products and coverage for the mid-market group at that meeting
regards delainey
guys
we appreciate your efforts on this project but we will not be needing your services as owners engineer on the vitro project
i will honor our agreement on the sell down
however
we have sufficient technical talent internally and externally to manage this job
i see very little effort in continuing to waste internal time in ena and eecc on this discussion
regards delainey
chris
that is correct
see you then regards delainey
adrian
you are very welcome regards delainey
paul
sorry for the delay in responding
i do not have a direct relationship with anyone in reliant or txu
however
jim ducote and janet dietrich may be the best spots in enron to pursue
regards delainey
dick
you need to agree with max on the scope to be provided by the oe
i expect high quality service for the money we are paying
the deal on friday is completely dependent on a pre-arranged scope and a minimum quality of service
i expect high quality ee&cc people to be proactively managing cost and exposure and to be there for the whole process
no pulls to other business lines
if max or virgo are not happy i am not happy
i make money you make money
thanks for your cooperation
regards delainey
adam
i believe that we have formally responded to all your issues as per your memo to me of august 0
0
in all or almost all cases
we have accepted your position
the agreement should look and behave very closely to what you would have signed with the competing utility
in addition
ena is paying a higher price
sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the term to twelve years from ten
i do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than a complete re-trade on the original transaction
i hope this is not the case
the ena team worked hard to facilitate this transaction for enron wind
in fact
we were originally solicited by enron wind to help build the merchant wind market and we had to coax enron wind to do this transaction with ena versus txu
i look forward to finding a solution to this current impasse
regards delainey
rebecca
looks fine to me
regards delainey
guys
keep the pressure on these guys
but
i think adam is in a corner and does not have a lot of flexibility
regards delainey
adam
thanks for the response
i guess it is a good thing for enron that we didn't do this deal with txu
nevertheless
i hope that we can find a way through this without significantly impairing value for ena
the ena team will work with you on this item
however
i need your committment to try and keep us whole as much as possible
regards delainey
tammy
are you getting copies of all these reports for the book
regards delainey
rebecca
i am fine with this
however
lavorato has was spelled wrong

it is my understanding that the incremental $0 mm in gas v@r
under an interim authority
expires today
given current market conditions
i would request an extension of that interim limit
$0mm in total gas v@r for an additional two weeks starting today
jeff
as per our meeting today
we may want to think about additional permanent increases for gas and power v@r particularily given the alberta ppa's
the potential nstar deal and the current gas market as we enter the winter season
i will take your lead on this one
regards delainey
barry
we currently have six folks coming who all golf

i will get kay to forward travel schedules to you so that we can set up times where everyone can play as much as possible
my understanding is that we are all staying at the mirage
regards delainey
hey
you guys are copying my model
congrats regards delainey
jeff
you will be receiving a dash from the principal investing group which does not fit well into some of the charter criteria
however
i do think this is a venture we should support
in a nutshell
it is providing $0mm
in seed capital
to be used in the start up of a new distributed generation company having the primary mission of designing
fabricating and marketing 0mw to 0mw mobile turbine-generator sets
these units are fully mobile via the nations highways and can meet single digit nox requirements given current scr technology
they are primarily utilized for back-up power
emergency power
var creation and peaker application and are fully dual fuel capable
the ultimate vision is a fleet of mobile/flexible/low cost generator sets that can be put in place very quickly in the most stringent emissions and constrained electrical regions and relocated when market conditions change
the benefits include
a
0% plus interest in a new distributed generation company with the opportunity to raise private funds at later rounds and ultimately the possibility of an ipo
similar companies in this space include active power
capstone and elektryon
b
origination opportunities
the ena mid-stream origination groups believe that there are numerous opportunities
0 to 0 time frame
to utilize this technology to take advantage of market opportunities and customer applications
c
learning
the distributed generation/renewable space is an area of critical importance for ena and ees to understand
if ena through this venture can make this technology work
it could be a very powerful tool in our network used to capture opportunity and manage risk
d
low risk
it is expected that roughly 0% of the initial seed capital would be recoverable through asset sales if for some reason the technology did not work or the market did not materialize
e
low tech
this solution utilizes existing turbine/scr technology
and f
ena would have a controlling position in this new venture
however
this venture is different than active power and several other principal investing investments in that a
it is a very early stage company and b
ena will have to provide or procure a complete management team if the technology proves out
given
that we could benefit most from the successful application of this venture
it is worth the initial work
our partner is power systems manufacturing of boca raton
florida
we have a very solid history with this company
they have successfully solved many of the technical issues surrounding the korean 0b's which are currently operating at new albany
they would bring the technical and engineering expertise at cost for their 0%
ena would ultimately have a buy-out clause at a fixed number for their 0%
if you would like to discuss in greater detail do not hesitate to call and i will set up a meeting
regards delainey
chuck
i appreciate the note
i just like to ensure that everyone is aware of the various issues and that we are managing our risk appropriately
i have a great deal of confidence that you have this handled
regards delainey
i don't think we can accomodate that request
regards delainey
kevin
shouldn't we participate in this rfp
regards delainey
mark
go ahead and set up the meeting
delainey
rick
it looks like the number is approximately down $0mm
what is the drill
regards delainey
attorney-client protected kevin
if we respond to the rfp with what we believe to be market prices and values and they don't accept it
does that not support a case where damages from the mopa
for that 0 mw
can be defined to be equal to or lower than our submission
regards delainey
patience my friend
before a meaningful change can occur in the a/a program some of the changes in the ei groups need to be resolved
that process is underway
i envision taking a comprehensive solution to jeff towards the end of this quarter with charlene on side
i will discuss with you when i have more details
regards delainey
guys
ena will take responsibility for the two 0ea's
we do not currently have any projects for the westinghouse 0d0a's
however
i do not know what bowen's view might be for eim or haug's for calme
regards delainey
kay
can you set up a one hour to half an hour with each if possible
regards delainey
janelle
i was hoping that maybe we could find a half hour to discuss your thoughts on your current role
i have heard you are considering global fuels and lagrasta's business
i would like to give you my perspective on the future vision for power and the overall organization including gas ultimately
ena and enron have a very open labour market and you need to manage your career in a manner that you feel will benefit enron and yourself the greatest
however
i think the power market
even though not easy
is the primary growth engine for enron corp over the next several years
kay
can you please set up a time at janelle's convenience
regards delainey
david
if this is going to cause you political flack with mary joyce lets just kill it
we have revised the original plan and this is probably not needed
regards delainey
carol
i believe hunter is leading the charge on building the gas fundamentals group
regards delainey
david
how are we making out with this item
regards delainey
jen
i would be pleased to attend
sorry for the delay on the e-mail
kay
please set up
regards delainey
tammy
are you getting all these reports
regards delainey
tom
i appreciate the e-mail
sorry for the delay in response
i am on-side with all your points
on the new albany retrofit
i want to ensure that i am not replacing one patent problem with another so a clear
title
up front on the new equipment will be important
however
i will be interested in hearing your solution especially if it can further reduce nox and increase our operating hours
i share your interest in the ft-0 project hopefully we can take that to the next level
please stay in contact
regards delainey
jennifer
is there another time
regards delainey
guys
gas with a $0.0 handle is not a good thing for this deal
i know we are pushing this restructuring as fast as we can
however
i think we need to determine how to move this faster
any ideas
regards delainey
successfully
missed another bullet
i have meetings set up with mariel

who are the two highest ranked performers in calme
to see if they are interested in joining our team

guys
pending the sale of the wilton centre unit
i would suggest that we not execute the gas balancing arrangement
the parties should continue to operate and invoice based on the verbal agreement
however
lets not execute the agreement or put it in the data room
we should represent to potential buyers that we have an interconnect agreement with northern border and have been accessing supply out of the chicago spot market
all other gas supply/transport/balancing agreements for the other facilities
including the northern border interconnection and the comed reg cap deal
will be conveyed to the new buyers through the sale of the llc
regards delainey
good note
don't think i could do better in style or timing
regards delainey
kay
please find room
mike
this appears to be a very reasonable settlement
proceed on this basis
i assume this keeps my number in and around the $0 to $0mm for the 0's all in

newport generation has called me interested in the plants

pls set up
guys
i appreciate the quality work and deal flow that you are generating
in an effort to measure and reward performance from our middle market groups we have attempted to come up with several standardized reports to be issued monthly and to be reviewed at the qbr
i am a strong believer in that what is measured and rewarded gets done
as well
the middle market capability is crucial to the continued growth of our business
therefore
reporting metrics which define high performance will ensure great deal makers get rewarded and that you will be able to attract high quality talent into the mid market groups
baughman and presto have created a number of reports and metrics for the east power group
i would like you to take a look and let me know how they should be changed to reflect the business in the west
upon agreement on the metrics
i would like issue these reports on a monthly basis
tammy sheppherd will get you a copy of the reports/metrics utilized in the east
regards delainey
guys
i would like to add the following commentary to the dash which will better reflect my thinking around this investment
the current text suggests that there is significant strategic advantage for ena to be a participant in the fund
i do not think that is the case
however
i do see some merits in the investment based on the needs of enron's global finance group
i would suggest toning down the strategic advantages and add the following
it is unlikely that given the funds target returns that the it will be an effective permanent monetization vehicle for ena's strategic and merchant investments
however
enron global finance believes that the investment is important for the following reasons
a
provides an additional
friend of enron
to facilitate short to medium term balance sheet and regulatory solution to highly structured commodity and capital transactions in the wholesale group
b
provides alternative sources of short term capital liquidity and c
by further developing the relationship with aig provides collateral benefits for enron's overall global finance capability and business
ena would have a requirement that this investments be hedged through raptor and be managed by the enron global finance group
regards delainey
david
on a go forwards basis
please ensure that there is a technical sign off on the principal investments dash
i would like either bob virgo or wayne mays to have a look at these investments from a technical due diligence point of view and to be on side before the investment is made
regards delainey
jim
agree with you
why don't you set up some time for us to speak and go through the regulatory report and iniatives
regards delainey
randall
i appreciate the invite
i would like to continue to be involved
it was a pleasure to meet you and your team
the several things on my radar screen with bridgeline include
a
improving the financial performance of the entity
b
ensuring that the risk management and trading capability and structure matches ena's technology
structure
systems
accountability and policies in every manner
in my view
this is not a negotiable item and will only benefit bridgeline on a go forward basis
c
continue to move from the
heavy lifting
approach to becoming the
smartest pipe
that can harness improved returns by capitalizing on your people
your information advantage and i believe somewhat of a first mover advantage given the continued consolidation of the intrastate competitors
ie
entergy/koch/fpl
we will be very supportive of innovative and aggressive positions that are well thought out and downsides defined
and d
increasing the underlying liquidity of our capital position in bridgeline
my time and resources are at your disposal
regards delainey
fyi

hr should be in touch with you with regard to a couple of people that i have agreed to take from calme

boris feschiev
manager

guys
i have spoken to cliff and mark and we are comfortable moving forward under the structure we have discussed
fcel
$0mm in equity and 0.0mm warrants from corporate treasury stock that vest based upon 0mw of orders
discussion with fcel in which we disclose all infromation we have about the potential conn
deal
i will require that myself and mark be on that call
the transaction is fully press released immediately
crra
subject to final due diligence on the development risks
we provide the management and wrap for crra on the potential fuel cell development opportunity that consists of between 0 and 0 mw
any appropriation of funds from the government will require dpuc hearing at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in fcel
i will require that mark haedicke manage this process and sign off on all press releases
term sheets
disclosure discussions
contracts and regulatory filings
i believe that we have this managed appropriately as long as we manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner
thanks delainey
guys
as usual the investment is subject to rac review and a dash
regards delainey
randy
scott healy contacted bob kelly at calpine about calpine's potential interest in bridgeline and he found that kelly and cartwright had no real knowledge of the potential deal
likely this originates at the local level and is probably a long put
kelly was going to get back to scott with more detail over the next week
regards delainey
kevin
i am not sure that you will get credit from the buyer for the increased mw's given well known industry issues with the 0f technology
further
any buyer will pay based upon 0 degree output which is the same in any case
ie
increased output only helps when ambient temperatures are lower than 0 degrees at site
likely the buyer will run any spread option value or multiple value based on 0 degree output
i may be wrong but it is also my recollection that this is a warranty issue rather than a true output issue
ie
we could increase the mw's at any time but we would likely run into warranty issues with westinghouse
given that the warranty expires in less than twelve months
what value do we really get
would it not be better to get the maximum amount of hard dollars out of westinghouse rather than an increase in output which will only be guaranteed for a limited amount of time and likely will not be paid for by a buyer
the thought process on the eecc side is for them to find overhead and cost savings to fund their fee
$0.0m
rather than further increase to the capital cost of the facilities
as well
given current accounting language
any fee we pay will have to be expensed to current earnings rather than capitalized so i would like to find ways for this to be self financing
my knowledge on this one is rather cursory
can you guys work this out and adjust tactics with eecc as necessary
regards delainey
guys
power systems has given me a proposal to replace the new albany and doyle 0b burners
this could possibly have two benefits
a
elimination of the possibly tainted equipment given current patent issues they are having with ge and b
apparently the newer technology significantly reduces the nox emission correlating into increased operating hours
i need two things to determine if we want to move forward
a
mark we need to be bullet proof on the patent
or lack thereof
issues on the new equipment and that it would protect us from further exposure and b
mitch
kevin
mike and bob
i need your technical and commercial opinions on the merits of this proposal
ie
do you as a team support this proposal
i believe the timing on this is rather short
please get back to me at your earliest convenience
i will forward a copy of the proposal to each of you
regards delainey
christi
i was unable to open the file can you please send a hard copy
regards delainey
ike
with the danger of being too presumptious
i thought i would follow up with an e-mail to suggest a procedure for trading settlement offers on wednesday
attached i have a suggested template for each party to use so that we can ensure that we are comparing
apples to apples
i would also suggest that each party provide sufficient back-up to justify their numbers
it may also be helpful for tva and epmi to use an independent party
such as charles bone
as the intermediary to facilitate the transfer of each parties settlement offer
i am in the office over the next several days
lets discuss at your earliest convenience
regards dave delainey
kay
can you set up a dinner with randall
thanks
joe
part of this deal is repayment of the sub debt at par and a series of cashflows that we would probably like to monetize
have you looked at this
jeff
i would like to get your view on the economics
basically they are giving us 0% of our carry value in cash and 0% of our carry value in a contingent payment payable at restructuring or sale of their partnership
lets discuss asap
regards delainey
ok
you got the ball
regards delainey
jim
i have forwarded your binder to david oxley to set up a meeting for the wholesale group to discuss appropriate homes for your people
it has taken a little longer than expected to get people together but we are making progress
it may be helpful for you to identify
like abe
where these folks would like to go if they had their druthers
it may be worthwhile for us to have a quick phone call to discuss
regards delainey
krista
you are very welcome
best of luck in the future
regards delainey
guys
i have explained the strategy/tactics that have lead to this position in some detail
in my opinion the company is not at risk and potentially ena could create significant value from a project that we have very little invested
i understand the construction risk on the bid as much as anyone and we have no intention of lifting their offer
as far as eecc involvement
as i had mentioned
coleman was a part of all these discussions
i will argue that mike and the ena deal team made the right call necessary to maximize return in the short run for enron without investing significant dollars or taking significant risks
obviously
i was unsuccessful in explaining such a sophisticated strategy
regards delainey
chris
as per our discussion
i just want to confirm that we have the ability to break the contract with the epc provider at any time
further
i want to confirm that our costs will be minimal and that this whole process
ie putting a number on a term sheet
has been based on trying to maximize the short run value of the project
in other works
we have no intention of lifting their offer
finally
we are not ordering hrsg's or steam turbines
these guys add no value and they are killing me
regards delainey
thanks
paul
i had a look at the pitch and i thought it was an intriguing idea
i think it works welll in allocating resources between competing
going concerns
but may be more difficult to allocate people to new businesses that may not have the income to fund the best talent
i also wonder if the cost of creating
managing and maintaining a market like this is greater than the overall benefit achieved over the existing system
in its own often clumbsy looking way enron's culture does allocate capital and people fairly effectively
obviously
these are very cursory remarks
i have not spent a great deal of time on this
regards delainey
ok with me
john
i think you may want to be part of this
regards delainey
john
completely agree with your view
david
i would have the matrix
with all of the ena statistics and names
ready for distribution on friday to the key managers to try and illicit a response from the low participation folks
regards delainey
david
i agree in principle with this process
i assume that you and your team will implement
like we spoke about
i do not see a need to widely distribute this through the commercial organization
i would just implement
regards delainey
chris
this sounds good
it would be helpful for us
the overall power business
to have a common set of metrics and reports that evaluate the effectiveness and importance of the mid market effort
i think we all believe this is an important skill or capability that needs to measured and rewarded
key metrics may include
a
coverage metrics against target customers
ie
customer contact
b
forward deal flow or hot list
c
completed transactions and origination
and d
eol customer sign-ons and deal flow
i look forward to sitting down to discuss
regards delainey
bruce
obviously ena does not have a problem with this
regards delainey
guys
how are the business units doing on the
talent pipeline
since we have put this on auto-pilot
is hr still providing resumes
regards delainey
guys
can you give me an update on what this deal is about
e-mail would be fine
regards delainey
ike
it is unfortunate we could not make this work yesterday
but i understand your position
in the interest of facilitating continuing dialogue and perhaps giving you our view on how we analyze such positions
i will send you our document
i would suggest that we try to set up a follow up meeting in early october once you have completed your work
regards dave delainey
jeff
i think we should take a quick review of the existing pi portfolio to see where we are and where we want to go
we have with the completion of fcel made a tremedous amount of investment in a very short period of time >$0 to $0m
i would like to hear how we are moving to monetize more mature investments and influence/generate value from the earlier stage investments
i don't want to approve any further investments until we have had such a discussion
regards delainey
david
i have a problem with the rac comments made on page #0 of the dash
specifically
the two paragraphs basically add no value and just confuse the reader
ie
what is your opinion
is this a good sale or can significant recovery
on a risk adjusted basis
occur if we convert the sub debt and infuse more equity
are we not receiving enough value from the cfpc given the possible recovery of this sector
the dash is deficient in its view of basic's prospects given current energy prices
jeff/dick/ray
what are your opinions
independent of the desire to move on
what is the right call
i do not want to give value away in any divestiture or restructuring
regards delainey
guys
what are we going to do with this contract and the barges
my understanding is that we have a done deal on the 0b's
is this correct
i may be a nervous nellie but i would like to put all this stuff behind us
ie
no more 0b's or barges
regards delainey
david
you may be getting to the nub here
ultimately
this is a lot more art than science
it will be difficult to come up with a mathematic decision rule to manage this process
i am looking to the opinions of yourself
ray
dick and jeff
given the facts in each case
does this appear to be a good trade given the market
the specifics of the company
the carrying costs of the asset and perhaps our desire to increase capital flow to higher return this is clearly not a fire sale and i trust the opinion or consensus that comes from this group
as a result
i need to have a positve consensus from this group in each case
regards delainey
rick
i disagree
the dash had an implication unsubstantiated that the current deal on the table is a bad one
i believe that rac should provide a clear opinion or say directly that the analysis is deficient
it is too easy to state the obvious
regards delainey
jim
i am not sure that this will attract the people we want to hear the message
however
i will hold back judgement until we discuss the strategy in more detail
regards delainey
guys
assuming that we receive $0m for the 0b's what is our cost basis in the barges
regards delainey
jim
this sounds like an ambush
mary
none outside of enron plans
regards delainey
jeff
this fella gave me a call on a new technology that converts chemical feedstocks into industrial gases
he wants to establish the technology in baytown and is looking for our assistance and capital
this is probably a stretch but it may be worthwhile for you to speak with him
i am not advocating this play just passing on the message
steve paras 0-0-0 he will be in houston on friday
regards delainey
marion
the leads include heather kroll and ozzie pagan in the eastern origination group and michael l miller in the principal investing group
regards delainey
joe
where is the arb
ultimately
this cannot be a cost of capital play given the owners
is this primarily an off-balance sheet issue for the customer
are we taking disposal or terminal value risk on the facility
operational risk
did we come up with this structure or was this the mandated structure in the rfp
is this a play that you would support
on a previous issue
do you feel confident that we can monetize the el paso note on the ecp sale at the 0.0%
it is important for us to be able to quickly monetize this note for obvious reasons
how is it going otherwise
regards delainey
rob
no hi or goodbye
you are losing your canadian politeness
on a serious note
you are doing the right thing for the company and for barry's career
this will be a good opportuntity for him to get to the next level if he makes it happen
as you are aware
i will aggressively support you and the toronto iniative
let me know
regards delainey
guys
can you forward your parts
regards delainey
charlene
that will be fine
on a different note
where are you on the straw man we spoke about
ultimately
i would like to continue to push this with the leadership team
regards delainey
charlene
the 0nd is ok
either mark
myself or john should probably be able to do the 0th as well
obviously
we strongly believe in the benefit of the program and its goals
ultimately
we have to walk the talk
regards delainey
sounds reasonable
erin
don't want to keep passing the ball
however
this is a retail opportunity in almost all states
ie
railroad demand is classified as retail customers under most iou tariffs
i would ask harold buchanan regards delainey
oz
david is interested in the fuel cell business
do you need his skill set
regards delainey
chris
you are officially the king today
with the psco deal this effectively eliminates the lm position assuming we successfully sell lv
regards delainey
joe
enrononline is essentially the internet distribution channel for our gas and power business
rather
my focus on the legacy channel is an attempt to increase the probability that more originators can complete transactions and generate deal flow
as well
to reduce the conflict between the trading and origination organizations in order to keep us spending more time in the market than focused on internal issues
as far as specifics
you will have to wait and see
thanks delainey
kevin
how do we get at the transmission without buying the entire company
regards delainey
i am not a big fan of this idea even though it is rather interesting
i just think that the logistics are difficult particularily with employees with families
the drive to galveston and back
the overnight babysitter
the potential trouble that may result in close quarters and hours of drinking et al
i prefer the original idea at enron field
regards delainey
guys
it will be very difficult to get money out of the power group
is the expectation that i come up with the dollars
just curious
are we not circumventing the spirit of the political contribution rules
regards delainey
rick which meeting are you refering to
regards delainey
jeff
can you speak briefly with kevin on this one
intriguing idea if the execution was probable
by the way
what is our plan with sithe
regards delainey
ike
given our schedules
it appears that e-mail may be the most effective communication tool
i thought i would just follow up on progress being made in tva on our settlement process
as well
i understand that there has been a number of communications between tva and enron on the noxtech emissions business
i have encouraged the enron folks to pursue this opportunity with tva given the larger dialogue
the enron team has told me that tva wishes to move to firm pricing and a mou on this technology
given the larger dialogue
i have suggested to our team to hold tight on completing the agreement until both tva and enron have a view on where the overall settlement discussions are going
please give me a call at your earliest convenience
regards dave delainey
ike
is the president and ceo of tva
fyi regards delainey
rick
i have been having discussions with both joe deffner and jean mrha on this one
clearly
this is a commercial banking product in which we have little competitive advantage unless we take more risk on terminal value or collateral
reserve risk
ultimately
i have challenged the upstream group to define the other parts of the deal that would compensate for this increased risk and the cost of capital uncompetitiveness
regards delainey
janet
he can approve but can't sign as a director
you need to continue to manage
this would take a board resolution to change
ie
he can not bind the company as a director
regards delainey
eric
like the united way
our goal should be 0%participation
in order to reach that goal
we need the reporting mechanisms to determine which groups and managers have very low participation rates
i strongly believe that ena's numbers would be better if we had north of 0% participation
ie
the
unhappy
folks are more likely to input info than the
happy
folks
regards delainey
sure
just set up with kay
guys
attached you will find a list of key transactions identified in the hot list for each business unit
the performance of your group is key to making our targets for q0 and to meet budgeted origination performance for the year
independent of specific budgets for the groups
the origination organization needs to generate $0m for q0
ultimately
a strong performance in q0 by the origination organization will help build momentum into the year-end prc
i will be setting up time with each of you to go through your numbers and specifics on the deals

i would like your opinion on this potential transaction
this has been sold through ge for some time and it is reasonably likely that if we employed some additional resources that this could be completed over the next quarter or so
ultimately
rodney and his team would like to see ees take control of the deal with eim folks staying involved to ensure continuity and to assist to closure
assuming that the sales process is largely completed
i see some value for enron to take this deal including
c
ge on our ees resume of companies which will help in future sales to the large industrial customers
and d
provides an
in
to the ge family of companies which could result in significant up-sell capability in the future if we provide a quality product

i don't think that janet would mind letting them nominate this person
if i am incorrect janet let me know

what is the cost basis in these turbines
regards delainey
marty
no agenda on this one at all
given
the change in enron industrial markets towards building the paper and steel commodity markets and less so on the outsourcing product
i just wanted your opinion on whether this is a deal we should do especially given the sales cycle is largely completed
i believe that rodney and his team want to finish this deal but given other priorities they would like to transition the deal to ees
ultimately
the value
tcv
earnings
up-sell
resume
would benefit enron more in ees than regards delainey
rodney
from what you told me it sounds like ge is willing to play on the selkirk asset so the sales cycle should be largely completed
can you answer marty's other questions
regards delainey
ken
i have taken a look at the material you had sent me on the arc northern gas pipeline route
ultimately
i believe that arc is looking for certain strategic investors to provide founding capital to fund the development of this proposal
to the extent that this is a open access non-discriminatory pipe
ena's opportunity lies in being a shipper to capitalize on basis markets or customer transactions that provide attractive risk reward characteristics
other than understanding the potential flows and costs
there is probably not much we need to do today given a 0 start from an ena point of view
the arc consortium needs to fund approximately $0m to develop this project
the us and canadian aboriginal groups will receive 0% ownership for $0m
the remaining $0m and 0% will be funded by a group of producers
pipelines
venture capital and the
organizing group
0%
stan horton
if he believes this is a commercial possibility
may want to provide a few million of founding capital to the venture in order to preserve him the option to participate as an equity holder or operator if this becomes a reality
regards delainey

what is your plan
regards delainey

thanks for the letter on friday
the team is preparing an analysis on where we have flexibility and preparing a response
we should be able to respond before the end of the week
thanks dave delainey
eric
as per my discussion with rob
i believe that the site has the most value to us given its location and capability
i would continue to actively develop that site for a variety of turbine technologies
as far as the turbines
i would probably exit them in the most opportune manner
regards delainey
guys
joe sutton had passed down an opportunity that probably fits your capabilities better than ours
in a nutshell
a consultant on retainer by mass
general hospital in boston
part of the healthcare partners system
is desiring a steam and electric contract
the steam load could be as high as 0,0 pd of steam and 0 mw of power
i think they are very open to an energy partner to manage all their needs perhaps including the six or seven other hospitals that hp controls in the nation
the consultants name is joe petrowski
0
0-0
i spoke to him yesterday afternoon and promised that one of you would be in contact
joe is a big fan of enron's and could see the logic of a more robust product like the full energy outsourcing versus just a steam agreement
it may be a good lead into the health care segment
regards delainey
guys
attached you will find the final plan to meet our origination targets for q0 consistent with our discussions
it is important that we hit our numbers in order for enron to meet its targets for the year
regards delainey

if this deal is such a long put why did you push me into this process
you should have made the call to kill it

i would let this fish go
he has been through the organization too many times

short of me coming up with the money
it will be next to impossible to get this out of either the trading or origination group
as a significant contributor to the pac and enron's other adventures

personally
i also have difficulty making campaign contributions so closely linked to specific legislation or policy
this may not be the answer you want
however
i am all ears if you have any ideas on raising these funds

i am not completely sure what the other groups want to do
however
assuming a fixed amount of the
internal
legal costs are fairly represented by this allocation as ena's
capacity
charge
you are correct
this number will be in the p/l under your name
the
outside
legal costs should be tracked and controlled and carried at the business unit
by deal
level
i need an estimate of the quarterly
capacity charge
for ena and an estimate of outside legal costs by business unit

lets get together in the next week or so to discuss progress
in the meantime
what are we doing with regard to ferc 0 to ensure that we have favourable rules in the trading of natural gas transportation capacity
do we have a master summary of the rto proposals submitted last week
regards delainey
barry
i have not spoken to whitt yet
working on this week
i would suggest that you will need to get a few bright managers/associates to manage the mid-market and a couple of more experienced originators
internal or external
to complement
i would start thinking about how to get that done
i would call oxley for help if needed
regards delainey
jim
i would start focusing some attention on gas at this point
when we get together i would like to sit down and go through a number of organizational re-alignments and what we may want to do on the regulatory front to support those businesses
regards delainey
guys
i spoke with mark this morning
he is very supportive of the structure and idea
i had indicated that he would continue to run the producer services business in the west but would also be part of the overall team as we plot out strategy in the west
he wants to stay in denver which i think we should be able to accomodate as long as his group stays integrated into the overall team
i had indicated that we would consolidate market making into houston and paul lucci could decide if he wants to continue trading or not
if so he needs to move to houston

colleen
thanks for the update
as another part of the nat gas value chain
traded transportation
with and without eol should be a priority
however
i think we have to ensure that we have rules and procedures accepted by the ferc that will allow the market to work
jim

thanks
regards delainey

regards delainey
jim

assets
pool structures
regulatory and political environment
currency and credit challenges
supply and demand
historical prices and volumes
b

and d
brief review of other s
american markets
i assume that you will have the argentines to brazil for the discussion and any one else you think appropriate
let me know what i need to do otherwise
thanks regards delainey
david
thanks for the people listing
wes
we need 0 and 0
including ce
esa income statements for each market in as much detail as possible
looking for un-necessary overheads and where the income brightspots lie
we would probably need the esa 0 budget
income
expense
cashflow and capital
for the trading/marketing/ees business and the asset/regulated business in seperate formats
a current balance sheet would be helpful as well
i think it may be appropriate for both of you to join us
you need to get your visa issues worked out quickly
kay can help
regards delainey
fran

regards delainey
sound good mark
pls
forward these to tammy sheppherd to incorporate in the ena ooc reports

i have attached a preliminary agenda which has you speaking to the group right after dinner the night of december 0th
you have no time constraint on the length of your talk
ie
whatever you find find appropriate in order to get your message across
i though it might be interesting for you to give your vision of enron's 0 goals
objectives and strategy
as well
a brief business overview of ees
ebs and networks may be valuable in building connections
regards delainey
gregg
please send a hard copy
the pdf file can not be opened on ena systems in houston
thanks delainey
steve
great letter and arguement
i think the more public we can be on this one the better
thanks dave
guys
can you help phillip out with this
i assume this has something to do with the 0/0 deal
i believe a reserve should have been set up for this payment which was only designed to ensure that the transaction was accretive to nbpl
regards delainey
wow
if haug spent more time making money than created bull
in the company we would be a $0 stock
on a different note
i was wondering if someone in your shop could map the current a&a process from planning for on-campus recruitment to manager promotion for the typical associate including timeline
this process mapping should be very detailed to give us the greatest insight
i think radical change is not the answer
the answer lies in a combination of a
slight changes in process
b
increasing participation/ownership at key points in the process by certain business units and people
and c
a credible key business spokesman or spokespersons co-opting the other units where necessary and providing the commercial leadership and representation for the program internally
overall this is a commercial program that needs to meet commercial objectives
the closer to the front the better
the goals of any restructuring are
a
eliminate the perception that the program is not receptive to the business units needs or any bu's perception that they lack ownership for the program
b
increase the quality of the recruits that are brought in and retained
c
ensure we have the best people in the organization recruiting
selling and interviewing
d
ensure that we have the best commercial training program that firmly grounds the associate in the
enron technology
which include skills in market understanding
structuring
finance
logistics and risk
e
ensure the business units have the ability to identify the outstanding talent early and give those people the responsibility necessary to move them up the curve quickly
ie
quickly identify the whalley/lavorato's in the program and
on the flip side
quickly deal with clear non-performance issues
f
review the effectiveness of the current prc process as a development
retention and performance tool
g
incorporate mid-year flexibility
internet recruiting techniques
non-traditional sources of talent and h
increase cost effectiveness
the solutions may include mandated participation by certain business units
people and teams
business tracks
etc
i think a thorough process mapping/tracking can identify
or help me see
the key spots for change/modification/ownership that reach these goals with the least amount of wholesale change for the sake of change
i think we need to get back to jeff not next week but the following week with a strawman
let me know your thoughts
regards delainey
john
this is a skilling issue
charlene and myself are going to talk to him about several changes in the next couple of weeks
regards delainey
rob
lets discuss
regards delainey
chris
rob milnthorp will give you a call to further discuss the opportunity
i would suggest that you find a day over the next couple weeks to meet rob in calgary to speak in detail about the role
the market and expectations
i appreciate your openess and let me know how i can help
the ontario market is one of the best new market opportunities for ena over the next year
regards delainey
tim
i would argue that we should pursue this business as long as a
we are being adequately compensated for the financing and underlying commodity risk
b
we have very good paper
c
we are dealing with solid credits and are charging an appropriate risk adjusted cost of capital for the underlying financing
d
we have the ability to syndicate the capital or funds flow position if needed to manage cash issues and e
that rac is comfortable that we are reaching these goals
any imbedded financing or $0m or more should be dashed
david
joe and mark should be your key contacts to ensure we are adequately managing these issues but i do not see any fatal flaw in the strategy if priced/managed well and we watch the funds flow issues
regards delainey
chris
the numbers are getting pretty large
we are trying to find a reasonable cut-off before this turns into an all-employee meeting at the hyatt
john and i decided to cut it off based upon who will be wearing large visable budgets
in the west
that includes tim/mike for trading
chris/greg for mid market and yourself for origination
i hope this rationale will manage your issues
if we invite jake i think you do have to invite parquet and mcdonald and we just don't have the room
lets discuss
regards delainey
rob
independent of dotted/solid lines
you already have the primary and complete responsibility to manage the office and the business
at the risk of being bold
i think the undercurrent of your note and your discussions with haedicke over the last couple of days is a matter of absolute control
ownership and passion are important characteristics of our best commercial people but so is fostering a diversity of opinions and ideas
with the back and mid office
the current enron model is based upon scale and standardization which generates tremendous operating leverage
further
it helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue
in the long-run
it is actually less costly
ie
systems that don't work together
less transferable human capital
un-managed legal risks
etc
a lot of your points are very valid and haedicke has never and never will get in the way of managing commercial business
however
mark
wes
sally
beth et al have a mandate to provide a flexible
scalable but standardized delivery mechanism
that manages our risk across the broad empire
don't quit protecting the business and your people
however
please help accomplish some of these goals as well
in short
i would like to keep the reporting structures the same
lets take the earliest opporunity to discuss this
regards delainey
great job guys
keep it coming
regards delainey
great job
we all appreciate your management of the situation
the a&a program is our most important asset
regards delainey
jane
we would like to go the adjustment of status route
regards delainey
i stand corrected
we need to dash everything over $0k
regards delainey
mark
fyi and between you and i
rob will always do the right thing
he is just a little more passionate than the average enron guy
keep trying to build those bridges
regards delainey
chris
fyi
guys
great job
the canadian office is still the model

kay

thxs regards delainey
dorie

as well
please ensure that both kevin and i sign off on the filing before it goes out

guys
i would like you to consider the following people to provide the basis of your producer marketing team

good memo
regards delainey
ike
sorry for the delay
it took us longer to deal with certain issues than expected
i have faxed you a proposal
lets discuss at your earliest convenience
regards dave delainey
guys
attached you will find a final cut on the ena 0 expense budget
please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are appropriate to hit the net ena target
in order to stay flat year on year
i split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups
as we had discussed earlier
these costs will not be allocated to the business units and will be tracked on the ena income statement below the line and the accountability managed by each of you
all outside variable costs
specifically related to specific deals
will be charged to the business units eg
outside legal and tax
outside technical expertise
facility costs
outside research support
incremental back and mid office support for specific asset management deals
specific entertainment
etc
i look at this cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business and evaluate/manage our risks
wes
can you please finalize the one page plan
expenses and headcount
for each group with these changes
regards delainey
dan
any help would be appreciated
we are very well positioned in the florida market at this point
regards delainey
tim
lets not worry about margin at this point
we are trying to get a handle on headcount and direct expenses/capital charge first
you will have your day in court to discuss margin soon
regards delainey
mike
duly noted
however
there will be at this point no change in the scope and function of redmond's group
thanks delainey
guys
i noticed that the corporate tax allocation to ena has more than doubled from 0 forecast to 0 plan ie
$0,0,0 from $0,0
could you please explain
our goal which is being met in ena's direct expense groups is to remain flat year or year from 0 to 0
regards delainey
david
i don't know if you are the right person to speak with
however
i am looking for detail to explain the substantial increase in insurance related cost allocations to ena for 0
we have been given allocation projections that increase our expense from $0.0m to $0.0m
i would like to know how this was determined and the nature of these costs
ie
what assets/positions
if you are not the right person
i apologize for the intrusion and could you please pass this on to the right spot
regards dave delainey
steve
i noticed that our allocation from 0 to 0 is going up by 0% year on year
ie
$0.0m from $0.0m
we have been able to keep ena's direct group expenses flat year on year
we are trying hard to keep the corporate allocation flat year to year as well
do you have a view on how we might be able to achieve this goal
regards delainey
kay
see when this is and if i can go
regards delainey
keep pushing these guys
regards delainey
ken
i think we should pass on the sponsorship of this event
if you have a different view
lets discuss at your earliest convenience
thanks delainey
jim
is there executive summaries for the following
a
eastern interconnect investigation by region

kay
can you please try to organize asap

janet
please have someone draft up a short speech for this function
regards delainey
chris
sounds good
a
wes will work with you on earnings recognition issues for pastoria and b
selling the lm's and the lv cogen asset is a good call regardless of the hit
some accounting flexibility on the lv hit may be worthwhile
value protected counts just as much as new value created
you are doing the right thing
regards delainey
thanks susan regards delainey
rob
we are planning to file the following protest of hq's behaviour in the ne power markets through their market based rates case with the ferc

tammy sheppard and dorie hitchcock will coordinate and do a lot of the heavy lifting
however
they need your first cut by december 0th
thanks delainey
milly is ok
however
i would like a quick read of the document once you send a hard copy up
regards delainey
beth
can you start putting together your presentation for the offsite
you have approximately one hour
topic should focus on the 0 ena systems plan
ie
what are identified priorities
key maintenance
new iniatives and maybe your view of where we need to go in the future
i would leave some time for questions
the audience should come away from the meeting with a pretty good understanding of what is our systems agenda for ena in 0
could you have a first cut by december 0th
tammy sheppard and dorie hitchcock can do some of the heavy lifting
regards delainey
working it
guys
can you start working on your presentations for the offsite
dave i would like you to focus on the new generation of capital products that you are working on for the ipp market which should be able to source short and medium term commodity liquidity and be syndicatable
on the capital side
go into some detail and speak to a couple of specific opportunities
it may also be interesting for you to give an initial cut on the economics of coal generation
including emissions control
given current power and gas markets and a quick view of the development process
how should we participate in this market
gasification technology
jeff
in your talk
can you focus on the emerging distributed generation sector ie
the technologies
the users
the vc's
etc
specifically
how will these technologies change our business model and the overall power business model
how are we positioning ourselves in this market
what is the pi strategy with this regard
dorie hitchcock and tammy sheppard can do a lot of the heavy lifting
however
we need a first cut by december 0th
thanks delainey
joe
has jeff rubin confirmed his availability on december 0th from 0:0 to 0:0pm to give us a macro-economic overview
regards delainey
rick
i need your view on which of these deals need to go through the board
tex mex
ercot to mexico transmission line with term ppa with desarco
crra/fuel cell energy
fuel cell deal with conn
regulators
sale of pastoria and lv cogen
assume not
sale of ecp
assume not
sale of hpl
assume not
regards delainey
fyi
shawn
just a little buried
why don't you come by on monday
kay please schedule
regards delainey
steve
what is the status
regards delainey
tim
sorry for the delay
lets talk if you think it is warranted
i can see a lot of positives to take this path
however
there are a
pr issues and b
we have hoards of on-going litigation that cost us a bundle
we should make this decision very carefully
regards delainey
jim
my understanding is that there continues to be some discussion on whether there will be functional seperation of the retail and wholesale businesses and to what extent and under what strategy these are undertaken
i am not sure that we want to put ourselves in a box under any structure until these things are completely ironed out eg
country managers et al
i'm not in agreement with any memo that further details the organization beyond what was outlined in the original memo
however
i am in agreement that this needs to get resolved asap unfortunately frevert and skilling and most of the first world is out this week
i ask for your patience
lets discuss
regards delainey
mark
fyi
in my estimation this business is no bigger than mexico or the toronto business ie
$0 to $0m in real value with reasonably high risk
i see no value in having two different agendas being pushed in s
america
i also believe that we could cut overhead and right size the organization and not loose any capability
early estimations are a reduction in budgeted oh by at least a third to one-half
did you or jeff speak with jim
regards delainey
ken
in response to the letter from mr miguel san juan
my suggestion would be to offer up the falcon for their use
however
given the tight time frame and your recent visit with mr
fox that it would be difficult for either you or me to participate
i spoke to max and he agrees with this approach
i hope this meets with your approval
regards delainey
guys
wes is going to come talk to you about booking more value in mariner in order to meet global finance and ena targets
i want a view from you guys of what is the prudent carry value for mariner assuming current gas prices and the reserve increases assumed to coming
keep in mind what would be a reasonble sale value for the asset mid-next year as per our plan
regards delainey
dave
i am going to send shawn your way
he has extensive development
asset and project finance experience
i would like him under your supervision to manage our coal power development strategy
like we discussed it could be a very robust strategy with multiple exit points
i strongly believe that coal needs to come back into the stack and that the existing development teams
parquet
jacoby
are already buried under mid-stream gas development opportunities
this would incorporate acquisitions
development
technology
asset sales
emissions credits
technology
fuel supply and power sales
please update your 0 budget to incorporate this new iniative
regards delainey
jeff
can you spend a little time thinking about the current north american energy markets
very high energy prices
stretched infrastructure
etc
and determine which game changing or altering technologies
business models or existing corporate positions that will benefit from such price and volatility levels
in particular
i think that miller should take a look at coal gasification technologies
emissions technologies and dsm/efficiency technologies and how these investments may fit in the charter or our overall business
as well
from a corporate development point of view which parts of the value chain ie
ipp
e&p
utility
assets
etc are undervalued given current commodity curves and expectations
can you get back to me with a few ideas in the next week or so
maybe it would help to go pick a few brains in various ena orgs as part of your process
regards delainey
sorry mike wrong address
guys
lets get together to get final resolution to these issues including the peaker fee asap
regards delainey
jean
can you give me an update on q0 from an earnings point of view ie
deals and value
regards delainey
rob
can you give me a view on where you stand for fourth quarter from an orig point of view ie
deals and value
regards delainey
guys can you give me a view on q0 earnings ie
deals and value
regards delainey
ken
in response to your note
i am not aware of any official dialogue with mr
kase lawal about a potential sale of mariner or with the economics of the aborted ipo
his $0 m valuation may have been appropriate 0 to 0 months ago
however
mariner has enjoyed a series of successful wells that are expected to be booked in reserve reports next march not to mention significant increases in gas and oil prices
our current valuations
in the $0m range is a stretch target but not incredibly out of line given reserve growth and current energy prices
our current goal
is to be able to demonstrate three to four quarters of increasing operating cashflow and reserves growth before attempting a private sale mid next year to a significant e&p concern that desires an offshore division
the concentration
operating and exploration risk implicit in mariner make it a very poor ipo candidate
ie
i'm not sure that an ipo was ever a viable strategy to maximize the exit value
i would recommend that we not meet to make the following points
a
mariner is not on the market at this point in time and b
his un-solicited offer does not warrant serious attention
otherwise
we would be glad to speak to him in the future if we decide to sell tha asset
i hope this meets with your approval
regards delainey
guys
there is quite a number of us dealing with this problem
what are our solutions
could we have a corporate jet available for folks stuck in the a&a prc
other
regards delainey
shawn
if you are in
i would like you to work with dave duran on this item
he currently manages the ena ipp group and the qf restructuring group
i would like to manage this under dave and your leadership
he has created a lot of businesses and value in ena over the years and can help
let me know regards delainey
rob can you give om a call
regards delainey
shawn
go ahead and give dave a call to discuss strategy
resources and approach
regards delainey
lou
are there concerns that i am not aware
from an economic point of view
it is clearly not in our interest to aggregate residential or small customers who have retail choice
however
standard office service
like the ui deal
is clearly a customized
wholesale/all
requirements sale of significant size negotiated with the utility and the puc
regards delainey
rob
thanks for the update
i am assuming that you will come up with $0m cdn
$0m usd
highly likely
with pml
we do not have recorded in the financial statements the $0m cdn in done deals
you may want to look into that
we need the money to show up given every other enron group is flaking
bail me out my friend
regards delainey
jim
i really don't see a need for this meeting
you can count on us not dropping the ball
i have a good understanding of the retail product offering
in fact
we lead the outsourcing sales process for the large industrial customers in na until ees bought back their minority shareholders
i have a very good relationship with dan leff and sunde
i already have dan's committment to help service the execution of the business initially
as it grows and the product proves itself out we can staff
regards delainey
dorie
i have to question the effectiveness of this program
over the years
it appears that more spots are being filled by enron people then customers
the effectiveness of this forum from a customer point of view is questionable
i vote to kill it
please forgive the approach
but i would like to provoke a discussion with my partners
regards delainey
fyi
rebecca
if you wouldn't mind i would like to sit in on the monday meeting
i think that mariella from what i have seen and heard is very capable
i strongly believe that we need to put a dedicated
with fresh eyes
swat team on this one that has control of the complete commercial
technical and financial aspects of this project
this is the only way to be effective
whether it is with you or me or both
i am indifferent i would like to ensure that kishkill
wiggs
gonzales and alberquerque are not buried in this project given other goals and objectives
thanks regards delainey
pretty quiet on the ecogas/kafus front
whats up
regards delainey
mark
i really don't think we need to have this all hands mtg
in particular i don't want to drag lou into this discussion again

sorry for the delay
lots going on including low value add in board meetings and prc's
lets set up this discussion with the following points
a
we are not exiting argentina
b
we need to right-size the overall organization to fit the business opportunity
c
if possible on the commercial front
i would like to consolidate intellectual assets to one location in order to generate greater productivity
increased team work
a flatter org chart
real time decision making and greater communication
d
we need to continue to maintain a strong presence
including customer coverage
in both markets including an office in argentina
and e
i would like to consolidate all non-commercial activity for esa to sao paulo
ultimately
i would like a very flat
commercially focused trading and origination organization
given limited resources
that prioritizes resources based on the highest value transactions independent of geography
retail vs wholesale or development vs commodity
however
i want to keep a strong presence in both markets and understand the language
political and cultural issues
i may be asking for my cake and eat it too
however
i believe that you guys will find the balance
there is no need for you to leave argentina
its up to you
joe and orlando to determine consistent with the business model we are trying to move forward
propose to me a plan that manages your concerns but gets us as close to these ideals as possible at a cost that is reasonable
please work with joe and orlando as part of this process
regards delainey
guys
here are the details on the esa meh turbines

whats up
dave
brett
since enron owns nepco
true risk transfer under a fixed price contract is difficult
however
i do like the behaviour that you get from such accountability
ie
high incentive to get done on time and on budget
my experience with nepco on cost plus has been very unfavourable
don't like #0
i will be supportive of any structure that aligns our interests appropriately
you might want to bounce a few ideas off dan
i have already given him a heads up on the value at stake if we can come in at the low end of the scale and early
drop me a note on where you end up

john and i appreciate the support you and your group have provided
regards delainey
eric
as per our discussion
i would suggest that we have no quotes or comments in the press release
as a sale of assets
which we do actively
in a our network strategy there is really nothing positive that can be said without reflecting poorly on the buyer
i would suggest that we approve an aep press release as we did with allegheny
if we have not already
i would not send the attached press release to aep without cutting out the quote
regards delainey
rebecca
sorry for the delay
i think that chris calger who runs our western development efforts would be very interested
chris please give rebecca a call

regards delainey
jim
i can assure you that neither john or myself are trying to attract blame or
cover our backsides
however
i do believe that there is/was a genuine breakdown in communication somewhere in the deal team
accounting and the desk
as well
it appears that this is not completely a black and white issue and can legitimately attract a number of points of view
as executives of this company
you
brian
tim and tom absolutely were responsible to ensure that all aspects of this transaction are managed correctly
nevertheless
i think it is amazing we have not had more problems with this divestment given the size
complexity
time and how intertwined it is into the overall framework of ena
i appreciate your candor and the unselfish maturity to bring to the trading floor
i look forward to working with you as we continue to build our texas and gas business
regards delainey
what is this
regards delainey
would this guy be a candidate for the ltp
regards delainey
get rid of this please
brian
good memo
i think you mean't energy capital resources not enron capital resources in your memo
i would distribute widely in the management ranks
regards delainey
guys
given all the change and our 0 success
i would argue that we should have a meeting
however
the challenge is getting people to show up
any thoughts on this eric/dorie
regards delainey
george
it was good to hear from you
please follow up with david oxley to determine possible roles within ena
regards delainey
jean
the $0m was a negotiated settlement between me and marty rosenberg of several old disputes as we moved forward in the restructuring of the independence plant earlier in the year
ruth added little other than administrative support
regards delainey
mike
as a policy offsites and retreats
especially more exotic and expensive
are being discouraged
i would prefer the galveston offsite and i don't see a need for more than one per year
please manage through pr
dorie hitchcock
she will require an agenda as part of the approval process
i would encourage some significant work discussion to be part of the offsite
if you have some concerns lets discuss
regards delainey
scud incoming
guys
i am in complete agreement on the strategy
this has been discussed for some time
dave duran and his group have distinct goals to move this strategy forward in 0
regards delainey
dave
we need to get this moving before the coal group starts occupying the space
regards delainey
can we realistically net transmission costs against ctc undercollections for ees
if there is a credible argument we should discuss
regards delainey
mark
you should be there if possible
regards delainey
guys
i can't recall how the corporate opportunity is managed between canada and the us for these customers particularily with regard to their transactions in michigan et al
is eastern canada now managed by the central desk from a trading and mid-market point of view since story came down to houston
how are the structured deals managed
is this still the right split for the business
regards delainey
kay please send regrets
i think i am in canada
regards delainey
hey
rob try and keep under $0k us
regards delainey
rob
if you and dave think this is your best branding opportunity in the short run as we gear up i am supportive

send me a towel
regards delainey
yes
kay
please ensure that her expense statements are signed by me
regards delainey
kyle

i'm not the sharing type

where do we stand with tom and the replacement combustion systems

ken
i'm a lowly piker but i will try to help
regards delainey
john
what do you want to do with this
we had discussed but i wanted to follow up
regards delainey
kevin
the only thing to keep in mind are the patent issues on the dln
the ge settlement prevents psm from re-manufacturing any further
tainted
product including spares for the existing dln system
how might this affect our reliability at peak times
regards delainey
ok
your call
do we have some spares available if needed
regards delainey
guys
i do not have any material that brian
tim or wes would not have in their files

janet dietrich
john thompson
jeff donahue
kay chapman david
greg told me that you were going to create a master list of reviews/reviewers to be completed to ensure that the wholesale ooc's catches all commercial and non-commercial direct reports
i would suggest that we follow up with a master list for each business unit to ensure that all reviews are completed across ena much like the process we undertook at mid-year
i would shoot for 0% participation target
how are we making out on the nim/issues folks in ena
either out the door or completed plans
regards delainey
jeff
i assume that you are doing lydecker
maffitt and detmering's review
thanks dave
janet
if you are ok
i'm ok
we usually only sign these type of non-solicitations
stand-stills or non-competes if we are well down the road towards having a reasonable probability to completing a transaction with the counterparty
otherwise
it becomes a nightmare to manage all these
i will leave it to your discretion
regards delainey
dan
sounds like we are moving backwards
but these guys tend to jump the gun at times
if it is not possible for these orgs to work together lets not try and force them
ie
we will manage our own business and contract with nepco when and if it makes sense
regards delainey
guys
do we have enough var to bring this position into the book
if over $0m in total exposure it has to go to frevert/whalley
john
i assume that you have gone through the transaction and have approved
regards delainey
wes
do you have the first cut
john you need to have some input
regards delainey

the calme organization does not exist so it might be difficult to negotiate a transfer price
we need to just do the right thing for enron
if you think you are getting stuffed economically then i would work a deal out with lavo or whalley
regards delainey
dan
should we put more meat on this bone
regards delainey
fyi
ken we may want you to speak to peevey and freeman
i believe that discussion should frame the proposal and attempt to set up a meeting with his staff and advisors to answer questions about credit and documentation
in the propsal
we have tried to frame the potential credit and legal holes in their rfp with our suggested language or documents
it would be helpful for the commercial team in ena/ees to meet with these gentlemen and their advisors to describe the proposal and perhaps move towards negotiating a transaction
the proposal includes
a
traded power products of various sizes and terms
b
unit contigent tolls from pastoria
0mw
and las vegas cogen
0mw
for term
c
natural gas packages for size for one through five year terms to provide gas hedges for their qf portfolio or other contracted merchant toll contracts

dave is forming an office of the chairman in ees
joining dave
in the office of the chairman
will be marty sunde
as president
global marketing services and dan leff
as president
global energy services
dan and marty have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful ees business model
in addition
janet dietrich will join the office of the chairman as chief operating officer
currently
janet is managing director in enron americas where she had successfully led both trading and origination organizations
regards delainey
john
i asked brian to investigate taking a number of esa's engineering folks into his central technical services group
these folks would continue to work on esa's projects but would get the resources and support of the centralized body particularily in their negotiations with outside vendors including nepco and oec
it would also be another linkage into the samerican business from houston to help monitor and defray technical and development risk
lets see if kishkill and redmond get to the right answer
regards delainey
fyi

however
i take full responsibility

my understanding is that you have been a significant contributor to ees strategy and success
you can count on a lot more discussion about which markets and products are core in the few weeks and you will be leading a market opportunity
i have asked kay to set up some time for us to discuss the market and the future next week

it is my understanding that this investment is currently in ray bowen's business
in my ena shoes
i would say we would have no interest in taking on that responsibility
in my ees shoes
i would like to take a closer look at the possible connections
please send me some info on the investment fund and their current investments portfolio
i have also heard that tom white has been talking to you about ees taking on the catalytica investment
with my ees shoes on
no way
regards delainey
i'm sorry bob

bob
please give me an update on our progress on this item and the viability of the technology
regards delainey
matthew
janet and i are going to come your way before march 0th
i'll give you a call to discuss further
couple of points
i would hope you would share with your group on monday
the european retail business is an important and strategic focus for enron and ees
it encompases a material part of ees's and enron europes margin plan for 0
so execution and most probably over performance is key in 0
it was birthplace of one of the key ees distribution platforms that needs to be migrated to north america
enron direct and the itol structure
for the large industrial customer
the european business is one of the largest growth opportunities going forward for ees and ees management will recognize
resource and reward that effort
i am very involved in business strategy
execution and deals
i believe in open communication
performance and high performance teams
no bullshit politics
i recognize and reward performance
thinking
execution and leadership
i flourish in a culture of ideas
fast action and success
and i will be visiting london to meet everyone probably late february early march
ps
i am already a citizen of the commonwealth
talk to you soon
regards delainey
mike
please let brian know if there is a problem and let him rectify
it is difficult for me to be responsive otherwise
thanks dave
hey crystal hope things are well
dawna is fine
we have two girls six
kassandra
and four
samantha
we have been in houston now three and half years
it has been a good move from a career point of view
obviously
you had heard my move from pres./ceo of enron north america to chair/ceo of ees
i hope life has been as kind to you
best of luck in the future
regards delainey
matthew
if you know my reputation
i tend not to be a big fan of these type of events either
however
at this point
i need to collect more information on the event and i think it inappropriate to cancel at this late stage
going forward
i think we as a management team including yourself should discuss what the strategy should be going forward
don't hesitate to voice your opinion
regards delainey
matthew
sounds fine
i will have kay start managing the calendar
regards delainey
chris
i would get mark or louise involved at this point
if it is mission critical let me know
regards delainey
no
joe
i will forward his voice mail to you
ees has enough challenges in na and europe before tackling retail products and services in a market with no wholesale market
please follow up
thanks delainey
david
i'm not sure there is any value to this for ees north america
there are well known and documented controls and process issues in the mid
back and risk offices of the company
we are working quickly to rectify
servicing your needs at the same time would slow us down
on the european side
i would like your perspective on their controls and business

thanks rick by the way
jcp is being restructured or killed

thxs ben
i'm sure our paths will cross again
best of luck

ken
fyi regards dave
thanks chris
i assume you are speaking about credit risk on the thirty day deal when you refer to the $0m exposure on $0
has tim spoken to john about this
i am supportive of this proposal and approach
like our discussion
we have to find a way to be supportive to the re-development of this market without creating un-acceptable credit or market losses
we also have to support lay's efforts in california
regards delainey
sherri
i will be there

peggy
the last version i read was fine
regards delainey
kay
are we in london during this event
regards delainey
vicki
how much $$ are we talking about for the bankruptcy and the class action suit
it does not seem inappropriate for us to share the bankruptcy costs given the ctc issue
i agree with you on the class action suit
lets discuss further before we approach ena
regards delainey
kay
please ensure i get to this
dave
kay
i forwarded a message to you from sheri sierra from a gentleman looking for energy mgt services in japan

just practicing apathy
regards delainey
all yours
just send it out to the affected parties
fyi
ray
in ees
the construction services
also known as efs
companies operate on a stand alone basis from enron and have clear liquidation value to the parents
ees and enron corp
it is my opinion that we should be trying to
un-buckle
these companies from enron over the short term to ensure their continued viablility as we find a sale
in my view un-buckling means a
stop the factoring of any construction services receivables that end up moving cash out of construction services up into the parents
b
utilizing those receivables plus
if necessary
enron's interest in construction services to obtain sufficient collateral to renew the st
paul surety bond
this surety bond is necessary to continue contracting
and c
terminate the sweeping of cash from construction services bank accounts to corp immediately
there will be a meeting early next week with st paul to renew the surety bond
i am hopeful that meeting these conditions will be enough to reinstate the surety bond
the construction services group employs approximately 0,0 people and is worth
given current backlog
between $0 and $0 million dollars
mark and his team are actively trying to sell over the next 0 to 0 days and we control 0% of the stock of this company
the other part half of the former efs is the facility services group
also know as serviceco
again
these companies largely operate independently of enron and have going concern value outside of enron
currently
we have outside technology and financial partners in the facility services groups that make it impossible to factor receivables or move cash out of facility services bank accounts without the approval of the board which includes several outside directors
we currently own approximately 0% of the firm that employs approximately 0,0 people and is worth minimum $0 million dollars
cash value
mark and his team are actively trying to sell or otherwise dispose over the next 0 to 0 days
ees also manages several joint ventures
dsm and o&m related mostly
with customers where we would have to have outside approvals to move cash out of these entities
these include owens corning energy llc
owens corning
le hesten energy llc
lily
tenant services inc
simon properties
ebc property llc and enron distributed energy services llc
in all cases
we need to be observant of corporate governance issues with these entities
as officers
i thought it prudent to ensure that you and your team had all available information
i would also like your approval to move forward with my recommendations for the construction services group as above
we appreciate everything you are doing
regards dave delainey
pls approve
ok
guys
the plan,as i am currently aware
a
gas
as per our conversation this am
press on
b
power
start with the california customers post june and the enron direct books
c
follow on with the rest of the power book once we are getting traction on
b
above
thanks dave
oz
where are you on the wip dsm
buckets
dave
wade
you need to give george and ray more texture ie
we lose $0m in value
in active sale mode that looks promising and we buy enron ten days with new york iso
been approved by rogers herndon
risk
and dave delainey regards delainey
jeff
possible buyer
what are we doing with the nepool book
are we selling
regards delainey
dick
thanks for the e-mail
i don't think i disagree with any of the points you made and i do think we have come a long way over the last year in the dsm
technology
we employ
unfortunately
a lot of these changes in thinking
sales and cost structure are too little too late
it is highly unlikely at this point that ees will exist beyond next week
all the best in the future and i would like to personally thank you for your contribution
thought process and caring to the end to make your point
regards delainey
ray
as per your request see attached
the bottom line we will need approximately $0m for the month of december in order to maintain an asset worth approximately $0m
the vast majority 0%+ is prepaid energy which will be recovered from the customer
it is highly likely that we will be able to sell this book
guys
it would be great to be able to go off-site in two different locations for these guys but given the fact i had to personally buy the paper for copying the termination packages
i don't think there any funds to spend
perhaps there are empty offices in 0 allen
please look into
either way we need to ensure that these guys are fairly well seperated
i am waiting for a confidentiality from calpine and aep this am
regards delainey
ok to pay
court would have to approve any reduction or significant change that we would do outside the normal course of business
short answer probably no on the non-compete otherwise we are down to 0 people have at it
regards delainey
nerco is waiting
where are you dsm boy
nerco is waiting
i am now officially a blackberry addict
what's up
thanks mike
you can contact me at my enron number for the next couple of months otherwise at 0-0-0
dave
peter
i do not have a contact at rwe but if you need a reference let me know
you can continue to contact me at my enron phone over the next several weeks
best of luck dave
peter
i don't have any contacts at rwe
however
if you need a reference do not hesitate to give me a call
i will be at the enron number for the next several weeks
all the best in the future
regards delainey
thanks
hang in there guys
i'll come have a beer with you guys later
let me know where you might be
dave
what's going on
dave
guys
please ensure that this is handled
regards delainey
jen
probably done with ene early in the new year and then determine next steps
take care
regards dave
jen
no calls from sempra
i hear san diego is nice
dan
are you managing or do we need to discuss
regards delainey
jimmie
i assume that you and tracey are formulating the options and populating the detailed financials on those options for the board meeting next week
it would be great if we could see that a couple days in advance
david
we should probably call a follow up board meeting for next wednesday or thursday
vicki
we need to speak about the board participation issues and the cash management issues discussed
regards delainey
thanks judy
you are doing the right things and it is important
regards dave
kay
please set up a meeting to discuss in detail the lily transaction and next steps
tomorrow or the next day
regards delainey
kalen/dan
please provide guidance for scott and let me know
scott
we are pretty much in a bind on most of this
i will see what we can do
regards delainey
the knuckleheads still rule
we are still here waiting
dave
mike
i would agree with your point that we will be attempting to sell the services
dsm/o&m
currently provided by ees to hensen llc
other than a heads up to jimmie given the potential effects to ebsi
i am assuming that you and jeremy et al are managing the sale
given the amount of work in front of jimmie around efs generally
sale of constructionco and restructuring of serviceco
i would hope not to overload jimmie on another sale process
thoughts
regards delainey
what are we doing with rexam
regards delainey
david
i am ok anytime next wed or thursday
just let kay know
thxs regards delainey
jimmie
agree
however
ees cannot immediately convey these agreements to ebsi as a sub-contractor permanently post bankruptcy
under bankruptcy
we need to show an auction process
in the cases
where ebsi has contracted directly with the client
i think we are ok
vicki please add some texture if required
regards delainey
vicki
i would have janet
dan
jeremy
scott
regards delainey
mark
starting to move
have a few ideas
the natives are restless
when are you returning to the mother ship
regards delainey
don
can you go through your canadian gas book and let me know all the positions and customers
we are planning on putting enron energy services canada into bankruptcy and need to understand the contracts
regards delainey
thank you
deborah
i have received your letter dated december 0
0 and i will ensure that you get a follow up
to give you a little texture on the issues
all pre-petition expense statements
dec 0
0
were frozen subject to an overall approval by the bankruptcy court on what could be paid
at this point
we have approval to pay up to $0k immediately and possibly up to $0k per pre-petition expense statement
this part of the bankruptcy process
it is actually harder to get pre-petition expenses paid than post-petition
unless i have my facts wrong
you should have been paid already or are in the queue
either kalen or dan will follow up
if not please give me a call at 0-0-0
regards delainey
no bid for the barges
better technology in the market regardless of price
these puppies are going to be tough to move
regards delainey
thanks much guys
much appreciate it
have a good new year
dave
ok
by the way
there is no model
i just pull these numbers out of the air
sat sun
hey japhet did i ever get you the name of the wind guy at enron
i forget now
hi kate
sorry for not leaving my numbers
they are
hope you have a great thanksgiving and can't wait to catch up
love
coop
hey toby
sorry to hear about the layoffs
i think the hatchet falls around here next week
chris wiebe has been taking care of things here and interacting with houston a fair bit and i think he's been doing a great job with things
which is too bad since that means he forces me to play around in dev instead of prod
anyway
i hope we can enjoy a beer sometime and laugh about enron
but it doesn't feel too good right now
thanks for the note
nope
maybe ask greg or sebastien
definitely
sounds fun
hey karl
great to hear from you
someday we will talk
maybe today
not sure if you're still in
but i'm at my desk
number is 0 0 0 i believe it is the same country code as us
but not sure
it's been bad here at work for the last few weeks and its going to take awhile for things to get better
i'm just hoping it doesn't get any worse
it was very dicey for awhile
thought ene was going tits up
spanish desk sounds great
say hi to kristian and paul for me
but we should catch up by phone
if possible
so i'll leave it there
cooper p.s
snow is just falling on the mountains and i'm getting excited for some good skiing
the colonel was talking about meeting at lucky's on 0th and then head out
perhaps to the backalley
not a house party at all
how do you feel about a matinee
bitch
chris
can you roll this when you get a chance
cooper
ian
do you by chance have emily's
from earls
email address
she gave it to hawker and he lost it
no prob if you don't
thanks
hey greg
sorry to hear you're sick
hope you feel better soon
what will be involved in handing over the development of the client piece
excel
etc
of the eol feed to colin
i'd like to get this done as soon as possible
cooper
dbd::odbc works like a charm
if you're already using dbi
i don't think you'll have much trouble with the transition
assuming you're doing anything funky
excellent
really looking forward to dinner tomorrow
can you come over when its convenient
done
gotcha
hood river would be a sweet place to live for awhile
alberta's great
getting very cold here
but it's been puking in the mountains
so i'm looking forward to getting out skiing
etc
with the nosedive enron is taking
it's easy to blow out of work and head to banff
alberta just built a 0mw wind farm
doubling wind capacity in the region
with more on the way
should be over 0% of installed capacity for the region soon
have fun in mejico
looks like its 0 gs to go to kansas city or st louis
too far to miami
etc
i missed it that
yah
the brutal part is that i'm sure those planes are no where near full
there is a market surveillance summary for the alberta power pool at www.powerpool.ab.ca with some spark spread stuff in it
didn't look at it
but if you're still looking at spark spreads
it would validate your method
you're dumb
i'll be in this powerpool meeting from 0:0 to 0:0
no problems here
everything is fine
bitch
you'll get your 0 bones when i get a card with my name on it
you're dumb
looks like i'll be free for lunch
any interest
hi chris
i don't know where you're at with things
i've been impressed how you've handled both the databases and the people involved with databases and would be happy to provide you with a solid reference if you ever need one
please keep this to yourself as i don't feel this way about many people here
cheers
cooper
cell number is
0 0 but it's enron's phone
so
home number is 0 0 and cooper@llamacom.com should be a good place to reach me
as for me
i'm very unsure
i'm still technically a u.s
employee and my visa expires soon
so i really don't have any idea
worst case is i take a well-deserved vacation for awhile and worry about the rest later
cooper
hey mom
enron just cut to junk status
very bad for the company
thought i would give a call but don't have your number at work
send it if you get a chance
love
coop
hi
i graduated in 0 and need a copy of my degree as part of the application process for a visa in canada
can you point me in the right direction for this
thanks
cooper
if there's anything you want me to change
technologies to add
things to highlight
let me know
i guess not
i'll remove the c++
sounds good to me
got the fax
it looks like i made it in microsoft word
shouldn't need the hardcopies
thanks
will keep you in the loop on things
love
coop
definitely
what more could you ask for
definitely
i'm glad you want to talk more about it
are you going to be downtown this week at all
should know more on wed/thu in terms of enron canada's future
not really
i'm sure you've already been labeled a playboy
i feel you playboy
it depends how superficial and silly the men are there
my sense is that they aren't
but i don't know
any interest in a chapter's visit sometime soon
no relation that clip isn't the full one though
there's an amazing guitarist playing at the double mo cafe
the one my friend's wife owns
on friday night
ted williams
i've seen him before and he's incredible
i would call him a blues guitarist
but not sure
i think it starts at 0
is strings interested
hey
can you send me the last few of these
cooper
don't think so
he's pretty old
hey dude
i hear you're engaged
congratulations
what's going on
i haven't been in touch with anyone in the last year or so
things have been going well in canada
but my company is melting down
so not sure what i'm going to be doing and probably won't know for awhile
i'm going to be home dec 0
jan 0
are you going to be around
looking forward to catching up
coop
hey dude
what's new
i'm coming home dec 0
jan 0
are you planning on being around
be great to catch up on life
i haven't talked to anyone from hs in the last year or so
feeling lame and out of touch
i hear howard is engaged
things are going well for me
although job situation is somewhat uncertain at this point
i'm sure you've seen what's going on with enron
how's callisma and life in general
coop
hi dawn
haven't heard from you recently
have you received anything from houston for me
cooper
hi
i'm responding to an email sent by tim callahan on nov 0 regarding questions on tax equalization
i also left a voice-message for you
i'm in the calgary office and paid out of the u.s
i've been operating under the assumption that i wouldn't get hit twice on income taxes as there is a
credit
between canada and the u.s
however
after doing some reasearch on the irs website
it seems there may be a cap to the
credit
that is allowable
do you know anything about this
or can you point me to someone who might be knowledgeable in such matters
thanks
cooper richey
i wanted to run the curve fetcher for the last few days
i booted up the app
but it looks like i need to setup a db connection
can you send me the steps i need to run for the last few days
coop
it has to hook up unreal because it requires local admin rights
also
we don't have the disk anymore since colin left
so don't think we hook up anymore
unfortunately
marks on the way
sweet
yah
jimi told me about the party and i will definitely be there
i'm not happy about you deploying though dude
do you know what your role will be
definitely catch up when i'm back
i'd have to see them and they'd have to fit my shoes
but as long as the discount is in the 0-0% range
i'm cool with it
sounds good
you're done on the 0% discount
i'll just need a receipt and you're done
the burden of proof rests on your shoulders
i'm out
strings should put them on ebay
sweet
glad to hear things are going so well
yeah
things are ok here
it's more boring than anything
not sure what the future holds
bitch
you have to let me see them
i'm tired today
good night at earl's last night
your aggro-ness finally paid some fucking dividends
call me when you have a chance
something i want to share
hey tim
not sure what you guys are up to
likely making yourself pretty for potential investors
we're not quite at that point yet here
so things are very slow which has given me some time to look into r
been on my list for quite some time
it looks very good
have you had a chance to look into it
i'd like to verify that it's worth putting some time into
hope things are going well and i'll give a call to chat sometime soon
cooper
in case you didn't get this
i don't know what you mean
i'm just a dumb trader it's called double mo cafe
go to www.doublemo.cafe
yah
didn't feel like talking to you
felt like a pawn on your wheelin
chicks chessboard yesterday
we should talk later
don't want to get into it over email or on the phone
what's your number over there
just use same as yesterday
hey
sorry for the delay and thanks for thinking of me
i missed you at thanksgiving as well
canadians celbrate thanksgiving in october
but some friends had me over for
american
thanksgiving

i'm hoping to catch up with you and kt over the holidays
i'm planning on being on the east coast from dec 0
jan 0
mostly in northern va
are you going to be in bethesda at all
also planning a trip up to ny
yes
enron is in a bad way
i'm doing fine
but it hasn't been a pleasant month at work with layoffs and massive uncertainty about future of the company
i've resolved to not worry about it until the new year and it seems to be working
still planning on staying in calgary but who knows
let me know about your holiday plans
love
coop
final up-to-date version
everything look ok
does the enron direct data look correct
wanted to send you a reference to my dream girl scroll down to the julie osborn section i used to work with her in berkeley
hey
i don't have your phone number at work
i have some bad news
i'll be flying out 0 days later than i told you before
either my booking got screwed up or i never booked the flight
i think it got lost on the internet some where
but i can't even remember what airline it was on
so it's impossible for me to check
just booked a one week flight and i'll be coming out on the 0th
i'm still going to take the days off from work and relax in calgary a little
which is good
by the way
if you haven't already gotten me something
i thought of a xmas present
a squash raquet
lots of people play here and i'm looking to get into it
number here is 0 0 0 if you want to chat
love
coop
are you around
can you give me a call
coop
chris
i need to get whatever access greg and colin had to albertapower and albertagas databases on dev and prod
i may already have it
but i'm not sure
especially about the albertagas database
basically
their accounts have been cleared from the network and i need to run things under my own account
rather than theirs
also
on dev db
i need to admin rights as colin had these to do some olap stuff
i'm guessing you are not the person to talk to about this
cooper
it never got the box up
great
thanks
c
i moved the meeting to vc0 for 0:0-0:0
does that work
i think i can get around this
but i need to install some software under local admin
can you drop by and hook me up when you get a chance
can you add mark dupuy to the
caldata_pwrfund
nt group
he needs to take over some of karim's responsibilities
cooper
can you move backups of production albertapower and development albertagas to i:\trading\newco\richey\db
cooper
i have enspace up and running
looks like the demo you showed
unfortunately
i'm taking the rest of the year off
so i won't be around for your startup
but i will look at it first thing in the new year
yah
it's amazing how quickly christmas sneaks up on me
i'm hoping i won't have to come into work next week and feeling very good about leaving work for awhile
almost like being an undergrad at the end of a semester
so
i'm flying out on wednesday and wondering if you'd like to get together before i go
i'm more or less free from sunday until i go
coffee sometime
dinner
cooper
how about mon eve then
i'm not sure how much time you have
sounds like you still have work to do before going home
but i'm up for anything
dinner or drinks/coffee later on
or maybe something more seasonal
i don't know if you still have any shopping left
but i always leave it to the last minute and do a horrible job
i'm running around today but i'll try phoning tonight to see what you think
cooper
testing
stan
just back in the office and i will get right on it
cooper
cheryl
nancy taylor at cognicase has asked me to check into payments for 0 it contractors
i have the invoices and understand that you have them as well
it's about 0 grand c$
are there any issues surrounding paying them
thanks
cooper
hey
i just got back into town from almost 0 weeks vacation
sorry i didn't get in touch over the holidays
but do you want to get together sometime soon
my schedule is very easy-going at them moment
hopefully you are in town
cooper
thanks cheryl
do you want in on yoga w
eze
i'd like to set it up
especially since it may involve jamie
but not sure if you're interested in spending extracurricular time w
eze
for stan williams of williams project ltd
submitted in december and approved by zufferli
is this one in the pipe as well
thanks
cooper
can you send eze email then
not a disaster if you don't come
based on the way you two got along last night
its probly better if you don't
apparently
your invoice has been lost in the system somewhere
do you have a copy you could send and i will get it processed asap
thx
cooper
my nametag now reads
mrs jai hawker
in keeping with nickname strategy
i am pretending not to notice
it looks like there are alot of places in the herald classifieds
i need 0 days notice according to my lease
did you do any thinking about how much you can spend on a pad
i need to move my dining room table before monday night when a sofa is getting delivered
can you help me out sometime this w/e
i also want to show off the scooby phone
it's all about the action
sweet
$0 seems like plenty
i know you don't want to be house poor
but i only think it's worth it if we find a sweet place
do you want to set aside some time this w/e to look at places
or should we wait until next week
it may be a little late to schedule things
altho
we should definitely check out that place in kensington
i am playing squash at the y at 0:0 on sunday
so maybe we could meet after i play and before you play
i would prefer that to meeting up with you and a friend
maybe grab some coffee
i am part of the trading operations
so i would get sold with it and then i would have to decide if i want to be part of whatever the new organization ends up being
dear elissa
it's great to hear from you and i'm pleased you thought of my on your christmas list
it seems like we started to get in touch awhile ago and then i think i dropped the ball
oops
i hope you are well and happy new year to you too
i am still working for enron
a company you have perhaps read about in the news recently
things are ok with that for the moment
but i don't really know what's in my future
probly know more soon
i live in calgary
did you know
and have for the last year or so
i like canada very much
much more than i expected
although it is very cold here
mostly the people i like
especially but not limited to all the comely young women
are you still in nc
are you going to make ben a respectable man anytime soon
i got back from almost three weeks vacation yesterday and am back at work
although i hesitate to call it that
since i do very little all day
i had a good time back home
went thru my normal roller coaster of loving being back with my family
then feeling like i am going crazy and needing to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving hanging out there
caught up with lots of friends and in general did very little for 0 weeks
which felt ok
it's been awhile since i've been away from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing
i wish you had sent one of those genero-grams in your holiday card so i would know what you're up to
send a note when you get a chance
also
if you can think of it
reply to trycooper@hotmail.com as i'm better at keeping in touch from home
one big hug
cooper
yah
maybe start on monday with new listings
check things out during the week and then massive investigation on the w/e
i only just started playing squash
are you a member at the y
do you want to meet around 0:0 or so
i'm leaving now
but why don't you call me on my cell on sunday or i'll call you at home and we can finalize
c
i called mt royal and tentatively scheduled for tomorrow at 0:0
left a message at 0th ave place
dude
that is faaaaar
hows the new job
i got your email from jai
are we on for yoga tomorrow
thanks for the scooby snacks
tasty
and stickers
plentiful
normally i suffer some angst from stickers since i don't want to waste them
but you got me so many that it's not an issue
did you have fun at the crazy horse
i was quite drunk and unfocused but had a good time
the edge
agh
i just spent 0.0 hours opening a bank account
banking in this country sucks
i hate to be a shitty american and i do love canada
but the banking system is brutal
yeah
working for a law firm is sweet
i see the same perks here working for a management consulting firm
i'm glad you briefed the ladies on the naked yoga
maybe janice could give us a demo
are you watching the royal tennenbaums tonight
we talked about it long ago
and i do want to see it
glad to see you are breaking in your email account
c
although i like my yoga naked
i do like to put something on for savasana
corpse pose at the end
which is probly what she's thinking
the latest in canadian yoga fashion can be found at www.lululemon.com give me a look on the movie if you end up going and want to see royal t's
cell is 0 0
we're on for 0:0
0:0 from your building
i still haven't eaten lunch
so i may take off now and then meet you
you're dumb
i'm worried the place is too small
have you told nicole about going to yoga tonight
keep in mind that whatever you tell her seems to go straight to dorland and then i have to deal with it
now he wants to pull an earls at joey's here downtown
i think he would be the jackass we hate at earls
but
i'm approaching him with the new jordey-inspired don't worry be happy mentality and its working great
i feel like i didn't get closure last night after seeing the place
maybe that nook in the main room could be for a computer
the first
just wanted to go thru whatever i was thinking last night
it's no big deal
yah
i'm looking forward to yoga
i didn't do anything over break and was really looking forward to starting up my practice again and went several times as soon as i got back
but then i got sick
so
i may try to take a nap this afternoon before yoga
i'm very bad with directions
i have the address at home and can call you with it
but basically
i go east on 0th ave
turn right on
i think
0th street and then turn left on
i think
0th ave
there's an asian restaurant at this corner
and then it's up on the right side
there's a big block of warehouse buildings
it's a little complicated to find from here actually
maybe you should pick me up and we can go together
i don't really shop for
yoga clothes
partly out of some sort of philosophical resistance and also because the women's stuff is so much cooler than men's stuff that i don't want to bother
dude
that 0:0am yoga story is brutal
yim is going downhill
i don't think rockne can hold onto his good instrucors
i hope core yoga stays solvent
nerve emailed me back and wants to get together for a drink
hey ethan
i appreciate the look on this and am interested
i'm investigating all alternatives and have been considering mainly calgary and portland as options
it looks like there will be more clarity on the future of enron's trading operation soon
which should help solidify any job decisions
my latest resume is at home and i will forward it on tomorrow and you can see what the fit is like
thanks for thinking of me and good luck with the business
cooper
hey craig
happy new year
thanks for forwarding me this
i'm investigating all career opportunities at the moment
i hope you've been out skiing the last few days
it looks like its been puking
i've been sick the last few days
first time in a year or so
had a great break and i'm back taking care of all the little things waiting to see what happens to the enron trading operation
we'll see
hey
do you want to go to stronghold sometime
be good to catch up
i don't think i'm going to be healthy this week
but if you're interested next week would work
i don't know how much time you're spending in calgary these days
cooper
hey greg
happy new year
i can't remember when you were taking your trip to france
but i hope things are going well
i'm back in town now after a long and peaceful break
mainly just waiting to see what happens to the enron trading operations
where did you buy the hardware when you built your servers
i'm thinking of building a database server and am not sure if its best to mail order or buy in person somewhere in town
hope you're well and talk to you soon
cooper
i'm glad you made it to yoga last night
how did you think the space compares to yim
don't worry
you won't hurt my feelings
they're very different and i'm always surprised when people prefer something like yim
but yoga tastes vary widely
i thought last night's class was excellent and i'm glad we all got to go
i'm not sure why jai goes to yoga
i've been to a few classes with him and it's always the same deep frustration with poses
but
yah
the jump thru to seated is fun
eh
last night i was playing around with it following her directions and i realized how terrible it is to not be able to jump thru smoothly
once you do it once you can do it forever
also fun is to do the reverse
i think the mechanics are easier on the reverse and then you'll be able to do full vinyasa smoothly
ian's email is indeed ian.cooke@enron.com ceilis could be fun tomorrow
let me know when you go
this week has gone by quickly
i can understand how you didn't see the scooby stickers on my car because it was dark
but what about the one on my forehead last night
nice
do you remember her
you're dumb on infusion
i don't remember
but i think you've got to give her the benefit of the doubt for her balls
yah
let's get it out of the way
that motherboard does look sweet
why the scsi drives though
personally
i want to find a raid card that can handle raid0
everything i've seen is 0,0,or 0+0
and then link up a bunch of smallish ide drives
if the controller is good
you don't need super fast and expensive drives
so you get speed and redundancy
as i look at hardware
i can't believe how much enron was paying compaq for hardware
it's amazing
as for parts
what do you think about ordering from the cheapest u.s
source and paying duty
coffee or lunch would be great
supposed to be big news about the enron auction today
but things are very slow and i'm more or less available any time
whenever you're next in town
give me a buzz
or if you're looking for a reason to come into town
how about tuesday or wednesday
lunch or an afternoon coffee
oops
i just sent you a note w/o reading this one
i might stop by ceilis for a bit
fine with me
hi emily
i left fairly quickly on friday night
sorry i didn't say goodbye
i was in a strange mood
maybe being sick and drunk
anyway
i feel like i should have socialized more there and regret not talking to janice more
but it was great to see earls people outside of earls amongst friends
why don't we go to yim instead of the space
i'm happy to go to yoga with other people instead of alone and i can go to any yoga class and enjoy myself
although rockne gets on my nerves if i let him
i think janice wants to come too
congratulations on passing all of your courses
i found graduating to be somewhat anti-climactic
i wish you had a ceremony to go to
but maybe things are different in canada
i finished reading tuesdays with morrie
great book
it's good to be reminded of certain things in life
i did get your call last night but deleted your home number
i called your cell
but no one answered and there was no voice mail for some reason
can you send on your home number
this is from my old girlfriend that i hooked up with over break
i think i should call
eh
hi mom
yup 0.0 x 0 is my size
thanks
love
coop
hey mara
i tried to call your phone number
but just got voicemail
here are my numbers
w
0 0 0
h
0 0 0
c
0 0 0
it would be good to chat
but i'll respond here in case you get this and not your voicemail
also
a better email is
trycooper@hotmail.com
i've been meaning to write you
it's on my list
but haven't probly because i'm not sure what to say
i'm glad you got in touch
i hope you had fun in belize with your family
i checked and i don't have brinda's email
sorry about that
i might have her phone number athome
but that won't do you much good i don't think
also if you are checking out sfsu
you may want to look up someone named ingrid binswanger
i went to college with her and she is ultra-cool and might be able to give you the lowdown
i think she is doing some sort of joint degree and is probly still there
not sure though
um
yeah
i was a bit surprised when you mentioned the 0 year statistic
but i'm not sure what relevance that really has
it's too bad things are rocky between you and steve
it seems like you've been together forever
it was a crazy night and i don't know what else to say
hopefully we will stay in touch better as a result
it's funny to think that i've known you half of my life at this point
of course
however you want to handle it is fine by me
well
if you get this while you are in portland or sf
give me a buzz and i'll tell you what i can
otherwise
call or write and let's stay in touch
good luck shopping for programs
cooper
mike
sorry to bother you for this again
but can you send me contact info for you and john m
cooper
hey gary
as promised here are names of 0 individuals i would recommend who are experienced in e-tagging
etc
john messenger
no longer at enron
mike taylor
still with enron
also
i know someone else who doesn't know etag but did a bunch of work for us with the ppa who is in the market and i will forward his resume when he sends it to me
don't have his contact info
cooper
hope this one gets thru
i'm going by banker's hall today
any interest in lunch
i want another round of that blackened chicken
i work from 0am to 0pm and it takes me 0 minutes to walk to work from my mom's house where i live unhappily in the basement
glad to hear you are finally putting in an honest day's work
let me know if you're planning on going to yoga tomorrow
wed
i did like tuesdays with morrie
do you want me to pass it on to jai or give it back to you
are you still planning your wine event on saturday
i want to come
but i think jai is going to a hockey game for work that night
hopefully i see you tomorrow night at yoga
subscribe
hi mom
i'll let you know when i get the package
thanks for sending it
things are ok
just waiting to see how things shake out with the enron-ubs deal
it looks ok
but i'll know more later this week
love
coop
i've been playing around more with r
doing some reading and installing the basic package
and it looks fantastic
in particular
the database connecticity package
rodbc
works right out of the box
very impressive
in a couple of lines
i can get data from a table in a sql server database into a dataframe and more importantly
result sets from stored procedures can be returned to data frames as well
and its free
does it take awhile for my access to nacal-sqws0d to take effect
you hooked me up on
nacal-sqws0d
i missed yoga last night too
do you want to try to yim this weekend
saturday night sounds good
i'm not sure what's going on with crantina and its not too personal nor a secret
i'll pass the book along to jai
are you working at earls again this w/e to support your shooter-lifestyle
c
hi danielle
i have some feedback w
respect to md apps file
canadian gas price reporter
environment canada daily weather data scott mccormick
0
0 0 thanks cooper
are you in the office today
yoga tomorrow sounds great
i went last night to a beginner yim class with a friend from work who wanted to check it out
it was crowded
are the w/e classes the same/better/worse
i somehow always try to show up early to yoga but never manage to
but yim may leave me no choice
i feel like i'm in san francisco three years ago the way yoga is taking off here
i love carrot cake
ceilis sounds good
i'll see you there
i like how you send each email with a takeaway thought
i'm actually busy this morning
but wanted to reply sorry for the sound bites
see you after work
c
at some point
you will stop demonizing emily and re-realize how cool she is
bitch
here's your chance to get out with your rep intact
you can blame everything on the
complexity
i would make it clean though
none of your half-assed bullshit
which one was sandy
is the machination mad at someone else for being selfish and calculating
no
address as i deleted your last email
can you send the name of the movers you used if its handy
or the realtors name
thx
cooper
i got an error message when i tried to open your message with mike's contact info
hey mike
hope you are doing well
i was talking to a guy over at epcor and he said that they were interested in hiring a
junior
power risk management person and i wanted to see if you want me to pass your contact information along
cooper
thanks
hey jon
i didn't get around to calling you this weekend
but am hoping to touch base this week
ok to give a call in the evenings
i'm beginning to think about this as a long term project and look forward to hearing your thoughts
coop
today is the day
hey emily
don't think i can make yoga tonight
i went climbing last night and inflamed some tendonitis i have in my arm so i'm going to chill out for a few days
however
i have made plans to see the royal t's with dorland tonight
so here's a look if you haven't already seen it
and to respond to your earlier email
i can't keep up
the meeting i had on sunday was fine
it's always good to see what else is out there
the pipe and casing industry sounds fascinating
i can't wait until you're an expert and you can hold forth on the intricacies over some earls carrot cake
and speaking of earls desserts
anything would be better than the gingerbread cake
also
has earls updated the propaganda on the left hand side of the menu
specifically the
featured ingredients
section
not sure when you're going to get this
actually
oh
i'm going to a wine tasting at the double mo cafe on thursday night if you/jamie are interested
do you interested in wine
my friend craig's wife owns the cafe which is near the university
i always have fun when i go
so give it some thought if you like wine
i think it's going to be a new zealand/australian theme
all
i'm attempting to use lattice on windows 0 under r 0.0
rgui and rterm crash when i invoke
xyplot
or
trellis.device
commands
including the oft-used
quakes
example
in particular
i get a message box from the windows os with the following text
rgui.exe has generated errors and will be closed by windows
you will need to restart the program
an error log is being generated this seems to happen right after the graphics window is spawned
i'm using lattice version 0.0-0 and grid version 0.0 am i missing some sort of prep work for lattice graphics
thanks any help
cooper
many thanks
your copy works like a charm
i'll be more diligent in my archive search next time
eze
its at 0:0 and its usually $0
all the money gets spent on the wine
so its a good deal
its extremely casual and it would be great to see jill again
as for jamie
brokering is a slimy business and its hard to see how she fits in
but then i don't know her that well
didn't see royal t's
i went home and went to bed
i'm sick
yuck
dorland is chris dorland and a guy i sit next to at work
he was there on saturday night
i'm sure you'll run into him again
i'll let craig know you are thinking of coming
be still my heart
dawn
i think i may be on an
immigration
list in houston
but based on the attached forms
it looks like they think i am a non-u.s
citizen residing in the u.s
rather than a u.s
citizen residing in canada
should i get in touch with karen buckley
please advise
cooper
how was the maid
0 to 0
the games were close
but carlos controlled the match
want to go
i really don't want to go out
but think i should at least stop by
well
after your pep talk this morning
it's worth checking out for sure
hi jill
i'm glad you had fun last night and we should definitely do it again
i may stop by ceili's on the way home
but might also go home to bed
undecided at the moment
if i don't stop by
can i take a raincheck
i'm sure i'll see you soon either way
cooper
button
thanks for the hockey tickets
my second nhl game
it was sweet
started out great with a fight and a goal and then not much happened
see ya around
cooper
dawn
updated resume is attached
let me know if you need anything else
cooper
hi jill
how was ceili's
i ended up going home and taking a nap and then going to see black hawk down
i think i was in bed by 0:0
i'm sure you had more fun than me
overall
my w/e was fairly uneventful
you
should go another time
cooper
i believe it is 0 0th ave
apt #0
but i'm waiting for verification
sorry for the delay
you can give them my cell # 0 0
afternoons work best starting this friday for installation
thanks
oh
can you send me the name of that attorney you mentioned
thx
cooper
hi
i work at enron as a power trader and gary hagerty asked me to forward any prospects for a
junior power risk management
position at epcor onto you
michael wong worked for us on booking the sundance b ppa position and was let go soon after this was sold to transcanada/altagas and if you're still looking for someone
he would be worth investigating
regards
cooper richey michael wong
gary
i seem to have the wrong email address
please forward this on
thx
cooper
excellent
although krypto has a good chance of morphing into
lex luther
at some later point
i think she said
going steady
nice work getting her email address
bitch
that's even worse
stratego
some other time then
brenda was a test
stratego failed
this email is yet more evidence
the fact that stratego was not aggressively machinating does not impress me in the least
the fact that you are still representing makes me sad
asking for props
please
dude
the depths of your selfishness have yet to be established
don't treat me like a fool or one of your bitches
take a moment and peer inside
that tinge of guilt
that's what i'm talking about
in any case
i don't plan on claiming anyone again
hows it going
jai said you got into an accident
glad to hear you are ok and i hope it wasn't too stressful
thinking of going to yoga tonight at the space
0:0
thought i would give you a look
have you been going to yoga
i haven't since i've been sick
can you send rene's number
need to get the postal code to get sofa delivered
can you ask your mom the name of the upholstery store she recommended to me before xmas
thx
here's the address in case you need it for something
calgary ab t0r0l0
consider me a free call option
are you fucking kidding me
i'm always right
baby
are you talking about the sweatbands in there
those are sweet
are you ordering anything from there
auntie
absolutely
i can't believe we haven't gone yet
we should make it a tradition
great to see you on sat
night
lucky was unbelievably lame
yawn
how did the night go
end up at cowboys
fyi sofa delievered sometime between 0 and 0 on sat
dude
you're over-reacting
i think she was flustered by your voracious flirting and pulled the chute
i hope kryptonomicon isn't this boring in real life
dude
are we done on nelly
do you remember tom cruise in vanilla
how he was a
satisfaction delayer
you are the fucking polar opposite
you've been waiting 0 years
don't you want to kick back and enjoy the ride in
it says its general admission
are there no seat assignments
do you want to go sat or sun
hitting the send button at most once a day would be a start
did you see black hawk down
i didn't like it that much
but i read the book awhile ago
really good
and its a hard subject to make a movie about
my brother is in the special forces
so it's scary to think he could be one of those guys
just finished playing squash with ian cooke i'm guessing you know him too
i have so little to do at work these days
its hard to be motivated
but i suppose i could have worse things to complain about
what movies did you rent
sorry if i'm nosy
but see previous sentence
looks like $0 plus surcharges
auntie
what are you having at burger inn
it has been too long
we'll have to fix it
what are you doing this w/e
i feel like i've been sick for two weeks
and i haven't been doing much
mostly taking care of errands etc since i don't have much to do at work these days
hopefully that will be changing soon
um
chrissy is much too cute to be playing with her toys alone
i'm not sure why lucky sucked
i think it was the crowd we met up with there
you two should have come and it would have been more fun i'm sure
eze
i got your message and i might be up for yoga tonight
i went to core last night and it was nice and mellow
do you have any idea who teaches the 0:0 class
i went a while back and it this hyper-active guy taught the class and it wasn't so good
adding that to the rockne risk makes it a dangerious proposition
do you happen to have janice's email address
jai and i haven't been to earls in a long time and i was wondering how she was doing
if you see her when you're working
tell her i said hi
hi cheryl
i'm not sure if i forwarded this or not
but i'm not sure what to do with this
this is regarding the invoice i gave you a couple weeks ago
it appears that stan submitted two invoiced on the same day
let me know if there is anything i can do
cooper
hey greg
just wanted to verify that the address i gave you before was correct
thx for the hookup
c
i've been doing nothing for two months
literally
and should be trading again in a few weeks
so i've got to start preparing for that
which is a welcome change
what do you mean you're not doing anything this w/e
i like the bar scene alot
but i have to be drunk to enjoy it
i think one night a week its good if you have nothing better to do
i think some of the boys from enron are going out this sat
if you end up having nothing to do
we'll be moving in this w/e
you should come by and check it out
as for chrissy
that was the sound of my cock puncturing the desk and knocking my mouse on its side
dingy pub would have been good
do you have a favorite
i like the auburn saloon
but jai hates it
so
it took us *forever* to get out of the parking lot
brutal
probly around 0 or after work around 0:0
i'm flexible
but i'm guessing it will be more crowded then
y
any interest in going to vegas end of feb
ok sounds good
its a boring exchange
its hard to get motivated
i thought i would be on the one a day plan bitch
i could barely open the doors on the way back
looks good
i'm working some stuff now that is writing to the z drive for publishing on the web
i will have it write to i
and set it up so it will be easy to change from now going forward
should be able to tell if it works from that
i think your idea was a good one
don't worry i'm certainly not blaming you for any of this
i have a short fuse when it comes to houston it
don't do that to me
hmm
synapses not jumping
i know the feeling
i think i have three neurons firing in my brain this morning
i know what you mean about getting soft
when i went home to virginia for christmas
my mom was like
it's cold out
shouldn't you put a jacket on
and having been toughened by the brutal calgary winters
in addition to being the super tough guy that i am
i did go out
naked almost every day
let me know when you'er heading over to bass brothers and i'll meet up with you
i have a few things to do but drinks after work should fit in
i ran into eze
aka emily
at banana republic last night
its such a small town
hey
what do you do at cnrl anyway
cooper
its going well
thanks for asking
work is good
i'm getting excited to start trading again and i'm actually doing some real work
feels good
and i'm having fun with the whole exercise thing
i hope it sticks
how are things with you
i know you are super busy
but it must be good to finally be starting a career
rockne is a special treat
at least he isn't hairy
i've found yoga to be a good antidote to modern life
i'm not excited to move at all
but i am looking forward to living in a new spot
change is good
i probly won't need your help moving
but i am planning on lifting some of those shelves from ikea
so i'll be sure to give you a ring for the install
great to see you last night at banana
i can't wait to wear my blue pants
but it seems like they should follow the white pants rule
so i don't think i'll break them out until labor day
definitely a good purchase
since i'll probably wear them twice
total
hope to see you tonight
cooper
auntie
i think it will be easy to get back into the swing of thigns
sitting on my ass for two months has been a nice distraction
but its gotten really boring
trading is exciting and i'm looking forward to it
should be like jumping into a cold pool
i'm actually doing real work lately which is great
i still have no idea what you do at work
anything interesting
yes
the new babe lair should be sweet
we'll need auntie's recommendations
just make sure you shit in jai's toilet
it might be harder for you than me
but peeing on the toilet seat is always a good way to get your message across
as a woman
i think it would send an especially clear signal
are you stopping by this weekend
i'm having a couch delivered on sat between 0 and 0
so i think we'll be around then for sure
0 times a day is no problem
but 0 times a day seven days a week might be a push
but with the right stimulation anything is possible
is chrissy a 0x0 kind of chick
wow
and
of course
retention is always an interesting experiment
we'll have to go to big wally's
especially if its not my style
i haven't spent much time in kensington
but it seems like there are some good spots there
try having no work to do for two months and then having to stick around and
appear
busy
i know what you mean
in some ways its harder when you're not used to not doing things
i've gotten good at finding things to do with my time
but when i first had nothing to do
i was going crazy
fridays are always slow around here and i'm guessing its the same there
although i don't know cnrl specifcally
oil and gas producer/marketer
in terms of what i do
before enron went under
i was the short term alberta power trader
since then
i have been champion internet surfer and investigating local coffee shops in an ever-widening circle
although
things are looking up
eze is
i think
an earls nickname
pronounced easy-e
although
they may just call her easy for short
i'm sure she loves both names very much
i have a very important meeting at 0 with my massage therapist and i was thinking about stopping by after that
should i call eze's cell
or do you have a cell #
hey
do you see graphics above this sentence
the admins showed me how to insert clip art into email and i'm trying to figure out if works outside of enron
damn
do you use microsoft outlook
or some bizarre corel product
yes
it would be terrible to allow employees access to a cd-rom drive
productivity would plummet
enron let their employees have cd-roms and look what happened to them
now that things are firming up
can you give me a summary of what is happening to all of the servers purchased for trading decision support
i.e
fundamentals
the ones i had to get zufferli to sign off on purchasing were power-fs0
nacal-sqws0p
nacal-sqws0d and the 0 pizza boxes
i know there is some shuffling around now
but i'd like to know what the plan is for these in the short term and long term
either estate/ubs share
estate only
or ubs only
thanks
cooper
ok
i'll keep it a secret
i think lemonade will be a dead giveaway when he tastes it though
greg
do you know the status of vpn connectivity going forward for ubs employees
cooper
stan
this is being processed and you will be paid soon
i promise
hope you are having a good start to the year
cooper
i put in a call to the deloitte systems admin to have your email name changed to
purtzki
eze
i hope you don't mind
i'm tired from moving
enron's moved me in the past and i'm used to just pointing and saying
that will go over there
etc
and i spent all sunday night packing up my shit
ugh
most of it has been moved which is good
i don't think you've ever seen my loft
but to get to it
you have to take the elevator up one building and then walk across the roof of another building
picture gravel with flagstones that are spaced for janice to walk across
and then into the floor of my building
once the movers saw this
i think they almost quit
it was bad
but they did a great job
i told one of them
the building i'm moving into will be a breeze compared to this one
and he laughed and said
of course
you have the worst apartment i've ever moved
poor guy
that's the most entertaining tidbit i could come up with
you should meet the building manager in our new building
he's a freak
but in a professional way
he's already yelled at jai and i
he sounds russian and says in a thick accent
if you vant to leeve here
you haf to obey da rrrulesss
i hope you read that with a russian accent in your head
he has video cameras set up that feed into his kitchen
his wife is a piece of work as well
count me in for the wine fest
if you pick up some tix
grab me one
or let me know where the website is
etc
i can't believe you've moved on from tubulars
while tubulars does seem like the next big thing
oil and gas seems like a promising area to study
great
thanks greg
i told you about the wireless ethernet stuff i bought right
i'm excited to set it up
i don't know if you've seen the site
but www.practicallynetworked.com has some good stuff in it
coffee or lunch this week works great for me
where are you working downtown
hi jill
ah
i don't think you'll get this until next week
but maybe you're checking your email on the road
hope your course is fun
how was it to see your family
i've had my parents visit me up here and i was also down there over christmas break and i much prefer when they visit me rather the other way around
i feel like i'm back in high school when i'm back home
i think
or something like that
don't tease me
what did you do on sat night
work is going really well
finally feeling some pressure
hmm
i don't know anything about painting pottery
but i'm interested
i've done it before and its harder than it looks and takes awhile
but could be fun with the right group of people
talk to you soon
cooper
hi chris
i'm deeply concerned about all of these points and think we should meet in person to discuss
i'm free all day
i have them back at my old apartment
i think
is your battery dead
careen has been added to the vip list for the babe lair in recognition of her discriminating taste
i can come now
what are you doing for lunch
i think you didn't let it run long enough after your boost
i think 0 minutes is the rule of thumb when you're battery is drained
not turning over at all is not a good sign
one thing you can do is park on a hill when you're in doubt and then you can roll-start your jeep
if you have a standard
if you didn't let it charge long enough
if the battery is really
really dead
though
this won't work
where's your jeep now
ok
i don't mind helping out
let me know if you need a hand
cell is 0 0
not sure
i have to do a walk thru on my old apartment at 0 and probly come back to work after that
what are you thinking
great
thanks
can i fax you the w0
also
i initially applied to transfer my existing trading account from td waterhouse
but i would rather not do that
can you put a hold on this
cooper
